<body>
<p>ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorder affecting approximately 5% to 10% of school-age children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711428806">Scahill &amp; Schwab-Stone, 2000</xref>). Although children with ADHD are typically characterized as having deficits in attention and inappropriate levels of impulsivity and hyperactivity, research has evidenced significant impairment in other areas of cognition, including working memory, executive functions, psychomotor speed and coordination, processing speed, and intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711428806">Barkley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711428806">Calhoun &amp; Mayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711428806">Karatekin, Markiewicz, &amp; Siegel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711428806">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711428806">Piek, Pitcher, &amp; Hay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711428806">Thaler, Allen, McMurray, &amp; Mayfield, 2010</xref>). Moreover, it is becoming increasingly apparent that ADHD diagnoses in a heterogeneous group of children that may exhibit different symptoms and cognitive and behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711428806">Bonafina, Newcorn, McKay, Koda, &amp; Halperin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711428806">King et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711428806">Marsh &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>), as in part recognized by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711428806">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>)—primarily inattentive, primarily hyperactive, and combined subtypes.</p>
<p>The differences in cognitive functioning among children with ADHD may be predictive of symptom severity and behavioral outcome. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of this are findings that children with the predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) appear to experience slowed cognitive processing speed compared with children with the combined type (ADHD-C), whereas children with ADHD-C appear to exhibit selective deficits in impulse control and sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711428806">Barkley, DuPaul, &amp; McMurray, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711428806">Hynd et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711428806">Mayes, Calhoun, Chase, Mink, &amp; Stagg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711428806">Milich, Balentine, &amp; Lynam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711428806">O’Driscoll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711428806">Schmitz et al., 2002</xref>). Reduced processing speed has also further predicted behavioral and emotional impairment in children with ADHD and is associated with more internalizing problems (IP) and fewer externalizing problems (EP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711428806">Carlson &amp; Mann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711428806">McBurnett, Pfiffner, &amp; Frick, 2001</xref>). In contrast to the other subtypes, the predominantly hyperactive subtype (ADHD-H) has had less empirical support in its construct validity, perhaps because it does not include inattention as a core deficit in its diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711428806">Woo &amp; Rey, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Wechsler scales have been previously used by researchers and clinicians to identify specific aspects of cognitive functioning in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711428806">Calhoun &amp; Mayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711428806">Scheirs &amp; Timmers, 2009</xref>). The most recent edition, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711428806">Wechsler, 2003</xref>) has a number of attractive qualities conducive to research, including a four-factor model of intelligence that is differentially sensitive to cognitive deficits associated with ADHD, particularly in working memory and processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711428806">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711428806">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711428806">San Miguel Montes, Allen, Puente, &amp; Neblina, 2010</xref>). There is also empirical support that cluster analysis, a taxometric approach that classifies heterogeneous data sets into smaller and theoretically more useful subgroups, can be used with the Wechsler scales to identify cognitive profiles with unique characteristics predictive of clinical outcome. For example, studies of children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have found that differences in IQ functioning were associated with neuropsychological measures and behavior rating scales, with the most impaired clusters exhibiting the worst outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711428806">Allen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711428806">Thaler, Bello, et al., 2010</xref>). WISC-IV clusters in an ADHD sample may similarly be associated with relevant clinical variables such as symptom severity and outcome. Such distinctions may aid researchers and diagnosticians in interpreting IQ profiles for specific strengths and weaknesses that might in turn assist in treatment and intervention planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711428806">Donders, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior cluster studies of children with ADHD have confirmed that heterogeneous samples of this population contain symptom and cognitive variation that can be of clinical relevance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711428806">King and colleagues (2005)</xref> cluster analyzed teacher ratings on a sample of children with ADHD and comorbid conduct disorder and identified seven clusters that varied on comorbid diagnoses and symptoms of inattention and EP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711428806">Marsh and Williams (2004)</xref> cluster analyzed DSM-IV–defined parent symptom ratings of children with ADHD and identified profiles matching ADHD-I and ADHD-C characteristics but not ADHD-H characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711428806">Bonafina and colleagues (2000)</xref> examined IQ and reading achievement clusters derived from a sample of children with ADHD with and without comorbid reading disabilities and identified children with average and low-average performances on measures as well as a high verbal cluster and a low reading achievement cluster. These clusters in turn differentiated among cognitive, behavioral, and neurochemical measures, suggesting that ADHD’s heterogeneity may be associated with more than just symptom expression.</p>
<p>To date, no study has examined WISC-IV cognitive heterogeneity in children with ADHD to assess whether WISC-IV profiles might predict diagnosis, symptom ratings, and academic and behavioral outcome within this population. Such a study is warranted given the widespread use of the WISC-IV in clinical settings as well as evidence that the Processing Speed Index (PSI) is impaired in children with ADHD-I but not ADHD-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711428806">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>). Based on prior studies examining Wechsler profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711428806">Allen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711428806">Bonafina et al., 2000</xref>), we hypothesized that WISC-IV clusters in children with ADHD will represent different levels of general cognitive performance with high-functioning, average, and low-functioning clusters. We also hypothesized that clusters with deficits on the processing speed and working memory indexes will emerge and that clusters with selective impairment on the PSI will have higher ratings of inattention and greater frequency of ADHD-I diagnoses. Finally, it is expected that lower functioning clusters will generally exhibit greater impairment on behavioral and academic measures.</p>

<p>The WISC-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711428806">Wechsler, 2003</xref>) is a four-factor intelligence battery for children who are between 6 and 16 years of age. This battery is comprised of 10 core subtests which combine to form four psychometrically validated factor scores. The Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) includes the Similarities, Vocabulary, and Comprehension subtests; the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) includes the Block Design, Picture Concepts, and Matrix Reasoning subtests; the Working Memory Index (WMI) includes the Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests; and the PSI includes the Coding and Symbol Search subtests. All 10 subtests combine to form a full scale IQ (FSIQ) score. Supplemental subtests were not included in this study as not all children completed them and they are not required to calculate index and FSIQ scores. WISC-IV index standard scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 whereas subtest scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. The WISC-IV was administered to establish a baseline of intellectual functioning and was not used for diagnosing ADHD.</p>

<title>DSM-IV ADHD Symptom Rating Scale</title>
<p>This ADHD symptom rating scale is an 18-item scale adapted by the third author from the ADHD Rating Scale–IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711428806">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoules, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>) to operationalize <italic>DSM-IV</italic> identified diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Nine of the items were designed to explicitly capture symptoms of inattention. The remaining 9 items were designed to capture symptoms of hyperactivity and 3 of these 9 were also designed to capture symptoms of impulsivity. A 4-point Likert-type rating scale was used to quantify the frequency of behaviors in question. The four points included 0 = <italic>never or rarely</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 2 = <italic>often</italic>, and 3 = <italic>very often</italic>. Internal consistency for the measure was high (Cronbach’s α = .88).</p>

<title>Behavior Assessment System for Children–2nd edition (BASC-2)</title>
<p>The BASC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711428806">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>) is a multimethod and multidimensional rating scale for use with children and adults between 2 and 25 years of age. The BASC-2 Parent Rating Scale (PRS) is comprised of nine clinical subscales and four clinical composites that measure symptoms of EP, IP, and School Problems (SP), and provides an overall Behavior Symptoms Index (BSI). In addition, five adaptive subscales measuring resiliency and stability form an Adaptive Skills Composite (AS). Subscales and composites each have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Clinical scales with <italic>T</italic>-scores above 59 and adaptive scales with <italic>T</italic>-scores below 40 are considered to be in the “at-risk” range whereas clinical scales with <italic>T</italic>-scores above 69 and adaptive scales with <italic>T</italic>-scores below 30 are considered to be in the “clinically significant” range and typically warrant follow-up. BASC-2 data were available for 127 children in the sample.</p>

<p>The WJ-III ACH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711428806">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>) is a broad measure of academic achievement with composite scores estimating reading, mathematical, writing, and language abilities. Selected subtests for the WJ-III, including Letter-Word Identification, Reading Fluency, Calculation, Math Fluency, Spelling, Writing Fluency, Passage Comprehension, and Applied Problems were used to measure academic achievement in our sample. WJ-III data were available for 129 children in the sample.</p>

<sec id="section8-1087054711428806">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All measures were administered according to standardized methods by a pediatric neuropsychologist or supervised clinical psychology doctoral candidates. Children were assessed individually at a private practice setting in a quiet environment. The WISC-IV was routinely administered to all children as a standard measure of intelligence. Selected subtests from the WJ-III ACH and the BASC-2 were also routinely administered. All parent data were reported from the children’s mothers, as more mothers than fathers filled out the forms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1087054711428806">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Demographic, clinical, and WISC-IV variables were compared across diagnosis using chi-squares or MANOVA when appropriate to determine whether significant differences might be present between the ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups. A principal components analysis was conducted on the ADHD symptom rating scales to identify the underlying variables that best explain symptomatology and provide factor scores that represent variables of inattention, hyperactivity, and other latent symptoms measured by the rating scale.</p>
<p>A Promax solution was selected as it accounts for correlations between factors as might be expected with the symptom ratings scale. The Kaiser–Guttman criteria and scree plot inspection were used to select for number of factors, and regression factor scores were examined for content and named accordingly.</p>
<p>Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was then used to examine cognitive heterogeneity in the sample using WISC-IV indexes (VCI, PRI, WMI, PSI) as attributes. Agglomerative clustering takes observations and merges those that are most similar to each other in a sequential manner until all observations are eventually merged into a single cluster. The experimenter specifies either a priori or through empirical methods a point to stop the merging and investigate the existing cluster solutions. Four-, five-, and six-cluster solutions were examined to determine the optimal solution for this sample. Ward’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711428806">Ward, 1963</xref>) was selected as the clustering method as it is an efficient method for samples that rely on quantitative variables, is resistant to outliers, and is consistently used in other studies in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711428806">Allen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711428806">Curtiss, Vanderploeg, Spencer, &amp; Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711428806">Mottram &amp; Donders, 2006</xref>). The squared Euclidean distance coefficient was chosen as the measure of similarity because it can detect level and pattern of performance within the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711428806">Hair et al., 2005</xref>). For clusters to be considered relevant, they had to be theoretically interpretable, comprise at least 10% of the entire sample, and have stability with an alternative clustering solution. Following the method outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711428806">Aldenderfer and Bashfield (1984)</xref>, stability was assessed by comparing cluster solutions with the partitional <italic>K</italic>-means iterative analysis which derived solutions using the hierarchical cluster means as centroids. Unlike hierarchical methods, the <italic>K</italic>-means method directly assigns observations into disjoint and predetermined clusters. The two solutions were compared using Cohen’s kappa to assess the stability of Ward’s method. In addition, discriminant function analysis was run with WISC-IV indexes as predictors and cluster membership as criterion variables to examine the cluster solutions’ classification accuracies as well as to inspect and compare the separation of clusters in discriminant function space. Based on these criteria, the most appropriate cluster solution was identified for the sample.</p>
<p>Once the optimal solution was identified, its clusters were compared on external variables that were not included in the original cluster analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were examined using ANOVAs and chi-square analyses when appropriate. Additional external variables were examined as outcome measures that might differ across clusters, including diagnosis, factor scores from the symptom rating scales, BASC-2 PRS subscales and composites, and academic achievement. MANOVAs and ANOVAs were used for all outcome variables.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analysis</title>
<p>Principal components analysis conducted for the ADHD symptom rating scales indicated three factors based on the Kaiser–Guttman criteria and inspection of scree plots. This three-factor solution approached a simple structure with high variable loadings with most items and relatively few cross loadings. These three factors were interpretable, with the first factor primarily composed of items assessing for hyperactivity and impulsivity, the second factor composed of items assessing for disorganization and inattention, and the third factor composed of items assessing for both inattention and hyperactivity. Inspection of this third factor suggests that items that loaded primarily focused on poor attention span and mild fidgeting but not on disorganization or impulsivity. The factors were named “Hyperactive,” “Inattentive,” and “Mixed.” See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711428806">Table 2</xref> for the pattern coefficients of the symptom rating scale.</p>

<p>Chi-square tests indicated no significant differences between the ADHD-I and ADHD-C diagnosis for gender, χ<sup>2</sup> = .36, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and type of school,χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.67, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. A one-way ANOVA did indicate a significant effect for age, <italic>F</italic> = 25.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with children with ADHD-C being younger. Entering covariates to statistically control for preexisting group differences has been noted to be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711428806">Miller &amp; Chapman, 2001</xref>), and so to address this, we compared MANOVA and MANCOVA with age as a covariate to see if the preexisting difference significantly altered results. Both the MANOVA, Wilks’s λ = .986, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and MANCOVA, Wilks’s λ = .973, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, indicated no significant difference between diagnosis for WISC-IV index scores. As the BASC-2 and the ADHD symptom ratings were taken into account in determining final diagnoses, they were not further analyzed for differences between ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups.</p>

<sec id="section12-1087054711428806">
<title>Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>Next, cluster analysis for the sample was accomplished by specifying four-, five-, and six-cluster solutions. The four-cluster solution yielded cluster profiles with significant differences in level and pattern of performance. The first cluster (C1) consisted of children who performed in the average range on the VCI, PRI, and WMI indexes yet somewhat low average on the PSI index. The second cluster (C2) represented children who generally performed within the high on the indexes with strengths in the PRI and PSI indexes. The third cluster (C3) had children who generally performed in the low-average range, and the fourth cluster (C4) had children who had a superior VCI. The five-cluster solution split the C3 into a new cluster with a below-average WMI and PSI and another cluster with a relative increase in PSI. The six-cluster solution split the cluster with low-average PSI performance (C1) into a low-average PSI cluster and an overall low-average cluster.</p>
<p>When the four-, five-, and six-cluster solutions were compared with their partitional counterparts, the four-cluster solution had a kappa agreement of .77, the five-cluster solution had a kappa agreement of .84, and the six-cluster solution had an agreement of .85, the latter two of which are generally considered to be strong agreement rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711428806">Fleiss, Levin, &amp; Paik, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711428806">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). WISC-IV indexes were next inputted in discriminant function analysis to establish their classification rates for predicting clusters. Indexes accurately predicted 87.3% of the four-cluster cases, 89.9% of the five-cluster cases, and 89.4% of the six-cluster cases. Inspection of the clusters in discriminant function space indicated significant overlap between clusters in the six-cluster solution. Although this solution had similar agreement rates as the five-cluster solution, its additional cluster did not add very much to the data and overlapped with a previous cluster suggesting a poorer distinction among clusters, and so the six-cluster solution was discarded from the analysis.</p>
<p>The five-cluster solution had better agreement and classification rates than the four-cluster solution and the additional cluster appeared to be of clinical interest. Therefore, the five-cluster solution appeared optimal for this sample and further investigated for external validity. WISC-IV Index score profiles for the three clustering solutions are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054711428806">Figure 1</xref>. Clusters were named based on their level and pattern of performance across the four indexes as follows: Reduced PSI (C1), High Average (C2), Below Average WMI/PSI (C3), Superior VCI (C4), and Average PSI (C5). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711428806">Table 3</xref> for descriptives of the clusters.</p>

<p>Demographic and clinical statistics for the five clusters are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711428806">Table 2</xref>. A one-way ANOVA indicated an overall difference among the clusters for age, <italic>F</italic>(4, 184) = 3.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Follow-up Bonferroni tests indicated no significance among specific clusters, although the fifth cluster had a smaller age range (6-13 years, compared with 6-16 years of other groups). Chi-square analysis indicated no significant differences among the clusters due to gender or school type (public vs. private). In addition, no differences were found among clusters for diagnosis, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 5.51, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. To further examine our hypothesis that reduced PSI would be associated with higher symptoms of inattention, a second chi-square analysis directly compared the Reduced PSI cluster to the other four clusters. A significant difference emerged, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, with more children with ADHD-I (64.5%) falling into this cluster.

<title>Symptom Ratings, Behavioral, and Achievement Differences</title>
<p>MANOVAs examined symptom rating scores derived from the ADHD factor scores, grouped BASC-2 subscales that form a respective composite scale, and the BASC-2 composite scores among the five clusters. The overall MANOVA for the symptom factor scores was significant, Wilks’s λ = 2.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .054. ANOVAs of factor scores indicated significant differences for the inattentive factor only, <italic>F</italic>(4, 181) = 3.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .089. Bonferroni tests indicated that the Reduced PSI cluster had significantly higher inattentive factor scores compared with the High Average cluster.</p>
<p>MANOVAs for BASC-2 clinical subscales found no significant differences. However, a MANOVA did find significant differences for the adaptive skills subscales, Wilks’s λ = 1.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .065. ANOVAs of individual subscales found significant differences for the leadership, <italic>F</italic>(4, 122) = 3.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .108, and functional communication, <italic>F</italic>(4, 122) = 3.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .099, subscales. Bonferroni tests indicated that the High Average cluster had better leadership scores compared with the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster and that the Superior VCI cluster had better functional communication scores compared with the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster.</p>
<p>The MANOVA for BASC-2 composites found a significant effect, Wilks’s λ = 1.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .058, although follow-up ANOVAs found no individual differences among the composites.</p>
<p>A MANOVA for WJ-III ACH subtests found a significant effect for cluster, Wilks’s λ = 1.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .065. One-way ANOVAs of subtests found a significant difference for Reading Fluency, <italic>F</italic>(4, 124) = 5.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .347, Math Fluency, <italic>F</italic>(4, 124) = 6.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .356, and Applied Problems, <italic>F</italic>(4, 124) = 3.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .242. Bonferroni tests indicated that the Reduced PSI and Below Average WMI/PSI clusters performed significantly poorer than the High Average and Superior VCI clusters on the reading fluency subtest. The Reduced PSI and Below Average WMI/PSI clusters also performed poorer than did the High Average cluster on the math fluency subtest.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is among the first to examine cognitive subtypes in a mixed sample of children diagnosed with ADHD-I and ADHD-C to determine whether different cluster profiles were associated with diagnosis, symptom ratings, and outcomes. Cluster profiles are useful in identifying subgroups of clinical populations as they are empirically formed but can be tested for specific hypotheses. In our study, we hypothesized that children with slowed processing speed would be associated more with the ADHD-I subtype as well as greater symptom ratings of inattention. We also hypothesized that children with the greatest cognitive impairment would exhibit lower scores on behavioral, emotional, and academic outcomes. As further discussed, these hypotheses were met and have implications for clinical interpretation of WISC-IV profiles.</p>
<p>Two of our clusters (Reduced PSI and Below Average WMI/PSI) exhibited low- to below-average performance on the WISC-IV PSI. The Reduced PSI cluster was associated with differences on parent symptom ratings, with severer ratings on the Inattention factor, supporting our hypothesis that children with slowed PSI would exhibit greater symptoms of inattention. When the Reduced PSI cluster was directly compared with the other four clusters, a significant relationship was found among diagnosis, with a greater proportion of children with ADHD-I in this cluster. This finding corroborates with other studies on ADHD implicating slowed processing speed or cognitive tempo as a distinct feature of ADHD-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711428806">Calhoun &amp; Mayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711428806">Chhabildas, Pennington, &amp; Willcutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711428806">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>) and also provides evidence that the WISC-IV PSI may aid in distinguishing this subtype from ADHD-C.</p>
<p>It is somewhat unexpected that the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster did not differ on any of the symptom ratings factors, given that this cluster actually had PSI scores that were below that of the Reduced PSI cluster. However, the Reduced PSI cluster exhibited a comparative weakness in PSI, whereas the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster had low-average or below-average scores on all IQ indexes. A selective deficit in processing speed with intact functioning in the other cognitive indexes may therefore specifically associate with inattention, whereas overall low cognitive functioning may be related to other cognitive, emotional, or psychiatric difficulties. It is also of interest that items that loaded onto the Inattention factor represented behaviors of disorganization such as losing items and difficulty organizing tasks, whereas more traditional symptoms of inattention actually loaded onto the Mixed factor. As such, reduced processing speed might be specifically associated with disorganization, which has been identified as a key symptom in ADHD-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711428806">Martel, Nikolas, &amp; Nigg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711428806">McBurnett et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>This suggests that a predominantly disorganized subtype of ADHD, characterized cognitively by a slower processing speed, may represent a distinct proportion of children with ADHD-I. Supporting this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711428806">August and Garfinkel (1989)</xref> distinguished cognitive and behavioral subtypes of ADHD and noted that children with the behavioral subtype do not typically perform poorly on neuropsychological tests, whereas those with the cognitive subtype exhibit information processing deficits. It should be emphasized that the lower PSI score identified in our Reduced PSI cluster is relative to other indexes, and still within a low-average to average range of expected functioning (<italic>M</italic> = 90.3). It may even be that children with PSI scores in the moderate to severe range of impairment may have cognitive difficulties that extend beyond increased disorganization, although further research is required to establish whether differences in reduced PSI severity relate to different symptoms, or even different diagnoses.</p>
<p>Differences in behavioral outcome and academic achievement were also identified among the clusters. As might be expected, the lowest IQ cluster, as defined by below-average performance on the WMI and PSI, had significantly lower BASC-2 adaptive subscale scores than other clusters. For example, the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster had significantly lower Functional Communication subtest scores compared with the Superior VCI cluster, which might reflect the superior verbal skills of the latter cluster. It should be noted that cognitive profiles often have minimal convergence with parent-rated behavioral measures, perhaps because they measure different aspects of functioning or because children may exhibit different behaviors in the clinic compared with the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711428806">McAuley, Chen, Goos, Schachar, &amp; Crosbie, 2010</xref>). As such, the positive results we found on the adaptive subscales strongly support that lower IQ index scores serve as a risk factor in behavioral functioning, as also found in cluster studies of pediatric TBI populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711428806">Allen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711428806">Thaler, Bello, et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>When clusters were compared across selected WJ-III ACH subtests of academic achievement, group differences also emerged in expected directions. The Reduced PSI cluster and the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster consistently exhibited impairment in reading and math fluency compared with the High Average cluster and in the case of reading fluency, compared with the Superior VCI cluster. This is likely attributed to the link between academic fluency and processing speed, which task individuals to perform simple tasks quickly and with automaticity. In addition, the Below Average WMI/PSI cluster had lower scores on the Applied Problems subtest when compared with the Reduced PSI and High Average clusters, which may reflect working memory impairments in a subset of children with ADHD which in turn interferes with higher mathematical problem solving. It is important to note that children with ADHD are often diagnosed with comorbid learning disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711428806">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2006a</xref>) and so screening out such children may have yielded a sample with an overall average or high-average achievement profiles.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings indicate that lower intellectual functioning, with below-average performance on the WMI and PSI, may be a risk factor for outcome. Alternatively or concurrently, higher intellectual functioning as characterized by average to high-average performance on all WISC-IV indexes might be a protective factor. Clinicians may use such profiles as initial guidelines on the prognosis of their clients, though additional research is needed to replicate these cognitive profiles and further examine them across other external variables to definitively establish their concurrent and predictive validity.</p>
<p>Limitations should be addressed. This study relied primarily on a convenience sample referred for a private practice neuropsychological evaluation. As such, the results from this study should be replicated in a more rigorous research setting to confirm their generalizability. Ethnicity information was not available for our participants. As previously discussed, this sample may represent a relatively high-functioning subset of children with ADHD with few complicating comorbid diagnoses which may further limit the generalizability of findings. In addition, WISC-IV clusters were primarily differentiated by parent ratings and measures of academic achievement. Additional comparisons across neuropsychological domains of attention, memory, executive functioning, and motor skills were not made and yet might provide further insight on cognitive profiles associated with ADHD symptomatology. Finally, the Average PSI cluster was not linked with any external variables, which is somewhat disappointing given its unique elevated PSI and reduced age range. Direct comparisons across additional measures might further determine whether this cluster is of clinical relevance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cluster analysis of WISC-IV profiles on a sample of children with ADHD yielded five clusters, two of which exhibited deficits in processing speed. The cluster with average VCI, PRI, and WMI, and reduced PSI was associated with higher ratings of inattentive symptoms and a greater proportion of ADHD-I diagnosis when directly compared with other clusters. The cluster with Below Average WMI/PSI had the greatest impairment in adaptive functioning and academic achievement. Results support the association between slowed processing speed and inattention and provide IQ profiles that may be predictive of symptomatology and functional outcome in children with ADHD.</p>
