<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim</italic>: To test the hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of triptans reflects convergent modulation of ion channels also involved in inflammatory mediator (IM)-induced sensitization of dural afferents.</p>
<p><italic>Methods</italic>: Acutely dissociated retrogradely labeled rat dural afferents were studied with whole cell and perforated patch techniques in the absence and presence of sumatriptan and/or IM (prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, and histamine).</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>: Sumatriptan dose-dependently suppressed voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. Acute (2 min) sumatriptan application increased dural afferent excitability and occluded further IM-induced sensitization. In contrast, pre-incubation (30 min) with sumatriptan had no influence on dural afferent excitability and partially prevented IM-induced sensitization of dural afferents. The sumatriptan-induced suppression of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and acute sensitization and pre-incubation-induced block of IM-induced sensitization were blocked by the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> antagonist BRL 15572. Pre-incubation with sumatriptan failed to suppress the IM-induced decrease in action potential threshold and overshoot (which results from modulation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents) and activation of Cl<sup>−</sup> current, and had no influence on the Cl<sup>−</sup> reversal potential. However, pre-incubation with sumatriptan caused a dramatic hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of K<sup>+</sup> current activation.</p>
<p><italic>Discussion</italic>: These results indicate that although the actions of sumatriptan on dural afferents are complex, at least two distinct mechanisms underlie the antinociceptive actions of this compound. One of these mechanisms, the shift in the voltage dependence of K<sup>+</sup> channel activation, may suggest a novel strategy for future development of anti-migraine agents.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412451356" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects a large percentage of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412451356">1</xref>). Furthermore, the social and economic burden of this disorder remains a major concern despite the prophylactic and abortive agents used to treat migraine pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412451356">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412451356">3</xref>). Previous data indicate that the release of inflammatory mediators (IM) in the dura and subsequent dural afferent sensitization are important for initiating migraine pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412451356">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412451356">5</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that IM not only sensitize the vast majority of dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412451356">6</xref>), but that this sensitization reflects the modulation of a number of different ion channels, at least one of which appears to be unique to dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451356">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Triptans, one of the most effective classes of drugs for the treatment of migraine pain, are serotonin 1B/1D (5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>) receptor agonists. Although the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors seem to be primarily post-synaptic, located on vascular smooth muscle, the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors are located on the peripheral and central terminals of dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412451356">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412451356">9</xref>). Interestingly, despite widespread distribution of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors in trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412451356">9</xref>), clinical data indicate that these compounds have little, if any utility in the treatment of anything but migraine pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412451356">10</xref>). And while preclinical data suggest that these compounds may have anti-inflammatory efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412451356">11</xref>) and may be analgesic when directly applied to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412451356">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412451356">13</xref>), systemic administration of triptans selectively inhibit nociceptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412451356">14</xref>), neuropathic pain behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412451356">15</xref>), and evoked activity in trigeminal dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412451356">16</xref>) in response to noxious stimulation of trigeminal targets.</p>
<p>These observations raised the possibility that the clinical selectivity and efficacy of triptans reflect a unique mechanism of action on dural afferents. To begin to assess this possibility, we examined the effect of sumatriptan on the excitability of dural afferents as well as the influence of this compound on IM-induced sensitization of dural afferents.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0333102412451356"><title>Animals</title>
<p>Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing between 180 and 290 g were used for all experiments. Rats were housed two per cage at the University of Pittsburgh animal facility on a 12:12 light: dark schedule with food and water freely available. Before all procedures, animals were deeply anesthetized with an i.p. injection (1 ml/kg) of rat cocktail containing ketamine (55 mg/kg), xylazine (5.5 mg/kg), and acepromazine (1.1 mg/kg). Experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of laboratory animals in research. All efforts were made to minimize the total number of animals used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0333102412451356"><title>Retrograde labeling</title>
<p>Afferents innervating the dura were identified as previously described following labeling with the retrograde tracer 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412451356">8</xref>). Immediately post-operatively, animals received a single i.m. injection of penicillin G (10,000 units/kg) and a single injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) to minimize infection and discomfort. Subsequent administration of ketoprofen was provided if evidence of hypersensitivity persisted over subsequent days after labeling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102412451356"><title>Tissue preparation</title>
<p>Ten to fourteen days after DiI application, trigeminal ganglia (TG) were removed, enzymatically treated and mechanically dissociated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451356">7</xref>). Acutely dissociated cells were plated on laminin/ornithine coated glass coverslips. Changes in current and excitability were measured 2-8 hours after cells were plated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0333102412451356"><title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>All whole cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings were performed with a HEKA EPC10 amplifier (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht/Rhineland-Pfalz, Germany). Data were low-pass filtered at 5–10 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter and digitally sampled at 25–100 kHz.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0333102412451356"><title>Current clamp</title>
<p>To assess changes in excitability, borosilicate glass electrodes were filled with (mM) K-methanesulfonate 110, KCl 30, NaCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, Mg-ATP 2, Li-GTP 1, pH 7.2 (adjusted with Tris-base), 310 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose). Bath solution contained (mM) KCl 3, NaCl 130, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.6, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris-base), 325 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose) and either vehicle (0.01% ethanol and 0.1% acetic acid) or test compounds: IM [(μM) bradykinin 10, histamine 1, and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> 1] and/or sumatriptan (1 µM). Excitability was assessed with three parameters as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412451356">6</xref>): rheobase, action potential threshold, and the response to suprathreshold stimulation. A neuron was considered sensitized if application of a test solution resulted in a hyperpolarization of action potential threshold, decrease in rheobase, and/or an increase in the response to suprathreshold stimulation greater than two standard deviations from the baseline mean.</p>
<p>Passive properties measured were resting membrane potential (<italic>E</italic><sub>m</sub>) and input resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub>). <italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub> was assessed with five 750 ms hyperpolarizing current injections (2–5 pA) from <italic>E</italic><sub>m</sub> immediately before and 90 s after the application of sumatriptan alone, IM alone, or sumatriptan and IM. Active electrophysiological properties were assessed with an action potential (AP) evoked with a 4 ms depolarizing current pulse. These included AP duration at 0 mV, magnitude of AP overshoot, magnitude of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP), and AHP decay (τ AHP). The magnitude of the overshoot was measured from 0 mV. The magnitude of the AHP was measured from the <italic>E</italic><sub>m</sub>. Decay of the AHP was estimated by fitting the decay phase of the AHP with a single exponential function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0333102412451356"><title>Voltage clamp</title>
<p>To isolate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, electrodes had a resistance of 1–4 MΩ when filled with and electrode solution containing (mM): Cs-methanesulfonate 100, Na-methanesulfonate 5, tetraethylammonium-Cl 40, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 11, HEPES 10, pH 7.2 (adjusted with Tris-base), 310 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose). The bath solution contained (mM): choline-Cl 100, tetraethylammonium-Cl 30, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.6, niflumic acid (NFA) 0.1, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris-base), 325 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose).</p>
<p>IM-induced Cl<sup>−</sup> currents (I<sub>IM-Cl</sub>) were isolated with electrode solutions containing (mM) Cs-methanesulfonate 100, CsCl 30, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, Mg-ATP 2, Li-GTP 1, pH 7.2 (adjusted with Tris-base), 310 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose) and bath solution containing (mM) Choline-Cl 130, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.6, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris-base), 325 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose). I<sub>IM-Cl</sub> was elicited with 100 ms test pulses from −70 to +50 mV following a 40 ms pre-pulse to 0 mV to evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the presence of sumatriptan with and without IM. I<sub>IM-Cl</sub> was also recorded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> artificially buffered to 622 nM with an electrode solution containing EGTA (1.2 mM), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) and influx via voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was also blocked by the addition of Cd<sup>2+</sup> (50 µM) to the bath solution. MaxChelator was used to generate estimates of resting free intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>To isolate K<sup>+</sup> currents, electrodes had a resistance of 1–4 MΩ when filled with (mM) K-methanesulfonate 110, KCl 30, NaCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, Mg-ATP 2, Li-GTP 1, pH 7.2 (adjusted with Tris-base), 310 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose). Bath solution contained (mM) KCl 3, Choline-Cl 130, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.6, NFA 0.1, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris-base), 325 mOsm (adjusted with sucrose). Because the bath solution contained Ca<sup>2+</sup>, total K<sup>+</sup> current consisted of both voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup>- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451356">7</xref>).</p>

<p>All salts and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless indicated below. Bradykinin was dissolved in 1% acetic acid (23.58 mM stock concentration), PGE<sub>2</sub> was dissolved in 100% ethanol (10 mM stock concentration), and histamine was dissolved in water (100 mM stock concentration). All stock solutions were stored at −20°C until the day of use. IM-vehicle bath containing the final concentration of ethanol (0.01%) and acetic acid (0.001%) was used as a control. NFA was dissolved in 100% ethanol. Sumatriptan was a gift from Glaxo SmithKline. Sumatriptan was dissolved as a 10 mM stock solution in water and subsequently diluted in bath solution. The 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonist BRL 15572 was obtained from Tocris Biosciences (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), was dissolved as a 10 mM stock in 100% ethanol and diluted in bath solution.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0333102412451356"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed with PulseFit (HEKA), Sigma Plot and Sigma Stat software (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). Conductance-voltage (G-V) curves were constructed from I-V curves by dividing the evoked current by the driving force on the current, such that G = I/(V<sub>m</sub> – V<sub>rev</sub>), where V<sub>m</sub> is the potential at which current was evoked and V<sub>rev</sub> is the reversal potential for the current was measured directly (for K and Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Instantaneous I-V data was obtained from the tail currents measured following activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0333102412451356"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For comparisons of data collected before and after IM application, either a paired t-test or repeated-measures ANOVA was used if data were parametric. Otherwise, a Wilcoxon or Friedman test was used for nonparametric analysis. For unpaired comparisons, Student’s t-test, one- and two-way ANOVA were used for parametric data and a Mann Whitney U test for nonparametric analysis. Data were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05. All data are represented as mean ± standard error.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0333102412451356" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Data were collected from 78 dural afferents acutely dissociated from 15 female Sprague Dawley rats. Of these, 53 were studied in voltage clamp and 25 were studied in current clamp.</p>
<sec id="sec13-0333102412451356"><title>Sumatriptan dose-dependently inhibits voltage-gated calcium currents</title>
<p>Previous data suggests a primary mechanism of triptan action is a G-protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (VGCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412451356">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412451356">18</xref>). To determine whether such a mechanism exists in dural afferents and to determine the appropriate concentration of sumatriptan for subsequent experiments, VGCC in dural afferents (n = 7) were studied with increasing concentrations (0.001–10 μM) of sumatriptan. Currents were evoked with 50 ms pulses from −60 to +80 mV following a 100 ms pre-pulse to −100 mV.</p>
<p>A concentration-dependent inhibition of VGCC was observed in seven of seven dural afferents studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412451356">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Inhibition of peak current evoked at 10 mV was converted to percent inhibition and data from all seven neurons were pooled, plotted as a function of the concentration of sumatriptan and fitted with a modified Hill equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412451356">Figure 1C</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> for sumatriptan-induced inhibition of VGCC was 142 nM, with a maximal fractional inhibition of 20 ± 2%. Interestingly, there was no evidence of a low threshold VGCC in any of the dural afferents studied.

(B) Bath application of increasing concentrations of sumatriptan from 0.001 to 10 μM suppressed I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude recorded with a single pulse to 10 mV in seven of seven dural afferents studied. (C) The IC<sub>50</sub> for sumatriptan was determined with percent inhibition plotted against sumatriptan concentration. (D) To examine the voltage dependence of inhibition, currents were elicited with a test pulse to +10 mV following pre-pulses to –60 and +80 mV before (Baseline) and after sumatriptan (10 μM Suma) application (n = 5). The ratio of the current amplitude following a pre-pulse to +80 divided by the current amplitude following a pre-pulse to –60 was determined before and after sumatriptan application. Following sumatriptan application, there was no significant difference in the current ratio. (E) Instantaneous I-V data were plotted from tail currents. Sumatriptan decreased the amplitude of the tail currents but did not produce a shift in their voltage dependence of activation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0333102412451356-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To determine whether a membrane-delimited displacement of the N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel β-subunit by the G-protein βγ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412451356">19</xref>) could also be mediating the decrease in VGCC with sumatriptan, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were elicited with a two-pulse protocol in which a test pulse to +10 mV was preceded by a conditioning pulse to either −60 mV or +80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412451356">20</xref>). A 50 ms step to −60 mV between the conditioning and test pulses was used to enable channel deactivation following the step to +80 mV (n = 5). Consistent with the absence of a detectable shift in the VGCC instantaneous I-V curve, there was no evidence of pre-pulse potentiation, as the ratio of the currents elicited before sumatriptan application (1.07 ± 0.03) were comparable to that after application (1.12 ± 0.07, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412451356">Figure 1D</xref>). To confirm that sumatriptan-induced inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in dural afferents was mediated by the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor, sumatriptan (1 μM) was co-applied to three dural afferents with the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor selective antagonist BRL 15572 (1 μM). Two minutes after the application of the combination of sumatriptan and BRL 15572, the decrease in maximal conductance (7.0 ± 0.1% of baseline) was significantly (p &lt; 0.01, Student’s t-test) less than that observed with sumatriptan alone.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0333102412451356"><title>Acute sumatriptan increases baseline dural afferent excitability</title>
<p>Acute (2 min) application of 1 µM sumatriptan alone produced a significant increase in excitability of dural afferents (n = 7) as evidenced by changes in rheobase (p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">Figure 2A</xref>), AP threshold (p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">Figure 2B</xref>), and the response to suprathreshold current injection (p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">Figure 2C</xref>). These changes were associated with a significant (p &lt; 0.01, paired t-test) depolarization of E<sub>m</sub> from −71.3 ± 1.6 mV to −54.0 ± 3.6 mV. These sumatriptan-induced changes in excitability were blocked by the co-application of the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonist BRL 15572 (1 μM, n = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">C</xref>).

(A) Acute bath application of 1 µM sumatriptan resulted in a significant reduction in rheobase in dural afferents (n = 7). This effect was blocked when sumatriptan was co-applied with the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonist BRL 15572 (Antag, 1 μM, n = 6). When IM were applied to dural afferents in the presence of sumatriptan, there was no further decrease in rheobase. (B) Acute sumatriptan application also significantly hyperpolarized the AP threshold. This change was also blocked when sumatriptan was co-applied with BRL 15572. There was no further change in AP threshold following IM application. Data in (A) and (B) were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak test used for post-hoc analysis. The most relevant comparisons are illustrated for clarity; *p &lt; 0.05.

<p>To determine whether sensitization of dural afferents via sumatriptan or IM involve comparable mechanisms, IM were applied following sumatriptan. No further increase in excitability was detected in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412451356">Figure 2</xref>).

Similarly, sumatriptan pre-incubation produced no significant (p &gt; 0.05, Student’s t-test) changes in AP threshold compared with control: AP threshold was −29.5 ± 1.6 mV and −23.6 ± 4.3 mV in neurons from vehicle- and sumatriptan-treated groups, respectively.

<p>The purpose of this study was to identify the ionic mechanism(s) underlying the actions of sumatriptan on dural afferents. Our results indicate the following. 1) Acute sumatriptan application produces an increase in baseline dural afferent excitability that is blocked by the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonist BRL 15572. No further increase in excitability was observed following subsequent application of IM. 2) A 30 min sumatriptan pre-incubation has no detectable influence on dural afferent excitability but attenuates IM-induced sensitization in a 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonist-dependent manner. 3) Although sumatriptan produced an expected inhibition of VGCC, pre-incubation with sumatriptan did not attenuate the IM-induced decrease in AP threshold or action potential overshoot (changes that appear to depend on an increase in tetrodotoxin-resistant Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451356">7</xref>)) or I<sub>IM-Cl</sub>. 4) Sumatriptan both increases K<sup>+</sup> currents in dural afferents via a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation and attenuates IM-induced suppression of total K<sup>+</sup> current.</p>
<sec id="sec20-0333102412451356"><title>Sumatriptan-mediated inhibition of VGCC</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate that sumatriptan concentration-dependently inhibits VGCC in dural afferents. One of the most dramatic mechanisms of G-protein-coupled-receptor-mediated inhibition of VGCC involves a rapid displacement of the VGCC β subunit via the G-protein βγ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412451356">19</xref>). A unique feature of this form of inhibition is that it can be overcome with a strong depolarizing pre-pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412451356">20</xref>). However, following a depolarizing pre-pulse to +80 mV, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents did not recover from sumatriptan inhibition. Furthermore, a lack of depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation with increasing concentrations of sumatriptan suggests that this inhibition is via an as-yet unidentified intracellular second messenger. These conclusions are consistent with previous results from a study of <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae spinal neurons indicating that 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonists (L694 247) reduce high-voltage-activated N- and P/Q-type currents by a G-protein-activated diffusible second messenger pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412451356">18</xref>). More relevantly, these data are also consistent with previous reports that zolmitriptan can block P/Q- and possibly R-type currents in dissociated TG neurons. This effect was pertussis toxin sensitive, indicating the activation of Gi/Go class of G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412451356">17</xref>). Such a mechanism was recently suggested to account for the sumatriptan-induced suppression of capsaicin-evoked currents in dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412451356">24</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0333102412451356"><title>Acute sumatriptan application increases dural afferent excitability</title>
<p>Acute application of sumatriptan produced an increase in dural afferent excitability. These data may explain the clinical observation that triptans transiently aggravate headache. Within 5-15 min of taking sumatriptan, approximately 50% of patients experience exacerbated pain that lasts for about 10–15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412451356">25</xref>) before the onset of pain relief. Our data are also consistent with previous observations that sumatriptan can drive a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412451356">26</xref>), increase the firing rate of C and Aδ meningeal nociceptors, and increase their mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412451356">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple mechanisms are probably involved in this sumatriptan-induced transient increase in dural afferent excitability. However, the only change in active or passive electrophysiological properties observed in this study following acute sumatriptan was a significant depolarization in the membrane potential from −71.3 mV to −54.0 mV. The fact that the depolarization was not accompanied by a significant change in R<sub>in</sub> suggests that there was no net change in the number of open channels, only a shift in the proportion of the various types of channels that were open.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0333102412451356"><title>Pre-incubation with sumatriptan has no influence on dural afferent excitability</title>
<p>There was no significant influence of pre-incubation with sumatriptan on baseline dural afferent excitability. This is somewhat surprising, in retrospect, given the dramatic leftward shift in the activation of I<sub>K</sub>. Multiple K<sup>+</sup> currents are expressed in sensory neurons and are critically involved in regulating their excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412451356">27</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> channels regulate the timing between APs and therefore affect AP frequency. Thus, the dramatic shift in the voltage dependence of activation of K<sup>+</sup> currents should have resulted in an increase in rheobase and/or a decrease in the response to suprathreshold current injection. The failure to detect such changes in excitability suggests that the shift in the voltage dependence of K<sup>+</sup> current activation is compensated for, at least in part, by excitatory changes that persist following acute application of summatriptan. One such mechanism would include a suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels secondary to the sumatriptan-induced inhibition of VGCC. We have recently demonstrated that such a channel is present in a subpopulation of cutaneous neurons, where it plays a significant role in the regulation of afferent excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412451356">28</xref>) and appears to be tightly coupled to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via VGCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412451356">29</xref>). Given that we have also demonstrated that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel is present in dural afferents and suppressed following IM application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412451356">7</xref>), sumatriptan-induced suppression of such a current could also account for the apparent block of the IM-induced suppression of total K<sup>+</sup> current following sumatriptan pre-incubation. Such an explanation would suggest that the shift in the voltage dependence of K<sup>+</sup> current activation is associated with an increase in K<sup>+</sup> channel density. That is, an increase in one K<sup>+</sup> channel type associated with the shift in the voltage-dependence of activation would compensate for a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, resulting in the observed no net change in peak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. K<sup>+</sup> channel subunits present in sensory neurons that could undergo such dramatic shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation include Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102412451356">30</xref>), which can undergo a ∼26 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the G-V following Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin dependent dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0333102412451356">31</xref>). Future studies will be needed to identify the K<sup>+</sup> channel subunit(s) that underlie the actions of sumatriptan in dural afferents.</p>

<sec id="sec23-0333102412451356"><title>Sumatriptan selectivity</title>
<p>The observation that both the sumatriptan-induced acute sensitization and the subsequent inhibition of IM-induced sensitization of dural afferents were blocked by BRL 15572 indicates that both processes are mediated by the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor. This is consistent with previous data suggesting that although both 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors are present on trigeminal ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0333102412451356">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0333102412451356">33</xref>), the vasoconstrictive effects of triptans are due to the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors on the dural vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0333102412451356">34</xref>), whereas the selective therapeutic efficacy of triptans for migraine is due to 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors in dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412451356">35</xref>). However, evidence that the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor is present on subpopulations of afferents throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412451356">9</xref>) and that triptans have analgesic efficacy in other preclinical pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412451356">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412451356">13</xref>) still leaves a question as to the basis of the selective clinical profile of this class of drugs. Our recent observation of the higher density of the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>R in nerve fibers preferentially involved in signaling migraine pain may partially explain the selectivity of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412451356">8</xref>). However, in light of the fact that a receptor for these drugs is present in other afferent populations, albeit at lower densities, we proposed that other mechanisms probably contribute to efficacy and selectivity. Given evidence that IM-induced activation of I<sub>IM-Cl</sub> appears to be a relatively unique mechanism underlying the sensitization of dural afferents, sumatriptan-induced inhibition of I<sub>IM-Cl</sub> would provide another mechanism to account for the therapeutic selectivity of this compound. The observations that sumatriptan neither blocked the activation of I<sub>IM-Cl</sub> nor shifted the equilibrium potential for Cl<sup>−</sup> indicates that this channel cannot account for the therapeutic actions of triptans. However, the modulation of I<sub>K</sub> could account for the therapeutic selectivity of this compound if data from subsequent studies confirm that this modulation is observed only in dural afferents.</p>
<p>The complex actions of sumatriptan on dural afferents raise at least three questions. One question is how a decrease in VGCC could contribute to the antinociceptive efficacy of triptans at the same time triptans have increased excitability of dural afferents. VGCCs are largely responsible for the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> necessary to enable transmitter release from pre-synaptic terminals. The suppression of VGCC on the central terminals of dural afferents should contribute to the antinociceptive efficacy of triptans and account for the normalization of dural stimulation-induced activity in trigeminal dorsal horn neurons following IM-induced sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412451356">36</xref>). While there is evidence that low threshold or T-type VGCC may contribute to afferent sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412451356">37</xref>), the high-threshold channels described in the present study that mediate transmitter release have a minimal direct contribution to AP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0333102412451356">38</xref>). However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through these channels may contribute to the activation and/or modulation of a number of channels, including two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0333102412451356">39</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412451356">28</xref>). Thus, as noted above, although the triptan-induced suppression of VGCC in dural afferents may occur in parallel with the increase in excitability, the two may be causally linked.</p>
<p>A second question pertains to the differential time course of the sumatriptan-induced excitation and inhibition of IM-induced sensitization, particularly if both processes are mediated by the same receptor. Although pharmacokinetics could explain the relatively slow onset of triptan-induced pain relief observed clinically, the present results suggest an alternative possibility: distinct cellular processes underlie excitatory and inhibitory actions of the drug, in which those underlying inhibition develop far more slowly than those underlying excitation. Additional work will be needed to tease apart the specific mechanisms underlying the actions of sumatriptan in dural afferents, but the literature is now full of examples of receptor-mediated processes, in particular those, like the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors that are coupled to G-proteins, that develop over very different time scales. For example, the membrane-delimited form of G-protein-mediated suppression of VGCC can occur within tens of milliseconds in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412451356">40</xref>), while there is evidence that metabotropic-glutamate-receptor-mediated decrease in membrane ionotropic glutamate receptors develops over tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412451356">41</xref>).</p>
<p>A third question is why triptans fail to alleviate migraine pain once it is already established. Our results indicating that pre-incubation with sumatriptan blocked IM-induced sensitization are consistent with the evidence that triptans administered before the development of migraine pain can abort a migraine. However, the leftward shift in the activation of K<sup>+</sup> currents should enable sumatriptan to reverse afferent sensitization even after it is established. The observation that triptans fail to reverse IM-induced sensitization of dural afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412451356">36</xref>) suggests that the second messenger pathways activated by IM block the actions of sumatriptan, at least those underlying the modulation of K<sup>+</sup> currents. Ongoing experiments are designed to identify the point(s) of convergence of the underlying second messenger pathways.</p>

<sec id="sec24-0333102412451356"><title>Summary</title>
<p>We have described both excitatory and inhibitory effects of sumatriptan that follow a time course that may explain why some migraineurs experience increases in pain sensitivity before the onset of pain relief. Additional work is needed to identify the ionic mechanisms underlying the excitatory effects of sumatriptan, as the ability to block these effects may ultimately increase the efficacy of these compounds. We have ruled out two important targets for the therapeutic actions of sumatriptan, tetrodotoxin resistant I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>IM-Cl</sub>. The implication of this observation is that there is a balance between the excitatory actions of IM and the inhibitory actions of triptans, which appear to be acting on different targets. More excitation and/or less inhibition in a subpopulation of patients would result in a population unresponsive to triptans. Differences in the relative balance between excitation and inhibition may suggest an explanation for why triptans are effective in only ∼70% of migraineurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412451356">3</xref>) (although the number pain free at 2 hours may be considerably lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0333102412451356">42</xref>)). More importantly, in addition to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels previously identified by others, we have identified a novel target that may account for the therapeutic actions of triptans. Maximizing the hyperpolarizing shift in I<sub>K</sub> may provide a novel approach for the treatment of migraine.</p>
