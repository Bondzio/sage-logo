<body>
<p>An 11-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with history of dry cough for 1 week. There was no history of runny nose, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, exercise intolerance, fever, rash, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or change in appetite. He was seen at an urgent care clinic 2 days prior to ED evaluation and was prescribed 5-day course of azithromycin. He did not improve on azithromycin and was subsequently brought to the ED.</p>
<p>The patient did not have history of any medical problems or surgeries. He had no known allergies and his immunizations were up to date. His only medication was azithromycin. The patient lived with his parents and there was no history of pet exposure or recent travel. His family history was remarkable for cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death of his 28-year-old brother.</p>
<sec id="section1-0009922813483172">
<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>In the ED, the patient’s vital signs were a heart rate of 125 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.8°C. The patient’s oxygen saturation was 86% on room air and 99% with blow-by oxygen. On examination, the patient was mildly tachypneic with rales heard over bilateral lower lung fields. His heart sounds were normal and no murmurs were appreciated. Abdomen was flat, soft, and nontender without organomegaly. Neurologically, he did not have any focal deficits.</p>
<p>A chest X-ray was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813483172">Figure 1</xref>). The laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count of 5.4 (50% neutrophils, 36% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes), hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14.6 and 41.8, respectively, and platelets 298 000. He had normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. He was fluid resuscitated and was started on antibiotics for a pneumonia based on chest X-ray findings.</p>

</fig>
<p>A capillary blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.38, pCO<sub>2</sub> 38, bicarbonate 22, and ionized calcium of 1.42. Electrolytes were Sodium 131 mmol/l, Potassium 4.6 mmol/l, Chloride 98mmol/l, Bircarbonate 26mmol/l, BUN 13 mg/dl, Creatininie 0.8mg/dl, glucose 106, and calcium 10 mg/dl respiratory syncytial virus/influenza direct fluorescent antigen tests and polymerase chain reaction were negative.</p>
<p>During the course of patient’s admission, his respiratory status worsened. He became increasingly tachypneic, developed retractions, nasal flaring, and increasing oxygen requirement. A repeat chest X-ray showed worsening infiltrates. A thoracic ultrasound did not to reveal an effusion amenable to drainage. An echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function.</p>
<p>Because of the patient’s dependency on supplemental oxygen and worsening respiratory symptoms, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was negative for bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial organisms. A thoracic computed tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922813483172">Figure 2</xref>) revealed extensive bilateral opacities with interstitial thickening and enlarged paratracheal, subcarinal, and right hilar lymphadenopathy.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit after a video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed for which he was intubated. On ventilator he initially required high FiO<sub>2</sub> and increasing positive end-expiratory pressure. He was started on methylprednisolone 30 mg intravenous every 6 hours for acute respiratory distress syndrome–like picture. He was weaned off the ventilatory support over a 7-day period. While in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient was hypertensive. His systolic pressures were in 140 mm Hg range and diastolic in 100 mm Hg range. The hypertension was treated with hydralazine.</p>
<p>The lung biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were sent and were found to be elevated. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made and he was started on intravenous methylprednisolone with subsequent addition of methotrexate and folic acid.</p>
<p>The patient was eventually weaned off oxygen support and remained stable on room air. Antimicrobials were discontinued. He continued to have slight cough with clear mucus. He underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for neurosarcoidosis, which showed symmetric increased T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery signal abnormality involving the left cerebellar hemisphere, bilateral parietal, occipital, and frontal subcortical white matter representing posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, likely from patient’s hypertensive episodes. The patient was eventually discharged home on oral steroids and weekly methotrexate therapy.</p>

<title>Final Diagnosis</title>
<p>Pulmonary sarcoidosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922813483172" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pediatric sarcoidosis, though rare, has been described in literature from time to time. Around 25 cases have been reported over the past 5 years. However, our case was unusual because the child presented with acute symptomatology, acute respiratory distress syndrome–like picture and absence of other commonly associated systemic symptoms such as malaise, fever, loss of appetite, and loss of weight.</p>
<p>Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease with unknown etiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483172">1</xref></sup> In a Danish study on pediatric patients with sarcoidosis, the incidence was reported to be 0.29 per 100 000. The usual presentation of pediatric sarcoidosis is bimodal with 2 age-groups identified, those younger than 5 years and those in the preadolescent and adolescent age-grousp. Younger kids most commonly presented with cutaneous, ocular, or joint involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813483172">2</xref></sup> In older kids and adolescents, pulmonary manifestations are common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483172">3</xref></sup> Unlike adults, a pediatric study failed to recognize particular gender predilection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483172">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lungs are the most commonly involved organs at initial presentation. As in our patient, dry cough is a predominant symptom. Radiologic abnormalities are commonly found. As much as 60% to 70% patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms have radiological abnormality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483172">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483172">4</xref></sup> Unlike our patient who only had unilateral hilar adenopathy, bilateral hilar adenopathy is a more common finding on a chest radiograph.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483172">4</xref></sup> Most patients, unlike ours, have concomitant systemic symptoms such as loss of appetite and weight at the time of presentation.</p>
<p>Multiple laboratory abnormalities are observed in patients with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, though not specific, may be elevated in more than 50% of patients with sarcoidosis and this is believed to be because of secretion of angiotensin-converting enzyme by the sarcoid cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813483172">5</xref></sup> Similarly, majority of the patients with sarcoidosis have hypercalcemia and this is thought to be secondary to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D produced within the sarcoid granuloma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813483172">6</xref></sup> Other abnormalities may include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leucopenia, eosinophilia, and hypergamaglobulinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813483172">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813483172">8</xref></sup> Hypergammaglobulinemia seems to originate from activated T-lymphocytes in the lungs stimulating certain B-cell clones to produce immunoglobulins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483172">9</xref></sup> However, gold standard for diagnosis of sarcoidosis is demonstration of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy supported with clinical and radiographic findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483172">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Complications of sarcoidosis depend on the organ system involvement. Common complications include restrictive lung disease, blindness from ocular involvement, chronic arthritis, renal and myocardial dysfunction, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813483172">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813483172">11</xref></sup> Though our patient did not have any neurologic symptoms from his elevated blood pressures, hypertensive encephalopathy has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813483172">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Steroids appear to the mainstay of treatment for pediatric sarcoidosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813483172">12</xref></sup> A maintenance dose followed by a slow tapering regimen is most commonly used. Low-dose methotrexate has also been used as steroid sparing agent for worsening pulmonary disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483172">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813483172">5</xref></sup> Our patient did receive methotrexate secondary to extensive pulmonary involvement.</p>
<p>Secondary to limited literature on pediatric sarcoidosis, the prognosis is not very clear. In a long-term follow-up study in 46 Danish children with sarcoidosis, majority recovered within 6 years of disease onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813483172">13</xref></sup> In a case series of 6 patients with onset of disease at younger than 4 years of age, the prognosis seemed unfavorable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813483172">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813483172" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the ED, a high index of clinical suspicion is required for new diagnosis of pediatric sarcoidosis. It should be suspected in a child presenting with pulmonary symptoms and radiographic evidence of hilar adenopathy. Helpful laboratory clues to diagnosis include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in active disease, leucopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia and nonspecific elevations of angiotensin- converting enzyme levels. The gold standard for diagnosis of sarcoidosis is demonstration of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy supported with clinical and radiographic findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483172">4</xref></sup> The mainstay of treatment is steroids with favorable prognosis for kids in the older age-group.</p>
