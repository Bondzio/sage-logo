<p>Curran’s compelling volume begins by outlining what he believes is the social mission of the Catholic Church in the US. What stands out throughout his treatment of this topic is the role played by the laity. Post-Vatican II theology has insisted on the importance of the social mission of the Church as a constitutive dimension of the Gospel and the Church’s mission, and Curran wants to flesh out what this means for the contemporary Church, especially the lay apostolate. He stresses the fact that all baptised members of the Church carry out the social mission of the Church. Thus he states: ‘As overseers the bishops have a responsibility to make the whole Church recognise the theoretical and practical importance of the social mission’ (p. ix). But, in addition, ‘individual Catholics, various movements, and institutions also exercise important leadership functions as regards the social mission of the Church’ (p. ix). Although the Pope and the bishops have proposed a body of teaching for Catholics to follow (Catholic Social Teaching), this cannot be identified with the social mission as such. Curran is keen to emphasise the fact that the social mission of the Church is not complete and that it is the responsibility of all Catholics to bring it about.</p>
<p>Drawing upon the work of John A. Ryan and John Courtney Murray, Curran outlines how the social mission of the Church developed in the first part of the twentieth century. Ryan’s work was useful in emphasising the levels of hierarchical teachings issued by the bishops as well as emphasising the fact that social questions are not merely economic matters but moral and religious issues that need the input of the Church. Of particular interest, though, is Ryan’s insistence that the Catholic laity must become involved in different aspects of social reform either by working to change certain policies or by participating in institutions such as labour unions. For Ryan, bishops and priests have to lead social work and action by assisting and directing cooperative associations of all kinds (p. 16). John Courtney Murray’s work was significant in the first part of the twentieth century because it sought to show how the Church can and should influence and affect the temporal order through the works of Christian lay people. Here again, we see that the lay apostolate is crucial to the work of the hierarchy and the mission of the Church. Murray was clear about the fact that a personal, one-to-one apostolate would not be able to change a milieu or an ethos or an institution (p. 17). The Catholic Worker Movement is living testimony of this.</p>
<p>Curran considers the Catholic Worker Movement to be living testimony to the power of the lay apostolate, referring to the pioneering work of Dorothy Day to highlight its effectiveness. Despite not being an official Catholic institution under the direction of the hierarchy, the group had a profound effect on the Church in the US, and was the forerunner of the Catholic peace movement which strongly opposed the Vietnam War through the use of non-violent civil disobedience (p. 28). The group influenced the position taken by the US Bishops in their 1983 pastoral letter and, as a result, pacificism was recognised as a legitimate position.</p>
<p>Curran points out that all of this shows that sometimes the bishops were able to mobilise the whole Church behind their activities and sometimes the lay movements within the Church were able to mobilise the bishops. Again this highlights the important role played by the laity in living out the social mission of the Church. From the very outset, Curran’s work encourages the Catholic faithful to draw inspiration from Catholic movements in the States which operated outside the jurisdiction of the hierarchy and to try to follow this example in seeking ways of building up God’s kingdom on earth. He shows us that lay creativity and participation in the Church are the key to the Church’s social mission at every level.</p>
<p>For Curran, lay people exercise an apostolate of evangelisation and sanctification. The laity, he claims, has an active role in the life and activity of the Church, especially at parish level, and schools and parishes are the most effective means of keeping the lay apostolate alive and healthy. ‘A Catholic school [he argues] can integrate both the in-service involvement and the curricular emphasis on social justice with the liturgical life of the students’ (p. 132). In addition, we are told that Catholic Social Teaching should provide the lens through which Catholic higher education views how well they have prepared graduates to see their careers as vocations in service of the common good (p. 133). The parish, on the other hand, is the central place to carry out the social mission of the Church. This is not an extra mission; it is integral, essential and constitutive of the parish. The role of the bishops in this regard is to learn from the experience of the parish where there is evidence which shows that the social mission is being lived out and brought to life. However, Curran notes that this presents parishes with the challenge of making the Sunday liturgy a significant vehicle through which teaching and formation can occur.</p>
<p>The book concludes with a discussion on how the US bishops have dealt with the issue of abortion. Curran claims that the Catholic bishops have claimed too much certitude in their position on abortion law and have failed to recognise that other Catholics may legitimately hold other positions. The final chapter of Curran’s work demonstrates that the bishops could, and at times should, speak out on specific policy issues but they must recognise that on such complex issues they cannot claim certitude. Although the bishops themselves disagree with this point—claiming that abortion is an intrinsically evil act and therefore cannot ever be justified—Curran argues that laws prohibiting abortion are not the only way to protect the life of the unborn. ‘Education, support for pregnant women and change in structures that might make abortion more appealing can have [also] have a significant effect’ (p. 176). Moreover, Curran states that the bishops should not treat abortion law as the primary social issue; ‘other important social issues of poverty, equality, discrimination, ecology, peace and all forms of justice have not been given the importance they deserve’ (p. 176). He is clearly calling for the bishops to link their concern for the unborn with other equally pressing life issues. He also calls the bishops to acknowledge that when they speak of abortion issues they cannot and should not assume or claim that theirs is the only position within the Church. The truly Catholic Church, in Curran’s view, has room for different positions on abortion law.</p>
<p>Curran’s work is impressive in many ways. First, the depth of historical and theological research into the development of the social mission of the Catholic Church in the US provides a stimulating platform for Curran’s views on the participation of the laity in carrying out the social mission of the Church as well as his views on how groups operating outside the supervision of the hierarchy should be considered by the bishops. Second, his emphasis on the role of the lay apostolate presents every Catholic with a challenging agenda: to live out the social mission of the Church in the light of experience and conscience. It also presents the bishops with a challenge: to become a group of leaders who listen to ‘on the ground’ experiences of the laity and use these to inform future teachings. This of course does not always happen in practice and is often frustrated by an overly judgemental magisterium. Nevertheless, the examples cited in Curran’s work show us how effectively the magisterium could work if it listened to the experiences of ordinary Catholics and other movements outside the Church who are committed to same social agenda as the Church. Third, Curran’s work shows us that we need not be fearful of diversity within the Church. Diversity and conflicting views are seen as part and parcel of an evolving and mature Church. For instance, diversity concerning the teachings on abortion may bring about a more fruitful way of protecting life rather than relying solely on top-down prohibitions on the issue. And finally, Curran’s volume teaches us that prudential judgements taken by the educated lay faithful can and do lead to legitimate positions different from those taken by the bishops (p. 170).</p>
<p>Clearly, Curran’s Church is one where everyone’s informed view is considered carefully and taken seriously rather than condemned and disregarded. His model of Church is visionary and hopeful, but it remains to be seen whether the bishops in any country, not simply those operating in the US, will see Curran’s work as a call to responsible governance or a threat to their own authority and leadership. It also remains to be seen whether or not any bishop will take up the challenge on an individual basis and attempt to organise his diocese in such a way as to take lay creativity seriously; to listen to the experiences of the parish as it seeks to live out the social mission of the Church; and to respect legitimate differences when the parish finds itself unable to embody the official teachings of the Church. The challenge is perhaps daunting for many but it is undoubtedly one that could bring many surprises and new ways of becoming God’s people on earth.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a must-read for any Catholic who is seriously committed to living out the Church’s social mission. It challenges and provokes discussion and deep reflection upon what it means to be engaged in issues of social justice as baptised members of the Church. It gives motivation to those Catholics who are contributing to the social mission of the Church and whose experiences are not integrated into the hierarchical structure of the Church. It proposes an antidote to alienation and impersonal governance within the Church and challenges the bishops to listen to others working both internally within parishes and dioceses and externally in other charitable organisations. Although written primarily with the US Church in mind, Curran’s proposals are relevant to the entire Catholic Church. At a time when bishops around the globe are dealing with issues of child-sex abuse and cover ups of such scandals, a new type of leadership is undoubtedly required—one which is capable of listening before it teaches and which includes and encourages the widest possible participation to ensure that it acts with justice and integrity in the quest to realise the common good.</p>
