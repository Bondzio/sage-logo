<p>Language teacher education generally includes two strands: content (i.e. language) and method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Johnson, 2006</xref>). In this important work, Steve Walsh argues for the inclusion of a third strand on classroom discourse, and simultaneously produces a textbook for such courses. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Walsh’s (2006a)</xref> monograph appealed more clearly to researchers, this book speaks directly to language teachers and language teacher educators.</p>
<p>Walsh begins the introduction with his fundamental claim: ‘language teachers can improve their professional practice by developing a closer understanding of classroom discourse’ (p. 1). While this argument has been made before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Allwright, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Fanselow, 1988</xref>), Walsh convincingly contends that the absence of attention to interaction in language teacher education, and the inability (or unwillingness) of classroom discourse researchers to convey results practically to teachers, represent real problems for the field. Walsh identifies interactional features he argues are important to understanding how discourse affects learning opportunities, and urges teachers, to examine classroom interaction in light of their pedagogic goals. The introduction closes with an argument for the need for: 1) interaction study in language teacher education, 2) teachers to acquire classroom interactional competence (CIC), 3) teachers to understand the relationship between methods and interaction, and 4) learners to take on a more equal interactional role. The first three of these goals are taken up in upcoming chapters, while the last appears again only in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, on the relationship between interaction and teaching, introduces the classroom as a micro-analytic context. Walsh identifies areas for improvement in teaching practice, arguing that self-awareness of interaction is essential. Chapter 3, on classroom discourse and learning, argues for a social, rather than cognitive, conception of learning. These two chapters in particular seem aimed towards teachers-in-training with prompts and tasks interspersed throughout, encouraging readers to reflect on their preconceptions about language, teaching and learning. Commentaries on each task are also included at the end of the book, and would prove useful for language teacher educators and their students.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 through 6 explore classroom discourse study, including Walsh’s own framework, Self Evaluation of Teacher Talk (SETT). Chapter 4 introduces the reader to classroom discourse research, much of which is covered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Walsh (2006a)</xref>. Chapter 5 focuses on ‘alternative’ approaches and outlines corpus linguistics (CL), combinations (e.g. CL and conversation analysis), and a variable approach which is also discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Walsh (2006a)</xref>. Chapter 6 presents SETT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Walsh, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445613476791">2006b</xref>), and the author stresses its utility for raising language teacher awareness of interaction. The practicality of classroom discourse research for teachers has been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Allwright, 2003</xref>), but Walsh makes the argument that SETT represents a tool teachers can actually use. The concepts in SETT are not overly technical, but the framework is complex enough that teachers would most likely undertake it as part of formal professional development, rather than individual action research. In addition, SETT is not meant as a tool for coding interaction and is not appropriate for all classroom interaction (e.g. small group work), and so might not be considered useful by discourse analysts. However, because Walsh is concerned here with self-awareness of teacher talk, these issues are largely irrelevant. Walsh’s intended audience here is clear: this is a framework for teachers, not researchers. By collecting snapshots of their teaching practice, he posits that teachers can develop a <italic>representative</italic> conception of interaction in their classroom, aiding in the exercise of reflective practice, the focus of Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Despite agreement that teachers need to engage in reflective practice, Walsh argues in Chapter 7 that they are often not taught <italic>how</italic> to do this. He suggests SETT as a tool for reflective practice, noting that it provides an observation framework, as well as the metalanguage required for dialogue about teaching practice. By engaging in reflection, teachers can develop CIC, the focus of Chapter 8. In this chapter, interactional competence and communicative competence are reviewed, and Walsh argues that CIC is a natural extension of these concepts, given their context-dependent nature.</p>
<p>In his conclusion, Walsh reiterates the importance of classroom discourse research, arguing not only that interaction lies at the center of everything teachers and learners <italic>do</italic> in the classroom, but also that it allows us to extend our understanding of learning itself. He makes suggestions for future classroom discourse exploration, and concludes by arguing forcefully for the inclusion of interaction study in language teacher education, and this is where his greatest contribution lies.</p>
<p>A case has been made by others that language teacher education programs are limited if they consist only of content and method; here, Walsh not only provides a rationale for the inclusion of interaction study, but also a textbook to be used in such a program. Given this dual purpose, incongruities arise, as when the audience for a chapter seems to shift between teachers-in-training and language teacher educators. If the case for interaction study did not need to be made, this monograph might be more unambiguously a textbook. However, as is, this text speaks powerfully to both teacher educators and teachers-in-training, not only guiding them through classroom discourse exploration, but reminding them every step of the way why such investigation is essential.</p>
