<p>According to the American Cancer Society, about one-half of men and one-third of all women will develop cancer during their lifetimes. Diet is linked to cancer in that eating healthy can reduce the risk of cancer, while eating increased amounts of certain foods (such as refined grains and sugars, red meat, processed meats, and alcohol) increases the risk of developing cancer. Cancer and cancer treatment can result in loss of lean body mass. Furthermore, nutrition treatment for individuals with cancer may require specialized nutrition support via the enteral or parenteral route. This issue, devoted to nutrition and cancer, is being released in October, Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
<p>Our first article this month is an Invited Commentary by Mary Marian. Ms Marian discusses cancer risk and the continuum of cancer survival while introducing nutrition issues related to cancer risk and treatment. The article by Drs Huhmann and August reviews recommendations for perioperative nutrition support in cancer patients. The authors discuss how cancer patients should undergo nutrition assessment, which patients should receive nutrition support, what nutrition therapy is considered optimal, when feedings should be started, and what effect glycemic control has on this patient group. Readers should also listen to an interview with these authors on their article in a podcast found on the <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>) website. Because lean body mass loss is a predictor of poor outcomes in many disease states, Dr Tsai, in her article, discusses the types and causes of lean body mass loss in cancer as well as effects of muscle wasting and appropriate interventions to treat losses.</p>
<p>The next several articles address nutrient and food factors influencing cancer risk. Dr Miller and Snyder summarize the effects of phytochemicals on cancer. The authors summarize information on each of the following compounds: carotenoids, phytosterols, isothiocyanates, chlorophyll, and phytoestrogens. One of the tables in this article is a comprehensive summary of each phytochemical, its dietary sources, and mechanisms of action. The next article by Vargas and Thompson looks specifically at the role of diet in colorectal cancer. The authors classify several dietary factors as having convincing, probable, or limited evidence supporting an association with colorectal cancer. They also outline practical dietary recommendations to lower the risk of colorectal cancer, such as limiting intake of red and processed meats, avoiding charring or blackening of meat when cooking, limiting alcohol intake, and increasing dietary plant fiber. Colonic health and cancer risk with regard to microbiota is the topic of the next article by Drs Vipperla and O’Keefe. The authors discuss how colonic microbiota processes can be disturbed, causing dysbiosis, and contribute to diseases such as autoimmune disorders, allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. In the next article, Dr Thomson reviews evidence linking dietary factors such as dietary fat, red and processed meat, dietary fiber, vegetables, fruit, and legumes to the risk and prevention of breast cancer. The article also addresses suggested dietary changes after breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>NCP</italic> also includes a case study of nutrition support in a patient with cancer. Ringo and Chen describe a patient who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and developed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome and was treated with enteral nutrition. Their article outlines the difficulties in treating these very ill patients. Next, the article by Habschmidt et al provides insight into nutrition practices by dietitians providing care to HSCT patients. The authors collected and analyzed survey data about nutrition support practices and dietitian order-writing privileges; their findings are presented. A final theme-related article reports on the quality-of-life issues experienced by patients with head and neck cancer who had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube to provide nutrition. The article provides insight into patients’ experience with home enteral nutrition support. The CAM Corner this month also focuses on nutrition and integrative approaches for cancer prevention.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility as nutrition professionals to encourage healthy lifestyle choices and educate the public on how nutrition can be used as prevention or treatment of cancer. This issue provides an update on nutrition and cancer prevention and also provides helpful information on providing nutrition support to individuals with cancer.</p>
