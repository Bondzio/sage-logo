They also have excellent electrical resistance and dimensional stability than thermoplastics. Thermosetting resins are reactive low-molecular-weight oligomers or high-molecular-weight polymers having reactive functional groups for cross-linking reactions. After the thermosetting process, these resins become infusible and insoluble materials due to the cross-linking reactions and are irreversible. Cross-linking is responsible for providing hardness, strength, brittleness, and better dimensional stability. The curing reaction should provide not only cross-linking but also additional rigid ring structures. This becomes the base concept for high-performance thermosets.</p><p>The properties of high-performance thermosets become significantly dependent on the type of reactive functional groups. The end capping groups such as epoxy, maleimide, cyanate ester, acetylene, nadiimide, and so on are used to prepare structurally diverse thermosets having different properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954008312468352">1</xref></sup> Acetylene-terminated resins have excellent thermal and heat resistance, high service temperature, low moisture uptake, and high strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954008312468352">2</xref></sup> Propargyl-terminated resins are yet another very attractive acetylene reactive group–terminated resins.

The exotherm of its uncatalysed curing starts at around 200°C with a maximum at 275°C and ends at 325°C. There is no characteristic change that occurred in the melting point of the BPEBPA and its copper blends. In the FTIR results the authors mentioned that blending of different copper salts with BPEBPA is not affecting the IR absorption bands pertaining to BPEBPA, indicating negligible interaction in the blended materials. The change that was observed in the Δ<italic>H<sub>f</sub></italic> values for the pure BPEBPA and the BPEBPA/Cu salt blends provided good evidence for the interactions set in between BPEBPA and copper salts during heating. Especially, BCS, BCC, and BCA are having low Δ<italic>H<sub>f</sub></italic> values. The interaction differed with the nature of copper salts added into BPEBPA. Except BCO, all other copper salts affect the curing process of the BPEBPA. According to thermodynamics, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the melting transition of a sample is zero as it is an equilibrium phenomenon. Hence, from the melting point (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>) and the heat of fusion (Δ<italic>H<sub>f</sub></italic>), it is possible to calculate the entropy change (Δ<italic>S</italic>) associated with the melting. The calculated Δ<italic>S</italic> values are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008312468352">Table 1</xref>. From the values, it is possible to say that the copper sulphate pentahydrate blended with BPEBPA system is showing a minimum change in ΔS value, indicating more orderliness than the other systems investigated. From the DSC curves it is observed that the onset curing temperatures of BC1 and BC2 are shifted to lower temperatures of 164 and 179°C, respectively, which are considerably earlier than pure BPEBPA. The curing temperature of these blends ends at 325°C. Whereas the onset curing temperature of BCS, BCC, and BCA starts at 189, 186, and 205°C, respectively, and ends at around 335°C. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954008312468352">Figure 3</xref>, of all the copper salts investigated except the curve for copper oxide all other copper salts addition to BPEBPA show nearly three stages of curing and all of them overlap each other. It indicates that the presence of copper salts in the molten BPEBPA alters the nature of thermal curing mechanism of the BPEBPA and in the temperature region 265–280°C all the materials show exothermic reactions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954008312468352">Figure 4</xref> provides detailed information about the possible isomerisation reactions of the propargyl group and rearrangements during the process of curing. Douglas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954008312468352">10</xref></sup> and Kolb et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954008312468352">5</xref></sup> reported the existence of rearrangement of BPEBPA during curing, resulting in the formation of mono- and di-2H-1-benzopyran (also called as chromene) in an uncatalysed system. The rate of formation of isomers and the isomers undergoing rearrangements differ, leading to the resultant change in the rate of polymerisation process. The presence of copper salts is influencing both the rates of isomerisation and polymerisation. This is exemplified in the pattern of the DSC curves that were recorded. Thus, the presence of copper salts in the molten matrix of BPEBPA definitely alters the curing mechanism since the rate of isomerisation of BPEBPA and hence the rate of polymerisation or curing is dependent on the nature of the copper salt. Lucotte et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954008312468352">15</xref></sup> studied 1, 2-bis (3-propargyloxyphenoxy) ethane blends with 1% of cupric chloride and cupric sulphate salts. They reported that the incorporation of 1% of cupric chloride and cupric sulphate significantly shifts the onset temperature to the lower region and concluded that the catalytic amount of such cupric salts were efficient to modify the thermal behaviour of the reaction. From the above results, the incorporation of various copper salts was highly efficient to modify the thermal behaviour of the reaction. The observed Δ<italic>H<sub>c</sub></italic> value of BPEBPA seemed to be slightly modified for all of its blends but the parameter is reduced by the presence of BC2. In contradiction, the values of Δ<italic>H<sub>c</sub></italic> increases in the BCS, BCC, and BCA systems. Whereas there is no characteristic change in endotherm and exotherm for BPEBPA blends with BCO.

In the above cases, blending of copper salts with BPEBPA certainly enhances the degradation of thermally cured BPEBPA and it may be due to the diffusion of salts into the polymer matrix. The different levels of isomerisation and polymerisation of BPEBPA associated with the nature of the copper salt blended to BPEBPA as evidenced by the DSC studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954008312468352">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008312468352">Table 1</xref>) prove the possible variation in the final architecture of the thermoset produced.

The above results confirm the effect of copper salts on the degradation reactions. The relative peak magnitudes and the peak shapes obtained in the TG thermograms indicate that the presence of Cu salts could change the degradation mechanisms of the pure BPEBPA.

This hints that the final network structure formed from blending the copper salts with BPEBPA is definitely different from the structure of pure polyBPEBPA. For all the materials investigated, the evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> and CO follows the same trend except for the sample BC1. Here the intensity of released CO<sub>2</sub> and CO gradually increases then decreases and then increases. The peak pertaining to the ether product (–O–CH<sub>2</sub>) obtained from the degradation of propargyl ethers is overlapping with the peak particular for the compounds having C=C units in the materials BC1, BC2, and BCO. The release of these products from BCS, BCC, and BCA is distinctly seen in the temperature region at 350–580°C. It indicates the difference in the architecture of the network structure formed due to the influence of the added copper salt.

Different copper salts (1%) were incorporated into BPEBPA and thermally cured. The conversion of propargyl group into chromene was confirmed by FTIR studies. The DSC studies showed that the presence of copper salts alters the exotherm cure. This helps in processing the BPEBPA marginally at lower temperature than that of pure BPEBPA. The rate of formation of isomers and the isomers undergoing rearrangements differ leading to the resultant change in the rate of polymerisation process. The rates of isomerisation and polymerisation were influenced by the presence of copper salts in BPEBPA. The presence of copper salt in the cured BPEBPA alters the degradation as evidenced by the thermogravimetric studies. Among the different copper salts investigated, BCS increases the thermal stability and other salts decrease the thermal stability of the polymer. This leads to the BPEBPA/Cu interface resulting from the preferential adsorption of copper surface that can cause different degradation behaviour from the pure BPEBPA. TG-FTIR studies of cured BPEBPA showed the evolution of phenols, substituted phenols, ethers, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO from polyBPEBPA. The thermally cured BPEBPA with various copper salts blended liberates similar products but the intensity of released products is varied. The results prove that the final structure of cured pure BPEBPA and cured BPEBPA with copper salts is different. As thermosets obtained bispropargyl ether is hydrophophic, they are finding applications in the areas like coatings, adhesives, microelectronics, and fibre-reinforced polymer composite structures for aerospace applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors express their sincere thanks to the Management and Principal of Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, S.P.G.C.
