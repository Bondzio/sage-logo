<p>We are very pleased to offer members of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) the opportunity to choose an electronic-only subscription to <italic>Veterinary Pathology</italic>. We believe that this option provides value because of member concern for environmental sustainability and because some do not have office space for stacks of journals. This initiative is facilitated by the new mobile-optimized <italic>Veterinary Pathology</italic> website, where members can download full articles onto tablet devices or smartphones (not to mention desktop or laptop computers). This subscription option has been made available through a collaboration of SAGE with journal and ACVP staff. The details provided below indicate how to elect this option.</p>
<p>When ACVP members select the option to receive the journal online only, they will no longer receive printed issues. To go paperless, please contact Molly Vanderlin at mvanderlin@acvp.org. She will make sure that your next issue of the journal is available in paperless format.</p>
<p>As always, the electronic version of <italic>Veterinary Pathology</italic> is available through SAGE Journals Online for ACVP members and subscribers. If you have not activated your account, please follow the steps below:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Go to the SAGE Journals Online site: https://online.sagepub.com/cgi/activate/basic.</p>
</list-item>
