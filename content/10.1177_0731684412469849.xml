<p>Several thin sandwich panels (thickness close to 3 mm) of different configurations were studied to explore an alternative material for the outer body of various machines and appliances such as automobile, refrigerator, washing machine, lathe machine, drill press, cupboards, light furniture, etc. Three types of sandwich panels with the outer face sheets made of glass fabric/epoxy were fabricated for the present study: (1) XM-Core panel was made of polyester foam Coremat XM/epoxy as core material, (2) Xi-Core panel was made of polyester foam Coremat Xi/epoxy as core material, and (3) J-Core Panel was made of layers of Jute fabric/epoxy as core material. A very thin transition layer of glass chopped strand mat/epoxy was provided between the face sheets and the core to improve their bonding strength. The sandwich panels were analyzed for low velocity normal impact loading under a drop weight impact test set up and transverse static loading under universal testing machine. Damage area, indentation depth and permanent depression over damage area, and failure modes were observed under incident impact loading. The transverse static test was performed to observe load versus deflection relation and to characterize the flexural strength and stiffness.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412469849" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The outer body of most of the machines and appliances such as automobile, refrigerator, washing machine, lathe machine, drill press, cupboards, light furniture etc. are either made of metals that are heavy or polymers whose strength and stiffness are very low. Thin sheets of mild steel (MS) having thickness close to 0.8 mm are widely used in many of the above applications. They are heavy, they require high tooling cost, their design flexibility is poor, and they require high repair cost if damaged. Thus, there is need to develop light weight, strong, and attractive materials suitable for preparing outer body of various machines and appliances.</p>
<p>Polymer composite materials are usually used in the form of monocoque structures. The monocoque structure is heavy and expensive. To overcome these limitations, sandwich structures are being developed which are relatively lighter in weight and less expensive. In sandwich structure, the load bearing face sheets are separated with low density material, known as core. The most common types of core materials include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam, polyurethane (PU) foam, honeycombs, polyester foam Coremat etc. Most of the sandwich panels used presently are thick and are not as suitable as thin sandwich panels with thickness less than 5 mm for making outer body of machines.</p>
<p>The polyester foam Coremats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412469849">1</xref></sup> are available as thin sheets of 1–3 mm thickness, are very light weight, and are easy to use as core material. However, the resin is dispersed through the micro holes of Coremat making core significantly heavier than foam. But Coremat/resin core is much lighter than the corresponding portion of a monocoque laminate. The Coremat sheets conform easily on most curved surfaces. For a double curvature surface with high curvatures, appropriate cuts can be easily made in the Coremat in such a way that it wraps the curved surface. The laminates employing jute fabric core are also viable materials as far as cost and strength are concerned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412469849">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412469849">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many investigators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412469849">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412469849">14</xref></sup> worked on the behavior of thick sandwich panels made of different core materials such as PVC foam, PU foam, PP honeycomb, nomex honeycomb, aluminium honeycomb, balsa, Coremat, jute etc.</p>
<p>Investigators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412469849">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412469849">23</xref></sup> worked on the monocoque structures made of glass fibers, carbon fibers, or Kevlar fibers. Impact damage on composite plates has received considerable attention of researchers and results of many investigators are available in the literature, Lopez-Puente et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412469849">16</xref></sup> Cantwell and Morton,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412469849">17</xref></sup> Dorey et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412469849">18</xref></sup> and Kumar and Rai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412469849">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref></sup> used different kinds of impactors and specimens to study the impact behavior of monocoque structures of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Various kinds of failure mechanisms are identified within the damage area of an impacted panel in fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates such as delamination, fiber breakage, matrix cracking, matrix crushing, and fiber pull-out. Naik and Nemani,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412469849">21</xref></sup> carried out static test on a plate of monocoque structure, clamped at its all edges and loaded in the center. The delamination is the most ominous in the reduction of the compressive, bending, and buckling strengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412469849">24</xref></sup> because the separation of the plies reduces the laminate stiffness.</p>
<p>Although thin sandwich panels are now being used in industrial products such as in automobiles made for racing, they have hardly been characterized so far.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412469849">25</xref></sup> The objective of the present work is to characterize three kinds of thin sandwich panels made of glass fabric/epoxy as outer face sheet. The damage area and permanent depression over damage area, caused by an impactor under low velocity normal impact, are investigated. The panels are also characterized for flexural behavior through a three-point flexural test and response of lateral loading on a square specimen clamped at all four edges. Since the aim of this study is to explore alternative material for MS sheets used for enclosures of various machines and appliances, the properties of thin MS sheets are also compared with those of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) sandwich sheets.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0731684412469849" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<sec id="sec3-0731684412469849"><title>Development of sandwich panels</title>
<p>Three types of sandwich panels, made of woven glass fabric (GF) outer face sheets, were fabricated for the present study: (1) XM-Core Panel which consists of core as polyester foam Coremat XM (2) Xi-Core Panel which consists of core as polyester foam Coremat Xi, and (3) J-Core Panel which consists of core as two layers of jute fabric. The thickness of all sandwich panels was close to 3 mm.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412469849"><title>Constituent materials</title>
<p>For reinforcing face sheets, GF was used, which was supplied by Owens Corning India, Ltd. It was balanced plain weave with 17 yarns per 25 mm along warp direction and weft direction. Its mass per unit area was 360 gsm (g/m<sup>2</sup>). A very thin transition layer of glass chopped strand mat (GCSM) was placed between GF and the core to improve the bonding strength between layers. GCSM was made of random short glass fibers and its mass per unit area was 30 gsm. The configuration of the panels was GF/GCSM/Core/GCSM/GF.</p>
<p>Three types of sandwich panels were developed by using different core materials such as, polyester foam Coremat XM, polyester foam Coremat Xi, and Jute fabric. The polyester foam Coremat XM was provided with hexagonal cell pattern and the interspaced holes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412469849">Figure 1(a)</xref>. The hexagonal cell pattern resulted in a very consistent thickness in the panel and excellent drapeablity. The distance between opposite corners of hexagonal cell was 3 mm. The porosity of foam at the walls between the cells was much higher, thus helping the dry foam to bend easily to complex shapes. Also, the resin filled into the highly porous walls helped in joining the two face sheets. Its dry mass per unit area was 96 gsm and thickness was 2 mm.<sup>1</sup> Coremat Xi, also made of polyester foam, was supplied with the interspaced holes of 1 mm diameter. Coremat Xi is very soft and pliable when it is wet and therefore very suitable for complex shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412469849">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Its dry mass per unit area was 62 gsm and thickness 2 mm.<sup>1</sup> However, no hexagonal cell pattern was provided to Coremat Xi. It was supplied with slightly bigger holes than that of the holes in Coremat XM. During fabrication of the sandwich structure, the resin filled these holes, thus generating the columnar structure between the two face sheets. The epoxy was used as the matrix material for impregnating the face sheets and the core material of the sandwich panel. The density of resin impregnated Coremat XM and Coremat Xi were 500 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and 512 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Woven jute fabric of mass per unit area 368 gsm was used. Thermosetting epoxy resin L12 and the room temperature hardener K6 were supplied by Atul Ltd., Balsad, Gujarat, India.

<sec id="sec5-0731684412469849"><title>Mass per unit area</title>
<p>One of the main objectives of this study was to develop light weight sheet materials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412469849">Figure 2</xref> shows mass per unit area of all three sandwich panels and it is compared with that of 0.8 mm thick MS sheet which is used for making the cover of various machines. The mass per unit area of Coremat-based sandwich panels, XM-Core and Xi-Core, were nearly 50% less than that of 0.8-mm thick MS sheet while the mass per unit area of J-Core panel was nearly 40% less than that of 0.8-mm thick MS sheet.

<sec id="sec6-0731684412469849"><title>Test methods</title>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412469849"><title>Impact loading</title>
<p>The impact test was performed by referring journal papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412469849">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412469849">26</xref></sup> All the three types of sandwich panels and 0.8-mm thick MS sheet were studied under normal impact loading with an impactor having incident impact energy of 24 J, 18 J, 12 J, and 6 J. The loading was performed on the plate specimen of dimensions 168 mm × 168 mm clamped at all edges by the fixture. The fixture consists of two thick and rigid MS square-shaped frames clamped with the help of 16 M8 cap screws. Thus, all the four edges of the specimen plate were clamped quite rigidly. The central unsupported area of the plate was 150 mm × 150 mm. The specimen fixture was supported through four M12 leveling bolts in such a way that specimen plate could be leveled with a leveler. A polymer seamless vertical tube with smooth interior surface was used to guide the impactor during its fall. A MS cylindrical impactor with spherical head and of length 200 mm, diameter 30 mm, and mass 1.084 kg was dropped and guided within the seamless tube to have a normal impact on the plate specimen. The impactor was not allowed to make second or multiple impacts on specimen. These impact tests simulated the dropping of tools and light objects on thin sandwich panels with moderate mass (1.084 kg) and moderate impact velocity (between 3.32 m/s and 6.65 m/s).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0731684412469849"><title>Three-point bending test</title>
<p>The three-point bending test was conducted as per ASTM D 790 on a universal testing machine (UTM). The sandwich specimens of dimensions 90 mm × 20 mm were used for the test. The span length (L) between the supporting rollers was 62 mm. The span to thickness ratio (L/t) was controlled to be close to 16. The schematic of the three-point flexural test is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412469849">Figure 3</xref>, which consists of one upper central loading roller and two base rollers, each of diameter 25 mm. A load cell of 2 kN was used at the loading rate of 1 mm/min.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0731684412469849"><title>Static plate test</title>
<p>The test was performed on each kind of sandwich panel and 0.8 mm thick MS sheet by referring the journal paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412469849">21</xref></sup> The plate specimen of dimensions 168 mm x 168 mm was clamped at all edges by the fixture. The unsupported area of the plate was 150 mm x 150 mm. A cylindrical punch attached to cross-head of UTM was used for the transverse central loading. The front end of punch was made hemispherical but the tip was made flat of diameter 10 mm to suppress high stress concentration in the specimen plate. The transverse central loading was carried out on UTM at the rate of 0.1 mm/min.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0731684412469849"><title>Numerical analysis</title>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412469849"><title>Impact loading</title>
<p>Finite element analysis of a normal impact on a panel was simulated by HYPERMESH and LS-DYNA software. The finite element model was generated in HYPERMESH and solved by LS-DYNA. The steel impactor was modeled with 8-node brick elements, using the isotropic elastic material model. The impactor was simulated to move along z-direction by assigning the incident velocity of a normal impact.The different layers of sandwich panel were modeled with the shell section, using the orthotropic elastic material model. The elastic properties of different layers are as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412469849">Table 1</xref>. For determining the elastic modulus along fiber directions of face sheets (<italic>E<sub>x</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sub>y</sub></italic>), which play dominating role in the analysis, monocoque laminate was fabricated using same procedure as used for the sandwich panels. The tensile tests were performed to obtain the modulus. Similar procedure was adopted to determine tensile properties of the resin impregnated Coremat foam and jute core. The other elastic constants were estimated either using Helpin-Tsai equations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412469849">27</xref></sup> or the results of other investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412469849">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412469849">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412469849">28</xref></sup> The material of all layers of a sandwich panel was considered as a continuum and was discretized into shell elements. The size of element was 1.875 mm x 1.875 mm. Since the square-shaped specimen was clamped at all four sides during impact loading, the translation of all the boundary nodes was equated to zero and rotation of all the boundary elements was also equated to zero.

<p>In the simulation, the impact started with the impactor touching the composite plate (point to surface contact) and progressed to a surface-to-surface contact. In LS-DYNA, a contact algorithm ‘automatic surface-to-surface’ was employed to simulate the contact between the impactor and sandwich specimen, and also between the adjacent layers of specimen.

<p>The damage area of all three kinds of impacted sandwich panels was studied. At higher impact energy of 24 J and impact velocity 6.65 m/s, the sandwich specimens were partially penetrated, so the analysis was restricted to low impact energy of 6 J, 12 J, and 18 J. The damage area was seen against a strong source of light to determine overall damage area of sandwich panels under experimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412469849">Figure 4</xref>). The extent of delamination estimated by the numerical simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412469849">Figure 4</xref> with a dashed line. The estimated damage was found to be quite close to the experimentally observed damage area. The average overall damage area of three sandwich panels each at impact energy 6 J, 12 J, and 18 J are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412469849">Figure 5</xref>. The average overall damage area of XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, and J-Core Panel was 650 mm<sup>2</sup>, 418 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 134 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, at 6 J impact energy. It was increased to 805 mm<sup>2</sup>, 840 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 623 mm<sup>2</sup> for XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, and J-Core Panel, respectively, at 12 J impact energy. The average overall damage area was further increased to 1027 mm<sup>2</sup>, 1026 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 869 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, at 18 J impact energy. The damage area of XM-Core Panel and Xi-Core Panel was almost same at all the three impact energies. The damage area of J-Core specimen was substantially lower at low impact energy of 6 J but was comparable to those of XM-Core and Xi-Core specimen for higher impact energy of 12 J and 18 J.

<p>As the laminate structure is susceptible to delamination under impact loading,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412469849">24</xref></sup> some data related to overall damage area of monocoque structure under impact loading is compared with thin sandwich panels under study. The overall damage area of monocoque structures and sandwich structures at various impact energies is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412469849">Figure 6</xref>. Lopez-Puente et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412469849">16</xref></sup> used CFRP laminate of 1.6 mm thickness made of eight layers plain woven AGP-193-PW/8552 (AS4 fiber) and Kumar and Rai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref></sup> used CFRP laminates having nominal thickness of 3 mm for the impact analysis under air gun set up. Cantwell and Morton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412469849">17</xref></sup> analysed 2 mm thick CFRP laminate manufactured from (±45°) sheets of pre-impregnated Grafil XA-S fibers in Ciba-Geigy BSL 914 C epoxy under drop weight impact test set up. Also, monocoque GFRP structure made of eight layers of glass fabric having thickness close to 3 mm was fabricated using the same procedure as used for sandwich panels and tested against 6 J, 12 J, and 18 J impact energies. The damage area in thin sandwich panels was higher than that in monocoque structures because the interlaminar shear strength between the face sheet and core of the sandwich panels was lower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412469849">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412469849">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412469849">28</xref></sup> However, the damage area due to delamination in sandwich panels is not substantially higher than that of monocoque structure. The damage area of sandwich panel is within the comparable range. In these sandwich panels, being developed as semi-structural enclosure material, the damage area for high impact energy of 18 J is only about the diameter of 35 mm, which may be tolerated. The impact is sub-penetration and the flatness of the panel is not affected much as discussed towards the later portion of this section.

<p>To study the delamination between face sheet and core, debonding between glass fibers and matrix, and failure of the core, an impacted sandwich specimen was dissected into eight sectors around the center of impact. A thin diamond cutter of 0.3 mm thickness was used to cut the panel at high speed and extremely low feed rate. The cut section was polished using emery paper of various grades in the sequence 800, 1000, and 1200. The delamination between face sheet and core, crack in the core were measured on the cross section. The cut pieces showed that no delamination occurred between the GF ply and GCSM ply in both the face sheets, the front and rear. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412469849">Figure 7</xref> shows the following: (1) the delamination between front face sheet and core, (2) failure of core, and (3) delamination between core and the rear face sheet for impact at 18 J impact energy for all three kinds of thin sandwich panels. The delamination was observed to be largest on the rear interface for all the three kinds of thin sandwich panels. In fact, this mode of failure dominated in the impacted panels and the overall damage area shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412469849">Figure 4</xref> was found to be same as the delamination damage.
<fig id="fig7-0731684412469849" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Experimentally observed delamination of the interfaces and damage of the core at 18 J impact loading.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412469849-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The large delamination at the rear interface was probably caused by the transverse cracks in the rear face sheet. These transverse cracks were developed around the center of impact due to tensile stresses caused by the bending of the target plate under the impact load. The transverse crack, moving towards the core, turned into relatively weak interface between the rear face sheet and core, thus causing large delamination. The rear face sheet within damage area separated out of its plane. This is known as the spalling effect and was commonly observed in impact tests reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412469849">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref></sup> In comparison to Xi-Core specimen, the spalling effect was observed to be less prominent in case of XM-Core specimen. This was due to the structure of Coremat XM which connected the front and rear face sheets better due to filling of epoxy in the highly porous hex-walls of the foam core. However, at low impact energy of 6 J and 12 J, the spalling effect on rear face sheet was much less. By numerical simulation, the fiber breakage on rear face sheet was predicted at 18 J; however, no fiber breakage was predicted at 6 J and 12 J energies. Similar results were obtained in experimentation.</p>
<p>The delamination on the front interface was observed to be much smaller in all three kinds of panel. In XM-Core panel and Xi-Core panel, the delamination was circular as the core was transversely isotropic. But in J-core panel, the delamination was more in the fiber direction of jute fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412469849">Figure 7</xref>). This observation is consistent with delamination in monocoque laminates impacted normally with foreign body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412469849">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The jute core of J-Core specimen failed through transverse cracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412469849">Figure 8(a)</xref>). The jute core sandwich panel was similar to monocoque structures as the core was reinforced by jute fibers. The delamination crack at the interface on the impact side moved to the delamination crack at the interface on rear side at diverging angle through jute core, as commonly observed in the impact damage of monocoque panels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412469849">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412469849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412469849">24</xref></sup> However, no failure due to shear stress at the mid-plane was observed because the shear strength of two-layered jute fabric core was high, of the order of 14 MPa.<sup>2</sup> The damage was significant in the polyester foam of Xi-Core panel. The core failed at its mid-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412469849">Figure 8(b)</xref>); the failure was more like a delamination crack although there was no interface at the mid-plane. The fracture took place because high shear stress was generated at the mid-plane due to bending of panel caused by the impact. The shear strength of the polyester foam Coremat Xi was estimated as 4.1 MPa by conducting a tensile test of Coremat-epoxy panel and taking one half of the tensile strength. The average value of extent of the core failure at the mid-plane was experimentally measured as 5.7 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412469849">Figure 8(b)</xref>) from the center of impact. These values match well with the numerical analysis which showed that at an average distance of 6.7 mm from center of impact, the average shear stress generated was 5 MPa. However, negligible damage was observed in the core of XM-Core specimen as its mid-plane was stronger due to the presence of epoxy-rich hexagonal wall structure between the face sheets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412469849">25</xref></sup>

<p>The indentation is deepest at the center of impact in thin sandwich panels and MS sheets. In addition, an impact causes permanent depression of the panel in the surrounding area. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412469849">Figure 9</xref> shows the indentation depth in thin sandwich panels and it is compared with that of 0.8-mm thick MS sheet at all energy levels 6 J, 12 J, and 18 J. The average indentation depth of XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, J-Core Panel, and MS Sheet were 0.41 mm, 0.36 mm, 0.16 mm, and 4 mm, respectively, at 6 J impact energy. It was increased for XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, J-Core Panel, and MS Sheet to 0.43 mm, 0.51 mm, 0.29 mm, and 6.5 mm, respectively, at 12 J impact energy. The average indentation depth was further increased to 0.65 mm, 0.78 mm, 0.32 mm, and 7.94 mm, respectively, at 18 J impact energy. Thus, the indentation depth was less than 1 mm for sandwich panels up to 18 J normal impact; however, it was about 8 mm for 0.8 mm thick MS Sheets.

<p>To determine permanent depression around the center of impact, the deflection was measured at number of points on the damage area of the specimens.

Although the sandwich panels bend out significantly under an impact load, it regains its shape leaving only a low depth and a small area depression. The depression depth was found to be very small, even at highest energy level of 18 J. The lateral extent of permanent depression was up to 16 mm radial distance from the center of impact. On the other hand, the permanent depression on 0.8 mm thick MS sheet was substantially larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412469849">Figure 11</xref>).

<p>Thin sandwich panels are meant for semi-structural materials required to make the enclosures of various machines. If there is damage to GFRP enclosure due to foreign body impact, it can be repaired more easily by using glass fibers wetted with epoxy as the damage is localized. On the other hand, MS sheets deform with a dent at the point of impact due to plastic deformation of the metal. The dent spoils the aesthetics of the cover of a machine. An extensive work is required to repair an impacted enclosure of MS sheet in such a way that it matches with rest of the cover.</p>

The velocity of the rebouned impactor was determined by monitoring the height to which the impactor reached using a digital camera. The accuracy of the measuring system was better than 2%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412469849">Figure 12</xref> shows the energy absorption capability of the sandwich panels and 0.8 mm thick MS sheet. The energy absorbed by the sandwich panels was about 27.8% and that of MS sheet was 85.6% at 6 J impact energy. It was increased for the sandwich panels and MS sheet to about 41.2% and 90.7%, respectively, at 12 J impact energy. The energy absorbed was further increased to 58.3% and 93.1% at 18 J impact energy. The energy absorbed by the sandwich panels was dissipated in two ways: (1) to cause various failures like matrix cracking, delamination, fiber breakage, etc. and (2) to make the specimen vibrate back and forth with eventual energy dissipation through the normal vibration damping. In sandwich panels, the local damage around the center of impact was small, while MS plate was extensively damaged through plastic deformation.

The sandwich panels were vibrated due to impact. The time period of vibration mode remained almost same with the increasing impact energy. This was because the boundary conditions, geometry, and materials of the panels were not altered. As expected, the amplitude of the vibration mode increased with increasing impact energy. However, the MS sheet deflected with large plastic deformation under the impact load showing small amplitude of vibrations.

<p>Ten specimens of each type of sandwich panel were tested under three-point bending test. The load versus deflection relation of all three kinds of bend-specimens was monitored. The 10 Ton UTM was checked for its stiffness; the deflection of the three-point bending test system of UTM was found to be negligible in comparison to the deflection of the bend specimen under the low load condition of the experiment. Also, the deflections at different loads were estimated numerically by ANSYS software for these sandwich panels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684412469849">Figure 14</xref> presents the load-deflection relations of one specimen of XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, and J-Core Panel, respectively.

<p>The thin sandwich panels failed due to failure of the face sheet on the compressive side of the bend specimen under three-point bending.

The average flexural strength with standard deviation is as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684412469849">Figure 16</xref>. The average flexural strength of XM-Core Panel, Xi-Core Panel, and J-Core Panel were 351 MPa, 321 MPa, and 330 MPa, respectively.

<p>In the three-point flexural set up, all specimens of this study failed on the upper face sheet where the compressive stress was generated due to the bending moment. No signs of any failure were observed on the tensile side of the specimen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684412469849">Figure 17</xref> shows a micrograph of scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the failed face sheet on the compressive side. An extensive damage was observed in the face sheet that was reinforced with the balance fabric of the glass fibers. The figure shows fibers breakage, matrix failure, and debonding between fibers and matrix. In addition, the figure shows that the fibers in the compressive direction failed at multiple points. The study under SEM and the observation of the failed surface through a low magnification optical microscope suggested that a strand buckled and failed between the two cross-strands. The failure of fibers of the cross strands were hardly observed as they were not loaded in the three-point bend set up.

The results of other specimens were similar. The load-deflection relation of thin sandwich panels was found to be linear at low deflection but was found to be non-linear at high deflection of the specimen plate. The load versus deflection curve obtained by experimental and numerical analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684412469849">Figure 18</xref>. The numerically determined relations justified the non-linear behavior between load and deflection obtained through experiments.

<p>The numerical analysis showed that at the critical load, the tensile stress of 441 MPa was induced, exceeding the tensile strength of GF/epoxy face sheet. The compressive stresses on the front face sheet were 313 MPa along 0° and 90° directions at the critical load. They were significantly smaller than the tensile stresses on rear face sheet because of in-plane tensile load developed due to rigid clamping of specimen edges. Naik and Nemani<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412469849">21</xref></sup> also found significantly smaller stress on compressive side of GF/epoxy monocoque plate when rigidly clamped at outer edges. At the critical load, the fibers of the rear face sheet were extensively broken due to high tensile stresses in all the three kinds of sandwich panels. The breakage was seen more in 0° and 90° directions of the face sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0731684412469849">Figure 19</xref>). The ends of broken fibers came out of the surface plane making the damage look quite prominent. On the front face near the center where the punch pressed the panel, the damage was extensive with fiber breakage, delamination, and failure of core. However, beyond the contact surface between the punch and specimen, the damage was found to occur through debonding between fibers and matrix. The debonding was more prominent along 0° and 90° directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0731684412469849">Figure 19</xref>). The compressive stresses in the front face sheet were smaller than that in rear face sheet as determined through numerical analysis, but they were high enough to cause the debonding.

</fig></p>
<p>When the failure of plate test specimen was compared with the failure of three-point bend specimen, the mode of failure was found to be different. In the strip specimen of three-point bend test, the fibers on compressive side were buckled easily due to availability of free edges of the specimen and deformation through single curvature. In static plate test, buckling of fibers was not observed because there were no free edges in the damaged zone and the material was constrained due to deformation occurring through double curvature.</p>
<p>As explained by the numerical analysis, the non-linear load-deflection relation was the combined effect of in-plane tensile load developed as the edges of specimen were rigidly clamped and the non-linear stress–strain material behavior of the face sheet material at high deflection. On the other hand, the MS sheet, as expected, yielded at a very early stage, it then plastically deformed with increasing lateral load. Since the edges of MS plate were clamped, in-plane tension developed in the specimen resulting into high slope of load versus deflection curve.</p>

<p>Three types of thin sandwich panels made with the face sheets of GF/epoxy and core as polyester foam Coremat Xi, polyester foam Coremat XM, and jute were studied for impact loading under drop weight impact test set up and transverse static loading on UTM. They were studied to explore an alternative skin material for many practical applications like automobile body, cover of machines such as washing machine, refrigerator, lathe machine, drill press, etc.</p>
<p>Under low velocity impact loading, the overall damage zone in all the three sandwich panels was not substantially higher than the damage on monocoque panels. The damage area was only about the diameter of 35 mm at high-impact energy level of 18 J, which may be tolerated. The major delamination was found to occur between the core and the rear face sheet. The impact was sub-penetration and the flatness of the panel was not affected much. The permanent depression was less than 1 mm and spread up to 16 mm radial distance from the center of impact even at the high impact energy of 18 J.</p>
<p>Three-point bending test was performed on sandwich panels to characterize the flexural strength and stiffness. The load versus deflection relation was linear up to failure for all the three kinds of sandwich panels and the specimen failed due to failure of the face sheet on the compressive side of bend specimen. The strands of fibers along the length of specimen buckled between the two cross strands of the fabric reinforcement.</p>
<p>Under static transverse loading of square-shaped sandwich plate, clamped at all edges, load-deflection curve of sandwich panels was non-linear because of the in-plane stresses generated in the face sheets of the sandwich plates due to rigid clamping at all four edges and the non-linear stress–strain material behavior of the face sheet material at high deflection. At the critical load, fibers on the rear face sheet were extensively broken due to high tensile stresses. On the front face sheet, the compressive stresses were smaller than that in rear face, but high enough to cause debonding between the fibers and matrix.</p>
