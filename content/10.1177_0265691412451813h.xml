<p>The mobilization of the nation-in-arms during the French Revolution has long been a subject of fascination for historians. In this volume, Alan Forrest brings his not inconsiderable expertise to a broad spectrum of modern French history, tracing the legacy of the Revolutionary Wars from the 1790s to the present day. In so doing, he provides a much-needed analysis of the wider impact of the nation-in-arms upon French society. Forrest offers a chronologically-structured synthesis, situating the idea of the nation-in-arms at the heart of the modern French political state and suggesting that it was rooted in notions of equality and citizenship.</p>
<p>According to legend, the army of Year II fought more bravely than its enemies and predecessors because its patriotism was genuine, and it did not suffer from poor morale because men sought to defend their own homes and rights. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the soldier of Year II became the depoliticized, acceptable symbol of an intensely divisive age. Under the monarchist restoration of the early nineteenth century, the very different armies of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars became conflated in a popular memory that was nostalgic for a time when France controlled much of continental Europe. Only with the transformation of warfare by technological developments did the legend lose its relevance.</p>
<p>While changes to the French army were introduced out of necessity during the crises of the revolutionary period, the reforms were presented in ideological terms, as part of the struggle for liberty and social justice. Republicans reasoned that the nation as sovereign authority was entitled to ask its citizens to perform their duty in undertaking military service. The rise of Napoleon brought significant changes to the army, yet the emperor used propaganda not merely to capitalize upon his military successes, but also to bind the army’s loyalty to the regime by celebrating the heroism of ordinary soldiers. As the Napoleonic Wars dragged on, the army grew progressively less like the revolutionary legend, relying upon conscripts, and comprising increasing numbers of foreign soldiers. However, Forrest argues, the legend of the nation-in-arms lived on because public perceptions were shaped by festivals and cultural representations. The image that endured in posterity was one of communities mobilizing to defend their homes and of war as a national crusade.</p>
<p>After his fall, a new image of Napoleon began to emerge in which he was presented as the legitimate heir to the revolution of 1789 and a liberal enemy of the restoration monarchy. The new regime viewed the army as a hotbed of radicalism, rejecting ideas of the nation-in-arms by slashing its numbers down to a small conscripted force. Napoleon III upheld monarchist views on the desirability of maintaining a small, professional army, only belatedly conceding the need for a mass force based upon compulsory military service.</p>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War was a turning-point in reviving France’s revolutionary traditions. Republicans duly sought to emulate the past sacrifices of the French people for the Republic. After the experiences of the Paris Commune of 1871, however, the arguments for conscription were renewed, and compulsory military service came to be regarded as a form of social discipline and civic instruction in duty. Yet while military education pervaded French society during the late nineteenth century, the Boulanger and Dreyfus affairs illustrated that the army’s elite had become isolated and dangerous to the survival of the Republic.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the First World War revived the legend of the nation-in-arms, but the conflict was radically different from any that had gone before. Daily encounters with death rendered soldiers impervious to the glorious traditions of the Revolution. During the interwar years, anti-militarism and pacifism pervaded French society. When France was once again invaded in 1940, Forrest suggests that it was not so much the army that exemplified the spirit of Year II as the civilian population. The <italic>maquisards</italic> and Communist resistance in particular sought to consciously emulate the legends of the Revolutionary Wars. After the liberation, however, the depersonalized nature of the Cold War, and the Algerian nationalists’ appropriation of the nation-in-arms during the Algerian War, signalled the final death-knell for the legend of the Revolutionary Wars.</p>
<p>The opposition to the principles underpinning the nation-in-arms under the Third Republic and the controversies surrounding the reprisals against civilians for actions taken by irregular forces could perhaps have been explored further. However, these are merely minor points. This fascinating and well-written book makes a valuable contribution towards our understanding of the impact of the Revolutionary Wars upon the political culture of nineteenth- and twentieth-century France.</p>
