<abstract>
<p>Growing population diversity, referred to as ‘super-diversity’, has transformed the UK landscape, yet many areas of social science and policy appear reluctant to engage with the phenomenon. This article examines the ‘research–policy’ nexus as it applies one area of super-diversity: that is, businesses run by new migrants. Based on a year-long collaboration with a regional business support intermediary, the study investigate how policymakers, working with academics, handle the complexities that attend super-diversity in relation to enterprise. The study adopts an ‘engaged scholarship’ approach comprising participant observation and interviews with community-based intermediaries and business owners from 22 new migrant communities. It finds that policymakers and practitioners struggle to cope with the complexities that attend the processes of super-diversity. The danger of this is a perpetuation of a form of ‘ethnic managerialism’. However, by working collaboratively, academics and practitioners can deploy complementary bodies of knowledge to develop constructive intervention to support new migrant businesses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 1990s new waves of immigration have added unprecedented demographic complexity to British society. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">Vertovec (2007)</xref>, the early post-war migration pattern of replacement labour from a clearly defined handful of former colonial sending countries has been overtaken by what he calls ‘super-diversity’. New wave migrants originate from dozens of locations throughout the globe and come in myriad legal, occupational and social guises, driven by a variety of motives. The presence of such groups has transformed the social landscape of Britain, yet significant areas of social science seem surprisingly innocent of this phenomenon in their theorizing and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">Vertovec, 2007</xref>). For example, ‘mainstream’ organization and management studies rarely encompass such groups in their research agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611429979">Williams and Ram, 2010</xref>). In addition, policymakers and practitioners are struggling to engage with the complex dynamics of super-diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611429979">Sepulveda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611429979">Zetter et al., 2005</xref>): for example, new migrant communities rarely figure in debates on the role that self-employment can play in tackling social exclusion among disadvantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611429979">Ram and Jones, 2008</xref>)</p>
<p>This article examines a key manifestation of super-diversity: that is, small enterprises started up by recently arrived migrants. The focus on self-employment is apposite because it is a common strategy among migrants attempting to adjust to a new society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611429979">Ram and Jones, 2008</xref>). Our particular interest is the ‘research–policy’ nexus as it relates to new migrant business owners. Based on a year-long research collaboration with a major regional business support intermediary (which we refer to as SUPPAG), this project was designed to undertake two main tasks. First, we wanted to answer the question of whether and how the businesses created by new migrants in the complex context of super-diversity differ from those of predecessor entrepreneurial minorities. Illumination is provided here by applying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611429979">Kloosterman et al.’s (1999)</xref> mixed embeddedness perspective, a model designed to locate entrepreneurial minorities in their structural context. This approach suggests that the nature of new migrant business is shaped not only by diversity but also by migrancy: their dislocation in an alien and often difficult commercial, legal and social environment whose successful enactment requires linguistic and experiential skills which many do not yet possess. This article uses the mixed embeddedness of migrant businesses as its context for the second issue, which is its main focus.</p>
<p>In this article we examine how ‘evidence’ on new migrant businesses informs the practice of SUPPAG. Rather than one-sidedly passing on the fruits of our research to practitioners, we pursue an ‘engaged scholarship’ methodology, a ‘participative form of research for obtaining the advice and perspectives of key stakeholders (researchers, users, clients, sponsors, and practitioners) to understand a complex social problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>: 10). Such a partnership has the potential to offer a fresh, fluid approach to a policy environment long accustomed to viewing minority enterprise as a set of a priori socio-demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611429979">Janssens and Zanoni, 2005</xref>). In so doing, the article actively endeavours to address the so-called research–practitioner gap that continues to bedevil management scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611429979">Syed et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>An action research approach is adopted to pursue each of these objectives. This adds a further distinctive element to the study, since the role of theory in action research is not always made explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611429979">Dick et al., 2009</xref>), and the method’s contribution to policy development is not sufficiently recognized. Action research is an effective means of testing super-diversity because it facilitates both theoretical engagement (through mixed embeddedness) and its application in a policy context (SUPPAG). By actively working with practitioners to apply insights from mixed embeddedness and super-diversity, the action research process casts light on how policy initiatives aimed at supporting enterprise in disadvantaged communities ‘work themselves out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611429979">Rescher, 1998</xref>). This can promote policy learning, since recognition is accorded to the ‘fallible processes of craft judgement in assembling what is to be accepted as “evidence”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611429979">Sanderson, 2006</xref>: 128). Thus this study throws light on how SUPPAG constructed a view of migrant businesses, and how that view was amended through engagement with the research project.</p>

<title>Engaging super-diverse businesses</title>
<sec id="section3-0266242611429979">
<title>Conceptual developments</title>
<p>Let us begin by examining the tensions between the academic and policy contexts of super-diversity. In respect of the former, it must be recognized that new migrants and their businesses cannot be understood within the established ethnic minority framework customarily applied to their long-settled South Asian, African Caribbean and Chinese predecessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611429979">Ram and Jones, 2008</xref>). In addition to ethnic attributes such as language and country of origin, the new migrant trajectory in the UK is shaped by additional variables: notably legal status, a heavy constraint on the entitlements of refugees and asylum-seekers, restricting their access to employment and entry to business. Compared to their predecessors, new migrants are more diverse in terms of nationality, occupation and gender. In a high-mobility age of e-communication, they also tend to be transnational in orientation, often in constant contact with home countries and diasporas from which they sometimes draw business support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611429979">Smallbone et al., 2010</xref>). All these factors can influence to varying degrees both the entrepreneurial motivation and business resources necessary to put this into practice.</p>
<p>Understandably, then, Vertovec calls for ‘novel ways of understanding and responding to such complex interplays’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">2007</xref>: 1049). For much of the past few decades, entrepreneurial minorities such as South Asians in the UK have been understood in essentially ethnic terms, as beneficiaries of the competitive advantage derived from insider ethnic business support networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611429979">Janjuha-Jivraj, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, while this ethnic social capital model might have some purchase for new migrant businesses, many of its assumptions are only weakly applicable in the absence of settled, locally concentrated co-national populations. Moreover, any commercial benefits to be derived internally from community networks are powerfully overridden by the external difficulty of negotiating the alien surrounding environment. As well as the language barriers suffered by many newcomer groups, refugees for their part may be further alienated by negative experiences at the point of entry to the UK. From the practical standpoint of business support agencies, new migrants are the ultimate hard-to-reach group: not only culturally isolated, but also likely to be positively hostile to officialdom in any guise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611429979">Ram et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretically, it is clear that the balance should shift from internal group properties towards the ‘wider economic and institutional context into which immigrants are inevitably also inserted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611429979">Kloosterman et al., 1999</xref>: 257). According to this model of mixed embeddedness, the self-employed must be seen as grounded not simply in their own ethnic networks, but also in the wider world of markets and states. The close applicability of this to new migrants has been shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611429979">Ram et al.’s (2008)</xref> study of Somali firms in Leicester (a UK city of approximately 250,000 people in the Midlands), where the highly active pooling of family labour and communal capital was found to be largely ineffective in the face of poor markets in low value sectors in deprived neighbourhoods. Far from acting in an insulated bubble, community resource mobilization has to occur within a context of consumer, labour and financial markets, all of which tend to be blighted by ‘racist discriminatory practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611429979">Virdee, 2006</xref>: 625). Culturally dislocated as they are and unaided by any business support, Somalis are unable to enact this structure to obtain the mainstream markets and finance which hold the key to profitability and growth, or even to simply earn a decent living from business. Consequently, support intervention needs to be cognizant of external barriers to business development.</p>

<sec id="section4-0266242611429979">
<title>Policy challenges</title>
<p>There is now much support for the proposition that academic interaction with practitioners should endeavour more consciously to integrate the concerns of both parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611429979">Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611429979">Argyris, 1996</xref>). In principle, the benefits of such mutuality can be readily appreciated, but in practice the relationship between policy and sociologically informed research is an uneasy one: not least this is because the former’s concern with concrete practicalities tends to have little room for the nuanced ambiguities of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611429979">Rappert, 1999</xref>; see also objections by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611429979">McKelvey, 2006</xref>). Even so, there is growing awareness of the two-way benefits of integrating theory and practice, in which academia can inform practitioners and stakeholders while itself benefiting simultaneously from the expert knowledge supplied by the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611429979">Antonocopolou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611429979">Bartunek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611429979">Hodgkinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611429979">Syed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611429979">Wensley, 2007</xref>). Indeed, such interactions may be indispensable to the pursuit of ‘scholarship of social consequence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611429979">Özbilgin, 2010</xref>), especially in the present instance when scholars and support professionals alike are confronted by the unprecedented and obliged to engage in the self-same learning process.</p>
<p>While the divergent preferences of scholars and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611429979">Syed et al., 2010</xref>) are certainly a source of tension, this can be a dynamic tension, a ‘foundation for extending the range of questions they can pursue jointly, building on their respective capabilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611429979">Antonocopoulou, 2009</xref>: 427). In order to work effectively, this requires engaged scholarship that goes well beyond the confines of the research per se, and depends upon sustained and involved academic–practitioner relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). It involves grounding the research issue in practitioner and academic domains, continuous interaction with people with different views and approaches, and an active interest in addressing practitioner issues as well as advancing academic knowledge.</p>
<p>Even bearing all these caveats in mind, it is not entirely clear how the theoretical thrust of super-diversity should operate in practice. As Vertovec argues: ‘Social scientists are not very good at translating data and analysis of complexities into forms that can have an impact on policies and public practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">2007</xref>: 1047). This is especially true when, as in the present case, academic intervention comes as a direct challenge to entrenched and cherished practices. In the field of enterprise, the understanding of entrepreneurial minorities afforded by mixed embeddedness and super-diversity perspectives is not easily reconciled with the ethnic managerialism prevailing in policy circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611429979">Law, 1997</xref>). Here, the essentialist and homogenous ethnic pigeon-holing of diverse patterns of identification, needs and aspirations, combined with delegation of strategy and action to regional or local managers, leads to poor policy, provision and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611429979">Law, and Harrison, 2001</xref>). Such reductionism is further exposed by super-diversity, with its accompanying intra-group divisions, ethnically mixed individuals, families and firms.</p>
<p>In the field of ethnic minority business, managerialism takes the form of ‘government support for, and liaison with, ethnic minority organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">Vertovec, 2007</xref>: 1047), usually based in local communities. Buttressed by years of central and local state funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611429979">Keith, 1995</xref>), these intermediaries are thought to number as many as 5500 in England and Wales (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611429979">Blackburn et al., 2006</xref>) and have proliferated rapidly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611429979">Blackburn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611429979">Deakins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611429979">Ram and Smallbone, 2003</xref>). Question marks hover over these bodies, notably in respect of their failure to represent anything more than the most elementary level of diversity. Recently this one-dimensional vision of ethnicity was exposed by a study of business support in the East Midlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611429979">Ram et al., 2006</xref>), where intermediaries seemed to define their function as addressing ‘Asian’ or ‘black’ business per se, with little attention paid to special interests within these groups – women, young people, the British-born – and ignoring other communities not fitting the designated categories. Needless to say, new migrants were nowhere on the agenda. This is a problem of vested interests, since such intermediaries are perpetually engaged in a scramble for state-funding, and as such are wedded to drawing their membership from ‘recognized’ ethnic minorities. By definition, representation from new migrant communities is effectively squeezed out.</p>
<p>In summary, it is evident that the growing importance of super-diversity is being reflected in theoretical developments relating to ethnic minority enterprise. This is most notable in the deployment of mixed embeddedness and super-diversity perspectives in recent studies of new migrant businesses. However, it is unclear how the complexity that attends super-diversity is being handled by practitioners operating in business and community support. The (limited) evidence suggests that the traditional response of ethnic managerialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611429979">Law and Harrison, 2001</xref>) continues to prevail. Plainly, the challenges that policymakers face need further consideration. In the context of the present study, practitioners have been grappling with the complexities of supporting diverse communities for many years. They have been largely unaided by academic guidance, which is often abstract or even contradictory (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611429979">Ram and Jones, 2008</xref>). Researchers also face challenges in endeavouring to reconcile critical and relational perspectives on diversity with policy preferences ‘for approaches that can freeze, objectify and tame “race”/ethnicity into unitary categories that can be easily understood and managed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611429979">Gunaratnam, 2003</xref>: 34). Engaged scholarship is one response to such a challenge, and the next section discusses how this was enacted.</p>

<title>Rationale and context</title>
<p>The present study adopted an action research approach because of its twin objectives of facilitating change and advancing knowledge, which fits well with the ambition to engage actively with the process of super-diversity in a specific context. Action research, an approach first associated with the work of the social psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1940s, has been a valuable – if somewhat neglected – approach to management research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611429979">Cassell and Johnson, 2006</xref>). There are a range of definitions for action research and its variants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611429979">Cassell and Johnson, 2006</xref> for extended discussions), but the approach adopted here is that offered by Winter and Munn-Giddings:
<disp-quote>
<p>Action research is the study of a social situation carried out by those involved in that situation in order to improve their practice and quality of their understanding. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611429979">2001</xref>: 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is an approach that contains three key features:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242611429979" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>an intent to take action on an organizational or policy issue;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an explicit concern with theory formed from characterizing or conceptualizing the particular experience – this differentiates it from a pure consultancy intervention; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a process of continual reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611429979">Eden and Huxham, 1996</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each of these core elements of action research has implications for the methods and nature of engaged scholarship with practitioners (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611429979">Table 1</xref>). The organizational issue was clearly SUPPAG’s intention to engage with new migrant businesses in its catchment area. SUPPAG is a joint venture formed by local Chambers of Commerce to deliver the Business Link service across a particular English region. It reflects the English approach, where a regionally devolved decision-making structure allows regional support organizations, called Business Link, to develop different local support strategies within a national policy framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611429979">Mole et al., 2011</xref>). The Business Link system has been subject to successive waves of restructuring and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611429979">Bennett, 2008</xref>). At the time of the study Regional Development Agencies, rather than national government, had assumed responsibility for Business Link. The key function of this latest iteration of Business Link is that of a brokered service provider.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242611429979">1</xref></sup> This is SUPPAG’s core purpose: according to company materials, its responsibility is to ‘deliver the business support strategy of the region through its Information, Diagnostic and Brokerage (IDB) service’. More than 200 people are employed to deliver this service to small firms in the region. Like many of its counterparts in other regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611429979">Ram and Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611429979">Sepulveda et al., 2011</xref>) SUPPAG did not have a clearly articulated strategy to supporting ethnic minority and new migrant businesses.</p>

<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>SUPPAG lacked knowledge of the dynamics of the new migrant business community in the region, their business support needs and practical interventions aimed at such groups. Our role was to work with SUPPAG on each of these areas. The engaged nature of the research was reflected in the formal institutional arrangements of the project. In particular, the proposal for the project was developed collaboratively between the researchers and SUPPAG. However, the data-gathering process was not settled in advance; rather, it was negotiated with participants as the inquiry developed. This is demonstrated in our unanticipated interactions with new migrant intermediary organizations, with which we conducted 21 interviews; and five focus groups with business owners. In each of these exercises, the aim was to give
<disp-quote>
<p>voice to differing perspectives. Hence, gathering data needs to go beyond simply ‘asking questions’ and to include processes which encourage all participants to present details of their experience and their conceptions of desirable changes in practice.

</p>
<p>These exercises were more than simple data-gathering opportunities; they resembled ‘developmental workshops’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611429979">Winter and Munn-Giddings, 2001</xref>) in which participants outlined their views on wider issues of engagement with SUPPAG and the research team. SUPPAG and the researchers developed ongoing relationships with many of these intermediaries and business owners, thus broadening the potential ‘users’ of the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611429979">Rappert, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of theory varies in action research. Approaches range from those that emphasize empowerment and practical transformation to the advancement of more general knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611429979">Huxham and Vangen, 2003</xref>). The principal theoretical interest of this study lay in the interplay of super-diversity and mixed embeddedness. Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611429979">Sepulveda et al., 2011</xref>) that draw on super-diversity perspectives suggest that new migrant businesses are qualitatively distinct from other minority enterprises. The present study set out to test this argument by using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611429979">Kloosterman et al.’s (1999)</xref> mixed embeddedness perspective. Discussions on this approach encompassed the research team, external experts and practitioners at SUPPAG. Such exchanges on theoretical ideas are a key element of engaged scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). Our perspective informed the design of the semi-structured interview schedule – again, a collaborative accomplishment – which was administered to 165 new migrant business owners. Questions were asked on the profile of business owners, their firm characteristics and experience of business support. In addition to gathering this information, 88 business owners in need of advice were signposted to SUPPAG.</p>
<p>Continual reflection is central to action research. This involves careful thinking about the way in which the research process or other forms of practice shapes the outcome of interventions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611429979">Denis and Lehoux (2010)</xref> identify three ‘pathways’ in which this process of learning from practice can be achieved: immersion, confrontation and diffusion. The adopted approach of the present study, immersion, is less adversarial but more intensive than the other two pathways. It involves long-term connections between researchers and practitioners: often, this intense level of researcher involvement in organizational life can be the catalyst for action. The process is akin to ethnography, and this was the case in the present initiative. Two of the researchers were effectively participant observers: their familiarity with the internal operations of SUPPAG allowed them to shed light on the organization’s approach to diversity and the wider set of contractual arrangements and targets to which it had to adhere. Hence they had access to company documents, conducted formal and informal meetings with SUPPAG staff, and were in constant touch with other intermediary organizations. In addition, SUPPAG staff met with the entire research team on a monthly basis to discuss progress and emerging findings. These events constituted formal ‘episodes of critical reflection’ in which participants engaged in a combination of ‘conjecture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611429979">Klijn and Skelcher, 2007</xref>) and the exchange of experiences from the practice setting.</p>
<p>The variety of methods used, complemented by formal and informal processes of reflection, was highly conducive to the kind of triangulation that is characteristic of action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611429979">Eden and Huxham, 1996</xref>). The inclusive, iterative and ongoing nature of the project allowed both researchers and practitioners to share and interrogate each other’s accounts. This reflexivity enables research outcomes to be justified ‘as representative of the situation in which they were generated and have claims to generality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611429979">Huxham and Vangen, 2003</xref>: 399). The wider research team was involved in interpreting the data and was intimately acquainted with the history, context and politics of the intervention. This is useful in providing an audit trail to maintain transparent data collection and analysis and procedures, and in building a database that contains data available for re-analysis, contributing to the ability to confirm the research and its trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611429979">Ram et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These protocols served as safeguards against purely subjective interpretation. In effect, they afforded the methodology of engaged scholarship the distance required to ‘uncover significant underlying structures in the situation … which will “resonate” strongly with a wide variety of other situations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611429979">Winter and Munn-Giddings, 2001</xref>: 21). This can be attributed to the critical realist social ontology that underpins engaged scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). Critical realism enables the researcher to get into the ‘black box’ of an intervention to identify how and why it works in a particular set of circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611429979">Houston, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611429979">Beckinsale et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>New migrant businesses: how diverse?</title>
<p>The central objective of the project was to identify concentrations of new migrant business owners and develop baseline data, with the interview survey of 165 such owners intended to plug gaps in the existing data. There is a lack of accurate information on the numbers and characteristics of new migrant communities from Eastern Europe (A8 countries), Africa and the Middle East in the region, with no single data source providing a comprehensive picture. At best, there are broad estimates based on different data sources. A variety of databases were interrogated (i.e. 2001 East Midlands Census Data, DWP National Insurance Number (NINO) applications, and The Labour Force Survey together with the Annual Population Survey), and consulted migration experts. From these sources we estimate that there are between 70,000 and 90,000 A8 nationals, and 50,000 to 70,000 new migrants from Africa and the Middle East. There were no existing databases from which a ‘representative’ data base of new migrant businesses could be constructed. Consequently, the present study relied on chain referral sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611429979">Biernacki and Waldorf, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611429979">Penrod et al., 2003</xref>), which is an advance on snowball sampling because a variety of networks are drawn upon: the strength of chain referral sampling is that ‘multiple networks are strategically accessed to expand the scope of investigation beyond one social network’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611429979">Penrod et al., 2003</xref>: 102). Such an approach is particularly valuable when there is no readily accessible sampling frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611429979">Heckathorn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611429979">Penrod et al., 2003</xref>). The guidance of new migrant intermediary groups, community based associations, refugee organizations, church-based bodies, personal contacts and local authority sources was drawn upon.</p>
<p>The substantive conclusion was that the novelty and diversity of the self-employed themselves is far from reflected in the nature of their firms. In practice, they reproduce many of the features of predecessor minorities – a case of ‘new crew, same boat’. Entirely consistent with mixed embeddedness rationale, continuity prevails over change, with the heterogeneity of the protagonists themselves flattened by the demands of the market and other external barriers that they must face. Irrespective of geographical origins or personal characteristics, migrant business owners tend to follow similar rules if they wish to survive in a system which does not allow for exotic exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611429979">Jones and Ram, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Certainly the sampled business owners demonstrate Vertovec’s super-diversity criteria in full measure. With no fewer than 22 national origins represented, there is diversity too in respect of immigration status and migration motives. As Kloosterman notes, immigrants to many West European countries ‘sometimes face explicit legal barriers with respect to start[ing] a business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611429979">2010</xref>: 26), but the UK, with its low legal entry barriers, is unusually hospitable in this respect. Strictly speaking, there is a fundamental division here between economic and political migrants. For A8 migrants – European Union (EU) citizens who are freely entitled to enter the UK for work purposes – business entry is indeed an unimpeded process, as it is also for African and Middle Eastern migrants who have secured British citizenship after lengthy residence, or European citizenship (as in the case of 16 Somalis formerly resident in the Netherlands). By contrast, for nearly half of the African and Middle Eastern respondents who are refugees with either indefinite or discretionary leave to remain, an insecure and ambiguous legal status creates practical barriers to business entry, especially in respect of creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Diversity of origins is not matched by diversity of outcomes, and a concentration of new businesses were found in a narrow range of economic sectors such as low-end retail, catering and personal services, a pattern common to A8 and African and Middle Eastern migrants. It replicates that of predecessor entrepreneurial minorities in the UK, notably the emergent South Asian shopkeepers of the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611429979">Aldrich et al., 1981</xref>). While in principle the market is wide open, in practice it largely restricts under-resourced newcomers to easy entry vacancies, where ‘many aspiring entrepreneurs opt for the same markets … resulting in cut-throat competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611429979">Kloosterman, 2010</xref>: 34) This pattern might have made SUPPAG’s task easier, in that the businesses operated in familiar territory; however, they were hard to identify and they had their own distinctive features which created challenges for SUPPAG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0266242611429979">
<title>Academic/practitioner engagement</title>
<p>The researchers shared emerging findings as part of their interactions with practitioners. The research team immersed itself in the practice setting, while simultaneously pursuing the more academic and longer-term task of gathering survey data on new migrant businesses. This intensive engagement was a catalyst for action in two key areas. First, it facilitated an insight into the context of practice in which the project, and subsequent findings, would be located. Hence the constraints, or ‘structural impingements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611429979">Kontos and Poland, 2009</xref>), that shaped scope for action were made clear. For example, SUPPAG was subject to nationally imposed targets for engaging with ethnic minorities and other under-represented groups. These performance targets were regularly discussed within the organization and at board meetings. SUPPAG did manage to meet its target in respect of ethnic minorities, although it struggled with other groups. However, these targets were often reached by contracting with a few specialist providers that worked with established minority communities (for example, South Asian and African Caribbean groups): this has traces of the ‘ethnic managerialism’ noted in other policy fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611429979">Law, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611429979">Vertovec, 1999</xref>). SUPPAG had appointed internal ‘champions’ to promote awareness of ethnic minority businesses, but they struggled to fulfil this role because of competing pressures on their time. Further, even the most basic information on new migrant communities was lacking, illustrating Vertovec’s general contention that ‘most areas of service provision have not caught up with the transformation brought about by the new immigration of the last decade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">2007</xref>: 1048).</p>
<p>Second, the process of engagement promoted an exchange of ‘scientific’ and experiential knowledge, which is central to action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611429979">Whyte, 1991</xref>) and policy learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611429979">Ram and Trehan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611429979">Sanderson, 2002</xref>). The research team spent a considerable amount of time meeting key members of staff in order to discuss the aims of the project and understand how the organization functioned. These informal interactions were supplemented by formal quarterly meetings with SUPPAG staff on the emerging findings, and the steps that the organization could take to respond to them. Practitioners valued these ongoing exchanges, as one SUPPAG officer remarked:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that … the good thing was that all the information that was being held in the project wasn’t being kept until the very end … I think that we did learn as we went along.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Here, we elaborate on three particular areas of change and policy development: the contextualization of business support needs; widening engagement with users of the research and business support; and the reshaping of business support interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0266242611429979">
<title>Contextualizing business support needs</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before the project, most of our information on ethnic minority businesses came from specialist ethnic organizations. They tended to suggest that the key issues facing such businesses were ethnic issues … What the research was saying was that these businesses faced business issues, not necessarily ethnic ones. (SUPPAG officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence from the survey and researchers’ activities in other elements of the project hihglighted the the importance of understanding the context of owners’ business support needs. The extant research points to a tension between interpreting such needs as ‘ethnic’ or ‘business’-related (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611429979">Ram and Smallbone, 2003</xref> for a review). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611429979">Sepulveda et al. (2011)</xref> identify a number of ‘ethnicity-related’ factors in their study of new migrant businesses: they further highlight finance as a key constraint, and suggest that owners are disdvantaged by the actions of finance providers. The present study survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611429979">Figure 1</xref>) also identified finance as the most important business support need. A substantial majority (65 out of 165 firms) cite funding as their most pressing support need, with funding for new initiatives or equipment a prominent item.</p>

</fig>
<p>This is especially high among the new migrants from Africa and the Middle East. It is worth noting here that most are not expecting direct grant assistance, but rather help with finding investors or securing business loans. There was a general will to be self-sufficient, as evidenced by a new migrant entrepreneur who wanted ‘information about funding sources for Polish business’. Another felt that there may be forms of EU funding but simply did not know. Indeed the words ‘help’, ‘advice’ and above all ‘information’ run through this testimony like a thread, with migrants continually reminding us that they know even less than the average non-migrant British entrepreneur simply about where to find what is often already available and how to go about unlocking it.</p>
<p>Apart from an unfamiliarity with new technology, the problems mentioned stem from a lack of familiarity with English surroundings, particularly in respect of business information. Many relate to the legal and regulatory environment: an entirely to be anticipated incomprehension – and potential source of anxiety – on the part of newly-arrived outsiders. There were concerns over planning permission and health and safety regulations, and many wanted ‘more information about running legally’ (New migrant entrepreneur). They also cited help with business plans, with learning about National Insurance and VAT and with ‘finding decent accountants that charge reasonably’ (New migrant entrepreneur).</p>
<p>A series of five focus groups with new migrant business owners was convened with the twin objectives of exploring these issues further, and probing respondents’ commonsense perspectives on key elements of business support. These events – faciltated jointly by researchers and SUPPAG officers – provided further insight into the applicability of mixed embeddedness and super-diversity, and allowed practitioners to develop a dialogue with business owners. In terms of their support needs, there were frequent references to the need for more ‘awareness’ of available assistance, ‘professional advice’ and ‘guidance’ on the regulations required to start and develop a business. However, by exploring issues such as labour market choice, the role of the family, entrepreneurial intentions and organization of the business (issues relevant to mixed embeddedness), it became evident that such individuals were not necessarily fully-fledged business owners. In many cases, focus group participants had to work to supplement the business. For example, one participant commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>The push is there. The fact is at the end of the day I had to weigh my options and I started the business to support my wages. (New migrant entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A part-time garage owner claimed that:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not that people don’t have the skills to run a business full time, but it’s the finance that is lacking … I may have the zeal to do so, but I lack the resources to hire the required personnel to deliver.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was clear that the enterprise was kept afloat by the paid and unpaid support of family and community members. Such practices are more akin to the survival-oriented activities of ‘micro-business households’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611429979">Baines and Wheelock, 1998</xref>) than nascent entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>When the issue of finance was discussed, many participants admitted that it was often difficult to provide the necessary information to prepare business plans that would be acceptable to funding bodies. This prompted them to rely on ‘bootstrapping’ methods: for example personal credit cards, or informal sources, particularly friends and family. Such practices are explicable when placed in the broader context of the firm. The participants suggested that many new migrant businesses were informal in the sense of being legal in themselves, but unregistered for tax and welfare purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611429979">Williams, 2006</xref>). By using the focus group format to generate an ‘embedded understanding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611429979">Williams and Windebank, 1998</xref>), it was possible to develop a better appreciation of the practices that compound the difficulties in securing funds from formal providers of finance. This focus on basic business access to developmental finance is at odds with depictions of such business problems as ethnicity-related.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0266242611429979">
<title>Widening engagement with users</title>
<p>The relational nature of action research appeals to practitioners because it enhances the prospects of producing knowledge that is ‘actionable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611429979">Argyris, 1996</xref>). However, tensions arise from relationality, particularly in respect of who to include in the action research and the power that organizational gatekeepers exercise in determining the ‘users’ of the research. There is a potential conflict between under-organized systems that are fluid and organic, and highly organized systems that emphasize task and maintenance functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611429979">Elden and Chisholm, 1993</xref>). As noted earlier, SUPPAG’s approach to ethnic minority business was largely framed by a handful of intermediaries representing established ethnic minority groups – there were no relationships with new migrant organizations.</p>
<p>SUPPAG required the researchers to map new migrant intermediary organizations with a view to identifying relevant networks to disseminate business support information. This was done with around 50 groups identified through a process of multiple chain referral, involving a range of gatekeepers ranging from the clergy (in the case of Poles) and local authority officials with an interest in ‘community cohesion’. However, discussions with these intermediaries revealed a genuine desire for a closer engagement with business support issues and the broader objectives of the research. Many were interested in receiving support for their activities, and wanted to become part of a wider network to support new migrant business owners in the region. They often felt a sense of dislocation from the formal structures of enterprise support.</p>
<p>Consequently, the study went beyond contract by intensifying its involvement with such groups in a number of ways. First, rather than simply recording the number of intermediaries in the region, dialogue was developed that explored their key issues, constraints and aspirations for business support. These deliberations were shared with SUPPAG (and often involved officers directly). Second, the researchers actively facilitated a number of promotional and networking events that included SUPPAG, intermediaries and new migrant enterprises. Finally, the researchers participated in a number of collaborations during the course of the project. For example, a memorandum of understanding was signed with a social enterprise network in order to promote joint working on initiatives of mutual interest. The researchers were co-opted onto their committee board and attended meetings at their offices across the region. The researchers joined the board of a regional migration policy group which met on a quarterly basis in various parts of the region. During the Refugee Week in 2009, one the researchers worked closely with refugee community organizations in shedding light on the nature of refugee entrepreneurship in the region. This generated considerable interest among new migrant communities attending the event, which was followed up by SUPPAG.</p>
<p>A static enumeration of new migrant community organizations (as envisaged in the original terms of reference of the research contract with SUPPAG) would have provided information on the prevalence and nature of such intermediaries in the region. However, it would have done little to promote the ‘relational scholarship of integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611429979">Bartunek, 2007</xref>) at the heart of engaged scholarship, neither the experimentation and creativity that is the spur for policy learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611429979">Sanderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611429979">Schwandt, 2002</xref>). By being engaged and inclusive, our intervention was able to support a process that enhanced new migrant participation in representative structures from which they had been often excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">Vertovec, 2007</xref>). Our work with Polish intermediaries is illustrative of this approach. Prior to the project, SUPPAG had no direct links with this community despite the substantial presence of both first-generation migrants and more recent arrivals. We worked with two Polish community-based organizations in elements of the research, and facilitated links with between these groups and SUPPAG. The reflections of a member of the research team during the course expands on this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>We co-organized two focus groups together with SUPPAG and two Polish intermediaries … These events helped produce a clear insight on the barriers affecting pre-start-ups and established A8 businesses in these specific areas. With both the intermediaries and SUPPAG in attendance, we helped provide a meeting place for the different parties to become aware of each other and to explore areas in which they can cooperate in the future … We also signposted several other intermediaries such as the Polish Advice Centre … which provides a wide range of advice to Polish people, ranging from public services to employment matters. After having spoken to the owner and based on our observations, it seems that the advice centre is well established within the community. SUPPAG are [sic] currently trying to establish links with the Polish Advice Centre [that] will lead to them holding business support events at their office or to the Polish Advice Centre being listed in the SUPPAG Register.</p>

<sec id="section13-0266242611429979">
<title>Reshaping interventions</title>
<p>The action research process provoked a constant reassessment of the ways in which SUPPAG engaged with new migrant businesses. The deliberative exchanges arising from the focus groups, and indeed the other elements of the project, were shaping the way in which SUPPAG officers were approaching the issue of diversity and enterprise (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242611429979">Table 2</xref>; some of the changes have been noted earlier). SUPPAG altered the way that it promoted its services, started to develop relationships with a wider range of intermediaries (including those representing new communities), and intensified its efforts in areas where new migrant activity was identified. We highlight two particular developments.</p>

<p>First, our interactions with SUPPAG prompted interest in developing new ways of engaging with new migrant businesses. The ‘scientific’ and experiential elements of the project highlighted a widespread lack of awareness of the role of SUPPAG among new migrant businesses. The organization was keen to explore the ways that it could address this issue. This extract from the diary notes of a member of the research team describes the development of an initiative to promote its services to new migrant business owners:
<disp-quote>
<p>When we met the business relations team [the SUPPAG unit responsible for promotion] and shared with them our emerging findings, there was a real desire on the part of that team to do some marketing events specifically targeting the new migrant communities. One such lead that we attempted to explore was to use community media … The SUPPAG team was very enthusiastic about this, and several meetings were held with the radio station.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This resulted in the development of a close working relationship with a community radio station and the production of several programmes dedicated to the issues facing new migrant business owners. One possible indication of the success of this and other engagement efforts (for example, interactions with intermediaries and the focus groups) was a substantial increase in the recorded number of SUPPAG interactions with ethnic minority businesses, which rose from 2999 in the year before the project to 4214 after the end of the initiative. This increase was considerably more than expected, and although it is difficult to attribute this entirely to the project, a SUPPAG officer suggested that:
<disp-quote>
<p>we would like to think that some of that is down to the contact that we have made with intermediaries. I don’t think that we should underestimate the efforts of just two people [the researchers] … I think certainly a lot of it was increased awareness of the [our] brand and engaging with businesses … With [researchers] out there on our behalf because of the research, and because they are talking about [SUPPAG] … The … referrals that are generated get back into the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Second, SUPPAG reassessed some of its internal practices in relation to ethnic minority businesses. As noted earlier, SUPPAG appointed a number of ‘champions’ whose main role was to work with ethnic minority businesses. However, during the course of the project, it was evident that these champions were often diverted from this role by their other elements of their job, did not share their knowledge of ethnic minority firms systematically with other members of the organization, were insufficient in number to cover all parts of the region and had little, if any, specialist knowledge of new migrant communities. Our interactions with SUPPAG highlighted these shortcomings and during the course of the project, it was decided that this approach should be terminated.</p>
<p>Crucially, the process of critical reflection that permeated the project coincided with the gestation phase of a major SUPPAG investment in outreach support. As the present project was drawing to close, SUPPAG initiated a community-based adviser programme which comprised the recruitment of six business support officers who would be based in particular geographic communities across the region. It was clear that the experiences of the present project was an important influence upon the new initiative, as the responsible SUPPAG officer explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>The learning from the new migrant project was continually being fed into the community-based adviser programme. It was invaluable in helping us think through what we would want from the business advisers and how we would want them to operate.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This innovation went with the grain of some of key tenets of super-diversity and mixed embeddedness: for example, rather than focusing solely on ethnicity, the new initiative emphasized the importance of developing an understanding of the context in which many new migrant business owners were located. Community-based business advisers were encouraged to develop long-term relationships with new and aspiring business owners in these areas; this proved helpful in developing tailored interventions rather than prevailing ‘one size fits all’ approaches. Finally, knowledge from these advisers was now being shared within SUPPAG, thus enhancing the organization’s knowledge on diversity and enterprise in new migrant communities.</p>
<p>These developments were viewed positively by SUPPAG and constituted an important attempt in its ambition to promote greater diversity in its service provision. However, producing sustainable change in an inherently unstable and volatile system of business support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611429979">Ram et al., 2006</xref>) is extremely difficult. A number of challenges were evident during the course of the project: for example, the researchers’ success in identifying new migrant businesses eager to secure advice placed a strain on SUPPAG’s capacity. This was the reflection of one of the researchers during the course of the project:
<disp-quote>
<p>As the project developed some of the intermediaries that we had had meetings with were a bit sceptical of our ability to deliver meaningful change, or at least offer any kind of support that their constituencies wanted. [Four intermediaries] criticized SUPPAG for its lack of support in helping their entrepreneurs. At one of the focus groups in Nottingham, several members bemoaned the lack of time from SUPPAG officials. One of the participants at the workshop said: ‘We are tired of attending these meetings. It seems it’s only talk and talk and we are asked to tick boxes without real support.’ … Such sentiments were expressed by other businesses who we had interviewed early on, who felt that the ‘promised support’ was not forthcoming.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the viability of the business support system, particularly ‘mainstream’ organizations such as SUPPAG, is under serious threat. Whether new migrant communities will be a priority in such a desperate economic environment is a matter of considerable debate. It is likely that SUPPAG will continue but in a much reduced form, focusing on smaller commercial projects rather than the kind of initiative reported on here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a field where both growing diversity and the research–policy nexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611429979">Vertovec, 2007</xref>) have been neglected by scholars and practitioners alike, this article has examined how the businesses run by new migrant communities are dealt with at the intersection of academic and policy domains. For policymakers, there is an obvious tension between the needs of new and diverse communities and entrenched organizational imperatives to monitor and cater to identifiable and established ethnic minority groups. SUPPAG’s experience is typical in its lack of knowledge of the dynamics of new migrant communities, tendency towards ethnic managerialism and reliance on a narrow range of ethnic minority intermediaries that largely represent established communities. This collaborative project provided a vehicle to draw together diverse bodies of knowledge among a range of partners. The practical outcomes included enhancing the knowledge base of a key business support organization, establishing relationships with intermediaries, developing potentially important support networks and facilitating the delivery of actual business support to new migrant communities. In effect, the researchers were able to act on the present findings as well as key insights from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611429979">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>): business support agencies need to be sensitive to highly specific contextual factors.</p>
<sec id="section15-0266242611429979">
<title>Implications of the study</title>
<p>A number of wider implications follow from the project. First, a serious and sustained commitment to engaged scholarship can enrich both parties in the research–policy nexus. As we have seen, applying a mixed embeddedness approach can contribute to a better understanding of super-diversity as it applies to new migrant business activity. Multiple sources of differentiation need to be acknowledged in assessing the capacity of new migrants to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. However, importantly, this has to be seen in the context of a powerful set of structural constraints that condition the nature and viability of such businesses. By examining the parts of the system as well as the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611429979">Carter, 1998</xref>) it is possible to develop a clearer articulation of the generative processes that might be described as ‘constrained convergence’.</p>
<p>Second, active engagement with a wide range of stakeholders allows bridges to be built with policymakers. By examining how the process of super-diversity is played out in a practitioner environment, we are able to see how the broader policy imperative to essentialize and ethnicize diversity reacts with an initiative to pursue a more relational and fluid approach to communities and enterprise. This throws into sharp relief the necessity to view policymaking as more than the unproblematic translation of ‘evidence’; rather, it is a process of argumentation that emerges from dialogue, interpretation, experience and prevailing power structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611429979">Forester, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611429979">Majone, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611429979">Sanderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611429979">Schwandt, 2002</xref>). This policy learning perspective is at odds with the instrumentalist project of evidence-based policy that is currently in vogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611429979">Sanderson, 2006</xref>). It powerfully illuminates the conditions, complexities and character of the context in which initiatives operate. This can be valuable to policymakers interested in establishing how the context and nature of interventions produce particular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611429979">Carter, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the present collaboration has illustrated the potential of action research to facilitate two processes for which it is not traditionally noted: theory and policy development. The various elements of the project explicated the dimensions of super-diversity and mixed embeddedness in a particular context. This casts light on theoretical knowledge pertaining to ‘causal conditions of the social/behavioural world and its attendant difficulties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611429979">Friedman and Rogers, 2009</xref>: 34). In terms of policy development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611429979">Schön and Rein’s (1994)</xref> concept of reflective transfer is relevant, since refers to ‘the process by which patterns detected in one situation are carried over as projective models to other situations to generate new causal inferences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611429979">1994</xref>: 204). In this vein, members of the research team are presently engaged with practitioners to adapt this project to another regional setting in the UK.</p>
<p>Finally, the present study demonstrates the utility of an engaged scholarship methodology and its potential to be applied to other contexts. The value of the approach lies in its capacity to overcome the ‘the dual hurdles of relevance and rigor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>: 34), and the present case meets these objectives by changing organizational practice while contributing to more theoretical debates on mixed embeddedness and super-diversity in the context of new migrant entrepreneurs. Exploiting the different knowledge base of scholars and practitioners is central to this process: such interaction is more conducive to the generation of useful insights than either party working in isolation. Clearly, there are affinities between engaged scholarship and the action research adopted in the present study, but this does not preclude the former’s relevance to other research methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611429979">Van de Ven (2007)</xref> demonstrates the value to many other different forms of social research including basic social science, with the advice of key stakeholders, collaborative co-production of knowledge with stakeholders, and design science to evaluate an applied programme. Stakeholder views can inform each stage of the research process, including grounding the research problem, developing plausible theories, research design and applying the findings to address the research problem. Active collaboration between researchers and practitioners is an important feature of engaged scholarship – it usually requires repeated interaction between the parties in order to explore meanings, generate new insights and develop better causal accounts. Importantly, the critical realist ontology of engaged scholarship and its commitment to deep explanation militates against undue subjectivity and instrumentalism.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Despite these broader implications, some limitations can be identified. The first relates to the extent to which the study can be contextualized. Recent articulations of mixed embeddedness (notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611429979">Kloosterman, 2010</xref>) call for the systematic analysis of migrant enterprise across a range of different contexts. This requires detailed elucidation of the different structural forces that shape the trajectory of such businesses, together with insights into the agential strategies that owners utilize to survive and grow. Our focus on the research–policy nexus militated against a more comprehensive examination of the context of migrant entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, future research will engage more deeply with developments in respect of mixed embeddedness and, importantly, will make an explicit link with the complementary meta-theory of critical realism. Contextualization could be further enhanced by comparative research on new migrant business owners in different nation-states: this would cast light on how different national regimes constrain and facilitate the capacity of new migrants to pursue self-employment. It would help to develop the meagre literature on international policy responses to new migrants and entrepreneurship.</p>
