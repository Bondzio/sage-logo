<p>We thank Dr Shrime for his interest in our article “Calcium Management after Thyroidectomy: A Simple and Cost-Effective Method”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812446790">1</xref></sup> and for providing an opportunity to clarify the objective of our approach.</p>
<p>We sought to simplify the management of patients undergoing thyroid surgery using an approach that is cost-effective. We use the common definition of <italic>cost-effective</italic>, namely, “economical in terms of tangible benefits produced by money spent” (<italic>Webster’s Dictionary</italic>) or “the minimal expenditure of dollars, time, and other elements necessary to achieve the health care result deemed necessary and appropriate” (<italic>Mosby’s</italic>). We specifically disagree that to be “cost-effective,” an intervention “must be less costly and more effective, or more costly and more effective,” as proposed by Dr Shrime.</p>
<p>Neither do we agree that “biochemical testing decreases the risk of hypocalcemia.” Testing represents a way to diagnose the condition. A patient who needs to be admitted after surgery needs to be admitted regardless of how this need is determined. The cost of this admission is independent of the approach used to reach that conclusion, and indeed a very small minority of patients (0.65% in our experience) will require admission.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Dr Shrime appears to have misunderstood that what is cost-effective (and safe and simple) is the supplementation of all patients with the intention of sending them home rather than the acquisition of an expensive battery of tests. Interestingly, a recent independent analysis reached the same conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness as we did (and favored routine supplementation over acquisition of the parathyroid hormone assay).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812446790">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our data are clear. This is an effective and safe strategy (and by the way, it is less costly). We encourage Dr Shrime to consider pursuing routine supplementation in his patients because we are confident he will promptly adopt this approach.</p>
