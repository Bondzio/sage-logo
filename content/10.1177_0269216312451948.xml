<sec id="section1-0269216312451948">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The modes of communication which patients use are seen as important within the sphere of palliative care and have been the focus of much research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312451948">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>This literature review aims to identify and analyse one particular mode of patient expression, namely that of the figure of speech (trope) ‘metaphor’, and ask questions regarding metaphor’s therapeutic usefulness when engaging with the life-limited patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312451948">
<title>Data Sources:</title>
<p>The investigation revolves around a literature review of academic papers which focus on the metaphorical ways in which patients speak of their condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312451948">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>This paper provides the theoretical foundations for the patient’s metaphoric utterances. It also delineates the variety and diversity of metaphors used by patients and categorises them into broad groupings which encompass metaphors of war, journeying, personhood, the natural world and existential concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312451948">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The papers reviewed suggest that metaphoric communication allows sensitive subjects to be dealt with and provides benefits for patients. The results suggest that engaging with patients at the metaphoric level enables them to create new ways of viewing their situation and opens up the possibilities of new coping strategies. Finally, some developmental trajectories emanating from the reviewed papers are suggested, which will allow the efficacy of metaphor to be explored further within a palliative care setting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well recognised that the language used by patients to describe their condition and experience is important. The notion that all language, including that of the patient, is replete with figures of speech is also well documented and is seen to be crucial in gaining a correct understanding of situations at the level of the clinical encounter. This paper seeks to provide a review of the use of <italic>metaphor</italic> within medical, nursing and healthcare literature as it relates to palliative care. Metaphors are one sort of figure of speech commonly used by patients within palliative care settings and are modes of expression which convey complex thoughts, feelings and emotions by the transference of one term to another.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312451948">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There exists a critical debate within scholarship regarding the operation of metaphor. In general terms, since Aristotle, the argument about the metaphoric has revolved around whether metaphor is merely ornamental to already existing thoughts or words, or is actually creative and constitutive of thoughts and words. The former is expressed by Locke, who views metaphors as an ‘abuse of language’ which ‘insinuates wrong ideas’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312451948">2</xref></sup> The latter is exemplified by Ricoeur, who sees metaphor as a mode of creating new realities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312451948">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312451948">4</xref></sup> Thiselton gives a good historical survey of the critical debate, from Aristotle to modern and post-modern theorists (such as Ricoeur, Derrida, Lacan and Lyotard), which incorporates and exemplifies proponents of both ‘ornamental’ and ‘constitutive’ schools of thought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312451948">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312451948">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been a recent rise in the recognition of the importance of metaphor across a wide range of disciplines, including medicine and health sciences. This interest has been generated by applying the linguistic insights of a number of theorists to patient-based interactions and is particularly prominent within the fields of psychotherapy, psychology and social studies. The aim of this review is to analyse papers in which the figure of speech of metaphor is recognised within a palliative care setting and to answer three specific questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0269216312451948" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1) What theoretical foundation of metaphor is used and what is its operative mechanism? This will entail an identification of the principal theoreticians of metaphor within each paper and an understanding of how the author(s) perceive(s) metaphor to act within a palliative care setting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2) What types of metaphors are generated by patients, and can these be categorised into discrete groupings?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3) What do the papers conclude with regard to the usefulness and role of metaphor?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We begin by delineating the method we use for a <italic>narrative literature review.</italic> We will then produce a tabulated set of results which answers, in a preliminary way, the questions above, before embarking on a detailed discussion and categorisation of the topics identified. The final section provides some developmental trajectories which might be pursued if work on metaphor is to proceed within a palliative care framework.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216312451948" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>It was envisioned that a high-quality narrative review would be produced using a systematic procedure. There is little need to re-invent new approaches for narrative literature reviews and so a mixed-methodological approach drawn from the work of Rigby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312451948">7</xref></sup> and Duke and Bennett<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312451948">8</xref></sup> was utilised for our study. The former is based on the work of Hawker et al., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312451948">7</xref>(fn22)</sup> whilst the latter was a newly generated methodology which took into account various narrative review strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312451948">8</xref>(112)</sup> These approaches were adopted due to the fact that the current study’s purpose was to identify and review both qualitative and quantitative research papers, and Rigby and Duke’s work showed evidence of being able to elicit useful results.</p>
<sec id="section8-0269216312451948">
<title>Study aim</title>
<p>The threefold aim of the study was to locate published papers which utilised the trope (i.e. figure of speech) of metaphor within palliative care settings; to identify the theoretical foundations and operative mechanism of metaphor within each paper; and to report on the findings of each study with regard to the usefulness of metaphor in promoting the patient’s well-being. In order to do this we adopted a systematic search strategy; a process for the inclusion and exclusion of papers; and a critical appraisal of included papers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269216312451948">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>The first phase of the literature review involved a wide-ranging database search to identify papers which linked ‘metaphor’ and ‘palliative care’ within their title, abstract, or keywords. This process was undertaken in two stages. The first phase was a generic database search (using six electronic databases) for the terms ‘metaphor’ and ‘palliative care’ using appropriately selected search engines. The engines selected were: MEDLINE; CINAHL; PsychInfo; AMED; BNI; and EMBASE. The second stage was a thesaurus-linked electronic database search (under the direction of a specialist health librarian) in which ‘palliative care’ and ‘metaphor’ were linked to specific keywords within the thesaurus of the database, including ‘palliative care’, ‘terminal illness’ and ‘hospice care’. The hits elicited from first and second phases are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312451948">Table 1</xref>. After the elimination of duplicates, the total number of papers containing the search terms within the title, abstract or keywords was 45.</p>

<title>Inclusion and exclusion of papers</title>
<p>The 45 papers identified via the search strategy were assessed in light of the strict assessment criteria. These criteria are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216312451948">Table 2</xref>. Due to the nature of the topic under consideration, it was vital to include qualitative and empirical research papers, but also to broaden the scope to include practice reports which had highlighted the use of metaphor in patient care. All papers had to explore ‘metaphor’ as the main and substantive topic in the body of the work. Crucially, all papers for inclusion had to have a patient orientation and not be a consideration of the use of metaphor among nurses or other health professionals. In total, 13 papers were excluded due to their content relating to health care professionals; 15 were excluded because metaphor was only a partial or tangential feature of the article; and three were excluded because they were in a language other than English. This left a total of 14 papers which met the inclusion criteria satisfactorily.</p>

<title>The theoretical foundations and operative mechanism of metaphor</title>
<p>All but one of the papers included explicitly utilised a theoretical foundation for metaphor and supported this via recourse to some of metaphor’s principal theoreticians. It will be noted that 13 major theorists are referenced in the results table. Whilst it is impossible to offer detailed discussion of each position, it is possible to produce a synthesis of theoretical positions which bear a family likeness to each other. It will also be noted that only three works appear more than once: Lakoff and Johnson (six times), Sontag (twice) and Erickson (twice). As a starting point we will describe the thinking of Lakoff and Johnson and those to whom they connect theoretically, and then move on to examine Sontag’s position. These two works occupy two poles of a spectrum and will enable us to locate the other theorists’ (including Erickson’s) positions.</p>

<title>Lakoff and Johnson, Ricoeur and Aristotle</title>
<p>Lakoff and Johnson, Ricoeur and Aristotle belong together as a family group.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s <italic>Poetics</italic> defined metaphor as ‘the application of an alien name by transference’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451948">9</xref></sup> and Ricoeur uses this to contend that metaphors are: (a) fundamental to human expression; (b) disclosive and revelatory, transforming the past and creating ‘new realities;’ (c) untranslatable and complete expressions in themselves; and (d) polyvalent and convey a surplus of meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312451948">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lakoff and Johnson agree with Ricoeur and suggest that far from metaphors being devices of ‘poetic imagination’, they are ‘pervasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref></sup> providing a source of coherence in our understanding of the world and helping us to understand something abstract (e.g. love) in terms of something concrete or physical (e.g. falling).

<title>Susan Sontag</title>
<p>Susan Sontag’s work <italic>Illness as Metaphor</italic> takes an opposing view to that of Lakoff and Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref></sup> and asserts that metaphors are not to be welcomed. For her, the ‘healthiest way of being ill is one purified of (and) resistant to metaphoric thinking’. Sontag dismisses the way in which cancer is seen as mysterious and intractable in scientific terms and challenges the punitive notions attached to the ideas of illness. However, she rather proves the point which Lakoff and Johnson make: that metaphors (for good or ill) are a pervasive and everyday way of thinking and speaking about the world. For several reviewers, Sontag’s treatise is unconvincing and ethically unhelpful,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451948">12</xref></sup> and the two authors (within the present review) who make use of Sontag’s work do so to demonstrate how pervasive metaphors are in speech.</p>

<title>The remainder of the cited theorists</title>
<p>There is some difficulty in categorising the remaining theorists as they are drawn from a range of academic disciplines. However, there is a clear division between those who propose a philosophical mechanism for metaphor and those who are more practice-based. We will describe the former group first.</p>
<p>Blumer works with the concept of <italic>symbolic interactionism</italic> in which meaning itself is one of the interpretative processes used by the person.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451948">13</xref></sup> Likewise, Kovesces develops a ‘cognitive linguistic theory of metaphor’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451948">14</xref></sup> and Bachelard uses a phenomenological approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451948">15</xref></sup> Kittay’s treatise suggests that metaphor provides a way of learning something new about the world as a tool for ‘rearranging the furniture of the mind’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451948">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451948">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451948">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The above description suggests that the authors of the articles included in our review drew on theorists who bear a family resemblance to Ricoeur and Lakoff and Johnson. That is to say that metaphor is conceived of as a tool of innovation and creation. By using metaphor, the patient creates some new understanding of their world at the present time; and with that comes a new perceptual framework with regard to possible solutions to the challenges they now face.</p>

<title>Military metaphors</title>
<p>Military metaphors relate to the perceived battle going on, usually inside the patient’s body. So Casarett et al. documents patients’ speech in terms of ‘the host’s immune system as a defending army’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref>(257)</sup> and the treatment itself is described as a bullet or a missile that is being aimed at the target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref>(258)</sup> Byrne notes that the martial metaphor is very adaptable to cancer: ‘there is the enemy (cancer), the commander (physician) and the combatant (patient), allies (the healthcare team) and formidable weaponry (chemical biological and nuclear)’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(276)</sup> However, she does suggest some drawbacks to this metaphor: it is overly masculine, power-based and potentially violent. It also suggests that ‘fighting cancer is only a matter of fighting hard enough’, with the concomitant impression that patients fail treatment rather than the treatment failing the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(276)</sup> Spall et al. helpfully document some uses of the war metaphor: ‘She felt like she had lost the battle’; ‘I’m going to fight you; you’re not going to take over my body’; ‘He has fought the good fight’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> Furthermore, these militaristic metaphors are replete with conceptions of force and assault: ‘I feel raped with this disease’; ‘…[they] whack one of those big punch bags in my face and I’m back down again’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> The latter example links with a sporting metaphor in which another patient described himself as being in a marathon and not a sprint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref>(257)</sup></p>

<title>Metaphors of journeying</title>
<p>Metaphors of journeying are commonly called upon to facilitate the expression of patients’ situations and may give opportunities for personal growth (spiritual or otherwise), exploration and hope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(276)</sup> Indeed the hospice movement, historically, takes some of its ethos from this metaphor, being perceived as a ‘resting place for travellers on a journey, a place of healing for those wounded in battle’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(275),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451948">17</xref></sup> This journey takes the form of a folkloric quest in which the brave hero battles against the odds. Here are two important points: a) it is clear that the categories I have created overlap and are thus only provisional (so a journey may well involve a battle or a feat of physical struggle); and b) these metaphors can run deeply within the psyche of human experience, the quest being an <italic>archetype</italic> of human experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216312451948">25</xref></sup> At other times the journey is more straightforward: ‘they have had to go on a path that is not quite near yours’; ‘[it’s] like climbing a mountain; don’t really know what to expect when you reach the top, turning the corner might alter your perspective’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> The movement and plot of a journey ties in nicely with recent work on the importance of patients’ illness narratives and is a tool used by patients and practitioners alike to elicit new ways forward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216312451948">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Metaphors of personhood</title>
<p>Metaphors of personhood revolve around the identity of the patient in line with their relationships to other human beings. Kuchan relates Melissa’s motherhood metaphor in which she pictures herself in a rocking chair on the lap of Jesus, who takes the role of her mother, where ‘it feels nice and warm’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451948">16</xref>(1)</sup> More explicitly, some patients see themselves as the archetypal mother. This can, at times, have a jealous orientation: ‘I don’t mind if my husband does remarry, but I don’t want her in my house looking after my kids. Seeing to my kids. That feels all wrong. I shall always be looking after them. I ain’t never leaving my kids’. At other times it has a sacrificial thrust: ‘better me than one of the kids … it got me so it can’t get them’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312451948">38</xref>(159)</sup> And a protective and nurturing motif is at the heart of many of interviews: ‘I want my son to grow and move on, whether I’m here or not’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312451948">38</xref>(160)</sup></p>
<p>Personhood extends to areas other than motherhood, with some patients seeing their new identity as that of an <italic>alien</italic>, so Mayo speaks of a patient who had ‘adopted the mentality of a refugee and a stranger’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451948">17</xref>(211)</sup> Richardson and Grose identify the metaphor of family as an important concept within patients’ speech.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312451948">19</xref></sup> Finally, the notion of stranger relates to the patient’s self-perception: ‘I resent being sick because I don’t feel it’s me’ and, for the ex-dancer struggling into the bath: ‘I can’t believe this is me. I was so strong, so fit, so supple’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312451948">38</xref>(179)</sup></p>

<title>Metaphors of the natural world</title>
<p>The natural world provides the backdrop for a number of metaphors used by patients. The cycle of the seasons depicts how times vary in terms of their difficulty and challenges. Byrne notes that there is an Australian therapeutic programme called ‘Seasons of Growth’ built around this theme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(277)</sup> This programme encompasses ideas such as new birth, death and dying, and focuses on the cyclical nature of life.

<title>Existential or ideological metaphors</title>
<p>Existential or ideological metaphors relate to concepts and abstracts rather than concrete ideas, although they may embrace the physical world. Our analysis of papers shows reference to metaphors referring to freedom, safety, change, impotence, finality, death and dying. Death is often depicted as sleep or the end: ‘I’ll just drift into sleep before your very eyes’; ‘it feels like I have come to a full stop’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> However, linked with the <italic>journey</italic> metaphor, it sometimes becomes the next stage of a trip which patients are to take<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451948">16</xref>(248)</sup> or a mechanism for leaving this life: ‘there are people here who ought to let go and they can’t. They’re hanging on to life’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312451948">38</xref>(134)</sup> Lack of power is also a theme within this section, with patients noting the inability to do what they always took for granted: ‘It feels like I am walking through treacle’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> This extends to the disempowering communications with regard to their illness: ‘It feels like you are being drip fed with bad news’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> Existential metaphors can also be expressed in very concrete ways, so, in the face of helplessness, patients speak of a ‘roller-coaster ride’; ‘a rag doll being washed and dressed’; and cancer as an ‘alien taking me over,’ – with lack of control and powerlessness being key motifs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312451948">38</xref>(179)</sup> Finally, Dekkers notes that <italic>home</italic> can provide a metaphor to assist patients in describing their own body, a place of safety and a final destination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451948">12</xref>(343)</sup></p>

<sec id="section24-0269216312451948">
<title>Metaphor enhances communication and understanding</title>
<p>All of the papers asserted that the use of metaphor enhanced the patient’s communication and understanding. This included both the understanding between patient and professional and the self-understanding of the patient with regard to his/her condition.</p>
<p>With regard to the patient/professional interaction, ‘by listening to patients’ metaphoric speech, physicians may gain an insight into their understanding of illness and make sense of their questions’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451948">10</xref>(274)</sup> The converse is also true, as Casarett et al. show in their comprehensive qualitative paper concluding that ‘physicians who used more metaphors elicited better patients’ rating of communication … the use of metaphors and analogies may enhance physicians’ ability to communicate’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref>(255)</sup> This has a clear benefit for patients who, because of the use of metaphors, may now better understand their condition, but the corollary must also be true (following Byrne), that the professional has a better understanding of the patient’s situation.</p>
<p>This enhancement of communication is picked up in a different way in a number of papers and relates to the way in which metaphors overcome the barriers of communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451948">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451948">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312451948">19</xref></sup>. Husband and Broaddhus demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of metaphor in relation to children’s literature. For them, the pattern is that of <italic>problem identification</italic>, followed by a metaphor presenting a <italic>workable solution</italic>, which then requires a <italic>personal attachment</italic> of the relevance of the metaphor by the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451948">13</xref></sup> This is a common assertion amongst the papers reviewed, with others speaking of metaphors promoting discussion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312451948">19</xref>(12)</sup> illuminating situations and allowing the emergence of new ideas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451948">13</xref>(11)</sup> and leading to creative insights into ourselves and the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451948">17</xref>(215)</sup> Lyndsay’s idiosyncratic paper on ‘dying dragons’ suggests that metaphoric constructs also enhance learning ‘through the creation of mental images that help to establish connections between known and unknown’, which assists with understanding new or unfamiliar concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451948">18</xref>(4)</sup> There is a sense here that in the face of complex phenomena, <italic>rational concrete language</italic> reaches its limits, and in order to grasp the complexity one must resort to metaphor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451948">12</xref>(347)</sup> This may indeed be why people turn to poetry and the poets in times of dislocation and crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312451948">3</xref>(179–80)</sup> However, this creation of new ideas and concepts is not all the patient’s responsibility. Several articles speak of the <italic>co-construction</italic> of metaphors by patient and professional together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451948">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216312451948">27</xref></sup> This is where the professional ‘unconsciously feeds metaphors into the session and a subsequent metaphor appears to have been generated solely by the client’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(348)</sup> Spall exemplifies this via a case study in which, because the professional was ‘talking with her hands’ and moving them around and around, the client ended up describing their situation as ‘like a stew in a saucepan’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(349)</sup> The metaphor which emerged proved useful for the patient in promoting further thinking about their situation.</p>

<title>Metaphor enables the verbalisation of difficult and sensitive subjects</title>
<p>One of the specific modes of metaphoric operation relates to the verbalisation of sensitive and difficult areas. In her detailed and complex article, Karen Kuchan details the way in which metaphors work as part of an inter-textual web which allows patients to speak of their situation in illuminating ways in order to create new ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451948">16</xref>(2)</sup> Her various case studies (which predominantly endorse a religious and spiritual orientation and centre on contemplative prayer) deal with patients’ metaphorical expressions as they relate to the concept of the divine. Irrespective of the particularity of the religious orientation of this paper, Kuchan shows that metaphorical speech gives one patient new insight into the concept of compassion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451948">16</xref>(11)</sup> This echoes Taylor’s findings in a practice report: ‘Metaphor provides a gentle way in … This means a family can talk about something very complicated and it might only be at the end of the conversation that you relate the metaphor to what is happening’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312451948">22</xref>(19)</sup> The majority of the articles reviewed suggest mechanisms on this trajectory: metaphor allows for the expression of complex ideas as an augmentation to rational, concrete linguistic forms.</p>
<p>However, there is another element of metaphor which allows for verbalising sensitive issues, and that is the way in which metaphors can bring <italic>distance</italic> to the patient’s situation. The idea is that by avoiding the stark language of death and dying, metaphor allows people to speak about their illness and the future in a new way.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312451948">22</xref>(19)</sup> Spall et al. make this case: ‘People may use metaphors to avoid using words like cancer or death. They can thereby express how they feel without using words which will make them feel uncomfortable, e.g. “it feels like I have come to a full stop,” rather than “I am going to die”’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451948">20</xref>(349)</sup> Hutchings expands on this and likens metaphor to <italic>a dance of many veils</italic>, describing it thus: ‘To use the language of the poet, we want to dance with many veils, veils that allow our patients to peek through to their prognosis without being blinded. We want to share a truth without the glare of reality.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451948">14</xref>(282)</sup> For her, it is the multiplicity of metaphoric meanings, and the patient’s safety in expression, which are key to the dance of veils.</p>

<title>Metaphor produces benefits for patient care</title>
<p>One further assertion regarding patients’ use of metaphor relates to pain management. Berry contends that by reframing pain metaphorically there might be a reduction in the barriers to pain management for caregivers and patient. Her study revolves around the perceptions of relatives of the patient in response to the patient’s pain. She found that pain, ‘controlled or not, remained an indicator of the resident’s disease progression and overall status’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451948">9</xref>(24)</sup> and asserts that ‘the interpretation of adequate pain management is critical to family members’ constructing meaning around their relative’s pain’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451948">9</xref>(26)</sup> In this study she points out something which is under-explored in the literature, namely the unhelpfulness of some metaphors. For example, one relative, for whom pain was a metaphor for death, speaks of the patient’s pain getting worse, and comments there is nothing that can be done because it ‘is kind of indicative of where things are going’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451948">9</xref>(24)</sup> Thus the link between pain and death meant that inadequate pain relief was sought for the patient; a feature which Berry thinks can be minimised by professionals explaining the cause of pain to families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451948">9</xref>(26)</sup></p>

<title>Summation</title>
<p>Within this section we have provided an analysis of the reviewed papers which delineates their theoretical foundation on metaphor. Most papers rely on theoreticians who propose a view of metaphor as <italic>creative and revelatory</italic> and in which metaphoric utterances are viewed as having multiple meanings. The metaphors themselves can be placed into broad categories which illustrate how patients might speak of their condition. That some key motifs emerge from this, like <italic>war</italic> and <italic>journeying</italic>, should not minimise the range of potential metaphors which can be created by the patient within any given situation. Finally, there seems to be general broad agreement within the papers as to the mode of action of metaphoric utterances, i.e. what metaphors actually do. They seem to enhance communication; allow sensitive subjects to be dealt with, providing benefits for patients in these areas; and, when tackled aright, might possibly impact on the area of pain management.</p>

<title>Developmental trajectories: Furthering the work on metaphor within palliative care</title>
<p>The papers included within this literature review demonstrate that there is an emerging literature with regard to the usefulness of metaphor in dealing with patients within a palliative care setting. This small but significant body of work makes assertions, based on certain theorists of metaphor, which – if proven correct – could be applied to palliative care and provide benefit for the patient. It would, therefore, be disappointing if such a useful device as metaphor were not used to its maximum effect within this client group, given the contentions discussed. In order for metaphor to be used successfully, we suggest the following as possible developmental trajectories.</p>
<p>Firstly, whilst the literature reviewed is significant, it is noteworthy that there is a relative lack thereof, and indeed many of the papers discovered in the literature search related to the use of metaphor amongst health professionals rather than in direct patient interactions. It is also noteworthy that of the 14 papers, a significant number were reflections, reviews or philosophical analyses (<italic>n</italic>=10), whilst only four were qualitative or quantitative studies. It is not that only one type of research is needed; after all, in a field of study which incorporates a wide range of academic disciplines, it is essential to have a variety of research. However, there does seem to be a paucity of evidence-based research (either quantitative or qualitative) to substantiate the bold claims of many of the studies. Such research is not beyond the bounds of possibility and practicability, and we suggest that redressing the balance and undertaking more qualitative and quantitative endeavours would only strengthen the position of the papers in this literature review.</p>
<p>Secondly, and closely allied with the first point, a more rigorous definition of terms is necessary. Nowhere in the literature surveyed is there an adequate definition of metaphor. Nor is there much precision regarding the way in which metaphor differs from or exhibits similarities to some other figures of speech (e.g. analogies, narratives, personifications). It seems to us that unless one is clear about terms (and one can be clear about terms),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216312451948">36</xref>(189)</sup> it is difficult to circumscribe the trope and defend the view that a metaphor is a metaphor. Similarly, there is need for a rigorous theoretical position with regard to how metaphor functions. We have shown that the theoretical underpinnings of the work of metaphor in palliative care have emanated from secondary literature, particularly Lakoff and Johnson. This is satisfactory, but again, to substantiate the bold claims for the function of metaphor it may be necessary to have more substantial theoretical underpinnings gleaned from primary theoreticians such as Paul Ricoeur. It will be noted that Ricoeur is indeed amongst the theorists in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216312451948">Table 3</xref>, but use of his theories tends to come from those schooled in the humanities and philosophical disciplines rather than those within the medical and palliative care setting. A thorough-going Ricoeurian model applied to palliative care may bring benefits and flags up the need for inter-disciplinary academic working.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the prevalent view in the papers included suggests an overwhelmingly positive function for metaphor within palliative care. Here – and this is where the lack of a robust theoretical underpinning might hamper debate (and a rigorous theory might bring benefits) – there is a need for more clarity about the risks of engaging with the patient’s metaphoric usage (already alluded to by Berry above). Indeed, Ricoeur’s post-modern theory on metaphor notes the risk inherent in any form of language utterance, in that it is capable of multiple meanings:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312451948">5</xref></sup> for comfort or for upset. A metaphor which might bring solace to one person might be a marker of terror for another; this metaphoric function should not be discounted, especially in the context of possible distress caused to the life-limited patient. So, for example, ‘the dance of veils’, which has been viewed positively by Hutchings as a way of addressing the patient’s situation circuitously, may be viewed entirely differently: namely, as a an avoidance of ‘the real’ and a way for professionals to collude in the repression of emotions. This would, therefore, be contrary to the argument that metaphor use is a way of ‘sharing the truth without the glare of reality’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451948">14</xref></sup> A clear post-modern theoretical underpinning for this work would allow for further exploration of these possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, work needs to be done on the way in which figures of speech interact. If metaphor is a powerful device for creating new possibilities in palliative care patients, then what other tropes and genres are there, and how might they interact? Already there is an emerging literature on the use of narrative in palliative care. How might this complement the study of metaphor; indeed, how might these two modes act in tandem? What of the use of poetry and art, of analogies and allegories? These ways of viewing the world are perhaps best not seen in isolation, and a more integrative view of metaphor’s position within the tropes might prove beneficial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the articles within this review have demonstrated the desire to show the usefulness of metaphor within palliative care. The studies have utilised theories of metaphor which view the trope as a creative and revelatory one, and have applied this to patient care. They have also shown something of the varied natures of the metaphors used by patients and the way in which they are thought to function. In my view (both theoretically and in practice) these points are well made, yet there is need for more evidence-based research, a rigour in defining terms, and a robust model for the operative mechanism of metaphor (amongst other tropes) if this trajectory of development in the use of metaphor is to be maintained and augmented.</p>
