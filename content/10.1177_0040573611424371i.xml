<p><italic>Hannah’s Child: A Theologian’s Memoir</italic></p>
<p>Stanley Hauerwas</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 288 pp. $25.00</p>
<p>After being named “best theologian in America” by <italic>Time</italic> magazine in 2001, Stanley Hauerwas asked a group of friends to offer counsel on how to spend an upcoming sabbatical. “Write your memoirs,” they told him. And he did. The theologian and ethicist who published scores of books and essays to help himself think through theological ethics and a whole range of medical and political problems has written a memoir to think his way through the life that has been given to him to live. More specifically, given all his published words about God and the Church, he wrote to see what evidence there is for the claim that God has made a difference in his life. In one of the book’s major themes—the importance of friendship—Hauerwas allows his friends to sift the evidence. On nearly every page, the reader is reminded of how he has been blessed by having so many good friends for so many years. Hauerwas even likens this work to an extended preface to a book acknowledging what he owes and to whom. Both lists are long.</p>
<p>Hauerwas’s memoir provides just enough personal history to frame his life without getting mired in details. His roots in Texas Methodism, working in the family business of bricklaying, and attending Southwestern University and Yale Divinity School before securing his first academic job at Augustana College, his second at Notre Dame, and his third at Duke provide the framework for the encounter of people and ideas that have formed his work. It is not just Karl Barth who shaped Hauerwas, though his influence is strong. Nor is it just his teachers at Yale (specifically, Brevard Childs, Paul Holmer, Julian Hartt, and James Gustafson) and his colleagues at Notre Dame (particularly John Howard Yoder and Alasdair MacIntyre) and later at Duke. It was also the pastors, college professors, neighbors, and academic administrators he met along the way. They all have major roles to play.</p>
<p>Hauerwas’s journey across the theological and cultural landscape of the last 50 years is one broadly familiar to many readers of <italic>Theology Today</italic>. Reading this volume gives readers a chance to consider their own journeys with the help of a lively and hard working mind. One of the things that makes Hauerwas’s account appealing is his honesty in admitting the many things he simply did not know about the way the ecclesiastical and academic worlds worked. How does a Methodist from Texas get to Yale Divinity School? He admits going there not knowing what to expect or even that a large percentage of students were preparing for the ministry. That was just the start. For such an accomplished theologian to repeatedly say, “I didn’t know that things worked that way,” or “I didn’t know what to say or do” in a particular situation is refreshing and encouraging to those of us who thought we were the only ones in the dark.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Stout wrote a publisher’s blurb for the book: “<italic>Hannah’s Child</italic> might well be Stanley Hauerwas’s best book. It is must reading for everyone who knows him, either firsthand or through his other writings.” I underscore Stout’s recommendation, though I want to make it clear that this memoir is not an introduction to Hauerwas’s thought. Nevertheless, a sympathetic reading of it will position any reader to read or remember Hauerwas with greater clarity and appreciation. To the student of Hauerwas, this book will stimulate many light bulb moments and connect a lot of dots.</p>
<p>A final note: early in the book, we read of Hauerwas’s marriage to Anne, a relationship that he portrays as being difficult from the start, because of both her family history of mental illness and his own inability to navigate those troubled waters. This is a sad thread through the book, but one that may give some comfort and even hope to anyone who has lived in a difficult marriage.</p>
