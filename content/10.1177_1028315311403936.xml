<abstract>
<p>International students’ adjustment to living in an unfamiliar cultural environment and studying in a different educational system and language has been a topic of much research. Literature has shown that support from the host community could be the difference between a smooth transition and one fraught with problems and difficulties. This article describes a “buddy project” used in an intercultural communication class in which each student was a buddy for a newly arrived international student for a semester. The purpose of the project was to give social support to international students in the crucial first few months of their sojourn while at the same time complementing host students’ class-based theoretical learning with practical, meaningful experience with peers from another culture. The article discusses the outcomes, challenges, and students’ evaluations of the experiential learning exercise. Recommendations for future projects are outlined.</p>

<p>International education is a “global export industry” in many Western, English-speaking countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai, McCall-Wolf, &amp; Kashima, 2010</xref>, p. 176). For New Zealand, the industry is one of the top export earners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311403936">Butcher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311403936">Ward, Masgoret, &amp; Gezentsvey, 2009</xref>). Apart from the obvious financial benefits for receiving institutions and the economy, “international students bring information (social, political, or economic) about their home countries and thus widen the instructor’s and the [host] students’ perspectives on the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311403936">Ladd &amp; Ruby, 1999</xref>, p. 363). However, for the international students themselves, going to university in another country can be a very challenging and often difficult experience.</p>
<p>International students not only face the same problems and challenges any student faces but also have the added issues related to living in an unfamiliar cultural environment and studying in a different educational system and language. It is well documented that the sense of disorientation, and sometimes alienation, felt can be overwhelming (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>). A support system could be the difference between a smooth transition and one fraught with difficulties. In fact, international students have identified, in particular, “having someone to support them in times of trouble or difficulty” as very important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>, p. 29).</p>
<p>However, literature has shown that finding such support, especially from the host community, can be extremely difficult for international students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311403936">Zhang and Brunton (2007)</xref>, for example, reported that 55% of the 140 Chinese students they surveyed in New Zealand “were dissatisfied with the availability of opportunities to make New Zealand friends” (p. 132). Yet relationships with local peers have been found to have a positive impact on the successful adjustment in the new country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311403936">Shigaki &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>). This article describes a “buddy project” used in an advanced intercultural communication class to connect host students with newly arrived international students to provide social support for the former and, at the same time, experiential learning for the latter.</p>
<sec id="section1-1028315311403936">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Contact and social ties with host people have been shown to facilitate and enhance international students’ experience and adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403936">Furnham &amp; Bochner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311403936">Shigaki &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311403936">Stone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311403936">Westwood &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403936">Furnham and Bochner (1982)</xref>, for example, state that if students “are introduced into a new society by close, sympathetic host-culture friends, the evidence indicates that they may encounter fewer problems than if they are left to fend for themselves” (p. 171). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311403936">Furnham and Alibhai (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403936">Kashima and Loh (2006)</xref>, among others, have found that having personal ties with locals helped students to adjust better psychologically. In a study conducted by a group of British academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403936">Elsey &amp; Kinnell, 1990</xref>), it was found that “the opportunity to meet and befriend British people, especially other students, was seen as important” (p. 9).</p>
<p>However, while it has been established that “the degree of social interaction between the host national and the sojourner is related to the latter’s adjustment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311403936">Furnham &amp; Alibhai, 1985</xref>), the level of contact between the two groups has been reported by many studies as low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311403936">Chang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311403936">Daly &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311403936">Marginson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311403936">Ward et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311403936">Ward &amp; Masgoret, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311403936">Westwood &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311403936">Zhang &amp; Brunton, 2007</xref>). The presence of a large number of international students on campus does not mean that contact will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311403936">Leask, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311403936">Todd &amp; Nesdale, 1997</xref>). In the New Zealand context, almost one in four international students in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403936">Butcher’s (2002)</xref> study never socialised with a New Zealander, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311403936">Ward et al.’s (2009)</xref> national survey showed that “voluntary contact with international students [occurred] on average ‘rarely’” (p. 89).</p>
<p>The low level of contact is despite international students’ desire to establish relationships with domestic students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403936">Kashima &amp; Loh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311403936">Ward &amp; Masgoret, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311403936">Westwood &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311403936">Zhang &amp; Brunton, 2007</xref>). Literature has shown that it is difficult for international students to make friends with host students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311403936">Campbell &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311403936">Westwood &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>). One reason often cited is international students’ lack of confidence in speaking English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403936">Elsey &amp; Kinnell, 1990</xref>). Another reason may be that local peers are reluctant or not interested in making contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311403936">Ward, 2001</xref>) or “not always responsive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403936">Andrade, 2006</xref>, p. 143) or that they expect the “visitors” to be the ones taking the initiative to get to know them rather than the other way around (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner, 2008</xref>). International students also perceive cultural differences, lack of common interests, and the different priorities to be hindrance factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner, 2008</xref>). Researchers have suggested that intervention programmes to foster connection between the two groups of students could be beneficial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of studies have reported the use, and positive effects, of peer-support programmes, variously called peer mentoring, peer network, peer pairing, or “buddy” projects, to help international students adjust to the new environment and overcome the problem of lack of contact with local students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311403936">Abe, Talbot, &amp; Geelhoed, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403936">Andrade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403936">Devereux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403936">Devlin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311403936">Geelhoed, Abe, &amp; Talbot, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311403936">Shigaki &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311403936">Stone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311403936">Westwood &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>). As the initial stage of the sojourn is where stress is at its highest—it is “a time of upheaval, of intense emotion” as students “struggle to establish communicative competence in academic and everyday life and to diminish loneliness and thoughts of home” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311403936">Brown &amp; Holloway, 2008</xref>, p. 238), intervention would be most helpful at this stage. As a researcher interested in the adjustment issues of international students, I wanted to find ways to help these newcomers in their first few months of life in New Zealand.</p>
<p>However, helping international students was not my only motivation. As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, it is necessary for educators to prepare students for the global workforce. As convenor of an intercultural communication class, I wanted to provide my students with meaningful, out-of-class intercultural encounters—that is, with experiential learning. Experiential learning means “learning from experience or learning by doing” (Lewis &amp; Williams, 1994, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403936">Hedin, 2010</xref>, p. 108). It involves “active participation of learners in events or activities which leads to the accumulation of knowledge or skill” (Yount, 2001, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403936">Hedin, 2010</xref>, p. 108). There is “a whole world outside the lecture hall, library, and the computer screen that needs to be experienced as a learning laboratory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1028315311403936">Wolsk, 2003</xref>, p. 90). Particularly for an intercultural communication class, “experiential methods are ideal . . . precisely because <italic>culture is experienced</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311403936">Cheney, 2001</xref>, p. 92, emphasis in the original). In addition, as “intercultural skills are essential for businesspersons in today’s market” (p. 90), it seemed appropriate that these management/business students should avail themselves of the opportunity to participate in intercultural communication afforded by the presence on campus of international students. The buddy project reported in this article was designed to allow students to do this while at the same time addressing the need of newly arrived international students for social support.</p>

<sec id="section2-1028315311403936">
<title>The Buddy Project</title>
<p>The project involved pairing 30 intercultural communication students with 30 international students at a university in New Zealand. The purpose was to have the host students be “buddies” to the international students for a semester, providing social support during the latter’s initial settling-in period. Among the host students, 10 were male and 20 female. The majority, 20, were New Zealanders (17 Pakeha,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1028315311403936">1</xref></sup> 2 Maori,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1028315311403936">2</xref></sup> and 1 Indian) whereas 5 were Chinese, 2 were Dutch, 2 were Korean, and 1 was South African. The majority of the international students were from China (19), whereas the rest were from the United States (2), Papua New Guinea (3), Singapore (1), Vietnam (1), Japan (1), Germany (1), Malaysia (1), and India (1). The group comprised 9 males and 21 females.</p>
<p>The buddy project, approved by the University’s ethics committee, was part of the assessment (worth 35%) of an intercultural communication course. It aimed to</p>
<list id="list1-1028315311403936" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>provide the host students with a practical and meaningful experience in intercultural communication that, in the process, would help them to understand concepts and theories covered in class and develop an understanding of their own intercultural communication competence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>help make international students’ transition and adaptation in the early stages a more positive experience by reaching out and offering a helping hand.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A week before the semester started, a letter was sent through the school’s international office to newly arrived international students inviting them to participate in the project. Students were also informed of the project during orientation. It was made clear to the students that the primary focus of the project was not to provide academic assistance but to offer social support during the initial period of transition and adaptation. To ensure that the students were truly “newly arrived” and had not had the experience of cross-cultural adaptation before, two criteria were used: one, they had to have arrived in New Zealand within 2 weeks before the semester started, and two, they must not have lived or studied in another country prior to coming to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Although only 30 could be accommodated, many more international students expressed interest in participating. As there was a time constraint in that the project needed to commence as soon as possible, the students were accepted on a “first come, first served” basis. The primary criterion for matching the buddies was gender. Students in both groups were asked whether they had a preference as to which gender they would like to pair up with. All but one buddy pairs were of the same sex. Field of study was not deemed to be important as the exercise had a social rather than academic focus.</p>
<p>In the first 2 weeks of the semester, the class, together with a consultant from the school’s learning development unit, went over the details of the project, discussed the expectations, and developed ground rules and procedures involved in being a buddy. We also brainstormed for ideas about the types of things international students may need help with and activities and events that students and their buddies could participate in and enjoy together. By the end of the 2nd week, every host student was given contact details of their international student buddy and was encouraged to begin the project by initiating contact.</p>
<sec id="section3-1028315311403936">
<title>Engaging in Intercultural Encounters</title>
<p>For the following 12 weeks, students were to keep regular contact with the buddy. Face-to-face meetings, on or off campus, were preferred although phone or email communication/interaction could also be made, especially to set up meeting times or organize events. The meetings or events, which would take place in locations and circumstances that both parties were comfortable with, could be purely social (e.g., chatting over coffee, going to lunch, attending movies, having dinner, watching and playing sports) or task-oriented (e.g., helping with banking or shopping, showing where various facilities were on campus or in town). The types of activity to engage in were at each student pair’s discretion but were focused on the international student—those that help to orient the international buddy to life at the university, in the community, and in New Zealand. However, although the host students should be buddy-focused during their encounters, they should at the same time use these opportunities to learn as much as possible about the buddy as a person and about his or her culture and communication and adaptation experiences.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the project, each buddy pair was required to get together with at least another buddy pair in a social event or activity. The purpose of this exercise was to help expand not only the international students’ social networks but also the hosts’. As well, during the 12-week period, some class time was set aside for students to share their experiences with classmates and help each other find ways to make the project more beneficial for both themselves and their buddies, as well as more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The host students were asked to keep the following research questions in mind throughout the project:</p>
<list id="list2-1028315311403936" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What were some major issues in the buddy’s transition and adaptation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What could they, as hosts, do to help?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: How did the exercise affect their own intercultural communication competence?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1028315311403936">
<title>Keeping a Reflective Journal</title>
<p>Throughout the 12-week period, the host students were required to keep a detailed journal of their encounters with the buddies. In it, they were to include any insights gained and record any challenges to their own or the buddy’s preconceptions and expectations. They were also to note agreements, convergences, changes, difficulties, and misunderstandings that occurred in each encounter. They were encouraged to not only describe the encounters but also reflect on them and look at issues critically.</p>
<p>The buddy pairs were expected to have at least eight entries that involved face-to-face meetings spread out through the period of the project. To help students pace their encounters, they were required to submit the first 4 entries by the middle of the project. The entries were expected to be at least half-a-page long although longer entries of 1 to 2 pages were encouraged. The journal, worth 10% of the course assessment, would be useful when students analysed their experiences and wrote up their reports at the end of the project. The journal was evaluated on the quality and quantity of the interactions with the buddy, detail of description, and evidence of personal reflection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1028315311403936">
<title>Evaluating the Experiences and Writing the Report</title>
<p>To make sense of the experiences and the emerging data, students were encouraged to engage in personal reflection both at the end of each encounter with the buddy and at the conclusion of the 12-week period. Guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311403936">Holmes and O’Neill’s (2010)</xref> framework for reflection, students were to reflect on issues such as the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1028315311403936" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What they had learnt about their buddy and his or her transition and adaptation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What they had learnt about themselves and their intercultural communication competence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How their observations, experiences, and insights might link with the learning they had been engaging with in class and in their readings;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whether theories and concepts they learnt in class in any way helped to inform their understanding of the buddy’s transition/adaptation issues;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conversely, whether their understanding of their encounters with the buddy challenged the theories and concepts they learnt in class; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How they had, or had not, changed as a result of this research project.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>At the conclusion of the project, students wrote a report that included not only the description of the project and the findings and their personal reflection but also their evaluation of the assignment and recommendations that would improve the assignment. The report was worth 25% of the course grade.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1028315311403936">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The students’ journals and reports were analysed using thematic analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311403936">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311403936">Owen, 1984</xref>). Overall, the students not only were positive about the project and the benefits they believed it provided but also pointed out some reservations and challenges. Positive outcomes from the host students’ perspective, responses from the international student buddies, and challenges are presented below.</p>
<sec id="section7-1028315311403936">
<title>Positive Outcomes</title>
<p>Four major themes emerged from the data, about the learning that took place during the project, the practical experience the project afforded, the personal satisfaction and inspiration the host students felt, and the effect of the project on intercultural communication competence.</p>
<sec id="section8-1028315311403936">
<title>The learning</title>
<p>The comment that came up time and time again in students’ reports was that they “learnt a lot,” as one student put it. Students most often mentioned that they learnt about the culture of their buddies. The following quote by a Pakeha student was typical: “I was able to learn a lot more about the Chinese culture and the different values of their culture.” However, they learnt not only about the specific culture of their buddy but also about the general concepts of culture and communication, as comments from the following Pakeha students show:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This project has enhanced my awareness of cultures around me. It helped me to learn the value of communication and the importance of sharing cultures with different people.</p>
<p>This project has opened my eyes to the importance of understanding culture’s impact on communication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Through their buddies, students also learnt what it was like to be transplanted into a different culture and gained a better understanding of international students and the kinds of issues they had to deal with during the transition and adaptation process. A Pakeha student commented, “Through the buddy project, I learnt how daunting it must be to come to a country so different from your home country, with different food, language, people, cultural values, rules, and systems.” Seeing how their buddies struggled to communicate in English, and in some cases being in a situation where the host students themselves were the ones who could not communicate, was an effective eye opener. One Pakeha student related this experience with his Chinese buddy, when the shoe was on the other foot:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the parts that I enjoyed although it felt a little uncomfortable was when I went to Max’s house for dinner. Although this was uncomfortable as I could not necessarily communicate with his flatmates [all Chinese], it was a good experience as I was able to understand what Max goes through everyday that he is in New Zealand. This led to me being a lot more patient when communicating with my buddy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another important understanding that emerged is exemplified in the following quotes from two Pakeha students:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>An aspect that I was not aware of before undertaking this assignment is that Asian students want to make friends with New Zealand students.</p>
<p>From this research, it was discovered that a major issue facing Larry [Chinese student] was establishing friendships with New Zealanders as they had a very low tolerance in taking the time to communicate with him.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apart from the difficulty in making friends with local peers, students learnt that language and food were other main problems faced by international students. <italic>Halal</italic> food, for example, was found to be a major concern for Muslim international students.</p>
<p>The learning that occurred as a result of participating in the project was, however, not all about the international buddy. Another significant benefit often reported is that the host students also learnt about <italic>themselves</italic>. The experience during the project led many students to examine their own identity and culture as well as their intercultural communication competence, as the following quotes show:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Until this paper, I had not really looked at what it meant to be me. I call myself a Kiwi<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1028315311403936">3</xref></sup> but I have never really looked at what this entailed. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>The research assignment was a really effective way to learn about my cultural identity and intercultural communication competence. (Indian)</p>
<p>I have become great friends with my buddy and she has helped me to understand myself and my intercultural communication competence better. (Korean)</p>
<p>I had never really thought deeply about my culture and how different or similar it was to other cultures. By interacting with Zhan [Chinese buddy], I moved through the stages of cultural identity spoken of by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311403936">Samovar, Porter, and McDaniel (2007)</xref>. . . . The project has given me a framework to begin interpreting my experiences with others and seeing how and why they differ to mine. I now appreciate why others act the way they do and not base everything on my ethnocentrism. (South African)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experience during the project helped many students to recognise their communication tendencies and style and to link them to intercultural communication competence.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This assignment was a prime opportunity for me to analyse my own intercultural communication competency. I believe that Keiko has taught me how to be more tolerant of silence and to use that time wisely to form my own thoughts and ideas. (Maori)</p>
<p>Now that I am aware of my tendency to dominate the conversation because it is the way I deal with my feelings of uncertainly and anxiety, I have become more comfortable with allowing for pauses during our conversations. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Students indicated that it was important to know themselves and their tendencies towards certain behaviours: “By being aware of these attributes I believe that I can improve my own intercultural communication competence, which will enhance the communication experience for both parties” (Pakeha student). To be able to communicate with their buddies, students had to adjust themselves in relation to these tendencies. As a result, they reported that they had acquired skills such as speaking more slowly, not dominating the conversation, being patient, and not always jumping in whenever there was silence. Students felt that these skills were helpful in improving their intercultural communication competence.</p>
<p>Host students who were international students themselves also learnt new ways of doing things that contributed to successful communication with their buddies. One Chinese student, who was paired up with a student from Papua New Guinea, told of her experience with previously uncomfortable behaviours: “To my joy, I am used to hugging and kissing each other’s cheeks now; it was really impossible and embarrassing for me before.”</p>
<p>It can be concluded that the experience engendered ample learning for the host buddies. A student, South African, summed up the learning aspect of the project thus: “I set out initially to be a support for Zhan [Chinese buddy], but at the end of the project, I feel she taught me more than I might have taught her.”</p>

<sec id="section9-1028315311403936">
<title>Practical experience</title>
<p>The students were overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity for out-of-class experience in intercultural communication, as evidenced in the following quote by a Pakeha student: “Intercultural communication competence is a complex and multi-faceted subject that is easier to understand when experienced first-hand.” Students believed that such experience “in the long run will prove to have great worth in working in a multicultural work environment” (Pakeha student). This experience is particularly important for those students who would otherwise not have an opportunity or would not have availed themselves of opportunities that exist in the university and community, to engage with people from other cultural backgrounds:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I definitely enjoyed having the opportunity to meet and socialise with someone from a completely different background to myself. It was great that the course forced me through assessment to do this as I do not believe I would have done it otherwise. Actively involving students creates an opportunity to engage in interaction that would otherwise not occur. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>The assignment helps me—an international student—to have positive experiences through an opportunity to communicate with Danielle, who is from the country [Papua New Guinea] that I might never come into contact with in my home country. (Chinese)</p>
<p>This assignment has provided me with an experience I otherwise would not have experienced as I would probably have not undertaken such a task. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Students indicated that the practical experience complemented the class-based learning, as the following excerpts show:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am extremely glad I was able to participate in this project. You can only learn so much from a textbook and lectures and this project allowed me to test my knowledge in a practical situation. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>My understanding of intercultural communication has improved vastly due to both the buddy project and the paper as a whole. I have learnt theories and have been able to discover the thinking behind the experience. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The practical experience helped to enhance their emerging understanding of intercultural communication. The following comment by a student, South African, was typical: “I got to understand that intercultural communication is not just about communicating with a person of different culture; it’s also about learning why they do what they do.” In their attempt to make sense of their experience with their buddies, students applied theories and concepts learnt in class to events and incidents from their encounters. This link between theory and practical experience is illustrated by the following quote:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In researching culture shock, I was pleased to find that activities Crystal [Chinese student] and I have been participating in are things that can help improve her transition to New Zealand. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311403936">Samovar et al. (2007)</xref> recommend four ways to improve an individual’s transition: make friends, learn about the host culture, be patient and participate in cultural activities. I think we have achieved this by spending quality time together, sharing our cultures by visiting the Chinese Garden at the Hamilton Gardens and seeing things in the New Zealand Souvenir shops and participating in cultural activities by attending a dancing lesson and watching a non-English movie. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The concept most often mentioned, explicitly or implicitly, by students was that of stereotype, as illustrated by the following comments by two Pakeha students:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This project had made me think more about stereotypes and how I sometimes think about people in a certain way, just because of how they look or talk.</p>
<p>This project has allowed me to break stereotypical thoughts and focus on learning and interacting with people from other cultures and situations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many found their stereotypes challenged, even shattered, as the following comment, by the Indian host student, shows: “I realised after meeting my [Korean] buddy that people are more than their cultures, as she broke all stereotypes that are mentioned about the South East Asian culture.” Similarly, the following quotes are comments on Chinese buddies:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She was not my view of a “typical” Asian student (focused on studies). She was outgoing, loved clubbing, and [was] proactive in associating with students of different cultures. Her being different enabled me to think about our interactions deeply, confirming, challenging, questioning and modifying my preconceptions. (South African)</p>
<p>I had a mental picture of all Chinese students being academic over-achievers. . . . This preconception was destroyed through interacting with Han. Our interactions showed me that Chinese students can be, and are, just as “normal” as the average Kiwi student. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiences regarding stereotypes are summed up by one Pakeha student:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have learnt from this buddy project that we should not make assumptions about other cultures on the basis of our incomplete knowledge that we have in regard to others and their differences. Just because we have these predetermined perceptions and expectations, they are not always accurate and, like the saying “you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,” I found this to be completely relevant as these perceptions, expectations, and attitudes can be adjusted once you get to know a greater level of depth as to what helps to build a person, as I did in this case when I got to know and learn more about Karen [Chinese student] and her culture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Stereotypes were not the only theoretical construct that students related to their experiences with the buddies. The concepts of ethnocentrism and face also came up often in students’ discussion, as examples from two Pakeha students attest:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This assignment has also helped me acknowledge the times when I am being ethnocentric or when I am applying stereotypes, and this will help not only my intercultural communication but my general communication also.</p>
<p>I now have knowledge of cultural harmony and “face.” This had made me realise that when an international student agrees with me they don’t necessarily understand what I am saying, so it pays to be very clear and clarify what I say.</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1028315311403936">
<title>Personal satisfaction and inspiration</title>
<p>Students’ comments suggest that even though the project was an assignment, most students found it, either in part or as a whole, enjoyable:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I really enjoyed discussing Judith’s culture, and it was very interesting learning about all of her traditions and how some were very similar and others were very different to my own. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed each and every aspect of the buddy project. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition, many students also felt some personal satisfaction from being able to help international students settle in, an experience that they evaluated as rewarding:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The biggest benefit of being a buddy was helping someone with their transition and adaptation in New Zealand. . . . It was an educational and fulfilling experience to help an international student make their transition and adaptation into New Zealand a more positive experience. (Indian)</p>
<p>From this assignment, I had some personal satisfaction in improving Larry’s transition and adaptation into New Zealand as he had the chance to use me for any problems and tasks he needed assistance with. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>It was very rewarding and satisfying to know that I had done a small part for one person in helping them to incorporate and integrate themselves into our society and making a lifelong friend in the process made it even more gratifying. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>Spending time with Keiko was truly an honour and I enjoyed getting to know her and helping her out. (Maori)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the host students, an international student herself, told of how she felt being buddy to a newly arrived Muslim student from Malaysia, relating it to her own experience a few years earlier:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel fulfilled to help her, and keep her on the right track. When I came here, no one helped me to adapt here, and I spent a lot of time to find out how to live in a strange country, so I’m really glad to use my own experience to tell a newly arrived international student which way is easy and useful. (Chinese)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With more knowledge and understanding about international students, their cultures, and the intercultural communication process, many host students felt inspired to continue to connect and engage in future. They expressed their resolve to be welcoming and to embrace international students or generally to expand their intercultural horizon:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[The project] made me want to reach out more to new international students because if, like Mary, they do not even get to interact with any New Zealanders it is sad, and I think they [host students] should be encouraged to as much as possible go out of their comfort zone. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>This project has definitely made me more aware of what international students go through when they travel abroad. . . . As a result, I plan to be more interactive with [them], especially second language learners who I believe have the most difficulty in adjusting to our society. (Maori)</p>
<p>Being a buddy has benefited me as I now want to get more involved with other cultures. I want to learn another language and travel to some different places. (Pakeha)</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1028315311403936">
<title>Intercultural communication competence</title>
<p>Thus far, students’ comments show that they found the project a good and worthwhile one in a number of ways. However, did they feel the project helped to enhance or improve their intercultural communication competence (ICC)? Most students believed that it did, as some of the comments below demonstrate:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The project definitely added to my intercultural communication competence, particularly when it comes to communicating with someone whose first language is not English. Being patient and slowing down my speech were vital when I was talking to JingJing. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>The main benefit for me from this project is that I now think I have the tools required to competently communicate with people from different cultures to my own. Before this project, I knew I could communicate with people from other cultures, but now I think I can do it well. In our first encounter, I had to make sure that I spoke slowly, clearly, and was very patient in order to ensure that Judy understood me. (Pakeha)</p>
<p>An overall lesson I learnt from the project is that part of being a competent communicator when dealing with people from other cultures is to be patient and not to assume too much or too little—being open minded is essential. (Indian)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Students believed that as a result of the project, they had a greater capability to communicate and interact effectively in different intercultural environments. It has to be kept in mind, however, that the assessment of improved ICC was based on self-perceptions and not on any actual measurements. Therefore, it needs to be taken with caution. However, students’ comments—about the increased knowledge they had of another culture; the new understanding of international students and the issues they face in their quest for adaptation; the new skills acquired such as speaking more slowly and using appropriate vocabulary; and being sympathetic and patient—suggest that factors inductive to intercultural competence were being fostered.</p>
<p>Not all students felt that the project helped to improve their ICC, however. Even though they were positive about the benefits of the project, both to host students and to international students, five students reported that the project did not have much effect on their level of ICC. This was, they claimed, because they had already had extensive experience interacting with people of different cultural backgrounds, either through their multicultural upbringing or through travelling or working in different countries, and as a result they believed that their ICC was already well developed.</p>

<title>Challenges</title>
<p>The project was not without some difficulties. Some students found the exercise to be a challenge, albeit “an excellent challenge,” as one student put it. Two major themes emerged: the nature of the project and the time/timing issues.</p>
<sec id="section14-1028315311403936">
<title>Nature of the project</title>
<p>Some students did not go into the project willingly and felt that the interactions with their buddies felt somewhat “forced,” not spontaneous. They believed that the project should be optional rather than compulsory, so that students could choose to participate of their own free will. However, they also acknowledged that if the project was not compulsory, they would not have volunteered to participate and thus would very likely not have had the opportunity to engage in intercultural communication and benefited from it as they did.</p>
<p>Some students also felt uneasy being required to communicate with a “stranger” from a different culture, as it took them out of their “comfort zone.” At the beginning, they felt apprehensive, even negative, for various reasons. For example, they were worried that the exercise might not be beneficial, that the buddy might not enjoy meeting up with them, or that the project might be time-consuming. The fact it was assessed also added a level of stress. However, as time went on and they had got to know their buddies, they felt more and more positive, as the quotes from two Pakeha students show: “My attitude changed and I became very enthusiastic about giving her as much help as I could” and “It felt less and less like a project and more like a normal friendship.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1028315311403936">
<title>Time and timing issues</title>
<p>Another challenge mentioned by many students concerns time. Students, both host and international, were full-time students, and many also worked part-time. One of the issues, therefore, was that it was difficult to find free time to meet their buddies, especially free time that was mutually convenient. Many students suggested that the number of face-to-face encounters be reduced as well as the project duration be increased to spread out the workload more.</p>
<p>Students also felt that starting the project on the 2nd week of the semester was too late, as international students would need help as soon as they arrived, which is before the semester started, not 2 weeks into it.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1028315311403936">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this section, I will discuss the findings in terms of the two main objectives of the project: to provide my students with experiential learning and to help make the transition and adaptation process a less daunting one for some international students.</p>
<p>It is clear from what the students reported that the exercise did provide the majority with meaningful, positive intercultural experience that they would otherwise not have. The experience helped them “learn a lot” about the culture of the buddy, their own cultures and identities, and the communication challenges for both parties, an outcome that is supported by other cross-cultural communication projects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311403936">Campbell, 2008</xref>). One of the stated objectives of the overall course was for students to appreciate cultural diversity. The exercise certainly helped the class to achieve this goal. Although we can learn about intercultural communication from lectures, textbooks, and research articles, there is no denying that direct involvement with someone for an extended period—that is, experiential learning, or learning by doing—would have more impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311403936">Campbell, 2008</xref>). Experiential learning requires self-reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311403936">Holmes &amp; O’Neill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311403936">Kolb, 1984</xref>). Through reflection, students in the project achieved self-awareness and increased sensitivity to differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311403936">Gu &amp; Maley, 2008</xref>). Moreover, it helped students to relate what they experienced to what they learnt in class. Such connection made theory come alive and become more meaningful and understandable for the students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311403936">Campbell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Engaging with international students on a more personal basis also enabled host students to move from the “front stage” in the local–international student relationships to the “back stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311403936">Cheney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1028315311403936">Varner, 2001</xref>). Prior to the buddy project, most of the host students’ knowledge about international students would have been based only on what they could directly see (the front stage). Interacting with international students during the buddy project, however, allowed the host students to go beyond the front stage and understand the reasons and values behind what they observed (the back stage). The comments by host students, reproduced below, clearly show that they had been “back stage”:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The project has given me a framework to begin interpreting my experiences with others and seeing how and why they differ to mine. I now appreciate why others act the way they do . . .</p>
<p>I got to understand that intercultural communication is not just about communicating with a person of different culture; it’s also about learning why they do what they do.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311403936">Brown and Daly (2005)</xref> found that “[New Zealand] local students have a more closed attitude and are less able to empathise with people from different cultural backgrounds” (p. 95). There was plenty of evidence in this study, however, that the experiential learning, and the accompanying back-stage information, helped host students to overcome these tendencies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403936">Brebner (2008)</xref> also found in her study, it helped students to challenge their ethnocentrism and stereotypes, increase their cultural awareness, and expand their worldviews, resulting in a better understanding and appreciation of—even sympathy towards—international students.</p>
<p>In relation to the second objective of the project, the exercise succeeded in bringing the two student groups together and getting them to interact. As mentioned earlier, the presence of cultural diversity does not automatically lead to intercultural contact. For the understanding and the relationship between the two groups to occur, interaction is necessary. However, left to its own devices, interaction is unlikely to happen, as much literature has shown (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311403936">Leask, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311403936">Todd &amp; Nesdale, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311403936">Ward &amp; Masgoret, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311403936">Zhang &amp; Brunton, 2007</xref>). Comments by a number of host students attest to this assertion. For host students, the buddy project provided them with the push they needed. For international students, being paired with a host student means that the biggest stumbling block in the path towards making friends with local peers was removed. The overwhelming amount of interest in the project expressed by international students also confirms that there is a need for this kind of intervention.</p>
<p>Peer support in various forms, including student pairing, has been found to be beneficial to students new to the university (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403936">Glaser, Hall, &amp; Halperin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311403936">Peat, Dalziel, &amp; Grant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311403936">Stone, 2000</xref>). Research has shown, as mentioned earlier, that it can be particularly helpful to newly arrived international students as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311403936">Abe et al. (1998)</xref>, for example, found that international students who participated in their peer programme study showed significantly higher social adjustment scores than those who did not. Feedback from international students in the buddy project lends support to this claim.</p>
<p>Researchers have found that having local friends is a major factor in adjustment. International students themselves have identified linking them with a volunteer willing to befriend them as an important service they wish the university to offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>). However, in the buddy project, host students were surprised to learn that their international peers wanted to make friends with them. This knowledge is significant in that it helped host students to realise that they had the power to make a difference, as a Pakeha student demonstrated:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel I have learnt a considerable amount about not only Steven [Papua New Guinea buddy] and the way international students feel and integrate themselves, but also of how being a friend and making an effort can speed up this process for them and not make international students feel so alienated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Being a buddy also helped address a related issue—international students’ lack of confidence in speaking English, which is often cited as a major factor in the low level of interaction with local counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403936">Elsey &amp; Kinnell, 1990</xref>). International students have identified linking them with people who can “spend time conversing with them in English” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>, p. 29) to be one of the most important types of support. It is clear from both groups of students in the buddy project that the pairing provided the latter with an opportunity to practise speaking English in a nonthreatening environment. The increased level of speaking confidence reported by the international student buddies confirms this point.</p>
<p>Helping international students to have a local connection is a good start. However, research has shown that the more local ties they have, the better their adjustment is likely to be, as mentioned earlier. Rosenthal, Russell, and Thomson (2006, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311403936">Cunnington &amp; Reid, 2008</xref>) believe that “social connectedness is a critical factor in the international student experience” and “a fundamental dimension of students’ experience of well-being” (p. 3). Social networks are important because they reduce students’ isolation and increase their sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403936">Glaser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311403936">Peat et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, “where students feel a sense of belonging and acceptance into [the] new environment, they are more likely to make the effort required to adjust to the changes in their lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311403936">Stone, 2000</xref>, p. 55). The buddy project was designed to help expand international students’ social networks by encouraging buddy pairs to get together with one or more other student pairs at least once. In fact, host students recognised the potential for increasing social connectedness and suggested that more joint encounters be required in future iterations of the project.</p>
<p>Participating in this type of peer support benefits not only the new students but also the host students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>). Self-reports of experiences of host students in this project confirm the findings from previous research. The opportunity to learn about other cultures, helping to make a difference to someone’s life, and gaining greater understanding of what it is like to be an international student were some of the gains reported by host students in Gresham’s evaluation of the International Students Care Program at the University of Newcastle in Australia. Host students in the present project reported similar benefits.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The buddy project was a research assignment involving pairing up host students and newly arrived students for a semester. The goal of the project was to provide host students with meaningful experience communicating with someone from a different culture while at the same time helping international students with their social adaptation. Despite some initial concerns, host students were overwhelmingly positive about the project, stating that it was a great way to provide students with practical experience relevant to learning intercultural communication. The experience complemented and enhanced their theory learning, challenged their stereotypes, and helped improve their intercultural communication competence. Host students believed that what they gained from the project, such as being more accepting of people’s differences, was valuable and would be “a good grounding for [their] entry into today’s multicultural workforce.” They also believed that “the buddy project can be a useful tool in facilitating a smooth transfer to life in New Zealand for international students.” This view was echoed by international student buddies, who were very positive about the experience. It can be concluded, therefore, that the buddy project is a pedagogic tool that instructors can use to benefit both groups of students.</p>
<p>The buddy project also confirms what many previous studies have recommended—that intervention is needed to increase cultural contact (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311403936">Cunnington &amp; Reid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311403936">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311403936">Todd &amp; Nesdale, 1997</xref>). Although there is “a general willingness to engage in more frequent intercultural interactions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311403936">Ward et al., 2009</xref>, p. 89), it is evident that domestic students need a strong motivation to engage. A project such as that reported here, which benefits not only international students but also host students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403936">Gresham, 2003</xref>), can provide such motivation.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Following are the recommendations the students made for adapting or fine-tuning the project:</p>
<list id="list4-1028315311403936" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>That the buddy project be continued in the intercultural communication course but as an optional assignment to make sure that the host students are willing and enthusiastic. This is certainly possible, although it would be interesting to see how many students would choose this option, taking into account the self-admitted tendency to avoid situations that take them out of their comfort zone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>That the project starts at least a week before the semester begins, preferably sooner, to maximise the benefits for the international students. This suggestion, although ideal, may be difficult to adopt in terms of the logistics involved, as most host students are usually not back on campus until just before the semester starts and the course convenor does not get to meet them until the first class session. It is, however, not impossible. The problem would be that the number of host students available would be much smaller, and the number willing to start work before the official commencement of the semester smaller still. Such an early start would also mean those who came later but who would like to participate would be excluded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>That the duration of the project be extended to ease the time pressure. This option could easily be adopted as the duration could be adapted to suit the time constraint of each course.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>That the number of face-to-face encounters be reduced. This is also possible, as other means of communication can also be used, but care has to be taken that the buddies do not end up being “pen pals.” Doing things together and talking face-to-face are important to developing interpersonal relationships.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>That buddy pairs get together with other pairs more often than once. Depending on the time frame of the project, this recommendation could easily be implemented.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>That a whole-class get-together be arranged. While the recommendation has merit, in terms of time and logistics the event could be difficult, although not impossible, to organize.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This article has discussed the project as an exercise for intercultural communication students. However, it could be adapted for use in other courses. All students, not just those taking intercultural communication classes, can benefit from being more culturally aware and developing intercultural competence. Of course, the project would require varying degrees of adaptation to suit the specific nature and objectives of particular courses. For courses which already have an international or intercultural dimension, instructors should be able to incorporate the project without much further work. Such courses include business communication and international management. The project could also be adapted for language courses. Students studying Chinese and Japanese, for example, would benefit from being paired with Chinese and Japanese international students, respectively. Writing courses could also use a similar project as a basis for practice in reflexive and journal writing.</p>
<p>Some of the student recommendations outlined above should be helpful for those wishing to fine-tune the project for their classes. In addition, instructors could seek to further facilitate interaction by increasing the buddies’ common grounds. One way of doing this is to match students, as far as possible, according to their fields of study (for example, an accounting host student being paired with an accounting international student). This would increase the pool of things the buddies have in common and could talk about. Another way to help enhance interaction is to ensure buddies are not very different in age. When the age gap is wide (for example, one buddy in his or her 30s or 40s and the other in his or her early 20s, as was the case with a few pairs in my project), the students may find fewer things in common. Therefore, “mature students” should be paired with mature students if possible.</p>
<p>Thus far, the buddy project has been discussed as a course-based exercise. However, the concept may also be adapted for implementation as a more general, faculty-wide, or even university-wide, project, although a number of changes would need to be made. Obviously, domestic students’ participation would be on a voluntary basis. As no grade would be assigned, the incentive for participation would need to be of a different nature. In today’s world of interconnectedness and culturally diverse workplaces, it should not be difficult for students to be convinced of the value of intercultural experience and skills for their future careers. Another incentive could be in the form of a certificate awarded at the end of the project—something that would add value to their résumés.</p>
<p>Also, the project would be run slightly differently. It would not be appropriate to require volunteers to keep a journal and write a long analytical report, as was the case with the project described in this article. However, domestic volunteers, as well as their international buddies, could be asked to report to the project coordinator periodically, such as once every 2 or 3 weeks, instead. This would help the coordinator to monitor the progress or otherwise of each buddy pair and ensure a measure of quality control.</p>
<p>A project such as this would need support at the faculty, or university, level, as some financial resources may have to be allocated or redistributed. A university-wide project, for example, would be likely to require a full-time coordinator. It is reasonable to assume that gaining support from universities that are explicitly committed to providing international education would be comparatively easier. In any case, it is recommended that a smaller scale project, such as one at the faculty level, be trialled first as the costs would be smaller or could possibly be absorbed within the existing structure. This is what is being planned, in collaboration with my faculty’s international office, as the next step following my successful class exercise reported here. Once the benefits of such a project are demonstrated, gaining approval, and the necessary funding, at the university level may become easier.</p>
<p>In today’s world of cultural diversity, our job as educators is to prepare our students to be global citizens. To that end, the presence of international students on campus is a great opportunity to provide domestic students with intercultural experience. At the same time, we also have the responsibility to help international students settle in their new environment. This article has shown that a buddy project can help us achieve both.</p>
