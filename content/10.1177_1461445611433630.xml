<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the ways in which a group of four-year-old children co-constructed friendship networks when they began primary school in Wales, UK. This discussion has emanated from a wider study of the everyday social interactions children engage in when new to their school environment. The children’s interactions were investigated through the use of an inductive, ethnomethodological approach through the combination of conversation analysis (CA) and membership categorization analysis (MCA). The transcriptions revealed that the children used the collective pro-terms ‘we’ and ‘us’ in order to explicate affiliations and exclusions with their peers in their everyday social interactions. These findings offer an insight into the daily social organization processes children engage in and suggests their preference for exclusive dyadic friendships. The article also reveals the social competencies which four-year-old children have in accomplishing social organization.</p>

<title>The importance of researching friendships</title>
<p>Prior research investigating friendships has used both quantitative (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433630">Bagwell and Coie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445611433630">Barry and Wentzel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445611433630">Hodges et al., 1999</xref>) and qualitative (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433630">Avgitidou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445611433630">Peters, 2003</xref>) approaches which are designed to answer specific questions with regard to issues associated with these relationships. Friendships have been identified as multidimensional and complex relationships where differences between general peer acceptance and close dyadic friendships are acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433630">Lindsey, 2002</xref>). From a psychological perspective, children who are victimized by a group of peers find it easier to cope with the situation if they have a close friend to confide in; having a close friend reduces incidents of victimization and increases good humour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433630">Gifford-Smith and Brownell, 2003</xref>). Quality friendships are ‘essential for individual well-being, and for emotional and social support’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433630">Danby, 2008</xref>: 38), whereas having one close friend is suggested to be more important in combating being bullied than having a large number of friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>). Children who report having good quality friendships have higher self-esteem, less feelings of loneliness, better general peer interactions and do better at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445611433630">Doll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433630">Gifford-Smith and Brownell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445611433630">Hodges et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461445611433630">Ladd, 1999</xref>). In addition to these benefits, having a close friend at school has also been found to support the often difficult transition to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433630">Danby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445611433630">Peters, 2003</xref>). This is apparent for young children where ‘the presence of friendships appeared to go a long way towards establishing a positive experience of school’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445611433630">Peters, 2003</xref>: 52). The research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445611433630">Peters (2003)</xref> is particularly significant, as children who are new to the school environment can experience feelings of stress and low emotional well-being which can lead to aggression and disaffection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445611433630">Fabian and Dunlop, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research into the relationship between friends as protection from bullying found that there were many social support behaviours evident in the playground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>). It was also found that children with friends were alone less, and were therefore less vulnerable to acts of bullying. Children who were peer rejected were often on their own and classed as unpopular, therefore this legitimized the bullying behaviour ‘because of the knowledge that they are not popular within the peer group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>: 113). However, although these negative social experiences are emotionally traumatic for the victimized children, children build resilience through repeated experiences as they develop coping strategies which help them through emotionally difficult situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445611433630">Grotberg, 2001</xref>). In these situations peer support plays an essential part in the development of emotional resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445611433630">Grotberg, 2001</xref>). This is important from an early age as children who are emotionally resilient in preschool are less likely to experience depression and anxiety in later childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445611433630">Conway and McDonough, 2006</xref>). Having a group of friends, or having a best friend or two, helps protect against becoming a victim of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, friendships can involve negative aspects as well as providing close social support for the members. This is upheld by research which found that the intricate groups and dyads of girls’ friendships also encourage negative indirect aggression as relationships and emotions are discussed more openly, therefore influencing social manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433630">Bjorkqvist and Osterman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445611433630">Goodwin, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433630">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433630">Kyratzis, 2000</xref>). Other problems initiated in small exclusive friendships include children intervening in established friendships and telling lies as a form of indirect aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445611433630">Evaldsson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433630">Garandeau and Cillesen, 2006</xref>). In these circumstances the perpetrator appears innocent to adults and therefore averts punishment whilst also causing trouble for their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433630">Garandeau and Cillesen, 2006</xref>). This demonstrates children’s competency in engaging in the practice of morality when co-constructing social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461445611433630">Tholander and Cromdal, forthcoming</xref>) and how these strategies are often unnoticed or misinterpreted by teachers when incidents occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445611433630">Evaldsson, forthcoming</xref>). However, having a wider circle of friends also has its problems. Being in the presence of many peers does not offer the same unique support as exclusive dyads and may also make each person feel less responsible for engaging in negative actions due to deindividualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461445611433630">Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research into delinquent friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433630">Giordano et al., 1986</xref>) found that the members were more likely than less delinquent peers to disclose private and personal information to each other and believed that their friends cared and trusted them. Furthermore, these aspects along with the loyalty between the members provided ‘significant benefits from their friendship relations’ (p. 1192) and it was consequently suggested that ‘these results simply reflect a different friendship style that should not be viewed as either positive (attached) or negative (cold and brittle)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433630">Giordano et al., 1986</xref>: 1192).</p>

<sec id="section2-1461445611433630">
<title>Peer preference and rejection</title>
<p>Investigations into children’s friendships have found that social networks can be described as either inclusive or exclusive peer interactions where it is observed that social networks are an inclusive concept, whereas social groups involve ‘clusters’ of peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445611433630">Cairns et al., 1995</xref>). In groups and close dyads there is a commonality of principles which members are bound to where they are at risk of rejection if they deviate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433630">Christensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433630">Evaldsson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>When investigating childhood relationships through peer preference it has been found that children will use deliberate types of behaviour to initiate friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433630">Corsaro, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433630">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433630">Cromdal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1461445611433630">Warden et al., 2003</xref>). This is mirrored in further research investigating the complexities of peer preference in friendships, which suggests that children display behaviour which is conducive to their acceptance by peers as a prerequisite for establishing friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433630">Avgitidou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433630">Berentzen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433630">Corsaro, 2003</xref>). Later, more dyadic or specific friendships are observed once the children have been in school for a longer period of time. As friendships emanate from expected and experienced encounters, the initial year when children meet involves frequent general interactions which then settle into closer friendships over time as they determine who their preferred friends may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433630">Gifford-Smith and Brownell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433630">Kyratzis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461445611433630">Martin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In relation to this prior research, it is evident that friendships are a valuable social resource which offer essential emotional support for all children. Regardless of whether friendships are labelled as delinquent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433630">Giordano et al., 1986</xref>) or prosocial, the importance of close dyadic relationships is essential for all children. It is therefore argued here that it would be more accurate to acknowledge that all children have a degree of competency in engaging in friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445611433630">Bateman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433630">Bateman and Church, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433630">Berentzen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433630">Evaldsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433630">Kyratzis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1461445611433630">Sheldon, 1996</xref>). In order to gain a greater insight into how friendships are initiated, an ethnomethodological approach is argued for here as the close, iterative analysis afforded offers a unique opportunity to look at four-year-old children’s initiation and maintenance of relationships in an inductive way without the limitations of predefined categories.</p>

<title>Collective pro-terms</title>
<p>Ethnomethodology emanated from a desire to investigate the complex and detailed mechanisms of everyday social order in various groups within society and is linked to the sociological work of Goffman and Garfinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611433630">Attewell, 1974</xref>). Conversation analysis (CA) and membership categorization analysis (MCA) are prominent forms of ethnomethodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461445611433630">Maynard and Clayman, 1991</xref>) and are used within the present research discussed in this article. However, this article does not aspire to articulate the many valuable aspects of CA or MCA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445611433630">Hutchby and Woofitt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1461445611433630">Schegloff, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1461445611433630">Sidnell, 2010</xref> for introductions), but aims to offer an insight into how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks’s (1992a)</xref> ‘collective pro-terms’ apply within the boundaries of the current investigation concerning children’s friendships.</p>
<p>In his lecture ‘<italic>A collaboratively built sentence; The use of ‘‘We</italic>”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 144–9, original italics), Sacks refers to how the use of collective pro-terms works to make a group of people demonstrably identified as together or belonging to the same category. Collective pro-terms are words such as ‘we’ and ‘us’ which are everyday utterances used by people to assert membership and affiliation to a chosen category, and in doing so emphasize that such a pair exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>). The use of collective pro-terms works to affiliate a person with another person through establishing a relational pairing; this creates a verbal connection to another group or person who may not be physically present at the time. Collective pro-terms such as ‘we’ are used to establish a unified collection of members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>). This verbal affiliation to a category set is therefore demonstrable in aligning members who are a part of the referenced group, and those who are not. Members orient to collective pro-terms when associating themselves with a group or ‘establishing a cohort and organizing collective action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433630">Butler, 2008</xref>: 94). The use of collective pro-terms facilitates the social organization between members and establishes order within the local context.</p>
<p>This article now presents an analysis of four-year-old children using the collective pro-terms ‘we’ and ‘us’ in the co-construction of their friendship networks in their new primary school playground. These findings are discussed in relation to each interaction where the social competencies of peer preference and peer rejection as an effective alignment are considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461445611433630">
<title>Researching children’s social interactions</title>
<p>The main study was initiated in order to observe how four-year-old children use their behaviour to initiate and maintain social organization. In Wales, where the study took place, children start school at the age of four years and so the research was conducted approximately three weeks after the children had begun their first day at their new primary school. It was anticipated that the new school context would present an opportunity for the children to display social organization strategies to configure new social relationships. This would therefore provide opportunities for the observation of how children co-constructed their new social worlds.</p>
<p>In order to achieve consent for the data collection, a meeting was planned with the head teacher and class teacher of the four-year-old children from the chosen primary school to explain the details of the data collection procedure and to provide an opportunity for any subsequent questions. A consent form was signed by both teachers at this meeting and parental consent forms explaining the details of the study and offering a contact phone number were then passed to the class teacher to distribute amongst the pupils. Twenty-nine forms were given to the children to take home and a total of 13 children returned their forms with parental signatures giving consent for their children to be involved in the study. A time and date was then arranged with the class teacher for a discussion with the children about the research and to ask if they would like to participate. The video camera was passed around the children for them to become familiar with the research tools whilst it was explained that, if they participated, they would wear the MP3 player and be videoed for one of their morning playtimes. All 13 children agreed to participate. Once consent was given by all the participating parties the research began.</p>
<p>Thirteen four-year-old children from a rural primary school in Mid-Wales were recorded and videoed during their morning playtime, one child per morning over a three-week period. The participants included children from middle-class families whose ethnicity was predominantly white British. Six girls and seven boys participated, giving an almost equal gender distribution. One child from the participating group was selected as ‘target child’ for one morning break time each. The length of audio and video footage was in keeping with the school’s morning playtime duration. After each playtime the footage was downloaded onto a secure, personal computer and placed in a file titled with the child’s codename. Four hours and five minutes of audio footage, and three and half hours of visual footage were collected over the three-week period. More audio footage than video footage was gathered as the MP3 player was turned on before the researcher took their video position and began visual recordings.</p>
<p>As the research was inductive, once the data had been collected the files were viewed to see if there were any emerging themes which the children oriented to throughout their playtime. Recurring themes were found during the data which revealed the children’s interests in an inductive way. It was noticed within this process that the children used the words ‘we’ and ‘us’ in their social alignments with each other and so those interactions were transcribed for further investigation. The selected footage was transcribed using Jefferson’s conventions described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461445611433630">Sacks et al. (1974)</xref> and analysed using CA and MCA principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461445611433630">1992b</xref>) (a list of transcription conventions is supplied in the Appendix). CA and MCA reveal the complex turn-by-turn actions which work to co-produce the friendship networks between the children.</p>

<sec id="section6-1461445611433630">
<title>Establishing an exclusive dyad</title>
<p>To begin an investigation into children’s friendships from an ethnomethodological perspective, a discussion into how these interactions are initiated is primarily useful. The initiation of a friendship is observable in this first interaction where Tina, Jess, Ian and Sally are inside a hut in the school playground. Tina begins her sentence through the use of a collective pro-term (line 40) to affiliate herself to Ian. However, Ian subsequently refers to a family member with a possessive pronoun ‘my mum’ (line 41) which prevents this affiliation from being successful. Tina then offers another attempt at affiliation (lines 47 and 49).</p>
<graphic id="img1-1461445611433630" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433630-img1.tif"/>
<p>Following Tina’s successful access to Ian’s hut she self-selects the initiation of a topic for conversation and projects her utterance towards Ian to take the next verbal turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461445611433630">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>). Tina uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ in her utterance to affiliate herself to Ian as she begins to suggest a collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433630">Butler, 2008</xref>) in which they could participate together. This begins a suggestion which ties Tina and Ian to the same category by using the collective pro-term ‘we’. Through Tina’s selection of the term ‘we’ when referring to herself and Ian she makes her willingness to be affiliated to him demonstrably relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 344).</p>
<p>However, Tina’s utterance is overlapped by Ian, who employs the use of the possessive pronoun ‘my’ as he begins saying ‘my mum’. This possessive pronoun coupled with the orientation to a member from the MCD ‘family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 228) presents an exclusive affiliation between Ian and his mum as a dyad which is independent of the current playground context. This utterance separates Ian from the members present, and in doing so excludes Tina’s suggestion of herself and Ian having an exclusive affiliation. By overlapping Tina’s assertion of involving him in an exclusive affiliated action, Ian stops this from happening and asserts an affiliation to someone else.</p>
<p>Ian then activates a self-initiated repair as he breaks off from his announcement (line 41) and then quickly latches onto the end of the cut off to extend it (line 42). Although Ian has co-operated in sharing his snack with Tina he now initiates a rule which is tied to this sharing. This rule only permits Tina to have one snack as Ian informs them that it is his mother’s choice that he is not allowed to share more than one. Ian’s assertion of a rule legitimizes his reason for disallowing Tina to eat more of his snack and, as such, reveals the competent way in which such rules are used by children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 497; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461445611433630">Tholander and Cromdal, forthcoming</xref>). In this rule, Ian verbally orients to his mother as a figure of authority who supports Ian’s earlier announcement (line 42). This external affiliation gives Ian support in asserting his announcement as it is no longer recognized as Ian’s suggestion to exclude Tina, but the decision of a person of authority whom he has an affiliation with. In suggesting that it is his mother’s idea to only allow his peers one snack, Ian legally evades any responsibilities which his actions may provoke. This is a demonstration of the acceptance of a legal rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445611433630">Cobb-Moore et al., 2009</xref>) by the other members as it is not questioned.</p>
<p>Following a brief announcement from Bev, Tina returns to her interaction with Ian. In this turn Tina initiates a conversational repair sequence as she uses a pause filler ‘um’ in the transitional space available and goes on to employ a question–answer sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461445611433630">Schegloff, 1992</xref>) with Ian. Through directing a question towards Ian, Tina initiates a question–answer sequence where Ian is more likely to offer a subsequent verbal interaction towards Tina in the form of an answer, thereby prolonging the interaction between the two participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461445611433630">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>). In her question to Ian, Tina uses an offer of an invitation to her party using the same possessive pronoun as Ian had used in his prior turn, ‘my’. Tina also mimics Ian’s prior utterance structure by making reference to an affiliation with an external category, which in this instance is her party. This use of a possessive pronoun together with an invitation to an external gathering beyond the social context of the playground works as a further offer of affiliation to Ian as the initial attempt failed. Ian replies with an insertion which serves to deflect asserting an immediate answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461445611433630">Schegloff, 2007a</xref>). Tina marks this as other-initiated repair as she repeats her utterance with the same intonation and emphasis, further asserting her attention to be affiliated to Ian. Ian uses his next turn to accept Tina’s offer by saying ‘okay’.</p>
<p>Tina began the sequence by a suggestion of affiliation between Ian and herself through the use of the collective pro-term ‘we’, but this was not immediately taken up as Ian disaffiliated himself by orienting to his affiliation with a member of the ‘family’ category. Tina subsequently uses a possessive pronoun with an offer to her party to initiate affiliation with Ian. This second attempt at asserting affiliation with Ian is successful as Ian accepts her offer. Tina has achieved her desired result of becoming friends with Ian.</p>
<p>This interaction demonstrates the way in which exclusive dyads are initiated between children in their everyday social situations. The following observations follow this with an insight into how, once exclusive friendships have been initiated, they are protected and maintained.</p>

<title>Protecting an exclusive dyadic friendship</title>
<p>The following interaction shows an offer of affiliation which is immediately declined by both members of an exclusive dyad. Emma approaches Kerry and Kathy and asks Kerry if she wants to play mums and dads. Kerry rejects Emma’s offer and uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ to explain that they are already involved in a game of families. Kathy aligns with Kerry’s explanation with a simple, yet effective ‘no’.</p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445611433630" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433630-img2.tif"/>
<p>Emma begins the interaction by calling Kerry’s name and immediately giving an offer of affiliation as she asks Kerry if she would like to play mums and dads (line 32). Kerry responds very quickly to decline Emma’s offer by latching onto the end of her utterance. In Kerry’s utterance she uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ to demonstrate that she is already affiliated to Kathy in her account of why she cannot play with Emma. This displays children’s use of rules for social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445611433630">Cobb-Moore et al., 2009</xref>) and has similarities with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433630">Evaldsson and Tellgren (2009)</xref> where pre-school children also used the collective pro-term ‘we’ in their exclusion of a peer in their play activity. This use of ‘we’ establishes Kerry and Kathy as belonging to an exclusive friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 344), and in doing so excludes Emma from also becoming affiliated.</p>
<p>Kerry’s rejection also orients to a distinction between playing ‘mums and dads’ and playing ‘families’. Although these games may be perceived of as similar due to them both incorporating imaginary play involving members belonging to the family category, they are recognized as different category sets by Kerry in the present situation. This differentiation is invoked to locally manage the social organization in conjunction with an assertion of being in an exclusive friendship through the term ‘we’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433630">Evaldsson and Tellgren, 2009</xref>), and is used by Kerry as an account for the decline of Emma’s offer. Through this interaction Kerry and Kathy demonstrate that they are affiliated through the use of a collective pro-term ‘we’ and that there are a limited number of members in their dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 678). Kerry and Kathy’s exclusive affiliation is heard as exclusion by Emma and this is displayed in her subsequent reaction as she walks away from the girls, back towards her hut (line 36). Kerry and Kathy have successfully managed to protect their exclusive dyadic friendship.</p>
<p>This observation demonstrates the way in which exclusive dyads are protected by the members when they are at risk of being no longer exclusive. The members of this interaction made it quickly observable that they did not want another member to join in. It was immediately understood by the potential intruder who did not argue, but accepted this exclusive alignment and moved on. In the following excerpt the understanding takes a little longer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1461445611433630">
<title>Persisting with the protection of an exclusive dyad</title>
<p>Katie and Mel have been observed in a close friendship in many playtimes before this observation. In this interaction, Tina approaches Katie and Mel. In lines 19–33 Katie notices that Mel and Tina are involved in an interaction and reacts to this by telling Tina not to play with them. However, when Katie bends down to tie her shoelace Mel initiates an interaction with Tina.</p>
<graphic id="img3-1461445611433630" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433630-img3.tif"/>
<p>At the beginning of this interaction (lines 19–21) Tina places her hand on Mel’s shoulder and leans in to her, but this is responded to as an illegal action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461445611433630">Tholander and Cromdal, forthcoming</xref>) immediately by Katie who is a long established friend of Mel. This is demonstrated in Katie’s verbal and non-verbal actions (line 22) as she looks towards Tina and tells her ‘no’ in quite a forceful way. This is understood as an exclusion by Tina, who demonstrates this intersubjectivity in her next action as she removes her hand from Mel’s shoulder and steps backwards (lines 23–4). Tina and Mel’s brief interaction is noticed as an affiliation by Katie, who subsequently demonstrates that she perceives an affiliation between Mel and Tina as threatening to her exclusive affiliation with Mel in her next action, where she tells Tina ‘don’t play with us’ (line 30). Katie uses the collective pro-term ‘us’ in her utterance to create a ‘them’ and ‘us’ situation as referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445611433630">Grad and Luisa (2008)</xref>, and in doing so affiliates herself and Mel into an exclusive category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 344) of which Tina is not a member. This works to exclude Tina from Katie and Mel’s dyadic friendship.</p>
<p>Katie’s exclusion is hearable by Tina who asks Katie for an account for her exclusion in her sequential utterance, ‘why’ (line 31). Katie provides an account for excluding Tina in her utterance, ‘coz I said so’. It is recognized by research that the use of the expression ‘I’ works to assert a person of authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461445611433630">Hanks, 1992</xref>) and this is evident in Katie’s account in this situation. In doing so, Katie ‘maps’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433630">Butler, 2008</xref>) herself as having more power than Tina and Mel. The use of physical gestures to support verbal actions is evident in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433630">Goodwin (2006)</xref> and observed here where the verbal exclusion of Tina is subsequently supported with a physical gesture. This is apparent where Katie holds Mel’s hand and runs into the playground with her away from Tina. In this section of the interaction Katie has initiated all of the actions of exclusion towards Tina and makes it demonstrably noticeable that Katie and Mel are in an exclusive friendship. However, Tina does not hear this as a legitimate reason for being excluded, which is seen in her sequential action where she physically holds onto Mel to follow Katie and Mel into the playground. As Mel and Katie run away from Tina into the playground, Tina holds onto Mel’s sleeve and follows them in a similar way to the ‘tag-along girl’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433630">Goodwin (2002</xref>: 723), which demonstrates that these unequal relationships are evident in children’s interactions which are years and countries apart.</p>
<p>In lines 33–43 Katie notices the physical interaction between Mel and Tina, stops running and reiterates her intention to have exclusive affiliation with Mel by physically separating them. Tina hears that she has been excluded from this exclusive dyad as she remains on her own whilst the girls run off together. Tina then runs towards Mel and Katie and catches up with them. In the next sequence of interaction (lines 43–56 below) Tina initiates an interaction with Mel by orienting to coats as a conversational item.</p>
<graphic id="img4-1461445611433630" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433630-img4.tif"/>
<p>Tina runs up to Mel and Katie and opens a new interaction with Mel as the exclusion she has received so far has been initiated by Katie. Tina begins her utterance with ‘I’ and immediately changes this to the collective pro-term ‘we’ (line 49). In doing so, Tina changes her potential alignment from being an independent member to affiliating herself and Mel as a collective dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445611433630">Lerner and Kitzinger, 2007</xref>). Tina has creatively taken advantage of the current situation where Katie is wearing a coat and Mel and Tina are not. This situation is used by Tina to assert a visible and legal affiliation to Mel. Tina not only uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ to verbally align with Mel in the first instance, but also proceeds to use ‘we’ a second time in the same utterance (line 49).</p>
<p>In Tina’s assessment of the current situation, not only does she affiliate herself and Mel through the collective pro-term ‘we’, but she also orients to the category bound activity (CBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 301) of wearing coats as the legal rule for being affiliated; Katie is the only one out of the three to be wearing one. The CBA of not wearing a coat therefore establishes Tina and Mel as being affiliated through belonging to the same category set and excludes Katie as she does not conform to the correct CBA to be a member of the same category. Through using the collective pro-term ‘we’ in reference to herself and Mel, Tina establishes affiliation between them and in doing so, excludes Katie. This strategy for affiliation with Mel works as Mel aligns with Tina in an agreement to her assessment that they do not need to wear coats because ‘now it’s gone warm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433630">Butler, 2008</xref>). Through offering this assessment Mel aligns herself as having the same opinion as Tina and affiliation is gained.</p>
<p>Katie asserts exclusive affiliation with Mel at the beginning of the interaction through using the collective pro-term ‘us’ when referring to herself and Mel. The use of a collective pro-term works to place herself and Mel in the same category and in organizing this dyad she also excludes Tina. This initiates a pattern of exclusion as Tina subsequently affiliates herself and Mel as belonging to the same category through also using a collective pro-term which now excludes Katie. At the end of this interaction Tina has achieved her goal of being affiliated to Mel. This is demonstrated as they display physical affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433630">Goodwin, 2006</xref>) by holding hands and walking into the playground together. This detailed analysis indicates that initially Katie and Mel were in an exclusive friendship, but through the persistence of Tina’s actions and particularly her use of the collective pro-term ‘we’, the social organization changes where Tina becomes accepted as part of the friendship.</p>
<p>This observation demonstrates that the protection of exclusive dyads is not always successful. Even though one member asserts the protection of an exclusive dyadic friendship, the other member also needs to align with this protection in order for this to be legitimately acceptable. In this observation, the dyad was open to other members as the exclusivity was not protected by both members. Another way to ensure the exclusivity of dyadic friendships is highlighted below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1461445611433630">
<title>An exclusive place for an exclusive dyad</title>
<p>Three boys have approached Katie and Mel and have been questioning Katie’s legitimacy for wearing the MP3 player. Mel closes the interaction physically by putting her arm in-between Katie and the boys and turning Katie away from them. The boys then move into the playground leaving Katie and Mel to walk in the opposite direction and discuss strategies for avoiding further contact with the boys.</p>
<graphic id="img5-1461445611433630" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433630-img5.tif"/>
<p>Mel demonstrates her affiliation with Katie throughout this observation. Initially this is shown with a physical gesture as Mel aligns Katie away from the boys and then proceeds to put her arm around her and hold her hand. These types of physical gestures have also been observed to be used in the co-construction of affiliation in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445611433630">Goodwin, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433630">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433630">2006</xref>). Through these physical actions affiliations become observable by surrounding members of the playground.</p>
<p>The affiliation that Mel marks in her physical gesture is further reflected in her verbal actions as she subsequently uses the term of endearment ‘babe’ (line 60) in a tag-position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461445611433630">Jefferson, 1973</xref>) at the end of her turn at talk. This is then followed by Katie’s astute suggestion of using a gender specific place to avoid further interaction with ‘those’ boys. Mel’s use of the term ‘those boys’ suggests that there is ‘clearly a category that is in alternation to some other category’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 149). In this instance the alternative category is supplied by Mel on line 65 where she uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ in reference to herself and Tina. Through Mel’s sequence of utterances it is observable that ‘those boys’ are a separate category to Tina and Mel.</p>
<p>Mel aligns herself to be in agreement with Katie’s suggestion of going in the girls’ toilets through her assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461445611433630">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>) of Katie’s idea. The sequences of affiliation between Katie and Mel over these turns is reiterated as Mel uses the collective pro-term ‘we’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 333) to place them in the same membership category as an exclusive dyad who are affiliated independent of others (line 65). This observation demonstrates the children’s competence in using their environment to ensure the exclusivity of their friendship is guaranteed.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that verbal reference to being an affiliated member of a dyad or group was made by the children using the collective pro-terms ‘we’ and ‘us’ as a resource. The children used these collective pro-terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433630">Sacks, 1992a</xref>: 344) to verbally affiliate themselves with another person in order to make it observable that such an affiliation, or friendship, existed. These utterances were used by the children to express a display of affiliation which the children had with other members and made these affiliations observable and demonstrably relevant to the people who were present. However, although the collective pro-terms ‘we’ and ‘us’ worked to demonstrate an affiliation with another member or members, it subsequently also excluded members who were not accepted as being part of the exclusive dyad presented.</p>
<p>Within these observations it is evident that the social alignment of exclusive friendships came into play. In the first observation Tina attempts to assert an exclusive friendship with Ian through her reference to the collective pro-term ‘we’. In observation two Katie and Mel are already in an existing exclusive friendship, which is made explicit by Katie’s use of the collective pro-term ‘us’ in her utterance ‘don’t play with us’; as this friendship is threatened by Tina’s approach she is consequently excluded by Katie. Tina then asserts the use of ‘we’ to align herself with Mel and is then accepted as she walks away into the playground with both Mel and Katie. Observation three provides an instant and effective demonstration of Kerry and Kathy aligning themselves as being in an exclusive friendship as they exclude Emma when she approaches with an offer of affiliation. Finally, Katie and Mel align themselves as being in an exclusive friendship through the use of the collective pro-term ‘we’, which is referred to in the social organization of the environment to maintain their exclusive dyad independent of ‘those boys’.</p>
<p>The findings therefore align with prior literature investigating children’s friendships which suggest that close, tight friendships offer important support for the members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433630">Fox and Boulton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433630">Gifford-Smith and Brownell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433630">Giordano et al., 1986</xref>). This research also aligns with the growing body of literature concerning children’s friendships from an ethnomethodological perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433630">Butler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433630">Church, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433630">Cromdal, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433630">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433630">Danby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445611433630">Danby and Baker, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445611433630">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445611433630">Evaldsson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433630">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445611433630">forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433630">Evaldsson and Tellgren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445611433630">Goodwin, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445611433630">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433630">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433630">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433630">Kyratzis, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433630">2004</xref>). The findings from this research offer further insight into how children’s affiliations and friendships are initiated and locally managed by the participants themselves. An important aspect of this research is the discovery of similarities between the findings of this study and similar ethnomethodological studies which were conducted years and countries apart. This was particularly evident in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433630">Evaldsson and Tellgren (2009)</xref>, where the same age group of children were also found using the collective pro-term ‘we’ to co-construct their social alignment in Sweden. This study also had similar findings to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433630">Goodwin (2002)</xref> as both studies had the presence of a ‘tag-along girl’ who attempted to access an already established friendship. Therefore, the light that this research brings to early childhood research and practice is the acknowledgement that children worldwide are using these strategies when co-constructing social alignment on an everyday basis. This research offers detailed and valuable accounts of how children go about initiating friendships in their everyday social worlds and also demonstrates that the process can be equally as cruel as it is pleasurable. In doing so, it aligns with other ethnomethodological studies which also find children’s social organization processes to be astonishingly cruel and competent.</p>
<p>A new and important finding from this research is that of the children’s orientation to the initiation and maintenance of exclusive and dyadic friendships. This is particularly interesting as it indicates that the close, dyadic friendships which have been found to afford the most support for children are the very friendships which children actively seek out and maintain. This research demonstrates the remarkable creativity and astute social competencies apparent in the social organization processes of four-year-old children, but also raises the obvious question for early childhood teachers: What about the children who are excluded in the process?</p>
