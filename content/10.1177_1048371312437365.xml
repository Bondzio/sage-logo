<title>What Is Creativity?</title>
<sec id="section2-1048371312437365">
<title>How Can It Be Fostered in General Music Classrooms?</title>
<p>When asking students in my college methods courses to provide their definitions of creativity, they often find providing succinct answers difficult and elusive. Terms they commonly associate with creativity include originality, progressiveness, uniqueness, and imagination. Many also believe that creativity involves more than making something new; the novelty must have value or meaning. When asked how they would foster creativity in their future classrooms, few hands are raised and the answers provided more tentative.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>General Music Today</italic> (<italic>GMT</italic>) is a special focus issue on creativity and composition. In formulating this brief editorial, I was reminded of Arthur Koestler’s—author of <italic>The Act of Creation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371312437365">1964</xref>)—words: “Creativity is a type of learning process where the teacher and pupil reside in the same individual.” Although some educators refer to a reciprocal process of teaching and learning that occurs between teacher and student, Koestler asserts that during creativity an individual fulfills both roles. Important questions for general music teachers to ask include: How do educators promote creativity on a daily basis? and How do educators encourage students to reflect on the value or meaning of their creations and those of their peers?</p>
<p>In a previous <italic>GMT</italic> article on creativity, I wrote that children—within their everyday activities—are naturally and spontaneously creative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312437365">Campbell and Scott-Kassner (2002)</xref> also identified the natural “creative impulses” of children (p. 271). To build and expand on children’s creative spontaneity and promote successful composition activities, a general music teacher can use the following five suggestions as a guide:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371312437365" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Allow time for multiple encounters with composition activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage student experimentation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Guide the class through composition experiences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide constant encouragement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Refrain from applying adult parameters and expectations to the students’ products. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312437365">Cooper, 2005</xref>, p. 6)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to providing opportunities for students to exercise their creative abilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312437365">McCarthy (1997)</xref> reminded readers of the social process involved in creativity and composition. She provided six “Insights for Classroom Practice” in regards to these types of activities. Her insights are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-1048371312437365" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The concept of creativity focuses on variation or transformation of material already familiar to the musicians.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Communal music making allows for variation in individual creative ability.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creativity is developed through immersion in communal music practices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Communal creative music making has inherent musical and social values and rewards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The audience plays a critical role in the total creative process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Research on group composition, in both school and community contexts is limited. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312437365">McCarthy, 1997</xref>, pp. 13-15)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A general music teacher, equipped with the knowledge of activities to include and the social factors to consider during creative and compositional activities, must also be mindful of the power of “personal passion for creating.” A teacher’s passion and excitement is contagious.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The passionate teacher fully believes that learning is fun, satisfying, and self-reinforcing. He believes that how he talks about this specific topic and the ways he leads students to experience it can make each lesson more engaging. He builds lessons that are intrinsically rewarding. Students learn almost without noticing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371312437365">Steele, 2009</xref>, p. 187)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Be passionate. Be creative. Foster creativity in your classrooms. It is you, the teacher, who holds the key to cultivating creative activities with your students, and the benefits reaped from this cultivation will include classrooms of engaged, enthusiastic, and creative students.</p>
