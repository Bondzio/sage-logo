<abstract>
<p>Shifting drug use patterns away from traditional illicit drugs (i.e., heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines) and toward prescription drug misuse among adolescents necessitates a renewed theoretical emphasis in adolescent drug use research. Given the unique processes and perspectives associated with prescription drug misuse, theoretical connections to prescription drug misuse likely show different patterns than prior research has shown with marijuana and other illicit drugs. Using data from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the authors apply concepts of social control theory, social learning theory, and strain theory to prescription drug misuse and draw comparisons with the predictors of marijuana and other drug use. Findings indicate that social learning, social control, and strain measures exert unique and independent influences on all three categories of adolescent substance use. Despite the similar theoretical effects across categories of substance use, many notable differences in theoretical processes are evident, especially for prescription drug misuse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adolescent drug use has received a considerable amount of attention from social scientists over the past five decades. Beginning in the 1960s, theoretical assessments concerning adolescent drug use focused on the constructionist paradigms of conflict, labeling, and Marxist theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436654">Dichter, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612436654">Galliher, McCartney, &amp; Baum, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612436654">Goode, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0022042612436654">Reasons, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0022042612436654">Salmon, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0022042612436654">Sanders, 1975</xref>). At the same time, however, positivist theoretical approaches to adolescent drug use developed, with social control, social learning, and strain theories eventually coming to dominate academic inquiries to the causes of drug use by the late 1970s. Subsequent research on adolescent drug use has firmly established that social control, social learning, and strain variables all significantly predict adolescent drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612436654">Elliott, Huizinga, &amp; Menard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612436654">Hawkins, Catalano, &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>), with social learning measures receiving the most empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers &amp; Cochran, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436654">Dishion &amp; Loeber, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022042612436654">Kandel, 1973</xref>). By the mid-1990s, direct theoretical assessments of adolescent drug use waned, possibly due to the overwhelming support the three main positivist theories of deviance garnered in the decades prior.</p>
<p>In her editorial introduction to a special issue of <italic>Journal of Drug Issues</italic> devoted to the empirical validity of theories of drug abuse, Helene Raskin White noted that although the articles included in the special issue provide strong empirical support for the social control and social learning perspectives in predicting adolescent drug use, “it appears that we have not made very much progress in the last 20 years and we are stagnating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0022042612436654">White, 1996</xref>, p. 286). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0022042612436654">White (1996)</xref> suggested that studies of adolescent drug use continue to address the same theoretical processes and risk factors for drug use, and called for further elaboration of contemporary theoretical processes, opportunity structures, biogenetic factors, psychopharmacological properties of drugs, and risk factors in infancy and very early childhood. Although we do not argue with these calls for future research on adolescent substance use, we propose that theoretical debates of adolescent substance use are revitalized when classic criminological theories are applied to new and developing forms of adolescent drug use. Consistent with research that suggested there are specific theoretical mechanisms that contribute to adolescent drug use versus general delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0022042612436654">White &amp; Labouvie, 1989</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022042612436654">Kandel and Davis (1992)</xref> reported that the predictors of marijuana use, alcohol use, and the use of other illicit substances also differ substantially. Following these postulations, the current study assess the veracity of three major classic criminological theories (strain, social control, and social learning theories) in predicting a new and growing trend in adolescent drug use—prescription drug misuse.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, prescription drug misuse has increased substantially among adolescents (The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022042612436654">[CASA], 2005</xref>), with the prevalence of prescription drug misuse now greater than the prevalence of illicit drugs other than marijuana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436654">Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612436654">McCabe, Teter, &amp; Boyd, 2006</xref>; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612436654">[SAMHSA], 2006</xref>). Between 1992 and 2003, CASA indicates that prescription drug misuse among adolescents increased 212% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022042612436654">CASA, 2005</xref>), whereas other forms of illicit drug use have declined in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436654">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>). The 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reports that 21% of people in the United States age 12 and older report prescription drug misuse at least once in their life, with the highest prevalence rates of prescription drug misuse among adolescents and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436654">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2006</xref>). Given the relatively high rate of use and the associated public health concerns with the misuse of prescription medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022042612436654">Hurwitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022042612436654">Kollins, Barkley, &amp; DuPaul, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0022042612436654">Poulin, 2001</xref>), establishing theoretical foundations for prescription drug misuse is necessary.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran’s (1985)</xref> work that compared three theoretical explanations for adolescent marijuana use, we apply concepts from social control theory, social learning theory, and strain theory to the study of prescription drug misuse in the current project. We first assess the theoretical correlates of prescription drug misuse, and then compare the processes associated with prescription drug misuse to the processes contributing to marijuana and other illicit drug use.</p>

<title>Criminological Theory and Adolescent Drug Use</title>
<p>Early theoretical research on adolescent drug use was largely nontheoretical, primarily documenting the patterns and demographic characteristics of users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0022042612436654">Preston &amp; Fry, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0022042612436654">Smart &amp; Fejer, 1969</xref>) or challenging the legitimacy of illicit drug prohibitions through constructionist theoretical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612436654">Goode, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0022042612436654">Sanders, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0022042612436654">Reasons, 1974</xref>). The early positivist criminological theories outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0022042612436654">Nye (1958)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436654">Glueck and Glueck (1950)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612436654">Cohen (1955)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0022042612436654">Sutherland (1947)</xref>, however, gained traction in the study of drug use during this period as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612436654">Akers, Burgess, &amp; Johnson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0022042612436654">Reckless, 1973</xref>). Early positivist theoretical applications to drug use focused heavily on the principles of differential association/social learning theory. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612436654">Akers et al. (1968)</xref> provided one of the first applications of positivist criminological theory to the study of drug use, showing that physiological and social reinforcement adequately explained opiate use, addiction, and relapse. Other early positivistic studies successfully applied social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022042612436654">Kandel, Kessler, &amp; Marguelis, 1978</xref>) and strain/anomie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612436654">Fazey, 1973</xref>) theories to drug use.</p>
<p>Applying the differential association theory to adolescent drug use, which stresses the importance of peer influence during adolescence on deviant behavior, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612436654">Akers, Krohn, Lanza-Kaduce, and Radosevich (1979)</xref> indicated that differential associations, differential reinforcement, definitions consistent with offending, and imitation explain 68% of the variance in adolescent marijuana use. Other research reiterated the role of exposure to drug-using peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436654">Elliott et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022042612436654">Kaplan, Martin, &amp; Robins, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0022042612436654">Wills, McNamara, Vaccaro, &amp; Hirky, 1996</xref>), expectations of positive reinforcement from peers for drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0022042612436654">Petraitis, Flay, &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>), peer attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612436654">Hawkins et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022042612436654">Kandel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612436654">Perkins, 1985</xref>), and parental influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612436654">Andrews, Hops, Ary, &amp; Tildesley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022042612436654">McDermott, 1984</xref>) in the etiology of adolescent drug use.</p>
<p>In line with social control theory, which emphasizes that strong connections to conventional others and participation in prosocial activities deters deviant activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022042612436654">Marcos, Bahr, and Johnson (1986)</xref> showed that affective attachment to parents, religion, education, and conventional values accounts for 42% of lifetime marijuana use among adolescents, and an abundance of other research has shown that social bonding is negatively associated with the use of other illicit drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612436654">Akers &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436654">Bahr, Maughan, Marcos, &amp; Li, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022042612436654">Kandel et al., 1978</xref>). Parents have received a substantial amount of research attention on drug use from the social control perspective. For example, research has established that adolescents who maintain close relationships with their parents are less likely to use drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436654">Bahr et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612436654">Hoffmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0022042612436654">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>), and parental monitoring has also been shown to constrain adolescent drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022042612436654">Mounts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0022042612436654">Simons, Whitbeck, Conger, &amp; Conger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0022042612436654">Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts, &amp; Dornbusch, 1994</xref>). Last, prior work has also shown that schools serve as an important source of social bonding that have the potential to deter adolescent drug use, as the school presents ample opportunities to form bonds with teachers, coaches, and administrators; build a stake in conformity; and participate in extracurricular activities. Prior research has established that adolescents with strong bonds to school are less likely to use drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436654">Bryant &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0022042612436654">Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Freedman-Doan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0022042612436654">Voelkl &amp; Frone, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The third major theoretical perspective in criminology is strain theory, which suggests that adverse relationships and situations put pressure on individuals to engage in corrective action; deviant behavior is one form of corrective action in response to strain. When goals are inconsistent with culturally approved means to achieve those goals, or when goal attainment is blocked by the actions of others or unfavorable social conditions, strain is placed on individuals to achieve success through illegitimate means, engage in retaliatory behavior, or alleviate strain through alcohol or drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612436654">Cloward &amp; Ohlin, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612436654">Cohen, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022042612436654">Merton, 1938</xref>). Empirical tests of strain theory in explaining adolescent drug use have been positive. For example, in a study of adolescents from the Rutgers Health and Human Development Project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436654">Agnew and White (1992)</xref> reported a positive direct relationship between strain and adolescent drug use, controlling for social control and deviant peer relationships. Similarly, other research has documented that strain directly influences adolescent drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612436654">Hoffmann &amp; Su, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612436654">Carson, Sullivan, Cochran, &amp; Lersch, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, deviant peer associations, bonds to conventional society, and social strain adequately explain variations in adolescent drug use. In an analysis of adolescent marijuana use, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran (1985)</xref> tested the merits of each theory on adolescent marijuana use, finding support for each theory independently. In the combined model that compares the merits of each theory against the other theoretical predictors, the authors found strong support for the social learning theory in predicting adolescent marijuana use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers &amp; Cochran, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0022042612436654">White, Johnson, &amp; Horwitz, 1986</xref>, find similar effects in their study of adolescent substance use). Similar to the work of Akers and Cochran, the vast majority of prior theoretical assessments of adolescent drug use have focused solely on marijuana use or a combined scale of marijuana use and other illicit drugs. As we discuss in the next section, however, there are unique differences between marijuana, other illicit drugs, and prescription drug misuse that potentially confound prior theoretical understandings of adolescent drug use. Following the comparative approach used by Akers and Cochran, we assess the distinct theoretical underpinnings of prescription drug misuse in comparison with marijuana and other illicit drug use in the current article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022042612436654">
<title>Unique Characteristics of Prescription Drug Misuse</title>
<p>Numerous differences exist between prescription drug misuse and traditional illicit drug use, further highlighting the need for a new theoretical assessment of contemporary adolescent drug use patterns. For instance, in a systematic assessment of the demographic and geographic trends in the use of opioid analgesics in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero, Inciardi, and Munoz (2005)</xref> reported that Whites are vastly overrepresented among the nonmedical users of such medications, which is in contrast to the overrepresentation of Blacks and Latinos among illicit opioid use (heroin). Similarly, opioid analgesic abuse is concentrated in small- or medium-sized urban, suburban, and rural contexts, regions of the country where heroin use is low. Cicero et al. speculated that the high cost of prescription opioids is less of a barrier in suburban and small urban areas, where wealth is more heavily concentrated and treatment facilities are more readily available, than in urban contexts where cheap heroin is abundant. Furthermore, the authors suggested that the demographic and geographic trends in prescription opioid use can also be explained by the relative ease of obtaining such medications in safe locations, like at school or from friends, in contrast to using underground networks of drug dealers in urban areas to obtain illicit opioids. Although the perspectives offered by Cicero et al. are intuitive and useful, it is also possible that predictors from social learning, control, and strain theories can also account for the demographic and geographic patterns of opioid analgesic abuse.</p>
<p>In an exploratory study of prescription drug misuse among college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero, Peterson, and Young (2006)</xref> identified the unique sociocultural factors associated with prescription medication abuse that exist in stark contrast to the perceptions of marijuana and other illicit drugs. Of primary concern with the high and growing prevalence of prescription drug misuse were the putative advantages of using prescription drugs compared with other illicit substances. For example, prescription medications were perceived by young adults to be more socially acceptable than other illicit drugs. A sharp distinction is drawn between “soft” and “hard” drugs by the college students interviewed for the study, with most prescription medications classified as “soft” drugs that are less dangerous, damaging, and addictive than “hard” drugs such as crack and heroin. Whereas “hard” drugs were perceived to cause physical health problems, loss of control, role failure, and addiction, prescription drug misuse is perceived to be a safe and socially acceptable method to fulfill specific physical, social, and psychological needs. In fact, prescription medications were perceived by the students in the study to be as socially acceptable and harmless as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, and are believed to actually <italic>improve</italic> social and physical functioning and improve productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). It is important to note, however, that marijuana was also perceived to be harmless and socially acceptable among the college student sample.</p>
<p>The pure chemical composition, government approval, extensive media advertising, and personal or family experiences with prescription medication also contributed to the perceived advantages of prescription drug misuse over more traditional forms of drug use. Pharmaceuticals are subject to extensive laboratory testing, are manufactured by professionals in sanitary environments, and produce a predictable dose-dependent effect, and potential side effects of the medications are listed on the bottle. Furthermore, most individuals had firsthand experience using prescription medications for medical purposes, or they knew people who have used such medications who become trusted resources of information regarding the effect of prescription drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). Because the drugs are standardized and predictable, especially in comparison with street drugs that are often of a dubious chemical composition, prescription medications were seen as safe alternatives to traditional forms of drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that prescription drugs were most often procured from personal or family members’ stockpiles of leftover medications, international pharmacies, or from the Internet, rather than “sketchy” drug dealers, further encourages the perception that prescription drug abuse was safe and acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, because of the unique characteristics, methods of procurement, and friendly social situations in which such medication is used for recreational purposes, college students also perceived the legal risks associated with prescription medications to be very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al. (2006)</xref> succinctly summarized, the putative advantages of prescription drug misuse in the youth culture created a situation in which the nonmedical use of prescription medications is particularly likely:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given the perceptions of acceptability, low risk potential, users’ knowledge and experiences, and experimentability, prescription drugs may be particularly valued as a means to engage in this culturally prescribed “time out” in what young adults perceive as a relatively safe way, especially in comparison to the use of “hard” drugs (p. 922).</p>

<p>Last, prescription medications are often abused for reasons beyond just getting high, thus further exemplifying the unique characteristics of prescription drug misuse among the youth population. College students have reported misusing prescription drugs for reasons ranging from pain relief, relaxation, sleep assistance, and weight loss to improving intellectual performance and increasing concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436654">Babcock &amp; Byrne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436654">Ford &amp; Schroeder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022042612436654">Low &amp; Gendaszek, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022042612436654">McCabe, Boyd, &amp; Young, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0022042612436654">Teter, McCabe, Cranford, Boyd, &amp; Guthrie, 2005</xref>). Taken together, prescription medications clearly possess unique characteristics and correlates. The theoretical correlates of prescription drug misuse, compared with the correlates of traditional illicit drug use, therefore, require further scrutiny.</p>
<p>The work of Jason Ford has explored the theoretical predictors of prescription drug misuse among adolescents. Consistent with the main tenets of social learning theory, in an assessment of the 2005 NSDUH data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436654">Ford (2008)</xref> found that adolescents who associate with peers who use illicit substances hold positive definitions of drug use and/or have a parent who support drug use were more likely to report prescription drug misuse (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436654">G. E. Higgins, Mahoney, &amp; Ricketts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022042612436654">Peralta &amp; Steele, 2010</xref>). Using the same data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436654">Ford (2009)</xref> reported that the odds of prescription drug misuse are significantly lower among adolescents with strong bonds to family and school, providing support for the social control theory in predicting adolescent prescription drug misuse. Last, in support of strain theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436654">Ford and Schroeder (2009)</xref> showed a connection between academic strain (a desire to do well in school but receiving poor grades) and prescription drug misuse among college students from the Harvard School of Public Health’s College Alcohol Study. Overall, prior research has established that social learning theory, social control theory, and strain theory are adequate predictors of adolescent prescription drug misuse. What remains to be examined is the relative effect of each theoretical model in predicting nonmedical drug use among adolescents when (a) assessed against the other major criminological theories and (b) compared with the theoretical predictors of more traditional forms of substance use.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Given the unique views of prescription drugs among adolescents and young adults that minimize the harm associated with other “street” drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>), we contend that the theoretical processes leading to the misuse of prescription medication are likely different than the processes leading to the use of other illicit substances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran (1985)</xref> highlighted the ubiquitous influence of deviant peers in adolescent marijuana use, compared with social bond and strain theory measures, and we anticipate that social learning theory will be a significant predictor of prescription drug misuse, marijuana use, and the use of other illicit drugs. But as the use of prescription medication has been somewhat normalized in contemporary society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612436654">Adlaf, Ivis, Smart, &amp; Walsh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0022042612436654">Poulin &amp; Elliot, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), yet marijuana and other street drugs remain stigmatized in most segments of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612436654">Hammersley, Jenkins, &amp; Reid, 2001</xref>), we contend that the influences of deviant peers on prescription drug misuse will be somewhat diminished, relative to the effect of deviant peers on marijuana and other illicit drug use. Because prescription medications are used for conventional purposes and the harms associated with using such medication without a prescription are discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), and the positive benefits of using prescription medications for nonmedical purposes are promoted within the youth culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), the traditional social learning theory process of attitude transmission and social reinforcement within the peer group is not necessarily required for individuals to internalize definitions favorable to prescription drug misuse.</p>
<p>Following this argument, we also contend that the influence of social bonds will be weaker in predicting prescription drug misuse, relative to the effect of social control on marijuana and other illicit drugs. Given the perceived low risk of negative sanctions for prescription drug misuse in contemporary society, especially among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), it is unlikely that adolescents will perceive prescription drug misuse as a threat to established social bonds to the same degree as marijuana or other illicit drug use. Social control theory has been supported across a number of studies examining juvenile delinquency in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612436654">Agnew, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612436654">Hirschi, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022042612436654">Matsueda, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0022042612436654">Wiatrowski, Griswold, &amp; Roberts, 1981</xref>), as well as adolescent substance use specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436654">Elliott &amp; Huizinga, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022042612436654">Marcos et al., 1986</xref>), including prescription drug misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436654">Ford, 2009</xref>). The controlling influence of social bonds on deviance, however, rests on the threat that deviance poses to valued social relationships, activities, future goals, and belief systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612436654">Hirschi, 1969</xref>). To the degree that contemporary youth perceive prescription medications as innocuous, in comparison with marijuana and other illicit drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), the controlling effect of social bonds on prescription drug misuse will be minimized relative to the impact of social bonds on substances perceived to be more harmful, notably illicit substances such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines.</p>
<p>However, we contend that social and interpersonal strains will exert a similar influence on prescription drug misuse, marijuana use, and other illicit drug use. Research has established that drug use is a common reaction to strain among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612436654">Hoffmann, Cerbone, &amp; Su, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0022042612436654">Slocum, Simpson, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>), in part due to the limited conventional avenues of negating stress among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436654">Agnew, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436654">Brezina, 1996</xref>). Research has also established that young adults who experienced strain often turn to prescription medication misuse as a means of directly alleviating the source of the strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436654">Babcock &amp; Byrne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436654">Ford &amp; Schroeder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022042612436654">Low &amp; Gendaszek, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022042612436654">McCabe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0022042612436654">Teter et al., 2005</xref>), including misusing prescription medication to improve academic performance or lose weight. The type of drug used in reaction to strain among adolescents, therefore, is likely to be influenced by a combination of access to a particular substance and the particular source of strain rather than the social conventions associated with each type of illicit drug. It is reasonable to assume then that strain will have a similar impact on all three categories of adolescent substance use assessed in the current study.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data used in the current study is from the 2009 NSDUH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2009</xref>). The NSDUH is an ongoing study sponsored by the U.S. SAMHSA that dates back to the 1970s and was formerly called the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The NSDUH sample is the only nationally representative data set that includes adolescent respondents, adequate measures of concepts from the three major criminological theories, and specific measures of prescription drug misuse.</p>
<p>For the 2009 NSDUH a total sample of 68,700 persons aged 12 and older was generated using a state-based sampling plan, including all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The sample was designed to select roughly 3,600 respondents from each of the 8 largest states in the country and 900 respondents from the 42 remaining states and the District of Columbia. The states were then geographically divided into equally sized sampling regions. These state sampling regions were then broken down into smaller regions based on census tracts, which then served as the primary sampling unit with a minimum of 150 dwelling units in urban areas or 100 dwelling units in rural areas. Dwellings, or households, were then selected from the primary sampling units, and residents aged 12 and older were interviewed. The sampling design of the NSDUH produced a sample that was generalizable to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Due to a subsampling step used to control the risk of disclosing the identity of any respondent, only 55,772 records appear in the public use data file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2010</xref>). Because the current study addresses the theoretical predictors of <italic>adolescent</italic> substance use, we restrict the sample to include only the participants below the age of 18 (<italic>n</italic> = 17,705).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612436654">1</xref></sup> The mean age of the sample is 14.595, 51% of the sample is male, and 58% of the sample is White.

<p>The NSDUH implemented many strategies to improve the validity of the survey. Given that several survey items cover sensitive or illegal behaviors, respondent privacy was enhanced by the interview procedures. Respondents were surveyed in the privacy of their own homes, and a combination of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) was used to collect the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2009</xref>). This data collection strategy allowed survey respondents to enter responses directly into a computer, providing respondents with a highly private and confidential means of responding to questions, thereby increasing the level of honest reporting of illicit drug use and other sensitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436654">Aquilino, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The current study compares the theoretical predictors of prescription drug misuse with the predictors of marijuana and other drug use, so the dependent variables for the current study are all indicators of each type of drug use. All of the dependent measures are dichotomous (1 = <italic>use of particular substance in past year</italic>, 0 = <italic>no use in past year</italic>). The prescription drug misuse measure is taken from several items that address the various categories of prescription drug misuse. The respondents were asked to report if they used pain relievers (i.e., Darvocet, Tylenol with Codeine, Percocet, Vicodin, Hydrocodone, OxyContin), tranquilizers (i.e., Klonopin, Xanax, Ativan, Valium), stimulants (i.e., Ritalin, Cylert, Dexedrine, Adderall), or sedatives (Mathaqualone, Nembutal, Pentobarbital, Seconal, Restoril) in the prior year that were not prescribed to them, or if they took the medication only to get high. For marijuana use, the respondents were asked if they had used marijuana during the past year. Last, for other illicit drugs, the respondents were asked if they had used cocaine, crack, heroin, hallucinogens, LSD, PCP, ecstasy, or methamphetamines in the prior year. Overall, 13.6% of the adolescents reported using marijuana, 7.7% reported prescription drug misuse, and 3.5% reported using other illicit drugs in the past year.</p>

<title>Social learning theory</title>
<p>Consistent with the main tenets of the social learning theory outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436654">Akers (1985)</xref>, and following the operationalization of measures proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436654">Ford (2008)</xref>, the social learning theory measures in the current study are all scales comprising several items that address the use of drugs by their peers (differential association), substance use attitudes of their parents and friends (differential reinforcement), and their own substance use attitudes (internalized definitions favorable to offending). The Peer Substance Use Scale comprises four items that ask the respondent to approximate the proportion of students in their grade that smoke cigarettes, use marijuana or hashish, drink alcoholic beverages, or get drunk at least once a week (1 = <italic>none of them</italic>, 2 = <italic>a few of them</italic>, 3 = <italic>most of them</italic>, 4 = <italic>all of them</italic>; α = .885). The Parental Substance Use Attitude Scale includes four items that ask the respondents to gauge the degree to which their parents would feel about them smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day, trying marijuana or hashish once or twice, using marijuana or hashish once a month or more, or having one or two drinks of an alcoholic beverage nearly every day (1 = <italic>neither approve or disapprove</italic>, 2 = <italic>somewhat disapprove</italic>, 3 = <italic>strongly disapprove</italic>; α = .848). The Peer Substance Use Attitude Scale is identical to the Parental Substance Use Scale, with “close friends” replacing “parents” in the wording of the questions (α = .897).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612436654">2</xref></sup> Last, the respondents’ own substance use attitudes comprises four items that ask the respondent to assess how they feel about someone their own age smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day, trying marijuana or hashish once or twice, using marijuana or hashish once a month or more, or having one or two drinks of an alcoholic beverage nearly every day with the same three-category response set as the previous attitudinal measures (α = .883).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612436654">3</xref></sup> A standardized composite scale is then constructed by adding each item from the constituent scales to obtain a global measure of social learning, recoding as necessary to ensure consistent directionality of the proposed relationships (α = .904).</p>

School bonds are identified with a five-item scale that asks the respondents to report how they felt about going to school (1 = <italic>hated going to school</italic>, 4 = <italic>liked going to school a lot</italic>), felt that schoolwork was meaningful and important (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 4 = <italic>always</italic>), the importance of school for later in life (1 = <italic>very unimportant</italic>, 4 = <italic>very important</italic>), how interesting the courses are in school (1 = <italic>very boring</italic>, 4 = <italic>very interesting</italic>), and the frequency at which teachers let them know they were doing a good job with schoolwork (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 4 = <italic>always</italic>) during the past year (α = .769).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022042612436654">5</xref></sup> Last, the religiosity measure contains four items that assess each respondent’s frequency of attendance at religious services during the past year (1 = <italic>0 times</italic>, 4 = <italic>more than 52 times</italic>), as well as the importance of religious beliefs, the influence of religion in decision making, and the importance that friends share their religious beliefs (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).

<sec id="section12-0022042612436654">
<title>Strain theory</title>
<p>The measures of strain in the current study assess the level of adversity the youth in the sample experienced. Following much of the recent research on strain theory, the current study uses an additive index of six life events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612436654">Agnew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612436654">Hoffman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0022042612436654">Slocum, 2010</xref>). Stress research has generally found that the accumulation of stressors across a variety of domains is most harmful to social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0022042612436654">Thoits, 1983</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612436654">Agnew (2001)</xref> claimed that strain is most likely to culminate in criminal offending when multiple stressors cluster over a short period of time. Each item in the Negative Life Events Scale is coded such that 1 = <italic>presence of strain</italic>. The items include fighting with parents (1 = <italic>youth had at least three arguments or fights with a parent during the previous year</italic>), grades in school (1 = <italic>C or D average</italic>), residing with biological parents (1 = <italic>no</italic>), having some form of health insurance (1 = <italic>no</italic>), participation in one or more government-assistance programs (1 = <italic>yes</italic>), and overall health (1 = <italic>health is fair or poor</italic>).

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The aim of the current article is to compare the theoretical predictors of prescription drug misuse with the predictors of marijuana and other illicit drugs. To illustrate these processes, we rely on logistic regression techniques predicting each form of substance use in past year. Logistic regression is used, rather than ordinary least squares regression, due to the low quality of substance use frequency responses (i.e., raw count data) in the NSDUH and the very low level of frequent drug use reported by the sample.</p>
<p>For each category of drug use, we begin by examining the effect of the sociodemographic background factors and the other categories of drug use on the specified category of drug use (baseline model). We then add the predictors from the three criminological theories, first with the composite scales to determine the overall impact of each theory on each category of drug use and then with the component scales to identify the unique effect of each independent factor for each theory on drug use. This allows for a comparison of the overall applicability of each theory to the three categories of adolescent substance use. To assess the impact of each unique theory on each unique category of substance use individually, we rely on inferential statistics from each individual logistic regression model. Rather than display the full models for each individual theory (available on request), the results of which are essentially redundant to the information in the full model with all three theories, the inferential statistics provide evidence as to the relative strength of each theory in predicting the odds of using each form of illicit substance.</p>
<p>To take into account the complex multistage sampling design of the NSDUH, analyses were conducted using the SVYSET and SVY commands in STATA. These commands allowed STATA to consider survey design effects, including stratification and weight variables and the primary sampling unit, when estimating test statistics.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612436654">Table 2</xref> includes the results for the full set of competing theoretical models. The baseline models indicate that age is significantly correlated to all forms of substance use (results not shown, available on request). Older adolescents are more likely to report the use of marijuana, prescription drug misuse, and other illicit drug use than younger adolescents. Gender is significantly associated to both marijuana use and prescription drug misuse. Males are more likely to report marijuana use, whereas females are more likely to report prescription drug misuse. Males and females are equally likely to report the use of other illegal substances. In these baseline models, race is significantly correlated with the use of other illicit drugs but not marijuana use or prescription drug misuse. White adolescents are more likely to use other illicit drugs than racial and ethnic minorities. Finally, each type of substance use is highly correlated with the other categories of substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022042612436654">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>The first set of models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612436654">Table 2</xref> include the composite standardized scales for each criminological theory, allowing for a direct comparison of the power of each theory, relative to the other theories, in predicting each of the three forms of adolescent substance use. This set of models allows the main tenets of all three major criminological theories to compete for explanatory power, showing the relative impact of each criminological theory in predicting each category of drug use. In short, the results show that all three theories are significant predictors of all three types of drug use in the predicted direction, with the notable exception that strain theory does not significantly influence the odds of other illicit substance use. The social learning theory generally shows the strongest impact on the odds of drug use across all three categories, followed by social control and strain. Each unit increase in social learning (higher levels of prosocial associations and reinforcements) is associated with an 81.6% reduction in the odds of marijuana use, a 40.6% reduction in the odds of prescription drug misuse, and a 54.8% reduction in the odds of other illicit substance use. Displaying a relatively weaker impact on adolescent drug use than the social learning constructs, controlling for the background factors, other drug use, and measures from the two other theories, each unit increase in social bonds is associated with a 30.5%, 42.6%, and 38.5% decrease in the odds of marijuana, prescription medication, and other substance use, respectively. Finally, the negative life index exerts the weakest impact on adolescent drug use, with each unit increase in strain associated with a 16.7% increase in the odds of marijuana use and a 17.4% increase in the misuse of prescription medication; importantly, strain does not significantly predict the use of other illicit drugs, net of the other theoretical measures. Although the full model explains the most amount of variance in the use of other illicit substances, measured by the pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values, the additional variance explained beyond the baseline model by the theoretical measures is greatest for marijuana use (pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> increased by .153 for marijuana with the addition of the theoretical measures). The full model explains the least amount of variance in prescription drug misuse, but the variance explained by the theoretical measures is greater than the variance accounted for by the same measures in the model predicting other illicit substance use (pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> increased by .039 for prescription misuse and .015 for the use of other illicit drugs).</p>
<p>The next set of logistic regression models include all the component measures from each criminology theory investigated. As described above, this modeling strategy allows each individual component of the criminological theories to compete for explanatory power, providing a depiction of the relative importance of each element from the theories. For social learning theory, peer substance use and respondent’s attitude toward substance use are significantly correlated with all types of substance use in the expected direction. Peer substance use and the respondents’ own attitudes toward substance use are most strongly related to marijuana use, with each unit increase in peer substance use associated with a 90.0% increase in the odds of marijuana use and each unit increase in the respondents’ opposition to drug use associated with a 60.0% decrease in the odds of marijuana use. However, peer substance use and the respondents’ own drug use attitudes are most weakly associated with prescription drug misuse, with each unit increase in drug-using peers associated with a 47.6% increase in the odds of prescription drug misuse and each unit increase in the respondents’ oppositional attitudes to substance use associated with a 24.2% decrease in the odds of using prescription medication for nonmedical purposes. The attitude toward substance use by the respondent’s parents is significantly correlated with marijuana and other illicit drug use, decreasing the odds of each form of drug use by 24.2% and 36.1%, respectively. Parental drug use attitudes, however, are not associated with prescription drug misuse. Finally, peer attitude toward substance use is only related to marijuana use; each unit increase in peer acceptance of drug use is associated with an 82.8% increase in the odds of marijuana use. Interestingly, peer substance use attitudes are not associated with prescription drug misuse or the use of other illicit substances.</p>
<p>For social control theory, adolescents bond to school is not significantly associated with any type of substance use. Parental bonds, however, significantly influence only the odds of prescription drug misuse; each unit increase in bonds to parents is associated with a 25.0% decrease in the odds of abusing prescription medication. Finally, each unit increase in religiosity reduces the odds of marijuana use and other illicit substance use by 21.1% and 28.7%, respectively. Religiosity, however, does not impact the odds of prescription drug misuse among adolescents. For strain theory, the measure of strain is significantly related to the odds of marijuana use, prescription drug misuse, and other illicit drug use, with strain being only a slightly stronger predictor of marijuana use than prescription drug misuse or other illicit drug use; each unit increase in negative life events is associated with a 17.8%, 16.0%, and 11.4% increase in the odds of marijuana, prescription medication, and other illicit drug use, respectively.</p>
<p>In sum, the competing models indicate that social learning theory, social control theory, and strain theory significantly and independently predict all three categories of adolescent substance use investigated in the current study. Social learning theory appears to exert the strongest influence on marijuana use and the weakest impact on prescription drug misuse, social control shows the strongest effect on prescription drug misuse and the weakest impact on marijuana use, and strain influences all adolescent substance use similarly across all three categories of substances. There are also several notable intricacies in the patterns of theoretical relationships revealed through the component analyses, including the lack of a relationship between parent and peer attitudes and the misuse of prescription medication, discussed below in more detail.</p>
<p>Although the method of introducing the theoretical measures into one complete model provides some information as to the power of each theory in predicting each category of drug use, another strategy to identify the best theoretical model to predict adolescent drug use across categories is to examine the explained variance added to the baseline model of each type of drug for each individual criminological theory. Given the highly interrelated nature of constructs from each theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436654">Agnew, 2006</xref>), this approach evaluates the relative impact of each theory on its own merits. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436654">Table 3</xref> shows the changes in pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and model χ<sup>2</sup> values for the baseline model for each category of drug use (demographic characteristics and other drug use predicting each type of substance use), and then the resulting pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and model χ<sup>2</sup> with the predictors from each criminological theory.</p>

<p>Note: This table shows the model fit, both Model χ<sup>2</sup> and Pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, once theoretical measures are added to each baseline model. All changes to the Model χ<sup>2</sup> are significant with the exception of the change between the baseline model and social control composite model for prescription drug misuse.</p>

<p>Beginning with marijuana use, and consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers &amp; Cochran, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0022042612436654">White et al., 1986</xref>), the data suggest that the best improvement in explained variance is with the addition of the social learning theory variables. In the composite models, the addition of the social learning measures to the baseline model is associated with a 12.4% increase in variance explained. The social control theory measures are associated with a 2.6% increase in variance explained, and strain theory adds only 1.1% explained variance to the model. The component models show similar shifts in explained variance. Social learning theory is clearly associated with the best improvement in explained variance, although the χ<sup>2</sup> shifts indicate that each set of theoretical predictors add significant explanatory power to the models.</p>
<p>With prescription drug misuse, the theoretical patterns are not as clear. The composite social learning theory measure adds 2.2% in variance explained, social control contributes to an additional 2.5% of variance explained from the baseline model, and strain adds 1.3% in variance explained. Once again, however, the addition of each set of theoretical variables does add significant explanatory power to the model. For other illicit drugs, the demographic factors and other drug use variables explain 40.3% of the variance, but the theoretical measures once again add little to the explained variance. The social learning measures add the greatest degree of explained variance to the baseline model, with the composite measure contributing to an additional 1.5% in explained variance. The social control measures do not add significant explanatory power to the model, and strain theory contributes a negligible amount of explained variance beyond the baseline model.</p>
<p>Overall, each theory makes a unique contribution to the process of adolescent drug use. Social learning theory appears to be the strongest correlate of adolescent substance use across all three categories of substances, but the impact of social learning theory is most pronounced for marijuana use. Social control theory exerts a similar, albeit weak, effect on all three categories of substance use in the combined models, but social control does not contribute to any additional explained variance in predicting other illicit drug use. Strain theory also impacts the odds of all three categories of substance use, but the relative impact of strain is also weak in the individual models. In comparison with the other theories, social learning theory is clearly most powerful of adolescent substance use, but the effects of social learning theory, and the other two theories for that matter, are relatively weak in predicting drug use other than marijuana.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Research comparing the theoretical predictors of drug is rare, especially in the contemporary criminological research. Social learning, social control, and strain theory have each been identified as important explanatory mechanisms in the etiology of substance use, but research comparing the veracity of each theoretical explanation of drug use is thus far limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran (1985)</xref> provided a comprehensive theoretical assessment of marijuana use among a limited sample of middle school and high school students, and found that social learning theory variables are by far the most powerful predictors of marijuana use, compared with measures of social control and strain. As important as this study is to establishing the theoretical understanding of substance use among youth, the study by Akers and Cochran focused on the use of only one illicit substance within a sample of adolescents from three geographically limited areas. Other research has compared the theoretical predictors of substance use across a variety of illicit substances, again finding that social learning theory is the strongest predictor of adolescent substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0022042612436654">White et al., 1986</xref>). Given the notable rise in popularity of prescription drug misuse among youth over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436654">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612436654">McCabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2006</xref>), and the unique characteristics of such substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), a renewed focus on the theoretical predictors of illicit substance use is necessary. The current study represents an initial attempt to compare the theoretical processes of drug use by the type of substance used.</p>
<p>Consistent with the conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran (1985)</xref>, and supporting our initial expectations, the first notable finding in the current research is that social learning theory is a consistent predictor of all types of adolescent substance use independently, as well as when the predictors from the other theories are controlled. Also consistent with our original supposition, in the competing theoretical models, the social learning theory scale is most strongly related to marijuana use. Although the social learning theory scale is significantly associated with prescription drug misuse and the use of other illicit substances, the additional variance in the use of each substance explained by the social learning measures beyond the demographic and other drug use variables is small (but statistically significant). These findings suggest that the traditional social learning theory process is important for all types of substance use but is diminished for prescription drug misuse and the use of other illicit substances. Marijuana and other hard drugs continue to be stigmatized in our contemporary culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612436654">Hammersley et al., 2001</xref>), but youth perceive prescription medication as being less harmful and less stigmatizing than other illicit substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>). The current study partially supports these claims, as it appears that exposure to drug use and attitudes supporting substance use are relatively less important in predicting prescription drug misuse than marijuana use.</p>
<p>The relatively weak increase in explanatory power associated with the addition of the social learning theory variables to the other illicit drug use model, however, is surprising given the strong societal prohibitions attributed to such substances. One possible explanation for this finding is that the amount variance in the use of these illicit drugs explained by the demographic and other drug use variables is high. There is a very strong association between marijuana use and the use of other illicit substances, and it is possible that a significant portion of the variance explained by the social learning theory measures is attributed to the marijuana use variable. The connection between marijuana use and prescription drug misuse is also strong but not nearly as strong as the connection between marijuana use and the use of other illicit substances. Therefore, the relatively low amount of variance explained by the social learning theory measures is likely due to the unique characteristics of prescription medication.</p>
<p>The individual components of the social learning theory further illustrate many of the unique processes contributing to drug use among adolescents. First, the drug use patterns of the respondents’ peers are predictive of all types of drug use, even when the predictors from the other theories are controlled, consistent with the behavioral modeling component of social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436654">Akers, 1985</xref>). The impact of peer drug use, however, is weaker for prescription drug misuse than the other two categories of substance use. Similarly, the internalized attitudes of the respondents themselves concerning substance use consistently predict all three categories of substance use, supporting the key provision of differential association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0022042612436654">Sutherland, 1947</xref>) and social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436654">Akers, 1985</xref>) that an excess of definitions favorable to offending contribute to an increased probability of offending. Once again, however, the effects of internalized attitudes consistent with drug use are a weaker predictor of prescription drug misuse than the use of marijuana or other illicit drugs. The peer and parent attitudinal measures in the current study, however, influence marijuana use among the youth in the sample in the predicted direction, and parent substance use attitudes are associated with a decrease in the odds of other illicit substance, but neither attitudinal measure is associated with prescription drug misuse.</p>
<p>The finding that attitudes of primary group members do not influence prescription drug misuse represents a notable contrast from the social learning theory perspective for this particular category of substance use; the lack of a relationship between the peer and parent attitudinal variables and prescription drug misuse highlights a key difference in theoretical mechanisms contributing to prescription drug misuse. Prior work assessing the intricacies of the social learning theory process in the etiology of general criminal offending have documented that the behavior of peers is a stronger predictor of offending than the attitudes peers hold regarding crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612436654">Heimer &amp; Matsueda, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022042612436654">Matsueda &amp; Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0022042612436654">Warr &amp; Stafford, 1991</xref>). Extending these findings to prescription drug misuse, it appears that attitude transmission is a key element in the process leading to marijuana and other illicit substances but not for prescription drug misuse. Clearly, attitudes toward substance use by parents and peers do not exert any significant controlling or exacerbating influence in the prescription drug misuse process. The parent and peer attitude measures in the current study, however, are general in nature and do not include specific reference to prescription medication. It is possible that peers and parents who generally hold negative attitudes toward alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana do not hold the same negative attitudes toward prescription medication. Future research should assess the social learning theory process using substance-specific attitudinal measures.</p>
<p>Another complicating factor in the social learning theory process contributing to adolescent substance use is the distinction between social and nonsocial reinforcement raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436654">G. E. Higgins et al. (2009)</xref>. In the current study, peer and parent drug use attitudes were conceptualized as a form of social reinforcement for substance use. However, G. E. Higgins et al. presented a theory of nonsocial reinforcement for the misuse of prescription medication. Through their analysis of Monitoring the Future data, G. E. Higgins et al. showed that nonsocial reinforcement, in the form of an internal high or thrill, is predictive of nonmedical amphetamine and tranquilizer use, controlling for measures of differential association and self-control. Although the research did not investigate the impact of nonsocial reinforcement on the use of marijuana or other drugs, it is possible that nonsocial reinforcement confounds the effect of parent and peer attitudes on prescription drug misuse. As stated above, the relatively legitimized nature of prescription medication in contemporary society likely negates the controlling effect of any negative attitudes that peers and parents hold regarding drug use on prescription drug misuse, but nonsocial reinforcement is an issue associated with the use of prescription medication for nonmedical purposes that deserves further investigation. Future research should implement specific measures of social and nonsocial reinforcement.</p>
<p>Last, the temporal order of social learning theory mechanisms and deviant behavior has been questioned in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612436654">Hirschi, 1969</xref>). Social learning theory proposes that deviant peers influence individuals to engage in deviant activities, but it is possible that deviant behavior leads individuals to associate with deviant peers. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data used in the current study, it is not possible to assess the directionality of the relationship between the social learning variables and drug use among the adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022042612436654">Krohn, Lizotte, Thornberry, Smith, and McDowall (1996)</xref>, however, investigated the direction of the relationship between deviant peers and marijuana use, finding that although there is evidence of selection into friendship groups based on marijuana use, the majority of the association between deviant peers and marijuana use is in the direction proposed by social learning theory. Furthermore, we find in the current study that parental attitudes influence marijuana and other illicit substance use. Because children cannot self-select into the family, and prior research has established that the majority of the peer effect on drug use in the direction proposed by the social learning theory, it is likely that deviant family and peer associations are leading to drug use, not the other direction.</p>
<p>The next notable finding from the current study is that social control theory is also a strong predictor of all three forms of drug use in both the individual models and the models where social control competes with the other theoretical explanations. Adolescents with strong bonds to their parents, school, and religion are significantly less likely to use drugs of any type. In the individual theoretical model, the composite social control theory measure is more strongly related to marijuana use than prescription drug misuse. This finding is consistent with our original expectation that social bonds are threatened to a lesser degree by prescription drug misuse than the use of other drugs, given the perceived relative harmlessness, stigmatization, and lower risk of arrest associated with such substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>). In the combined theoretical models, however, the composite social control scale is somewhat more strongly associated with prescription drug misuse than the other two categories of drug use, but the differences in explanatory power across drug use models is not striking. The model fit statistics, however, show that the addition of the social control variables to the baseline models explains a similar amount of additional variance in the use of marijuana and prescription medication but does not significantly add to the explanation of other illicit substance use. The general conclusion that can be drawn from the current study, given the somewhat contradictory findings between models, is that social bonds significantly reduce the odds of all types of illicit substance use, even when predictors from social learning and strain theories are controlled.</p>
<p>The assessment of each unique component of the social bond contributing to adolescent substance use, however, raises some notable contrasts in the processes associated with each category of substance use. In the individual social control models, each component of the social bond is significantly associated with all three types of substance use, with the exception that parental bonds do not affect the odds of using other illicit substances (results not shown). When the other theoretical predictors are controlled in the combined theoretical models, however, the impact of school bonds is decreased to insignificance for all three forms of adolescent substance use. Furthermore, parental bonds are only associated with prescription drug misuse, and the influence of religiosity diminishes to insignificance for prescription drug misuse only. Stated differently, religiosity is the only social control factor associated with marijuana and other illicit drug use in the combined theoretical models, and parental bonds are the only social control factor associated with nonmedical prescription drug use. Although studies have found mixed results as to the relationship between religiosity and criminal offending (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436654">Baier &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>), the main conclusion within the criminological research is that that religiosity does deter various forms of crime and deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436654">Baier &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612436654">Evans, Cullen, Dunaway, &amp; Burton, 1995</xref>; P. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612436654">Higgins &amp; Albrecht, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022042612436654">Jang &amp; Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612436654">Jensen &amp; Erickson, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612436654">Burkett and White (1974)</xref>, however, claimed that much of the relationship between religion and criminal offending among adolescents is for victimless crimes that violate explicit religious principles, most commonly alcohol and drug use (for review of more recent research examining the relationship between substance use and religiosity, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612436654">Hill, Burdette, Weiss, &amp; Chitwood, 2009</xref>). The current research shows that religion does control marijuana and other illicit substance use, but the lack of a relationship between religiosity and prescription drug misuse further highlights the unique characteristics of prescription medication misuse among adolescents; it is possible that religious institutions are not explicitly condemning the use of prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes. Future research should further scrutinize the role of religion in establishing specific forms of adolescent substance use.</p>
<p>However, and contrary to our original expectations, parental bonds do not significantly predict marijuana or other illicit substance use but are a significant predictor of prescription drug misuse in the expected direction. Adolescents perceived that the risk of criminal justice intervention is much lower for prescription drug misuse than the use of other drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>); therefore, it is unlikely that prescription drug misuse poses the same threat to established social bonds as the use of other illicit substances. The opposite pattern established in the current research suggests that youth with strong parental bonds are equally likely to use marijuana or other hard drugs as youth with weak parental bonds, but adolescents with strong bonds are significantly less likely to use prescription medication for nonmedical purposes than adolescents with weak parental bonds. Prior research has suggested that the impact of parental bonds on substance use is mediated by the development of antisocial attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022042612436654">Knight, Broome, Cross, &amp; Simpson, 1998</xref>) or self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436654">Chapple, Hope, &amp; Whiteford, 2005</xref>), and it is thus possible that the relationships assessed in the current project are confounded by such mediating processes. Furthermore, parental substance use has been shown to increase the risks of adolescent substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0022042612436654">Novins &amp; Mitchell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0022042612436654">Windle, 1996</xref>), either directly or indirectly through the diminished parenting capabilities of substance-using parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612436654">Kandel, 1990</xref>). Future research on the theoretical predictors of adolescent substance use, especially prescription drug misuse, should assess the confounding impact of antisocial attitudes, self-control, and parental substance use.</p>
<p>Last, consistent with our original expectations, strain measured by negative life events is a significant predictor of all types of illicit substance use in both the individual and competing theoretical models, with the notable exception that strain does not significantly influence the use of other illicit drugs in the competing models that include only the composite measures of social control and social learning theories. Given the relatively limited avenues for conventional coping among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436654">Agnew, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436654">Brezina, 1996</xref>), it is likely that the choice of drugs to cope with the negative impact of stressful life events is conditioned by access. Furthermore, general strain theory postulates that negative affective states mediate the relationship between strain and deviant outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436654">Agnew, 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, measures of negative affect are not available in the NSDUH. Future research should examine the role of specific emotional responses to strain in the choice of illicit substances adolescents use to cope with such emotions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many will argue that the results of the current study support an integrated theoretical approach to the study of adolescent substance use (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436654">Catalano, Kosterman, Hawkins, Newcomb, &amp; Abbot, 1996</xref>). Although a complete assessment of theoretical integration is beyond the scope of the current study, integrated models have been proposed and utilized in many studies of delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436654">Elliott et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022042612436654">Messner, Krohn, &amp; Liska, 1989</xref>) and drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612436654">Hawkins, Lishner, Catalano, &amp; Howard, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436654">Akers and Cochran (1985)</xref>, for instance, have proposed that there is conceptual overlap between elements of social learning theory and social control theory that can be combined into an integrated theoretical model. The social development model, however, is the most comprehensive integrated theory developed to explain the etiology of juvenile delinquency and drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436654">Catalano et al., 1996</xref>). The social development model incorporates “risk factors” from social learning theory, and to a lesser degree strain theory, with the “protective factors” from social control theory to produce a model that predicts prosocial and antisocial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436654">Catalano et al., 1996</xref>). The current study suggests that an integrated theoretical approach to the study of adolescent substance use is warranted, given that all three criminological theories independently significantly predict drug use. An integrated theoretical approach, however, would mask the important subtleties in the theoretical processes associated with the different categories of adolescent substance use. With new substances with unique characteristics (such as prescription drug misuse) continually emerging and requiring new theoretical scrutiny, we contend that comparing and contrasting theoretical processes for adolescent substance use is generally preferred to theoretical integration.</p>
<p>Overall, the current study shows strong support for social control, social learning, and strain theories in the adolescent substance use process. Even controlling for the predictors from the other two theories of criminology, all three theoretical propositions exert unique and independent influences on the three categories of substance use investigated in the current project. The relationship between marijuana and social learning theory is clearly the most notable finding, however, suggesting that theoretical research on adolescent drug use must look beyond marijuana and include separate assessments of prescription medication misuse and the use of other illicit substances. The intricate details of the theoretical processes also reveal several notable differences in the correlates of prescription drug misuse compared with marijuana or other illicit drug use. Prescription medication misuse is a growing trend among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436654">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612436654">McCabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612436654">SAMHSA, 2006</xref>) with unique properties, uses, and public perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436654">Cicero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612436654">Quintero et al., 2006</xref>), and assessing this new form of adolescent substance use presents new and unique theoretical challenges for researchers.</p>

<p>Although extant data are available in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to examine the patterns of substance use in adulthood, we decided to focus the current study only on adolescent participants for two reasons. First and foremost, the vast majority of research addressing the theoretical correlates of substance use has focused on adolescents. Second, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0022042612436654">Sampson and Laub (1993</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022042612436654">Laub &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>) illustrated, sources of social control, social learning, and strain shift from childhood to adulthood (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612436654">Agnew, 2003</xref>). The theoretical measures available in the current study are primarily relevant to adolescence (i.e., parents, friends, and school). Addressing the correlates of adult substance use with these theoretical measures is, therefore, inappropriate.</p>

<p>The measurement of reinforcement in tests of social learning theory has become a key concern among criminologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436654">Brauer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612436654">Horan &amp; Phillips, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022042612436654">Krohn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0022042612436654">Sampson, 1999</xref>). Conceptually, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436654">Akers (1998)</xref> explained that differential reinforcements are the “anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow or are consequences of behavior” (p. 67), which appears to blend expected (indirect) and actual (direct) experiences with reinforcement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436654">Brauer (2009)</xref>, however, suggested that direct measures of reinforcement will produce the strongest association with deviant behavior, although he recognized that the structure of most contemporary data sets does not allow such an investigation. Rather, indirect measures are often used as effective proxies in social learning theory research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612436654">Agnew, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436654">Brauer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436654">Elliott, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0022042612436654">Warr &amp; Stafford, 1991</xref>). Brauer suggested that, in the absence of direct reinforcement measures, researchers should attempt to capture reinforcement’s “residue” (information learned through prior reinforcement) with items that measure the expected approval or disapproval of parents and peers across a variety of deviant acts. The Parent and Peer Attitude Scales in the current study, therefore, conform to Brauer’s strategy of using effective indirect proxy measures for reinforcement.</p>

<p>The outcome measures in the current study are drug-specific, but the only attitudinal-based reinforcement measures available in the NSDUH data are for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Although such a measurement approach is not ideal, general rather than offense-specific measures of anticipated reinforcement are common in social learning theory research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436654">Akers, 1998</xref>, for a discussion of general, rather than specific, reinforcement processes), especially in studies with drug-specific outcome measures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436654">Ford, 2008</xref>). The general attitudinal measures used in the current study reflect an overall anticipated reaction to drug use across a variety of substances, as evidenced by the relatively high degree of reliability shown by the scales.</p>

<p>Given the strong relationship between each category of adolescent substance use and the other categories of drug use, multicollinearity is a concern. We performed the diagnostic tests for multicollinearity, however, and found no evidence that the strong relationship between forms of drug use influences the results of the current study. Similarly, multicollinearity is not an issue within the individual theoretical constructs.</p>
