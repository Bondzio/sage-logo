<disp-quote><p>We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us—and we ought to lay down our lives for one another. How does God’s love abide in anyone who has the world’s goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help? Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. (1John 3.16-18)</p></disp-quote>

<p>How do we know love? Here are some stories …</p>
<p>He knew love by this: Michael had had a stroke in his early forties – he was profoundly outraged by his condition – unable to speak without great difficulty and no longer able to walk, he spent his days in a ward of his local hospital, fuming I suppose, but also listening – the only pleasure he got was listening – soaking up the chat and banter around him. The truth of this became apparent when he contracted he MRSA bug which put him in quarantine in a separate room at the front of the ward. At first, the nurses gave him the big room with the window in the hopes that he wouldn’t feel completely cut off; but pretty soon, they were moving him to a back room in the ward, a room with no windows because, in his indignant and impotent fury, Michael had resorted to the only form of communication left to him – the one-finger salute. In this regard, Michael was no respecter of persons and everyone from grannies bearing grapes and consultants on their rounds were given the wave. He used it with gusto and I can’t say I blamed him. On the unfair scale, life had tipped the balance about as far against him as it could go.</p>
<p>Tom was on the other end of the scale – a good-looking prefect in his last year of High School, clever and confident, with the whole world waiting to see what he would do next. He was going to Glasgow University, had an unconditional offer to study engineering; his sixth year was a schoosh and the head teacher was keen that he do some community service, just to round out his school experience. So he approached the chaplaincy coordinator at the Infirmary, and asked if there was anything Tom could do.</p>
<p>“Not sure about this, but let me ask a few questions” – they said, and headed over to ward six to see what the nurses thought. They said that to put these two guys together would either be a recipe for disaster or a match made in heaven – who’d know. One of the nurses said that at least if it was a disaster, Michael would see him off with one wee wave. A comforting thought. Tom visited every week – he sat at the end of ward six and chatted with everybody, but made it clear Michael was the reason he was there. He started bringing two other friends with him so Michael didn’t feel the pressure of having to talk, but could do what he loved best – absorb and feel, for just a wee while, like he was a part of something normal. When Michael was transferred to a nursing home, the nurses thought that would be that, but Tom turned up looking for him, took down the address of the home and started making the trip there once a week – regular as clockwork. So did his pals. They didn’t want to miss their time with Michael. It had become one of the most important times in their week.</p>

<p>How do we know love? Here are some stories …</p>
<p>She knew love by this:</p>
<p>The sun streamed in the window and played a trick with her mind – if she closed her eyes, she could forget for a minute just how cold it was out there. For now, she sat in the comfortable, quiet office – not too quiet to be unnerving, there were voices outside and the photocopier was whirring and the secretary’s phone rang occasionally. She closed her eyes again, exhausted, but not wanting to let herself be caught unawares. She sat there and waited – she’d waited like this before – at the Department of Social Services, in the offices of several would be do-gooders, in court a few times – she’d sat and waited and she used to hope, but now she just sat. At least it was comfortable. The person interviewing her came in. Surprisingly, she sat in a seat right in front of her, not in the chair behind the desk. She had a clipboard with a list of questions, but laid it down on the table and smiled. “I’m Ann, welcome. It’s my job to tell you what we offer here and then help you decide if this is something you want. We have an opening and it’s yours, but only if you want it.” And she wanted it. Oh how she wanted it. But she was frightened and weary and if truth be told a little traumatized. Homeless had never been part of her plan – and even as she sat there, she couldn’t imagine how this had happened. She’d been desperate for help, but the kind of help she needed was huge – not a cup of coffee or a bed in a hotel or a twenty pound note so she could go mooch somewhere else. She needed BIG HELP. This seemed almost too good to be true – she needed to know they were for real.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you about the homeless shelter,” Ann said. “Residents can live there for a year and their goal is to help you get back on your feet and be independent. They have folk who will help you get a job, and a finance person who will help you set up a bank account. They also help you get a savings account. If you have to report to any outside agencies or need to go to rehab, then they will help you get to those appointments until you are stable enough to go yourself. When the year is up, they will help your transition – they have a furniture bank and people who help you find a place you can afford. For the twelve women at a time who stay there, love is very tangible and very real.”</p>

<p>He was only 16, and 16 year olds shouldn’t be troubled by an unusual spot on that part of the anatomy. For a 16 year-old boy there could be nothing more embarrassing. I mean, how do you mention it to your Dad or even worse, your mum? How do you talk about it with your mates? You can’t exactly bring it up in casual conversation. All he could hope for was that maybe it would disappear as quickly as it came.</p>
<p>But it didn’t disappear – in fact it got bigger, and it took a lot for Chris to screw up the courage to make an appointment with his GP (a man, thank God!). “Chris,” said the GP, “we can’t hang about here. I don’t like the look of this. I’m sorry but I want a specialist to give you an examination as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The specialist was sympathetic but matter-of-fact. “It is a form of skin cancer, and it will have to be removed. After the operation, just to be on the safe side, you’ll need to have some radiotherapy.”</p>
<p>To be honest, the operation wasn’t all that bad, and neither was the radiotherapy; but, the side effects were unwelcome to say the least. Clumps of hair began to come out and soon, he had to shave the wisps off because he looked so horrible. Completely bald, he started to get a little depressed and closed himself off from his friends. What would people say? What names would they call him? What new labels would they invent for him now? For a 16 year-old good-looking, hunky lad, life simply couldn’t possibly get any worse.</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning, and as usual, Chris was in his bedroom. He had hardly been out of the house at all these past few weeks: it was simply too embarrassing to walk down the street with everybody staring at him. He felt like a freak. A knock came to the door, and his mum answered it. “We’ve come to see Chris.” said Pete, Andrew, Mike and Seamus. “He’s in his room. Up you go.” said Chris’s mum.</p>
<p>The boys didn’t bother to knock on the bedroom door. Instead, they just burst in and stood there with great big goofy smiles on their faces. “What?” said Chris, steeling himself for whatever joke was about to come at his expense.</p>
<p>“This!” they said together, whipping off the hats they were wearing. All five boys then turned to look in Chris’s mirror. Five bald heads looked back at them - not a hair to be seen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524611431915">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>How do we know love? Gentle touches, wiped tears, held hands, someone who listens?</p>
<p>How do we know love? Well, what are your stories? Whose face or voice or lesson comes into your heart and mind unbidden? The ones who loved enough to give up what they wanted for what you needed … the ones who walked with you when they were ready to rest … the ones who listened when you could have been easily ignored. Love lives when we are willing to lay down our lives for one another.</p>
<p>One of our most ancient chants is the Kyrie. “Lord, have mercy. Christ have mercy.” If we are to be the body of Christ, then that ancient call must be reinterpreted and set free. Body of Christ, have mercy on each other! This world is desperate for love that lets go of self.</p>
