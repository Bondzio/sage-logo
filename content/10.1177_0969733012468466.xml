<abstract>
<p>Interprofessional collaboration has become accepted as an important component in today’s health care and has been guided by concerns with patient safety, quality health-care outcomes, and economics. It is widely accepted that interprofessional collaboration improves patient outcomes through enhanced communication among health-care providers and increased accessibility to services. Although there is a paucity of research that provides confirmatory evidence, interprofessional competencies continue to be incorporated into the curricula of health-care students. This article examines the ethics of interprofessional collaboration and ethical issues that arise from the mainstream adoption of interprofessional competencies and the potential for moral distress in nursing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The national and global cultures have firmly embedded the concept of collaboration, and in particular, of interprofessional collaboration, within contemporary health care. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has articulated the importance of collaboration in meeting the goals of primary health care (PHC) and has provided support for interprofessional education as a means to achieve collaborative teamwork among health professionals since as early as 1973.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>
</sup> The emergence of interprofessional care and collaboration within health care is of significant interest to governments, professional bodies, researchers, and clinicians. This is evidenced by a rapidly growing number of studies and position papers and the development of interprofessional frameworks that outline a variety of competencies that are considered necessary for collaboration such as interprofessional/communication competency, patient and/or family-centered care, teamwork, role clarification, collaborative leadership, and conflict resolution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012468466">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468466">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The primary intent of interprofessional collaboration, which is improved quality of health-care delivery, is clearly at the forefront of interprofessional initiatives. Policy makers and some studies suggest that the intent of interprofessional collaboration is made possible through the optimal use of the skills and knowledge of all health professionals, working together as a team to deliver comprehensive, integrated care over which the patient, however defined, maintains control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468466">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012468466"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468466">5</xref>
</sup> This perspective is predicated on the assumption that the skill or knowledge required to reach a solution that serves in the best interest of the patient is more relevant to quality care than the role that the health professional has on the health-care team. What is less evident in the intents and statements about interprofessional collaboration and teamwork is that health-care professionals will not only bring their skills and knowledge to patient-centered care, but that they will work <italic>to</italic> the fullest extent of the skills and knowledge legally allowed them. This is substantially different in its implications than practicing “<italic>within</italic> [emphasis added] one’s professional/disciplinary scope of practice” (p. 15)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468466">3</xref>
</sup> and potentially is what sets up an environment in which conflict can occur or be intensified between nurses and other professionals.</p>
<p>Even though each member of the interprofessional team might wholeheartedly agree with the general notion of patient centeredness, which calls back to an ethical narrative that is created by both the professional and the patient,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012468466">6</xref>
</sup> competition arises because each individual on the interprofessional team comes with different viewpoints that influence the co-creation of this narrative. This viewpoint is, by necessity, guided by the values and beliefs of each team member, which, for the professional team members, are influenced by disciplinary knowledge and perspectives. The particularity of each disciplinary perspective, while congruent with the bioethical principle of beneficence, or acting in the best interest of the patient,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468466">7</xref>
</sup> differentiates each discipline from the other and hence sets up the potential for tension and conflict within the interprofessional team. The particularity of disciplinary perspectives is enhanced when professionals are encouraged to work to their full scope of practice, and therefore, to fully actualize the portent meaning of their skills and knowledge. Overlaps between roles, accountabilities, and even tasks, such as the capacity of both nurse practitioners and physicians in Ontario to diagnose illness and prescribe medication, become apparent in the intersections between disciplines. More importantly, in terms of potential tensions, roles, tasks, and accountabilities are guided by values and beliefs that are particular to disciplines, which renders those beliefs, values, and ideas about good and bad, right and wrong, or what is ethical, more visible to others and may serve to increase tension between physicians and nurses, which has always been present.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468466">8</xref>
</sup> Conflicts, such as differences over goals and ethical norms among professionals, may mean that the “work and fulfillment of goals will be undermined … or that the professional has to give up his/her beliefs” (p. 87).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> Giving up beliefs about what is best, even through the process of finding a middle ground that respects the beliefs and values of all involved in care or generalizations about what is right, could result in a burden of greater moral distress for the nurse, which is defined as “a condition of discomfort that occurs when one believes that something should be done but is constrained by institutional or other pressures from acting on that belief” (p. 304).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468466">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Interprofessional care is essentially ethical. Its espoused motivation is that it promotes the well-being of the patient or <italic>beneficence</italic>, which is to do well by the patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468466">7</xref>
</sup> Despite the wealth of writing about interprofessional care and education, there is little written about the ethical considerations associated with interprofessional teamwork. The purpose of this article is to examine ethical issues arising from the operationalization of interprofessional care and the inculcation of current and future health professionals in principles of interprofessional teamwork.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468466">8</xref>
</sup> Ethical examination is necessary within a context where the evidence to support its efficacy in patient care or how to effectively teach it remains uncertain and sometimes, even contradictory,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012468466">10</xref>
</sup> and the political will to implement it is strong because of a widely held belief that it will improve the quality of health care and/or constrain the cost of health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468466">5</xref>
</sup> The need for ethical examination of interprofessional care and education is urgent. There is much written about how to implement interprofessional education and its believed value and outcomes. There is little written that questions its burden in the face of little confirmatory evidence or considers the ethical norms that might be associated with work with professionals, whose accountabilities and, therefore, obligations may be different from those of nurses.</p>

<title>Context of interprofessional care and ethics in Canada</title>
<p>Within Canadian health care, the government has firmly established principles of interprofessional and intersectoral collaboration within such significant contemporary documents such as the Romanow, Kirby, and Mazankowski reports. Each of these reports points to the need to collaborate as a way to reduce unnecessary expenditures, promote effective use of expertise appropriate to need and setting, and potentially, to better meet the needs of underserviced populations such as those in remote and isolated rural areas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468466">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012468466">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012468466">12</xref>
</sup> The motivation for interprofessional collaboration in Canada arises out of the <italic>economics of accessibility</italic>, which is concerned with the desire of a publicly funded health-care system to address the needs of its most vulnerable, such as those living in isolated rural or northern areas, or in poverty, or with mental illness. This is done by seeking ways to ensure availability of relevant health services, while coping with the burgeoning costs of chronic illness and an aging population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468466">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468466">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012468466">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In its concern with the accessibility and availability of resources, the Canadian health-care system aligns its decision-making with the principle of justice, which is a basic element of bioethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012468466">15</xref>
</sup> Justice is commonly understood as being concerned with fairness and with the equalization of advantages and disadvantages and is one of the seven primary values in the Canadian Nurses Code of Ethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012468466">16</xref>
</sup> Within the Canadian health-care system, concern with justice and distribution of resources to even the most disadvantaged is enshrined within the Canada Health Act of 1984 through two principles, universality and accessibility. Universality refers to the principle that every resident of a province or territory is entitled to insured health services and accessibility to the obligation of provinces and territories to provide reasonable access to services without extra billing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012468466">17</xref>
</sup> These two principles are key components in ensuring that even the most vulnerable in Canada have access to health care, regardless of economic class or social determinants of health, such as education.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with fair distribution of resources and with reasonable access to health care are several. Should decisions about resources be based on merit, for example, and if so, what does merit mean? Does this mean those who are poorest, therefore, warrant the most consideration based on lack of resources to meet even the most basic needs, such as a balanced diet, or inability to take time from minimally paid work to seek preventative care? Or, are those who can afford health clubs and who make every effort to observe conventional wisdom about smoking, diet, and exercise, worthy of more resources by virtue of good stewardship of their health? The conundrums presented by Beauchamp and Childress’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012468466">15</xref>
</sup> principles of fair distribution (equal share, need, effort, contribution, merit, and free-market exchange) have been partially assigned to the process of PHC, whereby communities decide, together with professionals, which may well include interprofessional teams, the principles, and values that will guide determination of need and distribution of resources. Ethical decision-making is thus at least partially transferred to communities, under the umbrella of a federal mandate that establishes justice as its primary principle in health care, and that seeks to promote interprofessional collaboration as a means to achieve fairness in the distribution of access to health care.</p>
<p>Within the Canadian health-care system, the question of access is partially that of a social definition of what is deemed good or right in terms of services by the community and partially, a question of geographic constraints and opportunities. Interprofessional teams are thought able to address a broad diversity of needs within a complex health-care environment, by nature of the wide mix of skills and knowledge available in these teams. Furthermore, they are able to provide a geographic footprint that may not be achievable by single providers such as physicians, who might better and more efficiently be clustered in communities of greater population density, where it is possible to provide services to a greater number, than in rural and remote areas. This perspective is consistent with utilitarian principles on how to ethically distribute scarce resources where the most good can be accomplished.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468466">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The importance of interprofessional teams to access is clearly tied to the PHC principle of sustainability and affordability. Interprofessional teams are seen to enable better matches between patient need and provider expertise, rather than the traditional hospital and physician driven system through which all patients entered, regardless of whether they needed medical services or not. In their respective reports, Romanow<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012468466">12</xref>
</sup> and Kirby<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012468466">18</xref>
</sup> worried about a health-care system in which there was considerable overlap among services and providers, lack of full attention to the needs of communities, and a deep need for better coordination of services. Kirby,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012468466">18</xref>
</sup> in particular, pointed to a need to reconsider solo practices and implementation of teams. He based this recommendation on his observations that multiple disciplines, working together, would be better able to effectively address the costs of a health system in which traditional approaches had hereto provided costly solutions for complex problems. These contemporary perspectives provided clear indications that accessibility is threatened by the costs of team that cannot be sustained by traditional hierarchical models, and that must move toward teams of various professionals, which Kirby suggests, can take many forms. The ethics of justice within these influential documents have driven the Canadian health-care system to continue to be based on accessibility, which is closely tied to social definitions of necessary resources and health, geographic realities, and economic sustainability, all of which are closely linked to the benefits of interprofessional collaboration.</p>

<title>Context of interprofessional care and ethics in the United States</title>
<p>Similarly, other developed countries, such as the United States, have surged in their commitment toward interprofessional collaboration in an effort to address questions of quality and care in their health-care system, primarily in response to patient safety and the economics of error. In the United States, Haskins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012468466">10</xref>
</sup> pointed to rising concern with the errors of health providers that result in serious threats to patient safety and well-being. The increased economic cost of additional care for patients harmed by error, as well as the costs of litigation, offers justification for examining a system in which poor communication between health providers has been found to be a major contributing factor in errors. The poor quality of communication stems from system and social influences such as lack of time and increasing complexity in patient situations as a consequence of rising acuity and the increasing incidence of chronicity, but most importantly, from professional influences such as different perspectives about patient outcomes, power struggles among team members, lack of role clarity, lack of understanding about the roles and scopes of practice of other providers, and stereotyping with regard to other professions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> These influences were found to diminish the contributions of some health providers, such as social workers, nurses, and occupational therapists and lead to limited participation of some groups in planning care for and with clients.</p>
<p>Concern with patient safety and the impacts of limited and/or tense communication among health professionals has led groups in the United States, such as the Committee on Quality Health Care (CQHC), to recommend cooperation, collaboration, and teamwork among clinicians in order to ensure patient safety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> The traction of this movement toward interprofessional health care has been significant, as reflected in the recently released United States document by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>
</sup> This panel, which includes representation from allied health, nursing, medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, advocates for interprofessional education as a means to reform the health-care system and to move toward interprofessionality. Interprofessionality is defined as
<disp-quote>
<p>The process by which professionals reflect on and develop ways of practicing that provides an integrated and cohesive answer to the needs of the client/family/population … [It] involves continuous interaction and knowledge sharing between professionals, organized to solve or explore a variety of education and care issues all while seeking to optimize the patient’s participation … Interprofessionality requires a paradigm shift, since interprofessional practice has unique characteristics in terms of values, codes of conduct, and ways of working. These characteristics must be elucidated. (p. 9)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468466">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> The Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>
</sup> suggests that the movement toward interprofessional education, in which students from health professions learn to “deliberatively” (p. 3) work together in order to build a safe and patient-centered US health system, is a responsibility or obligation that cannot be further ignored. The notion of obligation, which underpins concern with the physical and emotional safety of patients and of interprofessional care in the United States, presents a different ethical framework from that underpinning health-care and interprofessional collaboration in Canada. Obligation, as implied in the statement by the Interprofessional Educational Expert Panel regarding the responsibility of educators to implement interprofessional education in the interests of collaborative, patient-centered care,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>
</sup> is founded on duty or “the obligation to act according to particular rules or principles” (p. 5).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> This perspective is reflective of Kantian ethics, in which the motivation to do good is governed by doing one’s duty, which, in this instance, is defined as educating students to intentionally work in groups or teams to deliver cost-effective care that is coordinated and cooperative to respond to the needs of the client, however, the patient is defined. This particular perspective assumes that doing well by the patient or acting in the interests of the patient, means being able to work together with other care providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012468466">
<title>Meaning of interprofessional</title>
<p>A wide variety of terms have been debated and defined to describe the working relationships of health professionals,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012468466">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012468466">22</xref>
</sup> many of which are used interchangeably. A discipline is often defined as a field of study with a unique focus that distinguishes it from other fields of inquiry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012468466">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012468466">23</xref>
</sup> Nursing, for example, is sometimes considered to be a field of study that is focused on human health and healing through caring and relationships.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012468466">23</xref>
</sup> While the original predisposition in working together was to use the term multidisciplinary or literally, individuals from different disciplines working together, the term has fallen into less favor for a number of reasons. Single professions such as medicine may encompass a number of disciplines such as cardiovascular and endocrinology, and the use of multidisciplinary as a term to describe working together in health teams becomes problematic when referring to the relationships that occur between various professionals and the patient. Multidisciplinary has also come to mean members of various disciplines working together, but making autonomous decisions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>
</sup> that are irrespective of interactions with patients or with each other. The interactions implied by multidisciplinary are that team members act in parallel paths in relation to the needs of the patients and to decision-making with regard to care. Each member of the team is guided by the ethical norms appropriate to that discipline and by the obligations peculiar to the discipline. This approach to care, which is reflective of that in traditional health-care teams, realizes the common goal of beneficence, but can be achieved without sharing of leadership or expertise and without a great deal of understanding of the roles of other professionals. Such an approach seems to perpetuate the lack of communication and fragmentation of care that has led to concerns with patient safety in the United States.</p>
<p>The relationships within a particular professional group, such as those between general duty nurses and nurse practitioners, might better be described as intraprofessional. Transdisciplinary is sometimes used to describe the kind of transformative relationship toward which all collaborative endeavors might aspire, in which the boundaries of professions are blurred as expertise and knowledge are merged to meet patient, caregiving, or educational goals. These terms are further reflected in interprofessional collaboration education, where education that primarily involves education within a single profession, such as nurses learning together from other nurses, is termed uniprofessional. Education that includes learning together in interaction with other professions for the purposes of understanding interprofessional care and about each other is termed interprofessional.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012468466">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What moves interprofessional beyond multidisciplinary is a much greater intent to have professionals engage in interaction with one another and for decision-making to be shared, rather than to be an autonomous activity, as it is in multidisciplinary care. While the patient seems to assume a disquietingly silent voice in much of the discussion around interprofessional care and education, the aims of quality-infused, safe, and accessible care are essentially seen as achievable through relationship and collaboration, which implies a high level of respect for the values, beliefs, skills, and knowledge of the other. It also implies a desire to interact from the perspective of the relevancy of skills and knowledge to the situation or need, rather than from that of social or legal position and dominance.</p>

<sec id="section5-0969733012468466">
<title>Interprofessional collaboration and nursing</title>
<p>It seems natural with relationships as a central concern, that nursing would turn to the possibility of collaboration, not only with patients in the discernment of health and illness but also with other professionals, an activity that Gardner<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012468466">24</xref>
</sup> suggests involves people in relationship and not organizations. In the early 1990s, Meleis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012468466">25</xref>
</sup> suggested that while the central goal of nursing is health, nurses must be aware that this goal is shared by the public and by other professionals, which situates the primary aim of nursing squarely within the intended aims and goals of interprofessional care. Meleis further suggested that nursing must consider health within the context in which the patient finds it, rather than through the objective lens of science. In so doing, Meleis established nursing as essentially relationship and collaboratively oriented, because coming to know the context of the other implies a willingness to enter into the story or a narrative that expresses values, beliefs, and vulnerabilities. Within this shared understanding of values, beliefs, and vulnerability, which Gadow<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012468466">6</xref>
</sup> terms a relational narrative, an understanding or what is right or good or <italic>ethical</italic> emerges out of the relationship.</p>
<p>Bergum and Dossetor,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468466">26</xref>
</sup> through extensive discussion and research focused on ethics in health care, expanded the concept of relationships as the foundation for ethics in health care, in general. They contended that health professionals as a whole are bound by a commitment to relationships with patients and with each other. The space between people, whether patients or health professionals, is that in which ethical moments are enacted or in which what is right and good is defined, negotiated, and put into play. Bergum and Dossetor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468466">26</xref>
</sup> further contended that this space needs to be respected and acted upon so that these ethical relationships are characterized by embodiment, mutuality, engagement, non-coercion, and choice, which resonate with the ideals of interprofessionality and collaboration.</p>
<p>Friend and Cook<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>
</sup> underscored the importance of relational space and relationships in collaboration by suggesting that collaboration is recognized as involving parity, mutual goals, shared accountability, shared resources, and voluntariness. How respect is viewed is central to the relational ethics of Bergum and Dossetor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468466">26</xref>
</sup>and to how Friend and Cook<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>
</sup> characterize collaboration. Within this viewpoint, collaboration is necessarily, neither top down nor bottom up. Collaboration is, as parity suggests, a recognition that each person within the relationship comes with unique knowledge and skills and with a desire to enter into relationship that benefits both, but harms neither. The establishment of mutual goals for collective action, which is identified as a hallmark of collaboration,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468466">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>
</sup> implies that goals must be acceptable to all involved. Mutuality is aided by the process of engagement, which Bergum and Dossetor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468466">26</xref>
</sup> suggest involves authenticity, openness, trust, and a commitment to respect.</p>
<p>Relationship and respect are reflected strongly in competency frameworks for interprofessional collaboration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>
</sup> They are interpreted variously to mean use of sensitivity, active encouragement of opinions and ideas of other team members, and understanding of the uniqueness of self and others and what each can bring to the care of patients. Respect and relationship are what various writers and documents contend distinguish interprofessionality from other approaches to patient care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468466">28</xref>
</sup> Team members must understand the knowledge, skills, and roles that each brings to the care of the patient and adapt approaches to maximize the expertise that is present, as compared with multidisciplinary care in which professionals work side by side, often autonomously, without real understanding or regard for the expertise of others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012468466">25</xref>
</sup> Parity or equality in decision-making, which Friend and Cook<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468466">27</xref>
</sup> identified as an element of collaboration, means that leadership is shared in interprofessional teams. Leadership is dictated by the nature of the issue or goal, rather than by position<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012468466">29</xref>
</sup> and indeed, as Gadow<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012468466">6</xref>
</sup> suggested, also includes leadership by the patient, which enables proponents of interprofessional collaboration to consider patient-centered care as a legitimate outcome of interprofessional care. While parity is implied as a component of interprofessional collaboration, parity is difficult to attain in interdisciplinary teams.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012468466">30</xref>
</sup> This is exemplified in common clinical situations when nurses attempt to advocate a change in a patient’s treatment plan. Nurses must use evidence-based rationale to make their case to physicians for changes to the treatment plan; however, physicians may or may not provide rationale to nurses for making changes in the patient’s treatment plan. This in and of itself implies a difference in power, which is slanted toward the physician, especially as power in decision-making still resides with physicians.</p>
<p>Various studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> indicate that respect in interprofessional teams may be impeded by a lack of understanding of the roles of team members, rather than by power struggles or competition, a deficiency that may be best addressed through educational processes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012468466">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468466">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012468466">31</xref>
</sup> Jensen et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012468466">31</xref>
</sup> suggest that respect for others begins with a respect for self and the contributions that one is able to bring to the team, which enables free expression of ideas in coming to decisions and determining outcomes. In addition, true respect involves the “assumption that we are deeply and essentially interdependent for our well being” (p. 249).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012468466">31</xref>
</sup> The development of beliefs that sustain respect, relationships, and a deep understanding of the significance of interdependence requires moral courage in the face of barriers, as well as conviction that “something is deeply wrong” (p. 249)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012468466">31</xref>
</sup> and can be changed through resources such as collaboration and teamwork. Such assertions strongly position interprofessionality as a morally defensible perspective and therefore, failure to practice collaboratively or interprofessionally as morally indefensible.</p>
<p>Partnership arises out of common goals and interests. Within the framework of deontology, this relationship is frequently defined by duty and the roles and responsibilities assigned or ascribed to the various actors in the partnership relationship. The individual assumes the role of patient, with attendant and usual expectations, often culturally defined, of what being a patient means. A physician acts in accordance with the responsibilities and practice that are defined through law and by the professional college or association responsible for licensing physicians. Similarly, nurses act in accordance with the established standards for their profession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012468466">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012468466">32</xref>
</sup> While some studies suggest that lack of understanding leads to difficulty in realizing interprofessional collaboration, still others suggest that the duty or obligation that arises out of cultural, social, and legally sanctioned roles, standards, and expectations, such as those of physicians and nurses, may provide barriers that, if not insurmountable, are at least challenging and difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>These expectations, which are implicitly and explicitly expressed by both physicians and other care givers, are that the physician, by virtue of legal status in decisions regarding patient care and because of heavy financial education investments, maintains primary responsibility and dominance for decisions regarding patient care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012468466">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012468466">32</xref>
</sup> While this assumption is consistent with the ethical framework inherent in deontology and Kantian ethics, in which the morality of the human condition is partially expressed in the obligation to follow rules or universal guidelines that are established to free us from the whims of emotion and feelings, it raises important questions about the viability of collaboration within the PHC context, wherein collaboration is assumed to occur best within a power dynamic that acknowledges the capacity of the individual who best knows at the time to make decisions about patient care, which may well be the patient or a variety of health professionals, including the nurse or the physician in interaction with one another. However, if ethical decision-making in health care implies a duty of care that resides in standards and legal tenets, then decision-making that is highly collaborative cannot occur. Decision-making, by necessity, must attend to the normal roles and responsibilities assigned historically, legally, and culturally for health-care providers, which fully embeds the role of the physician as the primary decision maker.</p>

<title>Meaning of collaboration</title>
<p>The relational basis of collaboration is reflected in major reviews of studies and the literature related to collaboration. D’Amour and Oandasan<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468466">20</xref>
</sup> suggest that collaboration “conveys the ideas of sharing and implies collective action oriented towards a common goal” (p. 116). Furthermore, MacIntosh and McCormack<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012468466">33</xref>
</sup> suggest that collaboration involves partnership where members from different domains of understanding and practice work toward a common goal. Both definitions suggest that collaboration involves a unique form of relationship that is goal and action oriented. What is not clear from these conceptualizations is whether partnership is synonymous with collaboration or whether it is a separate although necessary condition for collaboration. What is clear is that collaboration involves people in interaction, who come together largely because they wish to do so, rather because they are mandated to do so, which invokes the idea of Aristotle’s virtue ethics or that good people do good things.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468466">9</xref>
</sup> Virtue ethics emphasizes the traits of character such as honesty, humility, integrity, fairness, courage, and respect as the basis of morality rather than principles (such as in deontology) or outcomes. Acting morally or in the best interests of the patient means being virtuous or acting with good character and thus, the motivation for care and caring arises from a moral inner attitude.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012468466">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012468466"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012468466">36</xref>
</sup> The goodness of fit of moral inner attitude and character traits with collaboration and interprofessionality is recognizable, and as such, virtue ethics may offer a sufficient moral framework for interprofessional collaboration. The difficulty with using virtue ethics as a moral basis for interprofessional care is that its history has been marked by questions as to whether you can teach character or a way of being. This question may well be at the root of contradictory evidence in interprofessional care as to its efficacy and in interprofessional education, where there remain significant questions as to whether interprofessional collaboration can be taught and if so, how.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468466">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468466">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The contradictions of evidence related to the efficacy of interprofessional care and how or if it can be taught raise serious concerns about the morality of health systems that are moving toward mandating relationships that may depend more on character, relationship, and voluntariness than on knowledge or economics. The burden of trying to implement interprofessional collaboration without consideration to its essentially voluntary nature, which may indeed be influenced by character traits of the professionals involved, and the particularity of individual professional perspectives potentially places a heavy moral burden on professionals, such as nurses, who may fail to do what is right in terms of the patient and of their disciplinary perspective, or from an interprofessional perspective.</p>
<sec id="section7-0969733012468466">
<title>Concluding reflections</title>
<p>Defining collaboration as a relational process posits it fully within the framework of moral action, in which we need to consider the implications of collaboration for human endeavor, and within the health-care context, the implications of collaboration, aside from economics, for the patient who is receiving care. Writing on collaboration has tended to focus on clarification of values or on the emergence of joint values and beliefs arising out of the collaborative relationship. Few, if any, have focused on the question of the ethics of collaboration itself. Questions about ethics arise out of the process of collaboration and its implications for education and practice, which includes implications for those who provide care, those who receive care, and those who are being educated to collaborate in the provision of care.</p>
<p>This circumstance raises serious issues about the viability of true collaboration in health care and indeed, about the moral integrity of assuming that collaboration can even occur. This, in turn, leads to a cascade of questions, including the value and morality of intimating to health-care practitioners that collaboration is possible, probable, and teachable.</p>
