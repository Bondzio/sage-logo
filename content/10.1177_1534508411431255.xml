<abstract>
<p>The present study examined the technical adequacy of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) of early numeracy. Six 1-min early mathematics tasks were administered to 137 kindergarten and first-grade students, along with an omnibus test of early mathematics. The CBM measures included Count Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, Missing Number, Next Number, and Number Facts. Alpha and split-half reliabilities were assessed, and construct validity and criterion validity (both concurrent and predictive) were examined. In addition, an item analysis was conducted for each measure using classical test theory and item response theory approaches, specifically using a Rasch model. Results indicated that the measures produced moderately strong reliability coefficients, satisfactory item difficulty and discrimination, evidence to support both concurrent and predictive validity with the standardized early mathematics test, and the tasks appeared to be measuring the construct of early numeracy proficiency.</p>

<p>Early intervention in academic areas can play a key role in identifying students who might be at risk for and in preventing later academic failure. This intervention should take place in reading and mathematics in kindergarten, if not before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411431255">Campbell &amp; Ramey, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508411431255">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>). However, teachers must have efficient and technically adequate methods to identify students that might be at risk for failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534508411431255">Tindal &amp; Parker, 1991</xref>). Technically adequate methods are important because teachers often lack the means to keep track of how well their students are performing and may not know when to intervene with students who are not demonstrating adequate growth. The National Research Council’s <italic>Eager to Learn Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411431255">Bowman, Donovan, &amp; Burns, 2001</xref>) calls for assessment of young children to be built into the instructional process. The National Association for the Education of Young Children and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508411431255">NAEYC/NCTM, 2002</xref>) joint position paper advocates that teachers should “support children’s learning by thoughtfully and continually assessing all children’s mathematical knowledge, skills, and strategies” (p. 4).</p>
<p>In addition, changes in federal special education law (the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411431255">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 2004</xref>) allow states the flexibility to choose methods that are used to make decisions about learning disability identification. States can implement a Response to Intervention model to aid not only in identification but in schoolwide assessment and instruction. A key element of this model is screening of all students in academic areas. While the model has primarily been implemented in reading, many districts are now requesting information and training on screening in mathematics. With this need for information comes the need for technically adequate screening measures in mathematics.</p>
<p>With the recognition that mathematics difficulties in early elementary school may lead to later mathematics deficits, it is important to conduct early screening and identification for students who appear to be struggling with mathematics. The measures used should entail basic mathematical concepts and skills and be reliable and valid for the purposes for which they are used (in this case, finding the students who might need intervention). One form of screening for students at risk in academic areas is curriculum-based measurement (CBM). CBM is a method of repeated measurement toward long-range instructional goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411431255">Deno, 1985</xref>). When used for screening, grade-specific CBM measures are given to all students in the fall, winter, and spring of each school year. Following screening, schools can identify students that might be at risk for not meeting end-of-year curriculum objectives and can intervene with these students. Assessments of this type can guide teachers in grouping their students into three instructional tiers: those who are on track to maintain proficiency in mathematics, those in need of additional intervention, and those who need the most intensive intervention. Teachers can also use the measures for progress monitoring, administering alternate forms of the CBM measures weekly or biweekly, and evaluating whether students are remaining on-track to meet their long-range goals. To use CBM for progress monitoring, teachers administer and score short assessments on a frequent basis, graph the scores, evaluate students’ progress towards goals, and use the data to make decisions about the effectiveness of their instruction.</p>
<p>One of the primary tasks used when screening and progress monitoring in mathematics has been mastery of basic facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411431255">Marston, 1989</xref>). However, prior to the past 10 years, there was no option for screening and progress monitoring in mathematics for students in grades K–1 who cannot yet master basic facts. In the past decade, substantial research has been undertaken in the area of early mathematics assessment both with and without regard to the use of a CBM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431255">Gersten, Jordan, &amp; Flojo, 2005</xref>). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411431255">Mazzocco and Thompson (2005)</xref> examined a comprehensive mathematics screening tool and suggested that screening can be conducted as early as kindergarten and that a multiple-skill screening given in kindergarten can be predictive of later mathematics performance, including math difficulty. In the Mazzocco and Thompson study, the screening included subtests from standardized mathematics tests as well as tests of visual-spatial skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411431255">Jordan, Locuniak, Ramineni, and Kaplan (2007)</xref> provided further evidence that mathematics screening can be predictive of later mathematics difficulty, using growth mixture modeling to target the particular concepts that contribute to the best predictive model.</p>
<p>In addition, early research has also been completed to examine the creation of brief, time-efficient assessment measures that can serve as indicators of mathematics performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431255">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431255">Chard et al. (2005)</xref> have examined the use of tasks such as number identification, quantity discrimination, and missing number with kindergarten and first-grade students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534508411431255">VanDerHeyden, Witt, Naquin, and Noell (2001)</xref> have also examined early mathematics measures that could be used as screening tools in the identification of kindergarten students in need of academic intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411431255">Fuchs, Fuchs, Compton, Hamlett, and Seethaler (2007)</xref> studied methods for screening first-grade students needing attention in mathematics by using a Response to Intervention model. Screening measures consisting of Fact Retrieval, CBM Computation, Number Identification/Counting, and CBM Concepts/Applications were administered to 667 Grade 1 students, followed by weekly progress monitoring consisting of CBM computation and Number Identification/Counting. Results of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411431255">Fuchs et al. (2007)</xref> study suggested that multiskill screening probes should be used for screening purposes. The authors also stated that Number Identification/Counting should receive additional research to examine its utility as an adequate screening tool. In the examination of progress monitoring measures, these researchers found support for multiskill probes over the simpler, single-skill screening measures. In addition, the authors suggest that measures that are useful in screening of math proficiency may not be equally suitable for progress monitoring.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411431255">Lembke, Foegen, Whittaker, and Hampton (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411431255">Hampton et al. (in press)</xref> examined the use of early numeracy measures such as Number Identification, Quantity Discrimination, and Missing Number to monitor student progress of kindergarten and Grade 1 students across a year. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411431255">Lembke et al. (2008)</xref> administered Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, and Missing Number measures once each month for 7 months to 107 students in kindergarten and Grade 1. Alternate form reliability was adequate for instructional decision making, whereas criterion validity coefficients comparing the early numeracy measures to teacher judgment of student proficiency in mathematics and students’ performance on a district-administered standardized test (the <italic>Stanford Early Standardized Achievement Test</italic>) were lower than those observed in previous research. Hierarchical linear modeling was used and all measures produced growth rates that were significant across time, for each grade level, with linear growth observed for the Number Identification measure only.</p>
<p>In the Hampton et al. study, all data was collected via PDA Palm Pilot handheld technology with web-based data management system. Concurrent criterion validity coefficients comparing the measures with student performance on the math subtest of the <italic>Woodcock Johnson III</italic> test of achievement resulted in weaker coefficients compared with previous studies that have compared similar measures with the same standardized test. Hierarchical linear modeling was used at each grade level to ascertain the ability of the six measures to model weekly growth trajectories over 13 weeks. All measures produced growth rates that were significant across time, for both kindergarten and first grade, with linear growth observed in all measures.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431255">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431255">Chard et al. (2005)</xref>, kindergarten (<italic>n</italic> = 436) and first grade (<italic>n</italic> = 483) students were administered tasks such as Counting, Number Identification, Quantity Discrimination, and Missing Number. At the kindergarten level, Number Identification, Quantity Discrimination, and Missing Number tasks had the strongest alternate form reliability and criterion validity, with acceptable reliabilities and criterion validity correlation coefficients ranging from .50 to .69 with the criterion, the Number Knowledge Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508411431255">Okamoto &amp; Case, 1996</xref>). The strongest correlation at the kindergarten level was found between Missing Number and the criterion. Counting, Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, and Missing Number all demonstrated adequate reliability, and criterion validity with the <italic>Woodcock Johnson</italic> Applied Problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534508411431255">Woodcock &amp; Johnson, 1989</xref>), Number Knowledge Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508411431255">Okamoto &amp; Case, 1996</xref>), and CBM basic facts probes for first-grade students ranged from .60 to .79.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534508411431255">VanDerHeyden et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534508411431255">VanDerHeyden et al. (2004)</xref> examined early mathematics measures as part of studies to identify screening tools that could be used to identify kindergarten students in need of academic intervention and to screen preschool children. Measures such as circle number, write number, and draw circles were administered to kindergarten students, with correlations ranging from .44 to .61 with the math composite on the Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills-Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411431255">Brigance, 1999</xref>). For 4-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 53), tasks such as choosing number, number naming, counting objects, free counting, discrimination, and choosing shapes were correlated with the <italic>Brigance Preschool Screen</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411431255">Brigance, 1985</xref>) and the <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Achievement</italic>–2 (TEMA-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411431255">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 1990</xref>). The choosing number and discrimination tasks demonstrated the strongest correlation coefficients with these criterion variables, ranging from .52 to .57.</p>
<p>With limited but promising research completed on technically adequate early mathematics CBM measures, the purpose of the current study is to examine the reliability and validity of a set of CBM screening measures reflecting the larger construct of <italic>early numeracy proficiency</italic>. In this study, early numeracy proficiency was modeled through broad and theoretically derived categories of mathematical thinking: Quick Retrieval, Written Computation, and Number Sense. These measures cover essential aspects of student mathematics: the abilities to retrieve information quickly, to compute, and to have a good feel for the meaning of the material. In the present study, potential indicators of these broad categories of mathematical ability were examined, including providing oral answers to number facts as a measure of Quick Retrieval, Counting Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Next Number, and Missing Number tasks as measures of Number Sense, and a precursor to Written Computation, Number Identification. Although the sensitivity and specificity of the use of the measures for risk identification was not examined as part of this study, this research does provide an initial examination of a screening battery that included measures in three classes that comprise early numeracy proficiency.</p>
<p>There is widespread agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411431255">Ansari &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431255">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>) that quick retrieval of the basic number facts or combinations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division facts with numbers 0 through 10) is both important for learning mathematics and useful for a CBM task. The research shows that knowledge of number combinations predicts achievement, and that children having difficulty with mathematics often do poorly on number combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431255">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508411431255">Russell &amp; Ginsburg, 1984</xref>). From a practical point of view, quick retrieval means that children get the answer quickly and do not have to expend much mental energy on calculation. Quick retrieval may result from rote memory, from fluency with rapid counting, or from application of basic principles such as commutativity of addition. In the proposed CBM measures, quick retrieval in kindergarten is not assessed, as students at this developmental level would not be expected to master this kind of material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411431255">Common Core Mathematics Standards, 2010</xref>). The measure that is examined in this study to assess quick retrieval is Number Facts in first grade.</p>
<p>Written computation includes basic reading and calculation problems. As mentioned previously, many students in grades K–1 are not yet prepared to compute basic facts. The task that we included to assess a precursor to written computation was asking students in kindergarten and Grade 1 to verbally identify randomly presented written numerals from 1 through 20. Previous research has found high alternate form reliability, test–retest reliability, and criterion validity for numeral identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431255">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431255">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411431255">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Number sense involves basic “intuitions” and ideas about numbers, including concepts that make computation easier or eliminate the need for it. Number sense includes the ability to compare the magnitude of numbers, to understand the relative effect of arithmetical operations on numbers, and to have meaningful referents for number and quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508411431255">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989</xref>). It also includes the ability to know whether certain numbers are plausible answers to certain problems, to break numbers into convenient parts that make calculation easier, or to apply basic operational rules to arithmetical equations. Although notoriously hard to define, number sense has shown to be important in predicting academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411431255">Berch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431255">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, theoretically based CBM measures of early mathematics were developed and evaluated in an attempt to replicate and extend existing research on reliable and valid measures, introduce new measures, modify existing measures, and more sophisticated analyses to include construct validity and item analysis. Research questions included:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data were collected from an elementary school in a large Southern urban city. The total enrollment for the district was approximately 30,000 students, with the primary ethnicity being African American (96%), followed by 2% Hispanic, 1% White, and 1% other ethnicities. For this study, a convenience sample of 137 students was used (68 in kindergarten and 69 in first grade), with similar ethnicities represented as that of the district (99% African American and 1% White).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534508411431255">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>In kindergarten, four measures were examined: students’ ability to (a) count out loud (Count Out Loud), (b) discriminate between quantities (Quantity Discrimination) of two numbers, (c) name printed numbers between 1 and 20 (Number Identification), and (d) identify the missing number from a pattern of three numbers (Missing Number). In the Count Out Loud measure, students were prompted to begin with 1 and verbally count consecutively as high as they could. For the Quantity Discrimination measure, students were presented with two written numbers between 0 and 20 and were asked to verbally name which number was greater. In the Number Identification measure, students were asked to verbally state numbers from 0 through 100. The Missing Number measure assessed students’ ability to name a missing number from a set of three numbers while counting in a forward sequence beginning as low as 0 and no greater than 20. The placement of the blank in the number sequence varied randomly.</p>
<p>In Grade 1, six measures were used; we continued to use Count Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, and Missing Number measures identical to the tasks for the kindergarten students, and added measures that included Next Number and Number Facts. In the Next Number measure, students were verbally prompted to say the number that comes next when presented with a random number between 0 and 100. First-grade students were also administered the Number Facts measure, where students verbally answered simple addition and subtraction facts with digits less than 10. All tasks for both kindergarten and Grade 1 were administered for 1 min. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411431255">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of all CBM early mathematics measures, including the number and range of numbers used in items, how items were constructed, and a sample item for each measure.</p>

<p>The <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Ability–Third Edition</italic> (TEMA-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411431255">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>) was used as a criterion measure to assess concurrent and predictive validity. The TEMA-3 is designed for children ages 3 to 8 and consists of 72 items in both informal and formal mathematics. Within the area of informal mathematics, four areas are assessed primarily through verbal, pictorial, or concrete tasks: counting and enumeration skills, number-comparison facility, calculation skills, and understanding of concepts. In the area of formal mathematics, four areas are assessed using written and other tasks and include numeral literacy, mastery of number facts, calculation skills, and understanding of concepts. The TEMA-3 reports high levels of reliability; the test manual indicates internal consistency reliability coefficients of .94 to .96, alternate form reliability coefficients of .93 to .97, and test–retest reliability coefficients of .82 to .93. Criterion validity correlation coefficients relating TEMA-3 performance to scores on other standardized, norm-referenced measures of mathematics achievement range from .54 to .55 (<italic>Key Math</italic>–<italic>Revised, Normative Update</italic>, Basic Concepts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411431255">Connolly, 1998</xref>; and <italic>Woodcock Johnson III</italic> [WJIII] <italic>Tests of Achievement</italic>, Applied Problems; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534508411431255">Woodcock &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>, respectively) to .91 (<italic>Young Children’s Achievement Test</italic> [YCAT]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411431255">Hresko, Peak, Herron, &amp; Bridges, 2000</xref>, Mathematics Quotient).</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>After parental consent was obtained, student participants completed two rounds of data collection over 4 days in October. In the first round of data collection, the CBM early mathematics measures were administered. One form of each measure was individually administered, with each data collection session lasting approximately 5 min per student. In the second round of data collection, on the days directly following the CBM data collection, the TEMA-3 was individually administered to students, with sessions lasting from 20 to 35 min per student. To assess predictive validity, the TEMA-3 was administered again at the end of the year, in May. Data collection took place in the library at the school from trained data collectors, who were all veteran educators with experience in mathematics, early childhood education, and assessment administration. Data collectors were trained to administer the CBM measures and the TEMA-3 in a session prior to data collection at the school and reliability of administration and scoring was assessed at that time.</p>

<sec id="section5-1534508411431255">
<title>Analytic Plan for Item Analyses</title>
<p>Characteristics of the items in the CBM early mathematics measures were examined through classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). For CTT statistics, item difficulty, <italic>p+</italic>, was computed as the proportion of students who answered an item correctly as each item of the CBM measures was dichotomously scored. Higher measures of item difficulty indicate an easier item as it reflects a greater number of students with a correct response. When targeting all levels of mathematics performance, the range for the average item difficulties can be expected to range from .3 to .7 in order to maximize the information the items will reveal about the students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411431255">Allen &amp; Yen, 1979</xref>). As such, items can be classified as “easy” if <italic>p+</italic> is greater than .7 and “hard” if <italic>p+</italic> is below .3. A discrimination coefficient (<italic>D</italic>) was calculated as a point biserial correlation (r<sub><italic>pbi</italic></sub>) between scores on an item (e.g., 0 or 1) and total score on all other items on the CBM measure. Item discrimination indicates how well an item is able to discriminate between students of low and high ability. <italic>D</italic> classifies items as having “good” discrimination if <italic>D</italic> is .3 and greater; “fair” if <italic>D</italic> is between .20 and .29; and “marginal to poor” if <italic>D</italic> is lower than .20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411431255">Crocker &amp; Algina, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Item analysis in IRT was conducted using the Rasch model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508411431255">Rasch, 1960</xref>). An advantage of IRT over CTT is that sample-independent inferences about student ability as well as characteristics of the items can be made. CTT relies on sample-dependent statistics that may bias the understanding of the assessment. For example, when a test is administered to a group of students with high ability, item analysis under the CTT framework may reveal that the items are too easy, thereby making sample-dependent conclusions. More specifically, the power of IRT, if the model fits the data, is to overcome two major shortcomings of CTT: (a) the ability or degree to which a student has the ability in question is treated as independent of the characteristics of items (i.e., examinee invariance) and (b) the item parameters such as item difficulty and discrimination are not dependent on the sample of participants (i.e., item invariance), which is a condition for generalizability. Among various IRT models, the Rasch model was chosen because of the relatively small sample size in the current study, as the Rasch model has the fewest parameters to estimate: a student’s ability parameter and an item difficulty parameter. The computer program WINSTEPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411431255">Linacre, 2005</xref>) was used with its default setting to conduct the Rasch analysis as it handles incomplete data in the CBM measures. WINSTEPS uses a joint maximum likelihood estimation approach that takes advantage of the Rasch model’s sufficient statistic property of total scores, which allows derivation of expected values to estimate item parameters. This technique provides a flexible method of handling missing values that produces consistent estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411431255">Linacre, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Means and standard deviations of each measure for kindergarten and Grade 1 are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508411431255">Table 2</xref>. On average, kindergarten students answered approximately 3 to 33 items correctly in 1 min on the various mathematics tasks, with the least correct on the Missing Number measure (<italic>M</italic> = 3.10) and the most correct on the Counting Out Loud measure (<italic>M</italic> = 32.52). The greatest dispersion of scores for kindergarteners was on the Counting Out Loud measure (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.21), whereas the measure where the dispersion of student scores was least was on the Missing Number measure (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.30). On average, students in Grade 1 scored the least correct on the Number Facts measure (<italic>M</italic> = 4.47) and the most correct on the Counting Out Loud measure (<italic>M</italic> = 68.83). The greatest dispersion of scores for first-grade students was on the Counting Out Loud measure (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.84), with the smallest dispersion of scores on the Number Facts measure (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.78). In all cases, students’ scores on the measures more than doubled when administered to first-grade students compared to kindergarteners.</p>

<title>Construct Validity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411431255">Table 4</xref> presents the results of the CFA model for only kindergarten. Note that the sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 69) in Grade 1 was relatively small to conduct the CFA analysis because there were six measures administered and it required at least 80 students. For kindergarten, the c2 value was 4.83 with 2 degrees of freedom and its <italic>p</italic> value was .09, indicating that the hypothesized model (i.e., early numeracy proficiency is measured by four CBM early mathematics measures) fit the data. Other model-fit indices also agreed that the CFA model for kindergarten had a reasonably good fit: (a) standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .04, meaning that the model explains the correlation to within an average error of .04 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411431255">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995</xref>), (b) comparative fit index (CFI) = .97, in which a cutoff value close to .95 suggests an adequate fit to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411431255">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>), and (c) the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508411431255">Tucker &amp; Lewis, 1973</xref>) = .92, with values close to .95 being indicative of good fit. However, the fit measured by the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was not favorable for kindergarten (RMSEA = .14), where values greater than .10 indicate poor fit; the upper bound of its 90% confidence interval exceeds .10, which seems mainly related to the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 68), as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411431255">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref>. Therefore, although the CFA results pointed out that the overall model fits the data well (i.e, it supports the evidence of construct validity for the CBM measures in kindergarten), the wide confidence interval of the RMSEA suggests that a larger sample may be required in order to obtain more precise results for further study.</p>

Given that all measurement errors appear to be uncorrelated, all of the CBM early mathematics measure in kindergarten showed relatively high standardized factor loadings and were statistically significant at the .01 level: Count Out Loud = .59, Quantity Discrimination = .69, Missing Number = .85, and Number Identification = .82. From the CFA results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411431255">Table 4</xref>, it can be concluded that given the data, the CBM early mathematics measures seem to support a unidimensional measure of one underlying construct, early numeracy proficiency.

Results show that all concurrent validity measures ranged between .40 and .68 across both kindergarten and Grade 1. For predictive validity, the correlations were smaller, with values ranging between .25 and .59 across kindergarten and Grade 1. All values were significant with the exception of Grade 1 Count Out Loud measure, which had a value of .25, the lowest correlation among the comparisons.

<title>Item Analysis</title>
<p>Item characteristics (item difficulty and discrimination) for each item in the CBM early mathematics measures were estimated through both CTT and IRT. Item difficulty is essential for determining whether students have mastered the concept being tested. Also, the ability of the CBM measures to discriminate between students that have mastered particular skills and those that have not is important for determining particular skills that need to be remediated, and for use in determining which students might be struggling overall in mathematics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534508411431255">Table 6</xref> presents the average item difficulty and item discrimination for each property to be assessed in the CBM measures due to a space limit. The time constraints imposed by the CBM methodology resulted in small numbers of unreached responses toward the end of the measures. However, even though item characteristics were relatively poor because of time constraints and consequently lack of responses, these items were not excluded from the measures. Note that the Count Out Loud measure was excluded from the item analysis for both grades because it was intended to measure the ability to count out loud from 1 and continuing as high as the student can count in the given time (i.e., 1 min); thus the item difficulty decreases as the number becomes larger.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534508411431255">Table 6</xref>, average item difficulty for students in kindergarten indicated that the Missing Number measure was most difficult (<italic>p</italic>+ = .28, .30, and .19 for properties of sets between 0 and 10, 0 and 20, and 11 and 20, respectively); and the Quantity Discrimination measure was easiest (<italic>p</italic>+ = .50) using CTT item difficulty. More specifically, items using a set between 11 and 20 in Missing Number and items from the 21 to 50 and 50 to 100 categories in Number Identification showed low item difficulty (i.e., they were difficult) when compared to items in Quantity Discrimination. Item difficulty estimated with the Rasch model showed a slightly different result: the Number Identification task was most difficult (β = .20) and the Missing Number task was easiest (β = .07) among the CBM measures. The values of r<sub><italic>pbis</italic></sub> seem reasonably good to very good varying from .39 to .69, indicating that the items of the CBM early mathematics measures in kindergarten seem to have a high level of discriminating power.</p>
<p>For Grade 1, the Number Facts measure was most difficult (<italic>p</italic>+ = .39) and the Quantity Discrimination (<italic>p</italic>+ = .61) and Next Number (<italic>p</italic>+ = .61) measures were easiest among the CBM measures based on CTT statistics. However, the Missing Number measure was easiest (β = .13) and the Quantity Discrimination measure was most difficult (β = .34) for students in Grade 1 based on the Rasch item difficulty parameter. Average item discriminations were satisfactory for all the CBM early mathematics measures for Grade 1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend existing research on reliable and valid early mathematics screening measures, introduce new measures, modify existing measures, replicate results of criterion validity studies with additional students, and perhaps most importantly, to examine the theory that particular early mathematics measures might contribute to the construct of early numeracy proficiency. The proposed CBM early mathematics measures were examined with respect to their fit within a model of mathematical reasoning characterized by three components: Quick Retrieval, Number Sense, and Written Computation. For students in kindergarten and Grade 1, measures included Counting Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Missing Number, and Number Identification, with the addition of Next Number and Number Facts measures for students in Grade 1.</p>
<p>CBMs that are technically adequate embody several characteristics, including limited floor or ceiling effects, large standard deviations, reliability, validity, and satisfactory item characteristics. It is important to identify measures that do not demonstrate floor or ceiling effects so that students’ performance can be measured early in their academic careers and can continue to be monitored on the same measures as they move through the grades. It appears that for kindergarten students, the Count Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, and Number Identification measures produced performance that did not approach a floor or ceiling, and for students in Grade 1, all measures were acceptable, indicating that these measures appear to capture students’ performance from kindergarten through Grade 1.</p>
<p>However, measures did vary in score distribution, with the lowest student means on Missing Number at 3.10 and 8.97 for kindergarten and Grade 1 students, respectively. The highest student means were for the Counting Out Loud measure, with kindergarten students receiving a mean of 32.52 and Grade 1 students receiving a mean score of 68.83. The greatest standard deviations were seen in the Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, and Counting Out Loud measures for both kindergarten and Grade 1, indicating that these measures have the potential to discriminate among students at a variety of levels.</p>
<p>With respect to reliability, all measures for each grade had high reliability coefficients, above the acceptable threshold of .70, which was similar to previous work on early mathematics measures. For purposes of educational decision making, however, we expect that the reliabilities will be at least .80, and all measures were above this level, with coefficients for kindergarten measures ranging from .87 (Missing Number) to .97 (Count Out Loud) on alpha reliability, with similar results for split-half reliability. For students in Grade 1, alpha reliabilities ranged from .80 on Number Facts to .98 on Count Out Loud, with split-half reliabilities mirroring these results. In the future, greater strength of reliability could be assumed if test–retest and alternate-form reliability tests were conducted. Given that these measures were administered to very young students at the beginning of the year, it was promising to see the strong levels of reliability. Teachers of these students need to feel confident that if they give the measures consistently, the data will be providing the same information each time.</p>
<p>CFA was used to evaluate the construct validity of the CBM early mathematics measures. This CFA is a significant contribution to the literature, in that in previous research on early mathematics screening measures, factor analysis has only been used in two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411431255">Floyd, Hojnoski, &amp; Key, 2006</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411431255">Lago &amp; DiPerna, 2010</xref>). In the Floyd et al. study, confirmatory factor analysis was used to determine whether the four early numeracy measures used (oral counting, quantity comparison, number naming, and one-to-one correspondence) represented a single-factor “number sense” or whether an alternative model might better fit the data. The single-factor model indicated good fit on all fit indices except one, where there was mediocre fit. Follow-up models indicated that fit indices were not enhanced by variations on this single-factor model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411431255">Lago and DiPerna (2010)</xref> used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine factor structure of number sense in kindergarten. Although they used measures drawn from a variety of previous studies, because they were uncertain about the fit of those measures, they used EFA. We used CFA to assess the construct validity because we specified the factor and how they relate to items from the CBM measures developed. With EFA, the factor structure is not specified up front, whereas in this study, the theory supported that these measures should be part of the CFA. The results of the CFA analysis supported the evidence of the construct validity in that the construct of Early Numeracy Proficiency was measured by Count Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Missing Number, and Number Identification for kindergarten. We were confident that the measures we were using to measure students’ mathematics performance were in fact indicative of the construct of early numeracy proficiency for kindergarten.</p>
<p>With respect to criterion validity, correlations were calculated between students’ scores on the CBM measures and the students’ scaled score on a standardized test of early mathematics, the <italic>Test of Early Mathematics Achievement–3</italic> (TEMA-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411431255">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>), administered in the fall (for concurrent validity) and spring (for predictive validity) data collection. Even though previous studies in this area did not assess criterion validity using a path model, these strong and significant coefficients imply very similar results to those in the research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431255">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431255">Chard et al. (2005)</xref>, where the strongest correlations observed were for the number identification, quantity discrimination, and missing number tasks, again, similar to the results of the present study. Also, it should be noted that the measures in the present study include Number Facts and Next Number measures, which were not assessed in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431255">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431255">Chard et al. (2005)</xref> work.</p>
<p>An item analysis was conducted to determine whether certain items (or properties) were disproportionately easy or difficult for students. This is an area that has been addressed in one other study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411431255">Lei, Wu, DiPerna, &amp; Morgan, 2009</xref>) on early mathematics CBM measures in the past, but it certainly warrants further study and has the potential to move the research forward in the future. In a CBM system, it should not be item variance that is causing fluctuations in student performance but changes in student achievement. Average item difficulty and discrimination indicated most of the items on the CBM early mathematics measures have adequate levels of item difficulties and satisfactory discrimination for each grade. Although there were a few items that were easy for the participants, we are searching for measures that serve as overall indicators of proficiency in early mathematics, and can discriminate among students within and across grades. Although it is not desirable to exclude items that are important and valuable for the content from a criterion-referenced test because they are too easy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534508411431255">Wiberg, 2004</xref>), it is not recommended to exclude items from a CBM measure that are contributing to the overall content unless these items are clearly too difficult for all students (i.e., all students score 0 on this item each time it is administered).</p>
<sec id="section12-1534508411431255">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One obvious limitation to this study was the small sample size. With measures given to fewer than 70 students in each grade, generalization is limited. This small sample size resulted in a related limitation, as the CFA could not be conducted for the Grade 1 students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534508411431255">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Overall, it appears that for both kindergarten and first-grade students, the measures used in this study did fit the model for Early Numeracy Proficiency, based on results from both reliability and validity analyses. For kindergarten students, the Counting Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, and Number Identification measures and for Grade 1 students, all six measures (Counting Out Loud, Quantity Discrimination, Number Identification, Missing Number, Next Number, and Number Facts), appeared to have the greatest technical adequacy, with few floor and no ceiling effects, and the ability to discriminate among students at different levels. Along with the results from other previous studies, these results provide further confirmation of a small group of measures that can provide information to kindergarten and Grade 1 teachers regarding which students might be successful on early numeracy concepts and which students are struggling with early numeracy concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534508411431255">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this study give us further confidence that these early mathematics measures can serve as good screening tools for students in early elementary. However, future research should examine the utility of using these measures to demonstrate growth over time, along with examining predictive validity with long-term outcome measures. In addition, further examination with a greater number and more diverse sample of students, across several settings and years, is necessary to validate that the measures are effective for the purposes of screening and progress monitoring in early mathematics. This research is promising as we look toward identifying evidence-based systems of screening and progress monitoring in mathematics, to intervene early, and to improve instruction for all students.</p>
