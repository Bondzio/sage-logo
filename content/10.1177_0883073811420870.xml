<abstract>
<p>The authors describe mitochondrial studies in a 6-year-old patient with a seizure disorder that can be seen in myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers. Using a recently developed noninvasive approach, analysis of buccal mitochondrial enzyme function revealed severe respiratory complex I and IV deficiencies in the patient. In addition, analysis of buccal mitochondrial DNA showed significant amounts of the common 5 kb and 7.4 kb mitochondrial DNA deletions, also detectable in blood. This study suggests that a buccal swab approach can be used to informatively examine mitochondrial dysfunction in children with seizures and may be applicable to screening mitochondrial disease with other clinical presentations.</p>

<p>Encephalomyopathies with a wide range of clinical presentations have been reported in children in association with marked defects in mitochondrial structure and bioenergetic enzyme function. Some of these mitochondrial-based disorders including Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy; mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes; myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF); and Leigh disease are known to result from alterations in mitochondrial DNA including pathogenic point mutations. Reductions in overall mitochondrial DNA levels primarily due to specific nuclear gene mutations are also known to lead to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction with a similarly broad spectrum of clinical presentation. In addition, large deletions in mitochondrial DNA may also result in mitochondrial diseases, primarily Kearns-Sayre syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and have even been described in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes; Leigh disease; and MERRF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420870">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420870">3</xref></sup> Biochemical analysis, usually of biopsied skeletal muscle, often shows significant deficiencies in specific respiratory complex activities, most frequently in complex I and IV, although deficiencies in II, III, and V have also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420870">4</xref></sup> In addition to the considerable overlap of both phenotypes and genotypes in mitochondrial diseases, severe mitochondrial enzyme dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA mutations have also been reported in children with seizures, muscle weakness, autism, or hypotonia who do not necessarily fit easily into the above clinical categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420870">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420870">7</xref></sup>

<title>Case Report</title>

<title>Clinical Data</title>
<p>The patient is a 6-year old girl, was a product of a full-term delivery, and was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 20-year-old primiparous mother. There were no prenatal or perinatal complications. The patient developed signs of motor and social delay at 5 months. By 1 year of age, a global delay was apparent, and the patient started to have brief myoclonic jerks of her extremities throughout the day. Her seizures were primarily myoclonic with only rare generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain at the time was normal. Levetiracetam, clonazepam, and topiramate were used with good but not complete efficacy. Her electroencephalogram showed multifocal sharp waves with a high-amplitude, disorganized background consistent with hypsarrhythmia. The patient steadily declined in cognitive function. Her neurologic examination revealed a child who is nonambulatory, nonverbal, and unable to follow commands, with generalized hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and ataxia. She displayed brief multifocal myoclonic jerks involving face and extremities, with a frequency of about 1 every 5 seconds. She was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and feeding difficulties and had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed around her sixth birthday. Her height and weight were always below the 5th percentile, but her head circumference was between the 5th and 25th percentiles. Family history was unremarkable, except for reported epilepsy in the mother’s paternal aunt. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with MERRF based on clinical phenotype and the biochemical findings described below and was started on coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>, carnitine, and multivitamins.</p>

<title>Laboratory and Biochemical Data</title>
<p>An initial metabolic workup revealed normal plasma lactate and pyruvate levels. Lysosomal enzymes in white blood cells were moderately abnormal with elevated α-mannosidase, α-fucosidase, arylsulfatase A, and β-mannosidase and decreased levels of β-glucosidase. Serum levels of β-galactosidase and α-fucosidase were also mildly elevated. Plasma amino acid analysis was uninformative.</p>
<p>Buccal swabs were processed in extraction buffer containing 1.5% lauryl maltoside, 100 mM of NaCl, 25 mM of HEPES pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors as suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420870">8</xref></sup> After incubation for 15 minutes on ice, sample extracts were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 16 000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes at 4°C and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL 3K centrifugal filters. Duplicate aliquots were subjected for protein concentration determination using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Levels of complex I activity were determined by a recently developed immunocapture methodology (Mitosciences)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420870">8</xref></sup> using aliquoted buccal extract on each dipstick obtained from 3 different independent sets of swabs performed 4 months apart. This dipstick technique has been recently shown to accurately identify complex I and IV deficiencies in cultured fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420870">8</xref></sup> and in buccal swab analysis of selected patients with suspected mitochondrial disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420870">9</xref></sup> Levels of complex IV and citrate synthase (CS) activity were assessed using standard spectrophotometric procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420870">4</xref></sup> Activities of complex I and IV were normalized relative to CS activity levels and were expressed as activity ratios (ie, I/CS and IV/CS).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811420870">Table 1</xref>, both buccal complex I/CS and IV/CS activity ratios were significantly reduced (28% and 20%, respectively, of the mean control values) as compared to values obtained with swabs from unaffected healthy children (n = 99, drawn from the well-child and neurology clinics), suggesting that significant deficiencies were present in both buccal respiratory complex activities (with &lt;10% variation between 3 independent patient buccal swab evaluations performed over an 11-month period). In contrast, buccal mitochondrial content as assessed by CS activity and frataxin content, the latter gauged by independent dipstick assessment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420870">10</xref></sup> was within normal limits on all 3 evaluations.</p>

<p>Analysis of specific pathogenic point mutations and large-scale deletions (ie, the 5 and 7.4 kb deletions) in mitochondrial DNA, reported previously in association with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420870">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420870">11</xref></sup> was performed on DNA extracted from patient buccal swabs and from blood using the QIAamp procedure (Qiagen, Valencia, California). None of the following pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations were detected in either patient blood or buccal material: 8344, 8363, 15967, 611, 15975, 14487, 12147, 8296, 5521G&gt;A, 3243, and 3251. In addition, common pathogenic mutations screened at 12 other loci on mitochondrial DNA were not detected in the patient.</p>
<p>However, both the buccal and blood mitochondrial DNA had significant albeit low levels (&lt;5% of the wild-type level) of the 5 kb and 7.4 kb deletions. The relative abundance of each deletion level was gauged using semiquantitative analysis as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420870">11</xref></sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The clinical diagnosis of MERRF is based on the following 4 features: myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, ataxia, and ragged red fibers in the muscle biopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420870">12</xref></sup> In addition, the MERRF syndrome typically features a marked deficiency in respiratory complex I and IV activities, which is generally assessed by biochemical analysis of biopsied skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420870">13</xref></sup> In this study, muscle biopsy could not be accomplished due to lack of significant muscle mass and the relatively high cost of the procedure. The patient has clinically been diagnosed with MERRF, based on a phenotype of progressive myoclonic epilepsy despite the nonavailability of muscle ragged red fiber evaluation. This case warranted, as many do, particularly with infants and small children, a noninvasive approach to evaluating mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
<p>Using a buccal swab approach, our laboratory has begun to demonstrate the reliability of identifying complex I and IV deficiencies in buccal extracts from children with suspected mitochondrial disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420870">9</xref></sup> Moreover, our recent studies have shown that significant buccal complex I and/or IV deficiencies have been detected in more than 84% (32/38) of patients with previously identified defects in either complex I or IV activities as revealed by biopsied skeletal muscle analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811420870">14</xref></sup> In this patient, the severe deficiencies in both buccal complex I and IV activities were consistent with a MERRF diagnosis and confirmed the usefulness of using buccal analysis of respiratory complex deficiency in screening patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders.</p>
<p>Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers with its demonstrable biochemical defects in the respiratory chain and mitochondrial DNA defects is a clear-cut example that some forms of epilepsy are the result of deficiencies in mitochondrial energy production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420870">13</xref></sup> Moreover, accumulating evidence has shown that a variety of seizure phenotypes often appear to be associated with extensive mitochondrial dysfunction. It has long been appreciated that epilepsy can be a critical sign in the early presentation and frequently the most apparent neurologic sign of atypical mitochondrial disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811420870">15</xref></sup> as well as a marker of disease severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420870">16</xref></sup> Moreover, impaired mitochondrial function has been shown in animal models and in patients with associated seizure-disorder phenotypes, including temporal lobe epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811420870">17</xref></sup> Several recent reports have indicated that complex I is a hot spot for mitochondrial dysfunction leading to epilepsy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420870">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811420870">18</xref></sup> not surprising given its pivotal roles in electron transport, as a significant generator of reactive oxygen species and target of oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811420870">19</xref></sup> In addition, an increasing assortment of underlying defects in mitochondrial DNA and in nuclear genes leading to mitochondrial enzyme and bioenergetic dysfunction and to associated seizure disorders has been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420870">20</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a potential confounding factor in evaluating these studies relates to the well-established effects on mitochondrial function of commonly used treatments for epilepsy including, but not limited to, valproic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420870">21</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, the pleiotropic nature of the mitochondrial enzymatic deficiencies suggested the possible involvement of a mitochondrial transfer RNA mutation or of marked alterations in the integrity and overall levels of mitochondrial DNA. Although we have screened extensively for previously described pathogenic mutations (particularly in mutations associated with MERRF) without success, pathogenic mutations in either novel or unscreened sites on mitochondrial DNA remain a distinct possibility. Preliminary results from semiquantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction amplification studies revealed no evidence of significant mitochondrial DNA depletion. In addition, no evidence was found in the patient’s blood DNA of known pathogenic mutations in polymerase gamma gene, previously implicated in cases of mitochondrial DNA depletion.</p>
<p>As far as we know, this study is the first to detect multiple deletions in a patient with a MERRF phenotype using buccal DNA. One previous study reported a multiple mitochondrial DNA deletion phenotype in biopsied skeletal muscle from a 16-year-old patient with MERRF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420870">1</xref></sup> Although the use of buccal analysis of heteroplasmic point mutations in mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly reported in a wide variety of mitochondrial disease phenotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811420870">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811420870">23</xref></sup> few studies have employed buccal mitochondrial DNA deletion analysis in these patients. Buccal analysis of mitochondrial DNA deletions has been in general limited to the study of Kearns-Sayre syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and Pearson syndrome, mitochondrial-based disorders in which mitochondrial DNA deletion levels are particularly high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811420870">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811420870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811420870">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the presence of multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions (both 5 kb and 7.4 kb) found in this patient is contributory to her clinical phenotype. Although each deletion is present (roughly at 5% of the total wild-type level), in themselves clearly not at levels sufficient for causing the roughly 75% buccal mitochondrial enzymatic deficiency we have found, these deletions may nevertheless be indications of an overall decrease in mitochondrial genome integrity. It is also noteworthy that the same deletions (at similar levels) were also found in the patient’s blood DNA analysis. Determining whether these mitochondrial DNA deletions are in fact contributory elements of the disease etiology or consequences of severe mitochondrial respiratory complex deficiency (and the subsequent generation of oxidative stress) will be an important focal point for further research.</p>
<p>In summary, the use of buccal swab analysis in investigating mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA defects in children with suspected mitochondrial disease including seizure phenotypes appears to be a highly informative, easily replicable noninvasive screening tool with significant potential in both diagnostic and prognostic evaluation.</p>
