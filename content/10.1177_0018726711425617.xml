<abstract>
<p>Simplexity is advanced as an umbrella term reflecting sensemaking, organizing and storytelling for our time. People in and out of organizations increasingly find themselves facing novel circumstances that are suffused with dynamic complexity. To make sense through processes of organizing, and to find a plausible answer to the question ‘what is the story?’, requires a fusion of sufficient complexity of thought with simplicity of action, which we call simplexity. This captures the notion that while sensemaking is a balance between thinking and acting, in a new world that owes less to yesterday’s stories and frames, keeping up with the times changes the balance point to clarifying through action. This allows us to see sense (making) more clearly.</p>

<body>
<p>There is currently a great deal of retrospective sensemaking regarding recent unprecedented events of rioting and looting in London and other English cities. Unprecedented events challenge organizing and sensemaking in as much as they instigate a search for meaning or a story that explains what is going on, while they also expose, sometimes cruelly, the now flawed assumptions on which yesterday rested. What was also surprising was the speed and dynamic complexity with which events were unfolding. Not only were police caught out by what was happening, they were also having difficulty catching up with what was occurring. Action on the part of the rioters was ahead of the police response to contain it. Police officers in riot gear reported that their protection was so heavy that they could not keep up with rioters, let alone confront them. Analogously, this prompts the question of why police did not have the tools and tactics to keep up with events. Like wildland fire, the rioters were faster than those fire fighters whose job was to contain it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711425617">Weick, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One surprising feature of this rioting was that it was apparently well-organized. Normally, riots are crowds of demonstrators that have become more like mindless mobs. In London, the many spontaneous eruptions were organized through media such as BlackBerry messaging, thus becoming a more mindful mob, not so much talked into existence as messaged into existence and organized. This gives a whole new meaning to organized crime and because unlike Facebook and Twitter, BlackBerry messaging is encrypted, this means that the police were at a disadvantage. The organizing and sensemaking that was taking place outside formal organization was generating action that was one step ahead of formal organization. The riots provide a glimpse of a brave, in the sense of chilling, new world: potentially, the shape of things to come.</p>
<p>This is a story that reflects the times in which people in organizations increasingly find themselves having to make sense: times that, while they are suffused with complexity and novelty (here the advent of well-organized rioting), demand quick and coordinated responses to events that are unfolding at such great pace that they threaten organizational and personal survival, let alone success. Such is the lesson from countless other organizational examples, including the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the disastrous events at the Fukushima nuclear plant or even recently in Norway, caused by Anders Behring Breivik’s unprecedented attack. All are characterized by dynamic complexity, putting a premium on the sophistication of the organizing processes to be a match for the ‘variousness’ that inheres in such circumstances. In short, the story of our times is one of <italic>simplexity</italic>: that is, the requirement for requisite complexity of thought combined with appropriate simplicity of action. Simplexity is a synthesis that articulates, both in the sense of speaking to the ideas of sensemaking, organizing and storytelling, and in the sense of linking them together. As such, we will in this editorial be using the concept simplexity in reconnaissance mode, as described by Kurt Lewin in the first volume of <italic>Human Relations</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711425617">1947</xref> as acquiring data as to where one now stands and whether the field has changed significantly.</p>
<sec id="section1-0018726711425617">
<title>On simplexity</title>
<p>Simplexity is a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711425617">Colville (1994)</xref> to refer to organizational skills that characterize future organizing: a fusion of sufficient complexity of thought with necessary simplicity of action. Complexity of thinking is required to notice and register the variety – the wild profusion of things – that reflects an increasingly random, entropic world. Rather like the case for requisite variety, an instrument as complex as the environment one is seeking to understand is needed for the processes of sensemaking and organizing to work effectively. We also argue that you need action. Action clarifies situations – it eliminates ‘might have beens’ by reducing equivocality – and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick (2012)</xref> highlights, is central to this Special Issue’s endeavour to elaborate linkages between sensemaking, organizing and storytelling. The difference here between reducing equivocality and reducing ambiguity is crucial to our argument. Lessening ambiguity implies that through action you can learn to discount what <italic>might</italic> have been going on and reach an answer to the question as to what <italic>is</italic> going on (or ‘what is the story?’). Reducing equivocality suggests that action does not clarify by allowing you to eliminate ‘lack of clarity’ but that action clarifies by shaping what it is that you are attending to and in ‘the doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711425617">Mangham and Pye, 1991</xref>), shapes what is going on. This way, one creates the story. Indeed, ‘the primary human mechanism for attaching meaning to particular experiences is to tell stories about them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711425617">Brody, 1987</xref>: 5). This ascription of meaning to experience provides the link between sensemaking and storytelling and achieves organizing through processes of inscription.</p>
<p>This may well be recognized as the sensemaking recipe that comes from the story made famous by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711425617">Weick (1979)</xref> of the little girl who, after being told to be sure of meaning before she spoke, said ‘How can I know what I think ’til I see what I say?’. While she was effectively being told to think before she acted, what the little girl had put her finger on (perhaps because she was young and had little past experience on which to draw) is that you can also act your way into meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711425617">Bruner, 1990</xref>). Sensemaking is thus a balance of making sense through thinking and acting in which there is always an element of both: simplexity is a way of conveying the idea that this balance point changes in ‘a more random world’.</p>
<p>We live not just in times of continuous change but continuous discontinuous change. If we understand sensemaking as staying in contact with context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711425617">Weick, 2009</xref>: 33), itself a continual effort to devise systems of discourse that can keep up with what is going on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711425617">Geertz, 1995</xref>: 19), this poses a double difficulty for organizing and organization: on the one hand, because in times of flux the past no longer serves as a reliable guide to what is going on, and on the other, because when continuous change is also discontinuous change, it is difficult to know how to act in a world that is not just equivocal but unpredictably equivocal.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711425617">Langer (1989</xref>: 37) offers an interesting observation of context in her book on mindfulness: ‘A context is a premature cognitive commitment, a mindset. Context depends on who we are today, who we were yesterday and from which view we see things.’ Thus, staying in contact with context, or sensemaking, is facilitated by frames which comprise the organization of past experience into generalized categories of meaning that become institutionalized in the form of organizational routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711425617">Brown and Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711425617">Feldman and Pentland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711425617">Tsoukas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711425617">Tsoukas and Chia, 2002</xref>). However, there is a conservative tendency in this in which the organizational answer to the question posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711425617">Goffman (1974</xref>: 8) ‘what is it that is going on here?’ tends to be shaped by ‘what has gone on in the past’. This is why a sensible event often resembles one that has happened before. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711425617">Bruner (1990</xref>: 56) noted, ‘framing pursues experience into memory’ and because ‘[t]he typical form of framing experience is in narrative form . . . it lends itself to storying’. This is why the phrase ‘that reminds me of a story’ is perhaps the most common sensemaking gambit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711425617">Gabriel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711425617">Weick, 1995</xref>). It is also a simplifying tactic. It is a ‘common-sense’-making in that in pursuing experience into memory, much of the granularity of experience is lost in the interests of fitting the type of story that is being told (e.g. epic, tragic, romantic, ironic). As such, this is a common-sense-making device.</p>
<p>While not suggesting that sensemaking and storytelling are synonymous, sensemaking implicates storytelling and storytelling implies sensemaking. Sensemaking from this perspective is essentially an act of cueing a story in the form of a frame that provides a recipe: a recipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711425617">Schutz, 1960</xref>) that serves both as a scheme of interpretation (i.e. this is the meaning of the situation) while also serving as a scheme for action (i.e. this is what you should do next). As such, the performance of stories is a key part of members’ sensemaking in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711425617">Boje, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711425617">Brown, 2006</xref>), involving a temporal sequencing of discursive information through their emplotment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711425617">Czarniawska, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711425617">Rhodes and Brown, 2005</xref>). Story thus shapes and conveys sensemaking. In shaping and conveying sense, a story also edits and simplifies in the interests of familiarity. Just as a sensible event resembles one we have seen before, then a good story is one that we have either heard before or that echoes or resonates with one we have heard before. As the organization of experience is never wholly disinterested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711425617">Parker-Follett, 1941</xref>), so stories are expressions of, and exercises in, power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711425617">Brown, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711425617">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711425617">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711425617">Foucault, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>But what if events do not remind you of a story? Is there still sensemaking? And if the old stories exert a simplifying latent power over what is seen and what is ignored, how do old stories lose their hold and a new story more in keeping with the times emerges? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711425617">Wallemacq and Sims (1998)</xref>, the ultimate lack of sense is when you cannot produce a narrative to go with the situation. The shock of the new disrupts the taken for granted nature and exposes its assumptive basis. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711425617">the 9/11 Commission Report (2004)</xref> noted that CIA officials received a report headed <italic>Terrorists learn to fly</italic> in the weeks before the bombing of the Twin Towers, but did not see this information as meriting further attention. We suggest that as this did not fit any pre-existing frames regarding what terrorists did, the officials had no means of understanding the significance of the situation: that is, they had no story to go with it and failed to make sense of it.</p>
<p>In a paper entitled ‘The concept of organization’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711425617">Bittner (1965)</xref> asked what is it that is organized in an organization. The answer according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711425617">Wildavsky (1983)</xref> is bias, while for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711425617">Tsoukas (2005)</xref>, it is abstraction. It is bias because an organization cannot attend to everything in the environment, it chooses which portions and aspects of the environment it will attend to, such that what it sees there and how it behaves is biased by what it has done before. It is abstraction because what has been done before leads to the generalization of recurring behaviours by means of institutionalized roles: ‘For an activity to be said to be organized implies that types of behaviour in types of situations are connected to types of actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711425617">Tsoukas, 2005</xref>: 124). The problem with this in a world of fast flowing, streaming events that are atypical in terms of the past, such as terrorist and counter-terrorist acts, is that organization of this form is a handicap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711425617">Turner and Pidgeon, 1997</xref>). If events can be spotted earlier rather than later in the process of becoming, the action plans laid to deal with them may be of a different order. Imagination is not a gift usually associated with most organizations, yet the 9/11 Commission Report notes ‘it is crucial to find ways of routinizing even bureaucratizing the exercise of imagination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711425617">1997</xref>: 334). Bureaucratizing imagination, which at first glimpse may appear to be an oxymoron, in fact exemplifies the concept of simplexity.</p>
<p>Organizing has to do with the processes by which people make sense of their world, by reducing equivocality, and thus makes better sense than organization in equivocal worlds. That is, in an effort to tame the ‘wild profusion of things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711425617">Foucault, 1977</xref>) and to introduce a workable level of certainty, people make informed bets as to what they think is going on. Sometimes we answer this question mainly by thinking about or reading situations with the idea that with increasing cognitive complexity, we get richer and deeper meanings as to what is happening. This is important in an increasingly complex and random world and lies at the heart of Weick’s notion of requisite variety, summed up by his proposition that if you want to preserve your ability to adapt to change all you need to do is to ‘complicate yourself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711425617">1979</xref>: 261). However, this view downplays the fact that at other times we make sense mainly by acting first. That is, we wade into situations and enact environments (not enthink) and then make sense of information we had a large hand in creating. That is, we act our way into meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711425617">Bruner, 1990</xref>) by keeping it simple. Thus, sometimes we make sense mainly by thinking and complicating our beliefs (also beloved of academics), while at other times mainly by taking simple action (beloved of practitioners). But this is not an either/or question, but a both/and issue. There is always an element of thought and action in the organizing and sensemaking that is the basis of the term simplexity: the synthesis of complexity of thought and simplicity of action, in which the balance shifts depending on time and circumstance.</p>
<p>Organizing makes better sense of the times than organization because it captures its processual, temporal dimension through its use of adverbs and gerunds as opposed to understanding the organization as noun, and can be further refined through the notion of simplexity. Our proposal is that when the flux is in flux, organizing and sensemaking should be more weighted to the action wing of the dialectic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711425617">Tsoukas’ (2005)</xref> argument for organization is that initial experiences are hollowed out through generalization and abstraction – that is, initial percepts are turned into concepts, which facilitates the sharing of meanings in the interests of coordination and control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711425617">Weick (2004)</xref> quotes Baron and Misovich (1999) as saying that sensemaking starts with knowledge by acquaintance that is acquired through active exploration. However, as complexity increases, there is a shift from perceptually-based knowing to categorically-based knowing – organization and permanence. This generates conceptual frames of previously organized experience that tend to remain blind to granularity of subtle difference within the cues of current experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick (2012)</xref> himself notes this tension between concepts and percepts, echoing Kant’s observation that ‘perception without conception is blind. But concepts, abstractions and schemas without perception are empty’, thus we need ‘observing that is more mindful, concepts that are more refined and constraints on sharing that are less tight’.</p>
<p>This chimes with the times and, not unconnectedly, with the rise of a process perspective in organization studies. The process turn is symptomized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711425617">Tsoukas and Chia (2002</xref>: 568) who, in contrast to more traditional perspectives, argue that change rather than stability is the norm. If we change the ontological priorities from stability to change, this shift sensitizes us to how pervasive change is and allows us to see that change is potentially there if only we choose to look for it. This way, organizations are said to be in a dynamic ongoing process of becoming.</p>
<p>An emphasis on this process-oriented perspective is consistent with simplexity because it puts a premium on attending to the potential novelty and changeful nature of action. This extends to an appreciation that frames based on past experience may not serve to reduce current equivocality. Such a reduction, and a more plausible answer as to what the story is, may lie more with action and thus with percepts rather than concepts, and with cues rather than frames.</p>
<p>This shift in balance point is not so stark as to amount to a swapping of ontological assumptions as called for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711425617">Tsoukas and Chia (2002)</xref>. However, simplexity does allow us to encompass an appreciation of becoming and continuous change along with individual resting points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick, 2012</xref>) where retrospective sensemaking takes place and meaning is inscribed. Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711425617">James (1957 [1890]</xref>: 243) has it (in discussing the stream of consciousness), like a bird’s alternation of flights (becomings) and perchings (sensemaking).</p>
<p>Weick goes on to note that while organizational becoming is a recurrent perspective, becoming is actually plural and that each may unfold at different speeds with faster becomings providing frames within which slower becomings gain their meaning. Again this is compatible with simplexity suggesting that the story of the times is the speed with which cues become frames, and how this alters the subsequent meaning attached to other cues. Of importance here is not just the becoming of frames but the going of previous frames operating as dominant stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711425617">Colville, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Dominant stories</title>
<p>In our role as guest editors, we are effectively sensemakers of others’ sensemaking, and indeed, as researchers have spent many years doing just that in our endeavours to develop theorizing about organizing and managing. If we apply reflexively the sensemaking and organizing perspective to the generation of theory, then the field is subject to dominant stories as to what passes for a theoretical contribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">Corley and Gioia (2011)</xref> offer a critique of the dominant story, why it is a professionally self-defeating story and how it can be changed. Appropriately enough, this major reappraisal appears in <italic>Academy of Management Review</italic>, generally regarded as a bastion of orthodoxy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">Corley and Gioia’s (2011)</xref> critique has its origins in burgeoning debates regarding not only the hegemony of what is deemed to be a theoretical contribution but also what this ignores (practice), and is increasingly irrelevant beyond its own tightly-drawn boundaries. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711425617">Humphreys and Brown’s (2002)</xref> terms, the more this story fixes the meaning of concepts, and circumscribes sensemaking, the less well it plays outside the confines of the academy. If, as Van Maanen argues, the purpose of theory is to communicate understandings and to persuade readers – the more the better – that not only do we have something to say but also that what we have to say is correct, important and well-worth hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711425617">2005</xref>: 134), then theory is not fulfilling its purpose. Certainly business schools did not have a good ‘economic crisis’, according to the Director General of the Confederation of British Industry (Sir Richard Lambert), while North American-based academics put it more directly: ‘the failure of business school research to either anticipate or deeply understand some of the most fundamental challenges of our times threatens the legitimacy of our enterprise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711425617">Polzner et al., 2009</xref>, quoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">Corley and Gioia, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Retold in terms of simplexity, the critique is that theory has been biased towards concepts rather than percepts in deciding what makes a theoretical contribution, and the dominating story also reduces the requisite variety of the concepts employed by which we try to make sense of the times. That is, the frames in terms of which current cues are made meaningful are themselves tightly drawn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711425617">Czarniawska (2008</xref>: 38) understands frames as categories of plots with dominant stories, and points out that within a genre the range of plots is restricted. She asks plaintively if there is any hope for organization theory if it cannot change itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711425617">2008</xref>: 131). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">Corley and Gioia (2011)</xref> argue that such change and emancipation from the current dominating story of a contribution to theory lies in embracing action through a practice approach that has its scholarly roots in the American tradition of pragmatism, such as that articulated by James and Dewey.</p>
<p>Having acknowledged the dynamic interplay between concepts and percepts, frames and cues, stories and plots, Corley and Gioia spell out how this provides a basis for not only reaching a wider audience but also to influence how that audience will make sense – something they term prescience: ‘theoretical prescience can be defined as the process of discerning what we need to know and influencing the intellectual framing of what we need to know to enlighten both academic and reflective practitioner domains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">2011</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Central to prescience is sensemaking, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711425617">Corley and Gioia (2011)</xref> use not so much as a topic of academic debate but as a resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711425617">Colville et al., 1999</xref>) for understanding and providing a new research agenda for organization theory. Academics are encouraged to become not only early sensemakers but also sensegivers. Early sensemaking – or prospective sensemaking – encourages scholars to attend to cues in the present that may become consequential issues or problems, to see the coming wave, but also through sensegiving to shape the framing of those issues.</p>
<p>Simplexity thus provides a compact way of understanding the premises for a reappraisal of what constitutes a theoretical contribution. In addition, because it is derived from an understanding of organizing and sensemaking, it is compatible with a research agenda, based on prescience. Put differently, in speaking to the links between sensemaking, organizing and storytelling, the papers that comprise this Special Issue speak also to wider debates concerning the future direction of organization studies.</p>

<title>Towards generative simplexity</title>
<p>The Call for Papers for this Special Issue asked for work that addressed the connections between sensemaking, organizing and storytelling and it elicited the second largest number of submissions ever for a special issue of <italic>Human Relations</italic>. This, together with the range and variety of the articles published here, confirms our view that there is a level of interest and fecundity in the connecting of sensemaking, organizing and storytelling that is generative. This provides encouraging support for our proposition that there is more to sensemaking and organizing than Weick, but we maintain that it would not make much sense without him, in terms of organization theory. As such, we were pleased to work with authors on developing their ideas, and it is gratifying to have Weick’s commentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick, 2012</xref>) on the articles that finally comprise the Special Issue. His commentary is also of value to us as editors to the extent that he provides an interpretation of what the Call for Papers was drawing attention to and how these authors have responded.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick (2012)</xref> observes astutely that the Call sought to direct attention to action, for the purpose of articulating the inherent yet underdeveloped linkages among sensemaking, organizing and storytelling. We felt this would be generative for developing our knowledge and understanding of action that lies at the heart of organization and management studies. To this we add the notion of simplexity as a means of articulating, both in the sense of speaking about the ideas of sensemaking, organizing and storytelling, and in the sense of linking them together.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711425617">Weick (2012)</xref> provides a detailed overview of each contribution to this Special Issue using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711425617">Dewey’s (1902)</xref> framework for considering attention. Here, at the outset of the Special Issue, we offer a brief introduction to each with the Special Issue agenda in mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711425617">Näslund and Pemer’s (2012)</xref> work provides a stark warning that our sensemaking is circumscribed by the stories that we tell, and shows how in organizational settings dominant stories marginalize deviant storytellers and restrict people’s scope for action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711425617">Cunliffe and Coupland (2012)</xref> show how sensemaking and organizing occurs not in the abstract but is embodied, and how felt experiences and associated emotions and sensory knowing are integral to it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711425617">Maclean, Harvey and Chia’s (2012)</xref> analysis points out, inter alia, that sensemaking stories of the self serve a social and a political function, and are tied intimately to impression management and self-legitimation, with significant organizational implications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711425617">Whittle and Mueller (2012)</xref> remind us that sensemaking stories do not inhabit a moral vacuum, that not all stories are created equal, and that some structure action more effectively than others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711425617">Humphreys, Ucbasaran and Lockett (2012)</xref> illustrate that sensemaking stories are also often sensegiving devices associated with the exercise of leadership and key to the orchestration (organizing) of fields and institutions.</p>
<p>Collectively these articles expose, examine and comment upon the complex interconnections between processes of sensemaking, storytelling and organizing. In addition, they also provide vivid insights on simplexity in practice as well as fulfilling our Special Issue aim to ‘explore theoretically and exploit practically these inherent yet underdeveloped linkages between sensemaking, organizing and storytelling to further their individual and joint understandings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711425617">Colville et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In addressing connections between sensemaking, organizing and storytelling, this Special Issue has attempted to see more clearly the generative power that might lie in such combinations. This has involved discerning a richness in the range of possible linkages, from understanding the difficulty of organization change in the context of dominant stories to a world where there is increasing dissonance between present cues and past frames. Authoring sensemaking stories becomes fraught and equi-vocal through being pluri-vocal.</p>
<p>‘Simplexity’ is a means of making sense of, and organizing these connections, while also providing a storyline to explicate them. We have argued that, reflexively deployed, this concept can be used as a means of seeing organizational theory more clearly and, as a consequence, how it might be changed. This also encourages a shift in the balance between concepts and percepts to focus on action more clearly while encouraging a pluri-vocality in the frames or stories that act as recipes for interpretation and guides to action.</p>
<p>This Special Issue has sought to enlarge the ways in which we make sense of and organize experience by endowing it with meaning. This is the province of the storyteller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711425617">Bruner, 1986</xref>: 12) and as such, storytelling is linked to sensemaking and organizing. The five articles, together with this editorial and Weick’s commentary have sought to articulate some of those linkages so that we can see more and in a variety of ways. To this, we have added the notion of simplexity in our endeavour to provide a story of our times, which highlights requisite complexity of thought combined with simplicity of action. We have also drawn attention to context and action, on-going process and pluri-vocality.</p>
<p>We began with a story about dynamic complexity, reflecting the times in which people and organizations ‘find’ themselves in the past, present and future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711425617">Langer, 1989</xref>) in both thought and deed. This Special Issue has been undertaken, not in the expectation that we can be sure of meaning, because as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711425617">Henry James (2011 [1894])</xref>, appropriately enough, a storyteller and brother of William James, put it, ‘Experience is never limited and it is never complete; it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider-web of the finest silken threads suspended in the chamber of consciousness, and catching every air-borne particle in its tissue’. This Special Issue has attended to making sense of that sensibility, to organize it and tell stories about it. Such an endeavour is never complete but it allows us to see more and to see sense(making) more clearly.</p>
