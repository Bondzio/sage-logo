<abstract>
<p>Investigation into the impact of the stages of a radio call on host–caller interaction has traditionally been conducted in single host scenarios, whereby one host interacts with one caller. Further, this analysis has often been done in the context of talk radio that is designed to promote a sense of conflict in order to entertain its audience. However, what of dual or multi-host scenarios, where a number of hosts are co-participants when interacting with callers? This article considers a talkback segment within a chat-based program in which two studio-based hosts are involved in conversation with callers. It considers previous research into call sequence as applied to this scenario and reveals that rather than working to challenge the caller, the hosts work together to enable the callers to challenge the hosts but in a way that orients to sociability rather than conflict.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As someone based in regional Australia, which can be by way of its geographic nature very isolated, I have devoted my research career to examining the ways in which locally based radio hosts foster a sense of community with their listeners. I have been particularly interested in chat-based radio programs, which have risen enormously in popularity in this country and now dominate the commercial FM band during breakfast and drive programming slots. These programs often have a breakfast team or ‘crew’ who take on the roles as hosts. Metropolitan-based programs in Australia tend to have triple-handed teams (three hosts, usually two male and one female) and regional stations tend to have double-handed teams (usually one male and one female, with some deviation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613480584">Ames, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The co-presence of a host adds a dimension to breakfast program talk that has been unexplored in traditional talk radio or broadcasting scenarios from a conversation and membership category analysis perspective. It appeared to me while doing my doctoral study into radio talk that arguments and discussions about the way radio hosts interacted with the listeners in talkback radio did not appear to apply to what I was hearing. This was despite the fact that callers and hosts were clearly engaging in a talkback segment around a topic that could be considered issues-based. Rather than the confrontational ‘shock-jock’ approach, hosts within this chat-based programming format appeared to work collaboratively with callers when engaging in discussion that had the potential for conflict, reflecting more of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445613480584">Andrew Tolson (2006)</xref> refers to as sociable argument than confrontational talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480584">1996b</xref>). It was also evident that there had been (and remains) limited analysis of talk in which more than one host was a co-participant.</p>
<p>The ‘stages’ of a call between hosts and callers has been considered in analysis of radio talk, with conversation analysis (CA) and membership category analysis (MCA) being the primary methods used to analyse the impact of sequence and orientation to role on host–caller interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480584">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445613480584">Tolson, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445613480584">2006</xref>). Examining the stages of a call became the starting point in my study in considering how sequential management of talk might demonstrate local social order within the context of the <italic>radio program</italic>, and the way in which callers and hosts oriented to roles and categories in a multi-host scenario.</p>
<p>This article will first consider findings from stages of calls during radio talk generally, and will then focus on one specific talkback segment within a chat-based radio program to illustrate the way in which call openings, validations and closings take place when more than one host is involved in talk with a caller. It will consider previously established arguments about the construction of talk in ‘talkback’ against these interactions as talkback segments within chat-based programming. It will specifically analyse host–host talk that precedes host–caller interaction (cotext), introductions, call-validations and call closings as stages in a talkback segment.</p>

<title>Corpus</title>
<p>The interactions considered in this article are a subset of a much larger body of data, compiled from 80 hours worth of recordings conducted over a four week period, focusing entirely on chat-based breakfast programs between 7.30 and 9.00 a.m. Two radio stations were the subject of analysis, both of which were located in the region of Central Queensland, Australia. Both stations had two hosts and were very locally focused. In addition to the traditional light-hearted topics often heard on this format of radio, hosts also opened up discussion to callers through talkback segments on more serious local matters. Talk between hosts and callers on specific topics was analysed using conversation and membership category analysis. Upon analysis of host–caller interaction within this context, it became clear that the dual-host involvement in conversations with callers, and the chat-based focus of the program (even when talking to callers about their opinion), provided for some deviation from that which has been established about radio talk. The analysis in this article refers specifically to interactions with two callers on one station, although it needs to be noted that this type of talk was reflective of the broader findings more generally, particularly in relation to the particular station on which this interaction occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613480584">Ames, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Stages of talk: Defining features of host–host and host–caller talk</title>
<p>Previous research into radio talk has highlighted the importance of considering sequences of the call to interaction between hosts and callers in radio talk. The four distinct stages of interaction are the introduction, the news production or call-validation phase (or reason for the call), the ‘interrogation’ and the close of call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>). Within these stages, we can see evidence of call openings, greetings sequences, question sequences, formulations and follow-up questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001b</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific analysis of introductions has been of significant interest when discussing the host–caller relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480584">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445613480584">Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">2001b</xref>), in some cases building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445613480584">Schegloff’s (1968)</xref> initial discussions of introductions in telephone calls. Introductions are important because the way in which hosts introduce callers and the immediate sequential interaction between caller and host has previously been identified as being important to establishing a sense of community within a program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2007</xref>). Introductions also serve to reinforce the institutional roles of ‘host’ and ‘caller’, and serve to provide an orientation to participants and an ‘economic turnover of callers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>: 182). In talkback radio, the host is also a talk ‘manager’ who introduces the caller into the participatory frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001b</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1991)</xref> refers to the host’s role as a ‘news-elicitor’, with callers being ‘news producers’ who may launch into direct and unprompted discussion about the reason for calling. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1991</xref>: 121), this may indicate awareness by the caller of the ‘institutional realities’ of the interaction. In this genre, hosts already have a known presence and developed persona that has become lodged ‘in the everyday practical routines of their audience members’; the caller, on the other hand, appears randomly and initially as only name and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>: 122). Further to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald (1999)</xref> details clearly how hosts introduce callers in a way that identifies ‘call relevant identities’ which serve to establish an identity of a caller that is not topic oriented; rather, it is a type of identification produced regardless of the topic of the show.</p>
<p>Most analyses of talk in this context is based on traditional talkback which involves a caller and a host, based around a topic, and the entertainment value of the program is reliant on differences of opinion between a host and caller on that topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">2001b</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald (1999)</xref> refers to an omnirelevant category device being ‘parties to a debate’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1996a)</xref> devoted a book to the ‘confrontation talk’ that he attributed to talk radio. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1996a)</xref> refers to introductions as ‘taking up positions’, and this view is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald (1999)</xref> who refers to the desire for hosts to be counter-aligned with their callers on topical issues.</p>
<p>The call-validation stage of the call commences immediately after the introductory sequence and provides the reason for the call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>). Here, the onus is on the caller to <italic>produce the news</italic>. Hutchby argued that hosts and callers normally orient to the institutional requirement that the call-validation stage is ‘the <italic>necessary</italic> and <italic>autonomous</italic> work of the caller alone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>: 121), but that there are two occasions on which this may be breached. The first is whereby an ‘affiliative opening’ is attempted by the caller, which attempts to engage in an interpersonal conversation with the host rather than providing the reason for the call, and the second is a ‘collapsed opening’, whereby the caller fails to move immediately into the call-validation stage of the call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>). In both cases, the host is required to intervene to either re-orient the caller to the topic at hand or request ‘missing’ information. Thus, we would expect a caller, once introduced, to then proffer his or her opinion on a talkback topic.</p>
<p>The call-validation stage is then followed by an interrogative stage, whereby the host can request clarification from the caller, or challenge the caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>). This stage features longer sequences, formulations, and possible shifts in footing and topic as hosts and callers attempt to make sense of talk. If and how this happens are subject to analysis when considering the stages of a call later in this article.</p>
<p>The final stage of talk-in-interaction in this format is the call closure. Closures don’t just happen; rather, conversations are brought to an end, but they are notable and worth specific examination because closings are much more diverse in terms of how they happen than introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445613480584">Schegloff and Sacks, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001b</xref>). Closings on talkback radio are different from those seen in mundane talk because they emphasize the institutional nature of broadcast talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>… it is, therefore, in the routinely self-explicating work of the <italic>closing</italic> of conversations on talk radio that the operation of the broadcast as a <italic>bureaucratic phenomenon</italic>, and of the host as <italic>the organizing agent at the interface of the ‘public’ and the ‘private’ in talk radio talk itself</italic>, is at its most immediately visible. (p. 134)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Closings are not negotiated between the host and caller; rather, the host acts as a processing agent to remove callers from air. Closings are designed to prevent callers bringing up other things to say, and therefore preventing the call moving forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1991)</xref> identified four types of closings: summary formulation, selective summarization, simple acknowledgement and explicit dissention. It appears, however, that there is also another – ‘disappearance’ by the caller, whereby there is no closing sequence at all (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow, 2001b</xref>).</p>
<p>The following analysis aims to illustrate the stages of a call in relation to a particular topic. It focuses on the way in which a topic is introduced to callers <italic>prior</italic> to callers being introduced to the overhearing audience. This cotext (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445613480584">Korolija, 1998</xref>) is important to considering if and how moral order in particular is established as a pre-requisite for calls because it is a <italic>contextual</italic> resource. Not all features of previous conversations become cotext; cotext is recycled in segments or units and is actively deployed by ‘actors’ in a conversation who strive for ‘shared understanding’ and establishing common ground (Koroloija, 1998: 100). The analysis then considers the call-validation stages, whereby the callers introduce themselves, followed by the interrogative stage, and call closings in relation to a topic.</p>

<title>The topic ‘What a difference 100 kilometres makes’</title>
<p>The topic ‘What a difference 100 kilometres makes’ invited callers to provide their opinion on the differences in crime rates between two regional cities in Australia. This topic was generated as a result of coverage by a local newspaper that suggested that the city in which it was published (referred to here as Cityone) was a much safer place to live than the other (Citytwo). The two cities are quite close in Australian terms (around 100 kilometres apart) and are quite fiercely competitive. One is an industrial city whereas the others is agriculturally and service based.</p>
<p>Only two callers responded to the topic: first, a caller named Tony, then another named Brent. The hosts are two males, referred to here as H1 and H2.</p>
<sec id="section5-1461445613480584">
<title>Cotext: Introducing the topic</title>
<p>The duologue below between H1 and H2 is lengthy cotext that precedes the host–caller interaction. There was no previous talk on this topic between hosts on that morning’s program, and the interaction here immediately precedes host–caller talk, although there had been a number of related topics highlighting differences between the cities discussed in the preceding week. There are a number of significant features of this discussion that are worth examination:</p>

<p>This cotext serves as the introduction to the calls. An orientation to the personal is a feature of chat-based programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613480584">Ames, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445613480584">Tolson, 2006</xref>), and while this topic is about the difference between crime rates in two cities (a public social issue), presentation of the topic prioritizes personal experience at the same time as calling for opinion. Indeed, the opinion called for is directly related to personal knowledge, when H2 asks listeners who feel indecisive about the area to call in about whether the crime ‘worries you’ (line 72). On a number of occasions one of the hosts (H1) establishes his personal position in relation to the topic, saying he has ‘never run into great dramas’ himself and ‘always enjoyed living in the area and .hh (.) have no issue’ (lines 60–62), as well as saying that he has ‘lived here a long long ↑time but it just se::ems to be getting worse and wo<underline>:</underline>rse’ (lines 30–31). He firmly establishes that he is not one of these people by asking on a number of occasions ‘who are these people/where are they coming from?’ (lines 33–34, 47–48). These comments are significant because they work to help define who or what it is to be local in the context of this particular station.</p>
<p>Rather than making the case for a disputable position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996b</xref>), there is quite a lot of doubt raised by hosts that serves to soften the possibility of conflict. The hosts do collectively work to establish a position, but whether it is disputable or not is questionable. That they work collectively is itself a point of interest. Each conversational turn builds on that which was previous generally, ultimately building a collective story or picture. There are only two occasions on which one host poses a challenge to a statement made by the other, evident in lines 24–34. In the first instance, H1 responds to H2’s question/statement about living in Citytwo by providing a justification – ‘I guess the population’s larger in Citytwo’ (line 29) – but then returns to the collective position, which is that crime is getting worse in the city. The use of the word ‘guess’ indicates some doubt, as does the word ‘seem’ (line 30). The second point of challenge occurs a little later in the transaction (lines 58–65). H1’s ‘According to the stats I know’ (line 60) also provides some challenge to H2 who has based his argument to this point on statistical data. In both of these samples, H1 justifies his challenge through a warrant based on personal experience. Thus, the collective position is that Citytwo is probably a more dangerous place to live, but some doubt about this is raised based on H1’s personal experience.</p>
<p>The gap in the collective disputable position acts as an invitation for listeners to pose a different point of view, and does in fact work to reinforce the role of hosts as being initially impartial to a debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1991</xref>). It is interesting to note the role of what I call the ‘deviant host’. This is the host who challenges the collective position, if only momentarily. For example, H1 becomes the ‘deviant host’ when he attempts to make light of the topic, only to be rebutted by H2 (lines 60–67). This is potentially a trouble point, whereby H1’s attempt at ironic humour in line 64, indicated by his own laughter (line 65), is thwarted when H2 starts to laugh, but immediately returns to a serious tone and counter-statement: ‘Kind of hard to back that ↑up at the moment’ (line 66). H1 then immediately responds by returning to the collective position in line 67 to support and in fact continue H2’s story.</p>
<p>This interaction thus demonstrates how hosts take a collective position on a topic, but at the same time allows for some doubt to be established within that position <italic>prior to requesting calls from listeners</italic>. The ‘deviant host’ establishes the possibility for an alternative view by a potential caller, illustrated by the attempt by one host to lighten the topic with humour only to be rejected by another, influencing the ‘deviant’ host to return to the collective position. This approach would potentially allow callers to take a position that would align with at least one of the hosts’ stated positions, and therefore ultimately be consistent with a collective view. The interaction also demonstrates that personal experience (‘warranting’) can play an important role in host–host conversation that precedes host–caller interaction to establish the entitlement to speak.</p>

<sec id="section6-1461445613480584">
<title>Introducing the calls</title>
<p>There was evidence that hosts on this station oriented to concurring with or affirming the listener’s view as a priority in the interactions on this topic. That this topic is also an ‘issue’ is made evident through the use of the word ‘the’ in line 26: ‘the newspaper’s reporting of all this crime’. This use of the prefix ‘the’ serves to invoke shared knowledge between speaker and recipients (Clark and Haviland, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996a</xref>), and introducing topics in this way (using ‘the’) ‘constructs them as given themes in the public domain, and the fact that something is recognizably in the public domain is a significant way in which it be constructed as an issue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996a</xref>: 43). There are three turns in the first introductory, or greeting, sequence between the hosts and the caller Brent: H1’s introduction of this particular caller, naming him as Brent and asking him to express his thoughts on the newspaper’s reporting; Brent’s opinion; and H1’s concurrence.</p>
<p>26 H1 Brent, what are <underline>your</underline> thoughts on the newspaper’s</p>
<p>27    reporting of all this crime?</p>
<p>28 Bre Look I think I think the Citytwo Paper (.) really I mean</p>
<p>29    I don’t have a vested interest in this I’m (.) I’m just you</p>
<p>30    know a reader of the paper but I just think it’s</p>
<p>31    appalling the way they portray Citytwo I mean (.)</p>
<p>32    a classic example of this was ah during Beef Week on</p>
<p>33    ↑Friday (.) when we had the town full of an extra</p>
<p>34    twenty odd thousand people and the Citytwo</p>
<p>35    Paper managed to pull up an article that was</p>
<p>36    two years old about someone getting bashed for his [shoes] (.)</p>
<p>37 H1      [Yeh]</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1991)</xref>, often the only evidence of a caller in an introductory sequence is their name and location. However, the hosts do not introduce Brent’s location – he orients to this himself in line 33, referring to ‘we’ with reference to the earlier mention of Citytwo (line 31). He identifies himself as ‘just you know a reader of the paper’ (lines 29–30), illustrating reference to a caller identification category. This three-turn sequence is marked with a concluding ‘Yeh’ from the co-present host H1. There is no counter-alignment evident at this introductory stage, and Brent has engaged in a ‘rhetorical argument’ in which a speaker engages in a multi-sentence monologue to make a ‘case for a disputable position’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 1996a</xref>: 44). The host, however, does not then challenge this ‘position’ at this early stage of interaction.</p>
<p>The second introductory extract involves a second caller responding to the same topic who does identify his location. This indicates that in both cases, the callers have oriented to the need to establish the location as the basis for justifying their future positions in the discussion. Again, in a three-turn greeting sequence, the host H2 responds with an affirmation (‘Yeah mate’, line 7):</p>
<p>5  H2   On 0422 1111 &gt;Tony what do ↑you reckon?&lt;</p>
<p>6  T  I’m from ah Cityone.</p>
<p>7  H2  Yeah mate.</p>
<p>Like the first extract, the use of ‘Yeah’ as affirmation also serves as encouragement for the caller to continue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445613480584">Heritage (1985)</xref> referred to cooperative formulations in interviews whereby a ‘recipient’ assists a speaker to make their point clear, or expands utterances so they are agreeable to the speaker. This type of formulation not only supports agreement, but can also often have the effect of terminating a sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445613480584">Mazeland and Ten Have, 1996</xref>). In the above cases, the ‘Yeah’ acts as an acknowledgement token to the speaker, and rather than the host initiating a new sequence as is common in other forms of institutional interview, the speaker initiates further talk on the topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1461445613480584">
<title>Call validation and interrogation</title>
<p>From these initial three-turn introductory sequences, the calls move to the call-validation and interrogation stages of the call. In the case of both programs, the orientation to affiliation is also evident, but it is also notable that hardly any questions are asked by the hosts during the interrogative stage in an effort to elicit or clarify the opinions of callers. Rather, the sequences demonstrate the hosts or callers offering opinions, in some cases as responses to acknowledge tokens:</p>
<p>8 T  I haven’t seen the paper yet I’m just on me way to work um (.)</p>
<p>9   I’m just a little disappointed if 10   that’s our newspaper if that’s what they’ve said because I sort of</p>
<p>11   believe that as neighbourly pair our cities should be helping each</p>
<p>12   other not bagging each other o<underline>u</underline>:t</p>
<p>13 H1   We:ll look for a long time there’s been a Citytwo vs Cityone</p>
<p>14   thing &gt;and I think it’s&lt; quietened <underline>down</underline> a lot over the last couple of</p>
<p>15   years because both cities use each other’s services ↑greatly (.)</p>
<p>16   and I think we work well together</p>
<p>17 T   Yeah↓ look my job entails I’m based in Cityone but I look</p>

<p>21 T   Umm (.) and yeah mate just sad to see that &gt;like fair enough a</p>

<p>31 H1   OK, so you’re prepared to take some of the uh people from the front</p>
<p>32   page of the Citytwo Paper and we’ll send them down to Cityone33   for a couple of weeks</p>
<p>((Laughter by all)</p>
<p>34 H2   Help relocate the thugs, yeah.</p>
<p>35 T   Yeah well we might have a ((undecipherable))</p>
<p>((Laughter by all))</p>
<p>36 H1  Good onya mate</p>
<p>37   Righto seeya</p>
<p>It is apparent that in the interaction with Tony, the hosts and caller work hard to ultimately cooperate with one another and the caller. The talk is full of qualifiers whereby an opinion is expressed but ‘softened’ in response to the previous statement in a relational pair. In validating his reason for the call, Tony makes his initial statement concerning being disappointed about the coverage, saying that he believes the two cities should be helping one another out (lines 8–12). H1’s immediate response (line 13) then signals the beginning of a potential interrogative sequence. Here, he asserts that there has been a ‘Citytwo vs Cityone thing’, but he then refocuses to say that he thinks the two cities work well together (lines 13–16), which is a statement of personal opinion and a subtle challenge to Tony’s assertion that the two cities are bagging each other out (line 12). Tony responds by justifying his position, indicating he is familiar with both cities, establishing his right to express his opinion as a witnessing act (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Witnessing is a term that refers to ‘a range of actions associated with making claims to personal knowledge, personal experience, direct perceptual access, or categorical membership in respect of an event or topic under discussion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 2001</xref>: 484). Witnessing is common in storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445613480584">Lerner, 1992</xref>), and there are a number of different techniques through which it can establish a claim to speak based on a sense of entitlement, including first-hand knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 2001</xref>), and this is evident as being relevant here. H1’s ‘Mmmm’ (line 20) is a response token that is taken as an invitation to continue, as Tony does in line 21. H2 then takes up the host role of challenging the listener, although it is not as much of a challenge as a statement of difference: ‘Yeh I don’t believe they’re necessarily trying to…’ (lines 23–24). Tony responds, again with a challenge after a longer pause: ‘(0.8) Yea::h but it would be also nice to:: maybe lend a helping hand’ (line 29). Tony then expresses self-doubt: ‘&gt;I don’t know&lt;’ (line 30), which appears to be a trouble point. It seems Tony is losing confidence in his argument – the words ‘I don’t know’ are almost mumbled. The host H1 steps in, and in winding up the call (lines 31–33) turns this trouble point into a point of humour with the cooperation of his co-host H2. That all co-participants in this conversation then laugh (after line 33) indicates shared acceptance of the humorous turn, and they all ‘get the joke’, allowing the call to transition to a close (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445613480584">Holt, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This cooperation between co-hosts can also be seen in the next extract, in which caller Brent takes a similar position to Tony:</p>
<p>38 Bre  For mine the front page of the paper that week</p>
<p>39   should have been nothing but what a great success beef week</p>
<p>40   was you know what a great area we live in I mean</p>
<p>41   we can’t sweep these real issues of crime under the carpet (.)=</p>
<p>42 H2  Yeh</p>
<p>43 Bre  =but fair dinkum I [mean</p>
<p>44 H1      [I guess] it’s a bit hard to balance too because</p>
<p>45   they’re trying to put news in a newspaper (.) and when the</p>
<p>46   majority of the news seems to be ne:gative stuff I guess</p>
<p>47 H2   What do you <underline>do</underline></p>
<p>48 Bre  Well the funny thing is (.) I mean our friends</p>
<p>49   frequently talk about this and we love Citytwo (.) I’ve</p>
<p>50   only been here four years we’ve lived in Cityfour we’ve</p>
<p>51   lived in Cityfive (.) yeah and sure the crime’s bad here</p>
<p>52   maybe it’s because we’ve got a prison up the road and</p>
<p>53   people settle here I don’t know what it is (0.5) but the reality</p>
<p>54   is I don’t think it’s anything (.) any worse I don’t feel any</p>
<p>55   less safe here than I do elsewhere (.) but the reality is</p>
<p>56   I think the Citytwo Paper just needs to (.) report the positive</p>
<p>57   things as well &gt;I mean&lt; 99 per cent of people that live in</p>
<p>58   this town are <underline>very</underline> very good people but the one per cent</p>
<p>59   who commit most of the crimes are getting probably 80 per cent</p>
<p>60   of the coverage in the ↑paper I mean there’s a lot of good</p>
<p>61   people doing a lot of good things [and the Citytwo Paper</p>
<p>62 H1      [Well said]</p>
<p>63 H2  just seems to ignore them OK (.) thanks mate</p>
<p>64 H1  Goodonya mate and we <underline>love</underline> to have you here.</p>
<p>After the initial introduction, Brent states that he felt the coverage during Beef Week (a significant local event in Citytwo) should have been positive (lines 38–41). In this, Brent justifies his position, to which H2 provides an affirming ‘Yeh’ (line 42). H1 provides a challenge to Brent by presenting the view on behalf of the newspaper: ‘I guess it’s a bit hard to balance…’ (line 44). This is followed immediately by H2, making a statement/question ‘What do you <underline>do</underline>’. In this sequence (lines 44–47), the hosts work collaboratively to counter Brent’s statement, but Brent does not take this as disagreement. Rather, he takes H2’s ‘What do you <underline>do</underline>’ as an invitation to continue, which he does in line 48. All three come to a cooperative ending when Brent concludes by saying ‘there’s a lot of good people doing a lot of good things’ (lines 60–61), to which H1 responds ‘well said’ (line 62).</p>
<p>It is evident here that the interrogative stages of the call reveal a search for grounds of agreement, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445613480584">Hutchby (1991)</xref>. While the potential for dispute is evident, neither hosts nor callers take up the challenges posed, and the subtle way in which challenges are made indicates the orientation to agreement rather than conflict. These extracts indicate that despite apparent counter-positions taken on the topic between hosts and the caller, the speakers work to come to ultimate agreement and cooperation, which is the imperative of sociable argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445613480584">Tolson, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1461445613480584">
<title>Closing the calls</title>
<p>In closing the calls, orientation to collegiality is again evident, and demonstrates that callers understand affirmation as a closure point. On both occasions, the hosts closed their calls with simple ‘positive’ acknowledgements:</p>
<p>62  H1      [Well said]</p>
<p>63  Bre   just seems to ignore them OK (.) thanks mate</p>
<p>64  H1  Good onya mate and we <underline>love</underline> to have you here.</p>
<p>This is an example of a simple close. In this, it appears that Brent takes H1’s ‘Well said’ in line 62 as an invitation to close, which Brent then does by thanking the host. Brent’s ‘OK (.) thanks mate’ (line 63) is then accepted by H1 as an attempt to conclude the conversation. In this case, it is the caller who is directly initiating the closure, rather than the host, as is normally the case. H1’s reference to ‘good onya mate’ in this interaction could be seen as positive reinforcement to Brent that his opinion has been accepted as a valuable contribution. This is consistent with the approach to closure with the second caller, Tony. This is also an example of a simple acknowledgement, but in this case, involved humour:</p>
<p>35  T   Yeah well we might have a ((undecipherable))</p>
<p>((Laughter by all))</p>
<p>36  H1  Good onya mate</p>
<p>37  T   Righto seeya</p>
<p>This sequence is an example of humorous topic termination, which refers to the use of humour to conclude a conversation in ordinary speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445613480584">Holt, 2010</xref>). Here, the point whereby all participants laugh becomes the point of simple closure: H1’s ‘Good onya mate’ (line 36) is taken by Tony (line 37) as being the conclusion of the conversation. That both host and caller take this point as closure is consistent with the view that: ‘A turn comprising of laughter is essentially backward looking: it responds to the prior laughter or laugh invitation without adding further topical matters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445613480584">Holt, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445613480584">Holt (2010)</xref> argued that the strong association between shared laughter and closing initiations suggest that they make closing initiation a particularly relevant next action, and it is evident that this is the case here.</p>
<p>The topic ‘What a difference 100 kilometres makes’ also demonstrates, therefore, an orientation to collegiality by hosts and callers. Where there is potential for disagreement, the hosts work to bring the call to an affiliatory close, and they work collaboratively to achieve this.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1461445613480584" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These extracts provide evidence of the ways in which a particular combination of hosts on a chat-based program discuss topical issues with callers. These interactions were typical of talkback segments in this format on this station, in that they were specifically topical at a local level, and the topics were introduced by host–host duologue (or preface) that provided the opportunity to consider initial opinion on the topic from the hosts.</p>
<p>This analysis revealed no greetings sequences in the introductions; that is, all callers were introduced directly to the participatory frame by the hosts. This contrasts with previous analyses of introductions in multiparty talk such as that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445613480584">Thornborrow (2001b)</xref>, which identified the need for all speakers to contribute to a greeting sequence in which all participants are ‘brought into the frame and an initial channel link has been established between all participants’ (p. 124). This is possibly because the hosts were co-located within the same studio, and one host acted as the ‘lead host’ who conducted the introductions on behalf of the other host. The lead host remained consistent, with H2 introducing the callers, and subsequently working to elicit their views.</p>
<p>In the analysis of call structure, examining introductions, call-validations, interrogations and closures, a few interesting points emerge for further potential consideration. In contrast to the simple turn sequence that allows the host to take a position of counter-alignment to a caller’s position, this interaction indicated greater complexity than a simple debate position in which a caller is able to respond or engage with the ‘debate’ based on the knowledge of hosts’ opinions. The talk-in-interaction that occurred here appeared less adversarial and ‘dramatic’ than talk-in-interaction on more traditional talkback radio. There were limited questions posed by the hosts during the interrogative stage of the call; rather, the conversation unfolded as callers spoke in response to a host’s statement or acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Unlike ‘traditional’ talkback, the sequence of talk between host and caller did not appear to be quite as consistent as that proposed by some others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613480584">Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445613480584">Hutchby, 2006</xref>), primarily because the purpose of conversation didn’t appear to be as aggressively oriented toward defining a ‘stance’ or taking up a position. The hosts provided their opinion first, and the callers were able to then respond to express their opinion. In Fitzgerald’s view, the host inviting the caller to speak allows the host to ‘take a position of counter-alignment with the caller’s opinion’ (1999: 63), but in the case of this analysis, this didn’t appear to be necessarily the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1461445613480584" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, in this particular interaction the two studio-based hosts worked to establish the possibility of affirmation or collaboration with the views of their callers prior to eliciting opinion. They also worked collaboratively with their callers, providing their own opinion during the call-validation and interrogation stages of a call, and worked to reach a collaborative call conclusion. Upon closing, the hosts acknowledged their callers prior to transitioning to host–host talk or music. In these instances there appeared to be a tendency for compliance and affirmation between hosts and callers. This provides evidence of a different style of interaction between host and caller on a talkback segment within a chat-based programming format than that which is found in more traditional issue-based talk programs.</p>
