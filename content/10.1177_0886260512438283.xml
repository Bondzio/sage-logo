<abstract>
<p>A large, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Turkey in 2008. In this survey, which used the WHO (World Health Organization) study module on violence, information about lifetime and current violence (past 12 months) was obtained using weighted, stratified, and multistage cluster sampling. This article describes factors associated with physical or sexual violence experienced by ever-married women, aged 15 to 49, from their current or most recent husbands in the 12 months before the survey. Logistic regression analysis is used to describe the risk and protective factors from a considerable range of explanatory variables. The findings confirm that many factors are similar to the experiences of other countries. The physical or sexual violence experienced by ever-married women from their husbands was 15.1%. The violence experienced by women is significantly positively associated with early childhood abuse experiences of both women and their husbands; marriages decided by families or others; husband’s behaviors such as drunkenness, adultery, controlling women’s behavior, and preventing contact with women’s family and friends. The age of the women, their contribution to the household income, support from women’s families, women’s acceptance of male authority, and nonpartner violence experience as well as regional differentials also affect the risk of violence. No significant associations were found with the employment status of women and men or education difference. This study, as one of the largest surveys ever conducted on the issue of domestic violence using face-to-face interviews, demonstrated how the patriarchal family structure still affects women’s lives in Turkey. This is particularly significant, given Turkey’s setting between traditional and modern values.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Violence against women is a global problem that violates women’s human rights and adversely affects their health and well-being. Over the past three decades, the number of studies examining violence against women has increased dramatically as research into all forms of violence has slowly become a public health priority. Between 1999 and 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an initiative to collect comparable data on violence against women in 15 sites in 10 low-, medium-, and high-income countries. At about the same time, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) began collecting data on gender-based violence in a range of developing countries via newly introduced modules on domestic violence and female genital cutting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438283">Hindin, Kishor, &amp; Ansora, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512438283">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). This research revealed that violence by intimate partners is the most common form of violence against women globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438283">Garcia-Moreno, Jansen, Ellsberg, Heise, &amp; Watts, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438283">Heise, Ellsberg, &amp; Gotteomeller, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of domestic violence was first brought to the public agenda in Turkey by the feminist movement, with the “Stop Violence” campaign in March 1987. Since then, guesthouses run by the government and counseling centers and shelters run by feminist women’s groups have begun to offer support to women exposed to domestic violence. Moreover, “The Protection of Family Law” (No: 4320), aimed at combating domestic violence was passed in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438283">Directorate General on the Status of Women [DGSW], 2008</xref>). Despite these achievements, many forms of gender inequality remain entrenched in Turkey, and many abused women still do not receive the services or support that they need. Turkey, with a population of 73 million, encompasses significant regional differences in terms of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The West is the most industrialized and socially and economically advanced region of the country, with lifestyles similar to those citizens in Western nations, whereas the East is the least developed part of Turkey. A tension also exists between traditional and modern values, and women’s daily existence is still circumscribed by many traditional expectations and religious and customary practices. Arranged, consanguineous, and religious marriages are still common, and the custom of bride price grants families the right to intervene in a couple’s marital life. In a patriarchal society, these factors influence power relationships within the family.</p>
<p>This article focuses on women’s experiences of current physical or sexual violence from their present or most recent husband (hereafter described as “husband”) by using data from the Turkey National Research on Domestic Violence conducted in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438283">DGSW, 2009</xref>). In order to associate marital relationship and physical or sexual violence, only violence from husbands was taken into consideration in Turkey where marriage is widespread. The risk and protective factors for experiencing violence were determined for ever-married women aged 15 to 49 years.</p>
<sec id="section2-0886260512438283">
<title>Ecological Framework</title>
<p>Recently, the use of the ecological framework has become popular as a way to conceptualize the multilayered factors that contribute to the risks of experiencing intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438283">Ellsberg, Pena, Herrera, Liljestrand, &amp; Winkvist, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512438283">Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, &amp; Zwi, 2002</xref>). Researchers use the ecological framework as a tool to explain the relationship between individual and contextual factors as well as to highlight the multiple causes of violence and the interaction of risk factors operating within the family and a broader community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>). In this study, a version of the Heise’s ecological framework is adapted to the Turkish context. The first circle contains the personal history factors of the man and woman, including their childhood experiences of abuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512438283">Figure 1</xref>). The second circle covers the formation of marriage and marital relationships, including household factors and the current situation of the couple. The outer circle contains community-level factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512438283">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Personal abuse history</title>
<p>The “cycle of violence” hypothesis assumes a childhood history of abuse increases the likelihood of children experiencing or perpetrating violence in later years. Even though children respond in different ways to witnessing or experiencing violence in their homes, depending on the frequency and severity of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512438283">Little &amp; Kantor, 2002</xref>), these experiences increase their perception of violence as a normal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260512438283">Romito, Crisma, &amp; Saurel-Cubizolles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512438283">Romito, Saurel-Cubizolles, &amp; Crisma, 2001</xref>). Several studies have found that early childhood experiences of violence are risk factors for experiencing later partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438283">Ellsberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438283">Gelles, 1980</xref>; Hotaling &amp; Sugarman, 1986, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438283">Jewkes, Levin, &amp; Penn-Kekana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512438283">Kalmuss &amp; Straus, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512438283">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512438283">Rivera-Rivera et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512438283">Straus &amp; Gelles, 1986</xref>). Husbands’ experience of physical violence in childhood is also positively associated with perpetration of partner violence; for example, witnessing one’s mother being beaten is a stronger predictor of partner violence than being abused oneself as a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438283">Abrahams &amp; Jewkes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512438283">Naved &amp; Persson, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512438283">
<title>Formation of marriage</title>
<p>Age and education differences between couples and young age at marriage are associated with power dynamics in the family. For example, age difference may lead to an increased exposure to violence, since an older husband may be perceived as having increased authority. Marriage at an early age is also associated with the woman having less education, bearing children at an early age, and having a lower position in the household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260512438283">Singh &amp; Samara, 1996</xref>). Not surprisingly, women who marry at an early age are also more likely to experience domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438283">Jensen &amp; Thornton, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Several marriage traditions in Turkey may also affect the risk of partner violence in marital relationships. The traditional involvement of the husband’s family in the marital life of young couples is often a source of marital conflict. Studies from a wide range of settings, including Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438283">Agoff, Herrera, &amp; Castro,2007</xref>), Lebanon (El-Hadad &amp; Balian, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438283">Keenan, El-Hadad, &amp; Balian, 1998</xref>), Trinidad and Tobago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438283">Hadeed &amp; El-Bassel, 2006</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438283">Chan et al., 2008</xref>), and Jordan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438283">Clark, Silverman, Shahrouri, Everson-Rose, &amp; Groce, 2010</xref>), have documented that involvement by in-laws is a potent risk factor for marital conflict and intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>Marriage within kinship networks (consanguineous marriage) is likewise high in Turkey as it is in many other Asian countries. In Asia as a whole, between 20% and 50% of women marry within their extended family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438283">Bittles, 1994</xref>). Although consanguineous marriage appeared to provide protection from violence in a study from Jordan, Clarke and colleagues recommended further investigating this phenomenon in the Jordanian context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438283">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). As the authors point out, the interference of in-laws in the marital relationship is high in Jordan, especially in marriages with strong kin networks. In Turkey, elders also come into play via the <italic>berdel</italic> system—a marriage where two sisters are married into the same family. Traditionally, the <italic>berdel</italic> system was used as a way to avoid paying bride price and to strengthen ties between families.</p>

<title>Educational level</title>
<p>Completing secondary school has been found to be protective among women, reducing the likelihood of partner violence in a range of countries, including Uganda and Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438283">Koenig et al., 2003</xref>). Studies conducted in the Middle East and North Africa have yielded similar results (Boy &amp; Kulcyzki, 2008) as have previous studies in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438283">Altinay &amp; Arat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438283">Balci &amp; Ayranci, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438283">Kocacik, Kutlar, &amp; Erselcan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512438283">Mayda &amp; Akkus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512438283">Sahin &amp; Sahin, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512438283">
<title>Family-related factors</title>
<p>Partner violence has also been linked to a number of factors related to the family and family dynamics. For example, there is a strong association between violence and the isolation of a woman from her natal family and close friends (Elsberg et al., 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>; Neilson et al., cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438283">Jewkes, 2002</xref>). Studies likewise suggest that violence is more prevalent in families where the husband independently makes the majority of the important decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438283">Garcia-Moreno, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>). Egalitarian relationships appear to have the lowest rates of relationship conflict and partner violence, an observation affirmed in studies undertaken in Haiti, the Philippines, and South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438283">Gage, 2005</xref>; Kim &amp; Emerty, 2003)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260512438283">
<title>Household characteristic</title>
<p>The common assumption is that women who live in poor households experience more violence than those who live in wealthier households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438283">Hoffman, Demo, &amp; Edwards,1994</xref>), although the reality has proven more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260512438283">Vyas &amp; Watts, 2009</xref>). Economic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438283">Jewkes, 2002</xref>), insufficient household goods (Carlson, 1984, cited in Flake, 2002), and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438283">Elsberg et al., 1999</xref>) were found to be one of the main risk factors for domestic violence in South Africa, the United States, and Nicaragua, respectively. However, findings from other countries have varied. Among nine DHS countries, for example, there was no consistent relationship between risk of violence and the poverty/wealth status of the households in which a woman lives. In countries where there was a significant relationship (India, Egypt, Peru), women in the wealthiest quintile appeared to be protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512438283">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). Besides the economic conditions of the household, the relative contribution of the woman and man to household income has also been linked to the prevalence of partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438283">Hindin &amp; Adair, 2002</xref>; Mcloskey, Williams, &amp; Larsen, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512438283">Schuler, Hashemi, Riley, &amp; Akhter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260512438283">Vyas &amp; Watts, 2009</xref>). For example, partner’s contribution of income to the household was negatively associated with the risk of domestic violence for women in Tanzania (Mcloskey et al., 2005), whereas women in Bangladesh who contributed more than nominally to the household expenses were 1.8 times more likely to experience violence than those who contributed very little or none (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438283">Bates, Schuler, Islam, &amp; Islam,2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512438283">
<title>Current situation of couples</title>
<p>Some studies have indicated a positive relationship between women’s employment and domestic violence, and some others found either a negative relationship or no relationship at all (Kalmuss &amp; Straus, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260512438283">Vyas &amp; Watts, 2009</xref>). One study in rural South India found that women who had higher incomes than their partners experienced less domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512438283">Rao, 1997</xref>), whereas another study among young low-income women in Bangalore found they experienced more violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512438283">Krishnan et al., 2010</xref>). A recent prospective study found that women whose partners become unemployed between the first and second visits of the study had 1.7 times the odds of experiencing violence compared to women whose partner remained employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512438283">Krishnan et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512438283">Panda and Agarwal (2005)</xref> found that possession of land or property reduced the risk of violence from one’s husband. They suggest that ownership of property gives women more security because it offers protection against fluctuations in the labor market and communicates that she has options outside of marriage. They recommend improving women’s property rights as one strategy to reduce partner violence. Patriarchal family structures that perpetuate male dominance in the family and women’s attitudes toward male authority are also related to domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>). Dibble and Strauss’s study of family violence asserts that the attitudes and behaviors are related to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438283">Dibble &amp; Strauss, 1980</xref>). Many studies have found attitudes accepting male dominance or partner violence to be a risk factor for experiencing violence. In particular, the studies mentioned in Boy and Kulzcycki’s paper on intimate partner violence in the Middle East and North Africa emphasized attitudes of women and men (Boy &amp; Kulzcycki, 2008).</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol has been recognized as a risk factor for intimate partner violence in many studies (Fagan, 1993; Hotaling &amp; Sugarman, 1986, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438283">Heise, 1998</xref>). When the husband is unfaithful and also frequently comes home drunk, women are at increased risk of partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438283">Jewkes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512438283">Koenig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512438283">Rao, 1997</xref>). Alcohol use is seen as related to marital conflict and as a facilitator of violence, even though the degree to which alcohol is a causal factor in domestic violence is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438283">Gil-Gonzales, Vases-Cases, Dardet-Alvarez, &amp; Latour-Perez, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Violence from nonpartners, in particular from families (including both birth family and in-laws), was associated with increased domestic violence for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438283">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512438283">Raj, Livramento, Santana, Gupta, &amp; Silverman., 2006</xref>). It should be taken into consideration that the reporting of violence from family members increases reporting of partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438283">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). In one study, in-law conflict was found to be the strongest factor associated with increased violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438283">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). Obtaining support from family members was an important factor in reducing violence from intimate partners. Women who obtain a higher level of support from their families reported less intimate partner violence in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438283">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; Naved &amp; Persson, 2008).</p>

<sec id="section9-0886260512438283">
<title>Community factors</title>
<p>Communities affect the likelihood of violence by protecting or insulating women. A few studies have looked at community factors. Community variation was measured by region in Flake’s study in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438283">Flake, 2005</xref>), and community characteristics were found to be principally determined by the social environment of that community, its beliefs, and its cultural factors. Rural women were found to be at more risk in the Middle Eastern countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438283">Boy &amp; Kulczycki, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>This study is based on data collected as part of the National Research on Domestic Violence against Women in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512438283">Turkyilmaz, Ergocmen, Yuksel, Coskun, &amp; Adali, 2009</xref>). The quantitative component of the research included a cross-sectional, household survey administered face to face to a nationally representative sample of 24,048 households. The study interviewed 12,795 women aged 15 to 59 years, using a stratified, multistage cluster sampling scheme designed to be representative at the national, urban-rural, and regional level (5 regions and 12 regions). More detailed information about the sampling can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512438283">Turkyilmaz et al., 2009</xref>). After 2 weeks of training, 189 staff worked as interviewers, field editors, supervisors, and data entry staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260512438283">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>The survey included both household and individual respondent questionnaires. Women were asked about their educational and family background and also about their experiences of physical, sexual, emotional, or economic abuse from an intimate partner. In addition, the questionnaire collected information on sexual and physical violence from nonpartners, child sexual abuse, attitudes and norms on gender, violence during pregnancy, and coping strategies regarding violence. The response rates for household and individual interviews were 88% and 86.1%, respectively. The principles of the WHO ethical guidelines for domestic violence against women were strictly followed throughout the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260512438283">WHO, 2001</xref>). The survey used the innocuous title, “Turkey Women and Family Research,” to avoid alerting the wider community to the nature of the survey and to protect respondents and interviewers from possible harassment or violence. The sampling unit was households, and only one randomly selected woman was interviewed per household. The interviews were conducted in complete privacy after obtaining the respondent’s informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886260512438283">
<title>Outcome Variable: Physical or Sexual Violence by an Intimate Partner</title>
<p>The Turkish study adopted the same questions for measuring physical and sexual violence by an intimate partner as used in the WHO multicountry study. For physical violence, women were asked whether they had ever experienced any of seven specific acts perpetrated by an intimated partner, including having been slapped, pushed, or shoved; had something thrown at them that could hurt them; and punched, kicked, choked, or been threatened by or had a weapon used against them. For each act, they were asked how frequently it had happened within the past 12 months (<italic>once, a few times, many times</italic>) and how frequently they had experienced it prior to the past 12 months.</p>
<p>To measure sexual violence from an intimate partner, women were asked about acts of forced sexual intercourse, coerced sexual relationships, or forced participation in sexual acts that they found degrading or humiliating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438283">Garcia-Moreno et al., 2005</xref>). They likewise were asked about the frequency of sexual violence within the past year and prior to the past year. Our primary outcome variable, as a subgroup of the main sample, was ever-married women aged 15 to 49 who have experienced one or more acts of physical and/or sexual partner violence by a current or former husband in the 12 months prior to the survey. The reference category for this analysis is ever-married women who have never experienced husband violence or who have experienced husband violence prior to the past 12 months. In addition, women who had experienced other forms of violence may appear in the reference category.</p>
<sec id="section14-0886260512438283">
<title>Exposure variables</title>
<p>Among the explanatory variables, the construction of country-specific and newly derived variables is described; other categories can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438283">Table 1</xref>. The data on childhood sexual abuse of women were obtained by directly asking the women about experiences of childhood abuse and also by giving women an opportunity to disclose anonymously. At the end of the interview, women were given a second opportunity to disclose child sexual abuse by marking either a “crying” or a “smiling” face to indicate their abuse status. For the purposes of the study, women were counted as sexually abused in childhood, if they indicated through either method a history of abuse.</p>

<p>Age at marriage was measured as less than or greater than 17 years, since 17 is the minimum age of legal marriage for both women and men in Turkey. Age difference between spouses was considered “almost the same age” if the partners’ age difference was approximately an year. In the survey, women were asked about their experience of several different situations relating to their husband’s behavior. “Husband drunkenness” was coded as coming home drunk “rarely” (<italic>once a month or less</italic>) or “frequently” (<italic>once a week or more</italic>) in the 12 months before the survey. We also derived two new variables using factor analysis, one called “controlling her behavior” and a second called “preventing contact with family and friends.” The controlling behaviors of husbands included, to a large extent, the variables of “insisting on knowing where she is at all times; deciding what she wears; controlling when she may seek health care; getting angry when she speaks to another man, and suspecting her of infidelity.” The <italic>preventing contact with families and friends</italic> variable included the variables “try to keep her from her seeing her friends” and “try to restrict/prevent contact with her family of birth.”</p>
<p>The other variables formed by using the factor analysis technique were “acceptance of male authority” and “accepting traditional gender roles.” Acceptance of male authority means perceiving the following statements as acceptable: It is necessary to beat children for disciplinary purposes, it is right to beat women in some situations, a woman has an obligation to have sexual intercourse with her husband, a woman has an obligation to obey her husband, and a man is responsible for his wife’s behavior. The traditional gender roles variable was measured with the following questions: “Can a woman spend her money as she wishes?” and ‘Should men do housework?” These two variables were coded according to the number of accepted statements. To measure household socioeconomic position, we followed the practice outlined by Filmer and Pritchett for use in DHS surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438283">Filmer &amp; Pritchett, 2001</xref>), to derive a wealth index based on household assets and dwelling characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438283">DGSW, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Because of the many factors affecting women’s lives, we explored a large the number of potential explanatory variables. These variables were sorted into six groups, and the analysis was performed in three phases. In the first phase, we checked collinearity among the explanatory variables, and no collinearity was detected. Next, we calculated the crude associations between each exposure variable and husband’s current violence, adjusted for the woman’s age. Although some variables were not independently associated with current violence, we nonetheless included them in the multivariate analysis, since multivariate analysis may yield different results. Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed by using PASW (SPSS)-18. The complex sample design of the survey was considered, and a “complex samples” module was used to perform the regression analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438283">Table 1</xref> presents the odds ratios and confidence intervals, taking into account the clustered nature of the data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438283">Table 1</xref> summarizes the primary findings of the study. The first column provides a breakdown of the population by response category for each of the exposure variables. The second column shows the percentage breakdown among women who experienced violence in the past 12 months by their current or most recent husband. Following the percentages, the odds ratios and confidence intervals for both the crude and final models are given. The final model is significant (with <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is 29%.</p>
<p>Overall, 15% of ever-married women aged 15 to 49 experienced physical or sexual violence by their current or most recent husband in the past 12 months; 6.6% of women reported childhood sexual abuse (as revealed through either interview reports or the anonymous question technique using the childhood faces). Consistent with the findings from many other studies, we found that prior experience of sexual abuse in childhood significantly increased the odds that a woman would experience current physical or sexual violence by her husband (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.02-1.9). In the final model, the odds of current husband violence were also 1.76 times higher among women whose husband was physically abused during childhood.</p>
<p>Witnessing marital violence during childhood on the part of either the woman or her partner increased the odds of partner violence, and more than one fourth of the women and men were aware of their mothers being abused by their fathers. Women who witnessed their own mothers physically abused had 1.59 times the odds of current spouse abuse, and women whose husbands witnessed their mother physically abused in their childhood had 1.71 times the odds of being physically or sexually abused by their husbands in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>In the typical Turkish family, women have an educational level equal to or lower than their husband and most husbands are 2 or more years older than their wives. Both civil and religious marriages are common. In the crude analysis, all of the family formation variables were found significantly related to current partner violence when adjusted for the woman’s age. Being more educated than one’s husband actually protected women from violence in bivariate analysis, whereas the practices of bride price, abduction, and <italic>berdel</italic> increased women’s risk. In age-adjusted crude analysis, women were also at increased risk in marriages where there was only a religious (not a civil) ceremony, where the marriage was decided by family members, and where others lived with the couple at the beginning of a marriage. In the final multivariate model, however, only having one’s marriage decided by others remained a significant risk factor for current spouse abuse.</p>
<p>Partner-related factors such as infidelity, preventing her from seeing family and friends, and other controlling behaviors put women at increased risk of domestic violence in both crude and multivariate analysis. In the final model, women whose husbands were unfaithful had almost double the risk of violence (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.41-2.37). Moreover, a woman who reported experiencing three or more controlling behaviors was 2.15 times more likely to experience current husband violence, and a woman whose husband prevented her seeing her family and friends was 3.82 times more likely to be abused.</p>
<p>In the age-adjusted bivariate analysis, women from poorer households had 2.30 times greater odds of husband violence than did women from better-off households, but this difference disappeared in adjusted analysis. By contrast, women who had no income experienced high odds of partner violence in the final model (OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.17-5.51) as did women whose husbands contributed more to the household budget then they did (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.31-6.69).</p>
<p>Labor force participation and possession of land or house are uncommon among women in Turkey. Only 45.5% of the women reported that they could raise money to support themselves and their children for 4 weeks in case of emergency. Women’s ownership of property and their ability to raise money were not significantly associated with partner violence in the final model, although they were significant in bivariate analysis. About 70% of women reported that they could count on their family and friends for support when they require assistance, and an equal percentage have family members living nearby. Women without such support had 1.28 higher odds of experiencing current violence in the adjusted model.</p>
<p>High acceptance of male authority also increased women’s odds of partner violence in both bivariate and adjusted analysis. Less than 10% of women reported drunkenness by husbands in the past year, but those whose husbands came home drunk frequently or rarely were at substantially increased risk of violence (OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.96-4.26, for <italic>frequently</italic>; OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.67-4.05, <italic>for rarely</italic>). Husband’s employment status did not appear to affect risk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 13% of women experienced physical violence from their families, and 2.5% of women experienced sexual violence from nonpartners after the age of 15. Physical and sexual abuse from nonpartners was significantly associated with husband violence. Physical violence from her husband’s family increased a woman’s risk of violence from her husband 1.73 times in the final model. Similarly, women who experienced sexual abuse from others were at enhanced risk of abuse by their husbands.</p>
<p>Where women lived in Turkey also affected their overall risk of spouse abuse. Women who lived in the Eastern and Southern regions of Turkey had 1.99 and 1.63 times higher risk of current physical or sexual violence, compared to women who lived in the Western region. As commonly found in other studies, younger women aged 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 were likewise at increased risk of current husband violence compared to women in the 45 to 49 age group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to explore the factors that put women at increased risk of current physical or sexual husband violence as well as the factors that might be protective. In recent years, studies researching parental abuse as a predictor of violence have increased in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438283">Altinay &amp; Arat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438283">Haj-Yahia &amp; Uysal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512438283">Kocacik &amp; Dogan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438283">Kocacik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512438283">Ozcakir, Bayram, Ergin, Selimoğlu, &amp; Bilge, 2008</xref>). The present study confirms the finding of many earlier studies, that if either the woman or her current husband witnessed parental violence in childhood, the woman is at increased risk of current physical or sexual violence from her husband. Qualitative study results reveal that parental abuse may cause early marriage in order to escape from violence at home; at this stage, the couple do not know each other well, and this may lead to marital conflict and violence in the husband’s home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438283">Kardam &amp; Yuksel, 2009</xref>). Similarly, physical abuse of the husband during childhood was positively associated with his risk of perpetration in adulthood. Childhood sexual abuse of women may be underreported in the survey, since talking about sexuality and sexual abuse are sensitive topics in Turkey. All these findings indicate the importance of the early experiences of abuse in the etiology of violence in adult relationships. However, the reason why some men become perpetrators of violence while others do not, even though they experienced and witnessed abuse in childhood, requires further research as suggested in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438283">Altinay &amp; Arat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438283">Heise &amp; Garcia-Moreno, 2002</xref>). Longitudinal studies and further qualitative work may contribute to understanding these relationships.</p>
<p>Even though status inconsistency in educational level between a woman and her partner was not associated with current physical or sexual violence in the final model, the fact that women with more education than their husband had lower rates of violence in bivariate analysis suggests a potential role for education in empowering women and helping them to overcome violence. Employment, like education, can be a source of empowerment for women. The labor force participation in Turkey is around 23.5% for women and 69.1% for men in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260512438283">TURKSTAT, 2009</xref>). According to the findings of this study, women who did not have an income or those whose husbands earn more than them were at greater risk of violence, suggesting that economic dependence may play a role in elevating the risk of partner violence. Marriage is one of the most important socially encouraged institutions in Turkey, and arranged marriages still predominate. Even though the consent of woman is obtained in most of these marriages, women whose marriages were arranged by their family (with or without their consent), who had a <italic>berdel</italic> marriage (sisters marrying into the same family,) or who were abducted were more likely to experience violence than women who chose their husbands. It is possible that such arrangements influence the risk of violence by increasing marital conflict or by decreasing women’s autonomy, thus giving them lower status in the extended family system.</p>
<p>Of all the factors examined, it was the characteristics of the husband that were most strongly associated with women’s current risk of partner violence. Even though only civil marriages are legal in Turkey, some men have a civil marriage <italic>and</italic> several religious marriages. Religious wedding ceremonies socially legitimize a man’s affairs while he is still married to another. If a woman would behave similarly, however, she would risk being killed in the name of honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438283">Kardam, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Physical or sexual violence is widespread in the country, but most women do not disclose their abuse. If they do share their experience, they generally prefer to confide in family members even though they often do not receive support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438283">Ergocmen, Uner, Abbasoglu, &amp; Gökcen, 2009</xref>). Violence against women is still seen as a private family matter in Turkey even though it is publicly recognized by the state. This study underscores the importance of families in a couple’s life and highlights the significant role played by the patriarchal family in the experience of violence. Witnessing parental violence and experiencing violence before marriage, support from the natal family, and experiencing violence from the husband’s family are all positively associated with marital violence. These risks increase when women are young and living in less developed regions of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, to reduce violence against women, transformations in families and society should be considered. In addition, women’s status should be strengthened through education and greater participation in the labor force, since even though women and men have equal rights in law, this is not translated into the daily life of women. Women’s social conditions, as well as their economic independence, are important factors in breaking the silence of women against violence. In Turkey, the fact that support from the wife’s own family is protective and violence from her husband’s family is a risk factor highlights the contradictory role that families can play in marital violence.</p>
<p>Most studies to date principally rely on information from women who have experienced violence, which is a necessary first step to exposing the issue. However, there is a need to investigate and understand men’s attitudes and points of view toward violence; further research should, therefore, also focus on men. Longitudinal studies should be conducted to understand the dynamics of domestic violence and the temporal relationship between risk factors. In addition, regional differences within the country should be investigated and differences between developed and less developed regions should be further analyzed.</p>
<p>This study represents the largest population-based survey ever conducted on partner violence, but it has some significant limitations. The data of the study are cross-sectional; therefore, it is impossible to establish the temporal ordering of events. Moreover, information on the husband’s behavior was obtained from their female partners so there may be bias in the reporting. On the other hand, this is the first national representative study that investigates the risk and protective factors for current physical or sexual violence in Turkey, and it provides important data for further research.</p>
