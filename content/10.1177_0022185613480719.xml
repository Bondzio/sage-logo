<abstract>
<p>The year 2012 produced a high volume of developments in the industrial relations law sphere. The Review of the operation of the Fair Work legislation dominated the federal agenda and, accordingly, is the primary focus of this article. We detail key recommendations and outcomes of the Review, including associated amendments. Next, we consider other federal changes, which were expansive in focus. Federal reforms included: a new legislated employee entitlements scheme to replace the administrative General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme; new regulation of the road transport industry; an overhaul of workplace gender equality legislation; revised governance obligations for registered organisations; and the introduction of the ‘dad and partner pay’ scheme as part of the Commonwealth's parental leave package. Turning to the states and territories, we summarise public sector workplace law changes in both New South Wales and Queensland and address other notable developments across jurisdictions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185613480719" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>When the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) commenced operation in 2009, it was the first wholly new federal industrial relations Act introduced since the passage of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth). Three years later, the legislation is no longer brand new, and in 2012, it was the subject of a major review designed to assess the extent to which it has been operating as intended. This legislative review and the subsequent first tranche of amending legislation to implement around one-third of its recommendations are the primary subjects of this year's discussion of industrial legislation.</p>
<p>It has been a busy year in the Federal Parliament, with no fewer than 10 significant industrial relations related Acts passing into law. The discussion will briefly outline these Acts. With respect to the FW Act, amendments were made subsequent to the review discussed earlier, as well as the implementation of transfer of business protections for outsourced state public servants. There was also a raft of industry-level legislation, including: legislation for the road transport industry aimed at improving road safety outcomes; amendments to the FW Act to protect clothing, textile and footwear outworkers; and long-awaited changes to building and construction industry legislation. The laws pertaining to misconduct and disclosure obligations for registered organisations were tightened in the wake of the Health Services Union (HSU) scandal, and the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) was replaced by a new employee entitlement scheme. There were also developments with respect to family flexibility and gender equity, with the implementation of ‘dad and partner pay’ provisions for parental leave, improvements to the workplace gender equality laws, and the creation of a fund to assist employers coping with cost increases flowing from the Social and Community Services (SACS) pay equity determination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185613480719">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ongoing efforts to harmonise Australia's workplace health and safety regimes have been discussed in the past two review essays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Smith, 2011</xref>). In 2012, both Tasmania and South Australia implemented the model work health and safety legislation (albeit with significant variations in South Australia) (Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (Tas); Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (SA)). This brought the total number of ‘harmonised’ jurisdictions to seven on 1 January 2013. Legislation has not yet been introduced in Western Australia, and the Victorian government has indicated that it will not implement the model laws.</p>
<p>The discussion will begin by outlining the recommendations of the FW Act Review, before a brief discussion of the other major legislative developments of the year. This will be followed by a round-up of developments in the states.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0022185613480719"><title>The Fair Work Act</title>
<sec id="sec3-0022185613480719"><title>Fair Work Act Review</title>
<p>Fulfilling a Labor promise to undertake a comprehensive review of the FW Act within three years of its enactment, a three member panel was appointed on 20 December 2011, tasked with assessing the extent to which the effects of the FW Act been consistent with its objects and the extent to which the legislation is operating as intended. In particular, the panel was to consider how the operation of the FW legislation could be improved based upon evidence of its operation in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 19). The 294 page report, <italic>Towards More Productive and Equitable Workplaces: An Evaluation of the Fair Work Legislation</italic> (the Review) was delivered in June and contained 53 detailed recommendations. In assessing the FW legislation, the panel was guided by the principles of improving national prosperity, productivity and equity. The panel noted that productivity growth had been disappointing under both the FW Act and the preceding Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), but it was reluctant to blame the industrial relations framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 84). However, the panel did link productivity and flexibility, with a significant focus in the Review on mechanisms to minimise legislative constraints on flexibility that might ‘impede productivity enhancement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>Overall, the panel found that the effects of the FW Act have been broadly consistent with its objects and that it has been operating as intended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 18). The more significant recommendations will now be discussed under the headings of workplace agreement making, individual flexibility, industrial action, unfair dismissal and adverse action, and Fair Work Australia (FWA).</p>
<sec id="sec4-0022185613480719"><title>Workplace agreement making</title>
<p>One of the most significant changes introduced by the FW Act was the imposition of the good faith bargaining requirements, a framework that ‘lies at the very heart of the new Statute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 118). The bargaining framework was the subject of extensive discussion within submissions to the Review, reflecting a broad spectrum of opinion on its operation and effect. Union submissions to the Review were generally supportive of the bargaining framework and the capacity to bring employers to the bargaining table; employer group submissions varied markedly. For example, the Business Council of Australia expressed qualified support for the provisions, while the Australian Industry Group advocated a return to ‘voluntary bargaining’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 117–118). The panel adopted a generally conservative approach, noting that the relative infancy of the bargaining framework combined with continued judicial development meant that there would need to be a strong case for recommending ‘any precipitous legislative change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 129). Ultimately, the panel recommended only a few relatively minor changes, observing that Part 2-4 had been largely successful in addressing preexisting problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 118). In particular, the panel concluded that grounds do not yet exist to implement more prescriptive good faith bargaining rules or codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 138) or for the extension of the circumstances in which FWA can impose binding arbitration on the parties during a bargaining dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 138).</p>
<p>Recommended actions included enabling FWA to act on its own motion to exercise its general powers to deal with disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 149), and the extension of the good faith bargaining principles to agreement variations and negotiations undertaken during the currency of an existing workplace agreement (not just in the last 90 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 141, 172).</p>
<p>The negotiation of greenfields agreements received particular attention in submissions to the Review, with widespread employer dissatisfaction expressed over the perceived capacity of unions to frustrate agreement making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 171). The panel recommended the extension of the good faith bargaining principles to greenfields negotiations, along with the power for FWA to intervene on its own motion and conciliate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 172). More controversially, the panel recommended ‘last offer’ arbitration for greenfields negotiations that have reached impasse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 173).</p>
<p>The panel also devoted considerable attention to the technical rules relating to the creation and lodgement of workplace agreements, making a number of recommendations. Given their tendency to undermine collectively agreed wages and conditions, the panel recommended the prohibition of workplace agreements created with a single employee and opt-out clauses in workplace agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 161, 168).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185613480719">2</xref></sup> It also recommended amendment of the employee bargaining representative provisions to prevent a trade union official acting as a bargaining representative for an employee who is not eligible to be a member of the union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 146). The Review did not recommend alterations to either the content rules of workplace agreements or the Better Off Overall Test (BOOT), despite lengthy submissions in both these areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185613480719"><title>Individual flexibility</title>
<p>A key component of the Labor Party's ‘Forward with Fairness’ policy was the abolition of individual statutory agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613480719">Australian Labor Party (ALP), 2007</xref>). Under the FW Act, there is no capacity for individual statutory agreements; however, all modern awards and workplace agreements must contain an ‘individual flexibility clause’ to permit individually negotiated variations to terms and conditions through an ‘individual flexibility agreement’ (IFA) (FW Act, ss. 144, 202). IFAs cannot be made a condition of entry into employment and must be unilaterally terminable on 30 days' notice.</p>
<p>IFAs were the subject of considerable attention in the submissions to the Review. Views expressed ranged from requests for the return of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) to the abolition of IFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 106). The panel considered that making IFAs more attractive for employers would facilitate flexibility. To achieve this, the panel recommended extending the allowable unilateral termination period to 90 days, clarifying the BOOT to allow for the exchange of monetary for non-monetary benefits and strengthening protections for employers where an IFA is found to have failed the BOOT. The panel also recommended enhanced protection for employees, including a requirement to notify the Fair Work Ombudsman of the creation of IFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 106–109).</p>
<p>One further issue discussed dealt with individual flexibility clauses in workplace agreements. Where an agreement does not contain an individual flexibility clause, it is taken to contain the model flexibility clause (FW Act, s. 202(4)). This allows for workplace agreements to be created that have narrower individual flexibility clauses than the model flexibility clause if it is agreed between the employer and their employees. The panel argued that the objective of encouraging ‘genuine’ flexibility may be undermined by an individual flexibility clause that permits less flexibility than the model term, and recommended that all workplace agreements contain, at minimum, the model individual flexibility clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 163–164).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185613480719"><title>Industrial action</title>
<p>Since the introduction of protected industrial action to the federal industrial relations system in 1993, employees have been able to take protected industrial action in support of their claims to commence bargaining with an employer. However, under the FW Act, the question arose as to whether the inclusion of majority support determinations to require employers to commence bargaining had the effect of removing access to protected industrial action for these purposes. A strict statutory construction of the FW Act suggested that it did not have this effect and Parliament's intention was unclear from the explanatory material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185613480719">McCrystal, 2012</xref>). In April 2012, the Full Federal Court found that provided the prerequisites were satisfied, protected industrial action could be taken by relevant employees to try to compel an employer to agree to bargain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185613480719">3</xref></sup> The panel argued that retention of the ability to take protected industrial action in these circumstances was incompatible with the system of workplace bargaining established by the FW Act and represented a ‘clear “disconnect” with the new bargaining regime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 177). The panel recommended that access to protected industrial action be restricted to circumstances where bargaining for a workplace agreement has commenced, even if the scope of the agreement has not been settled (Review, 2012: 177).</p>
<p>With respect to the circumstances where protected industrial action can be brought to an end, the panel received numerous submissions advocating extension of the grounds when arbitration is available for protracted disputes. However, the panel rejected these arguments, observing that the existing provisions ‘strike the appropriate balance’ between facilitating a lawful right to strike for employees and protecting employers, third parties and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 186). One change the panel did recommend was repeal of the capacity of the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to terminate protected industrial action on essential services grounds as such a power could lead to inappropriate political interference in disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 186–187). The panel also recommended various changes to the process for administering protected action ballots to make it simpler and quicker. The panel recommended that access to protected industrial action be restricted to circumstances where bargaining for a workplace agreement has commenced, even if the scope of the agreement has not been settled (Review, 2012: 177).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185613480719"><title>Unfair dismissal and general protections</title>
<p>Two areas that were subject to a large number of contradictory submissions to the Review were unfair dismissal and the general protections regime. The panel concluded that both sets of provisions are generally working well and rejected suggestions that there has been a large increase in unmeritorious or speculative general protections claims as a result of the revamped adverse action regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 233).</p>
<p>The main concerns expressed by the panel relate to the practice of employers paying ‘go away money’ to perceived unmeritorious applicants, and the effect of the different time periods in which to commence an action between unfair dismissal (14 days) and general protections (60 days). The panel concluded that eliminating the practice of ‘go away money’ was very difficult in a relatively informal no-costs jurisdiction. However, it recommended changes to the unfair dismissal process to make it easier for FWA to dismiss unmeritorious claims and make costs orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 229–230). The panel also found that the differing time periods for unfair dismissal applications and general protections applications could facilitate general protections claims by unsuccessful or out-of-time unfair dismissal applicants, an outcome that could have the effect of undermining the statutory scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 244). As such, the panel recommended harmonisation of the two time periods, making them both 21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 244–245).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185613480719"><title>Fair Work Australia</title>
<p>The creation of FWA as a ‘one-stop shop’ was a major Labor policy objective before the enactment of the FW Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613480719">ALP, 2007</xref>). The panel found that FWA has been operating efficiently and effectively, but recommended a number of changes to streamline its operations. One recommendation that received widespread support in submissions to the Review was changing the name of FWA to more clearly delineate its administrative and tribunal functions (the panel advocated use of the ‘Commission’ label) and removing the words ‘Fair Work’ altogether in order to avoid confusion with the Fair Work Ombudsman and the FW Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480719">Review, 2012</xref>: 251–252).</p>
<p>This general summary of the recommendations of the panel covers the major recommendations and the areas of significant contention within submissions to the Review. There are a range of other recommendations, including, for example, extending the right to request flexible working arrangements to a wider range of caring obligations and providing greater ability for FWA to resolve disputes about the exercise of right-of-entry powers. Overall, the recommendations walk a fine line between employer and union wish lists and allow more time for remaining uncertainties under the legislation to be resolved through the processes of time and judicial review.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185613480719"><title>Fair Work Amendment Act 2012 (Cth)</title>
<p>The Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 (Cth) was passed by the Federal Parliament just before the end of the 2012 parliamentary sitting year. The amendments implement approximately one third of the ‘non-contentious’ recommendations of the FW Act Review: those that are technical or that reflect broad stakeholder support. The amendments prevent the inclusion of opt-out clauses in workplace agreements, prevent workplace agreements with single employees, make technical amendment to award variation provisions, scope order notifications and employee representational rights notices, and align the lodgement times for unfair dismissal and general protections applications to 21 days. The amendments also adopt the panel's recommendations with respect to FWA's power to dismiss unfair dismissal applications, make unfair dismissal cost orders and suggested changes to the protected action ballots process. With respect to FWA, the amendments adopt almost all of the suggestions of the Review, although the words ‘Fair Work’ remain in the title of the tribunal which, as of 1 January 2013, is known as the Fair Work Commission (FWC).</p>
<p>In addition to the implementation of some of the recommendations within the Review, the amendments also implement other changes. Two new statutory FWC positions of Vice President (VP) are created, and the FWC President is given the power to intervene and assume responsibility for matters before the FWC. It also includes a new complaint handling process modelled on the Court Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 (Cth), which is designed to ‘support the independence of FWC Members and confidence in the FWC’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185613480719">4</xref></sup> The inclusion of two new VP positions was made on the recommendation of the President of FWA, who suggested that such positions would be helpful to attract senior practitioners to the FWC and to assist the President in administration and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613480719">Senate, 2012</xref>: 13–14). However, submissions to the Senate Review of the Bill expressed concern over the potential of these changes to erode the independence of members of the tribunal, particularly those commissioners originally appointed as VP or Senior Deputy Presidential (SDP) members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission before the commencement of the FW Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613480719">Senate, 2012</xref>: 13–14).</p>
<p>Other changes effected by the Amendment Act include the implementation of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission inquiry report, <italic>Default Superannuation Funds in Modern Awards</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185613480719">Productivity Commission, 2012</xref>), establishing an Expert Panel within FWA to review default modern award superannuation funds every four years. The Expert Panel will subsume the functions of the current Minimum Wage Panel, and relevant Expert Panel members (including FWC members and external members) will be responsible for conducting the annual minimum wage review. The amendments also overturn the decision in CFMEU v CSBP Limited (No. 2),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185613480719">5</xref></sup> which permitted the awarding of costs in the Federal Court in relation to appeals arising under the FW Act. Section 550 of the FW Act will restrict the ability of courts exercising jurisdiction under the FW Act to award costs except with respect to vexatious claims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185613480719"><title>Transfer of business</title>
<p>Finally, the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Act 2012 (Cth) amended the FW Act to expand transfer of business protections to outsourced state public sector workers. The amendments create a new Part 6-3A of the FW Act to protect the employment terms and conditions of state public sector employees whose positions are outsourced to national system employers. The amendments create a new federal instrument called a ‘copied state instrument,’ which preserves relevant state award or agreement terms and conditions in a transfer of business (as defined in the Act) to the extent that they are not below the National Employment Standards. As with the existing FW Act transfer of business protections, the FWC has been given the power to modify the transfer of business rules where it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0022185613480719"><title>Industry-specific regulation</title>
<p>Three industry level industrial relations Acts were enacted by the Federal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613480719">Parliament during 2012</xref>, concerning road transport; textile, clothing and footwear outworkers; and building and construction. While in Bill form, the substance of these Acts was discussed at length in last year's review essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>) and will be outlined only briefly here.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0022185613480719"><title>Road transport industry</title>
<p>The Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012 (Cth) (RSR Act) seeks to address the link between payment rates and safety in long-haul road transport by establishing mechanisms for minimum payment rates for road transport industry participants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185613480719">Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613480719">Rawling and Kaine, 2012</xref>). The RSR Act regulates employee and independent contractor road transport industry participants within the limits of the Federal Parliament's legislative competence, including participants within supply chains (RSR Act, ss. 5–9).</p>
<p>The RSR Act establishes an independent Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal) with a range of functions including setting minimum remuneration rates for drivers, conciliating and, by consent, arbitrating disputes, approving collective agreements for independent contractors, and conducting research into remuneration-related matters that affect safety in the road transport industry (RSR Act, s. 80). The Tribunal commenced operation on 1 July 2012 with Acton SDP as President.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Tribunal's work will be in the establishment and maintenance of minimum rates for road transport industry workers in the form of binding ‘road safety remuneration orders’. Such orders may be made by the Tribunal acting on its own initiative, or upon application by an interested party (a driver, an employer or hirer, a supply chain participant, or an industrial association) (RSR Act, s. 19). Road safety remuneration orders may include minimum remuneration and other entitlements for drivers, conditions for loading and unloading, including wait times, hours, load limits, and payment methods and methods for reducing or removing remuneration-related incentives, pressures and practices that contribute to unsafe work practices (RSR Act, s. 27).</p>
<p>The RSR Act also provides for approval of enforceable ‘road transport collective agreements’ made between collectives of road transport contractors and their hirers or potential hirers (RSR Act, s. 33). The Act was amended during its passage through Parliament in order to resolve a problem concerning the compatibility of road transport collective agreements and the anti-competitive conduct provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CC Act) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>: 285). Under section 37A of the RSR Act, permitted collective bargaining conduct undertaken pursuant to a road transport collective agreement is authorised for the purposes of the CC Act and not unlawful. The amendments also added a competition test to the approval process for agreements, where the Tribunal must be satisfied that the benefit in approving the agreement outweighs the detriment to the public caused by any lessening of competition from approval of the agreement (RSR Act, s. 32A). This test is similar to the public benefit test applied by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for authorising potentially anti-competitive conduct under the CC Act (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185613480719">McCrystal, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, no road safety remuneration orders or road transport collective agreements had been made. However, the Tribunal had published a draft annual work programme, indicating that it intended to inquire into making a road safety remuneration order with respect to ‘sectors of the road transport industry, including but not limited to the retail, livestock, rural and interstate long distance sectors and their supply chains’, dealing with a wide range of issues impacting upon safety within these sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022185613480719">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>On 1 July 2012, amendments to the FW Act providing increased legislative protection for clothing, textile and footwear outworkers commenced operation (Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Act 2012 (Cth) s. 2). Under the amendments, the bulk of the terms of the FW Act now apply to independent contractor outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry as if they were national system employees (FW Act, ss. 12, 789BA-BC). Further, the amendments create a mechanism for the recovery of unpaid amounts from almost any party in a supply chain of contracts and provide for the creation of a code of practice for standards of conduct and practice with respect to the employment or engagement of textile, clothing and footwear outworkers and other relevant matters (FW Act, Part 6-4A, Division 3-4).</p>

<sec id="sec14-0022185613480719"><title>Building and construction industry</title>
<p>As reported in the last two review essays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Smith, 2011</xref>), amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) have been on the Federal parliamentary agenda since June 2009. In March 2012, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Act 2012 (Cth) was finally passed. The bulk of the amendments commenced operation on 1 June 2012 and the Act is now titled the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act 2012 (Cth) (FWBI Act).</p>
<p>Overall, the effect of the amendments was to remove specific building industry workplace relations regulation of unprotected industrial action, while retaining work health and safety and enforcement provisions. The amendments also abolished the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, replacing it with the Office of the Fair Work Building Inspectorate (the Inspectorate).</p>
<p>The controversial coercive powers of compulsory examination held by the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner are now vested in the Director of the Inspectorate with a three year sunset clause that, unless renewed, will see the powers lapse on 31 May 2015 (FWBI Act, ss. 45, 46). The legislation also contains substantial safeguards concerning the exercise of the powers. Access to the powers will be overseen by Presidential Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (FWBI Act, ss. 44, 45), all examinations will be video-recorded and a copy provided to the Commonwealth Ombudsman for review (FWBI Act, s. 54A), and an ‘independent assessor’ has been given the power to determine that the powers of compulsory examination do not apply to a particular building project (FWBI Act, s. 39).</p>
<p>Finally, in order to secure passage of the Act, the federal government agreed to amendments that prevent the Director or Inspectorate commencing or continuing proceedings against building industry actors in matters under the FWBI Act where another party has already instituted proceedings relevant to the offence and settled the matter (FWBI Act, ss. 73, 73A).</p>

<sec id="sec15-0022185613480719"><title>Registered organisations</title>
<p>Passed in June 2012 in response to the investigation into the conduct of the HSU (see Bailey and Peetz, this issue), the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012 (Cth) amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth) (RO Act) to tighten governance and financial accountability obligations for registered organisations. The amendments introduce new disclosure obligations, strengthen the FWC's power to investigate breaches of the RO Act and increase civil penalties (RO Act, s. 337AA).</p>
<p>The FWC may now refer matters under investigation to state or federal police, where the investigation involves suspected criminal behaviour (RO Act, s. 336(2)(c)), and the General Manager of the FWC may disclose information about the matter under investigation to law enforcement agencies where it is ‘likely to assist’ in law enforcement or administration (RO Act, s. 335C). The FWC's expanded investigatory powers allow it to obtain evidence from third parties (e.g. telecommunications providers) where it believes the information is unlikely to be provided by the officer or auditor under investigation (RO Act, s. 335A). Investigations must be completed ‘as soon as practicable’ (RO Act, s. 335B), ostensibly, a response to criticisms concerning the perceived length of the HSU investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613480719">Woodley, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Under the enhanced disclosure obligations, organisational rules must require senior officers to disclose to members and to the branch of the organisation any material or potential conflict of interest, both personal interests and those held by relatives, whether non-financial or financial in nature (RO Act, ss. 148A–148C). Organisational rules must require that officers vested with financial duties undertake approved financial management training (RO Act, s. 154D) and the minister may issue model rules relating to expenditure (RO Act, s. 148F). The disclosure obligations will commence on 29 June 2013 unless an earlier date for proclamation is fixed (RO Amendment Act, s. 2).</p>

<sec id="sec16-0022185613480719"><title>Employee entitlements</title>
<p>Also indicated in last year's review essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>: 290), in fulfilment of an electoral promise, the federal government introduced new legislation to protect employee entitlements in the event of insolvency or liquidation of an employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185613480719">Gillard and ALP, 2010</xref>). The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012 (Cth) (FEG Act) replaces the administrative GEERS scheme and enables eligible employees to obtain an ‘advance’ from the Commonwealth if their employment ends due to bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up of their employer and they have not been paid accrued entitlements (FEG Act, s. 4(2)).</p>
<p>The new scheme only applies where the person's employment ends within six months of the appointment of an insolvency practitioner (broadly defined to include liquidators, administrators and receivers), or after a practitioner is appointed (FEG Act, s. 10(1)(c)). Financial assistance under the scheme is uncapped, despite attempts by the federal opposition to retain the 16 week cap that previously applied under GEERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613480719">Workplace Express, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Entitlements covered by the scheme include annual and long-service leave, payment in lieu of notice (up to five weeks' pay), and wages and redundancy pay (calculated at a rate of four weeks' wages per year of service). The scheme also prescribes a formula to determine the applicable advance payable (FEG Act, ss. 20–27). As under the previous scheme, once an advance is paid, the Commonwealth assumes the recipient employee's rights in relation to debt recovery (FEG Act, Part 5, Division 1).</p>

<sec id="sec18-0022185613480719"><title>Paid parental leave</title>
<p>Complementing the introduction of paid parental leave in 2010 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Smith, 2011</xref>), new amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 (Cth) (PPL Act) entitle eligible fathers and partners to a one-off payment of two weeks' government-funded leave, paid at the rate of minimum wage, upon the birth or adoption of a child (PPL Act, ss. 3A(2), 4). The payment is designed to encourage early shared parenting and father/partner–child bonding. The scheme applies to children born on or after 1 January 2013 (PPL Act, s. 115BD). To be eligible, the partner must be caring for the child, satisfy the income and work tests, and satisfy the residency requirement (PPL Act, s. 115CA). An income limit of $150,000 applies (indexed after 30 June 2014), unless the dad or partner is already eligible for PPL (PPL Act, s. 115CG(2)).</p>
<p>Other amendments to the PPL Act and the FW Act rectify operational difficulties. They extend the time frame that a primary claimant parent must wait before taking a ‘keeping in touch’ day to 42 days from the date of the birth (or adoption), unless the claimant's employer suggests or requests otherwise and the claimant agrees, in which case a period of 14 days from the date of birth or adoption applies (FW Act, s. 79A(2)(c)). The changes also ensure that ‘keeping in touch’ days do not sever the continuity of the unpaid parental leave period provided under the FW Act (FW Act, s. 79A(1)). The changes also modify the work test that applies to PPL claimants, allowing a primary claimant to satisfy the test where a child is born prematurely, or where pregnancy-related complications or illness prevent a claimant from working for the required period (PPL Act, ss. 32, 36A).</p>

<sec id="sec19-0022185613480719"><title>Workplace gender equality</title>
<p>New workplace gender equality laws were also passed in 2012. The objects of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613480719">Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012</xref> (Cth) (WGE Act) (previously titled the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act) include promoting and improving workplace gender equality (including equal pay) by removing barriers to women's workplace participation, eliminating gender-based discrimination and fostering workplace consultation in relation to gender equality issues to improve productivity and competiveness (WGE Act, s. 2A). The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency has been renamed the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).</p>
<p>The WGE Act signals a shift in focus from procedural measures to substantive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613480719">Thornton, 2012</xref>: 288). It introduces new phased reporting requirements, including minimum standards, which apply to all private sector and higher education employers with over 100 employees (WGE Act, s. 3). From 1 April 2012, relevant employers will be required to make annual compliance reports accessible to employees and shareholders and allow employees and employee organisations the opportunity to comment on reports (WGE Act, ss. 16A, B). From 1 April 2013, reporting obligations shift from programmes and measures, to equality indicators and outcomes, including pay equity, gender composition of workforce (including board and management) and flexible work arrangements (WGE Act, s. 3(1)). Reports will be publicly available, save for remuneration information (WGE Act, s. 14). The minister will set by legislative instrument minimum standards for each equality indicator by 1 April 2014, applying to all reporting thereafter (WGE Act, s. 19(1)). The minimum standards may be ‘quantitative’ or specify actions aimed at particular outcomes, and will be developed in consultation with stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185613480719">WGEA, 2012</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>In relation to compliance, the WGE Act introduces additional mechanisms: it empowers the WGEA to conduct random compliance ‘spot checks’ (WGE Act, s. 18) and publish non-reporting organisations on its website or by newspaper (WGE Act, s. 19D(3)). It also removes the ability of the WGEA Director to waive reporting requirements for compliant organisations (WGE Act, s. 13C) and potentially precludes non-compliant organisations from government procurement contracts (WGE Act, s. 18). For the first time, reporting requirements continue to apply to employers who drop below 100 employees, until the number of employees falls below 80 (WGE Act, s. 3(2A)).</p>

<sec id="sec20-0022185613480719"><title>Social and community services pay equity</title>
<p>The Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Act 2012 (Cth) (SACS Act) establishes a special Commonwealth account to meet the costs of pay equity orders following the social and community services equal remuneration decision (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185613480719">Cortis and Meagher, 2012</xref>). The SACS Act entitles employers who receive funding under certain Commonwealth funded programs for service delivery, or under Commonwealth grants, who are covered by the pay equity order, or to whom a pay equity order applies, to receive funds from the special account to cover any shortfall in funding as a result of increased wages flowing from the pay equity case (SACS Act, s. 7(1)).</p>

<sec id="sec22-0022185613480719"><title>New South Wales</title>
<p>There were a number of significant legislative developments in New South Wales (NSW) over the course of 2012, continuing the legislative agenda of the NSW coalition government. Three Bills to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (IR Act) affecting industrial organisations were introduced, two of which had been passed at the time of writing. In addition, there were substantial changes to the workers compensation legislation passed in response to a report of the Joint Select Committee on the NSW Workers Compensation Scheme: Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (NSW); and Safety, Return to Work and Support Board Bill 2012 (NSW). Space does not permit consideration of the workers compensation changes.</p>
<p>The Industrial Relations Amendment (Industrial Representation) Act 2012 (NSW) amended the ‘conveniently belong’ rule for state registered organisations. The new provisions allow the registration of new organisations, or the alteration of the rules of an existing organisation, where another organisation to which a member might more conveniently belong exists, provided that undertakings with respect to demarcation disputes are given to the NSW Industrial Relations Commission (NSWIRC) (IR Act, ss. 218(1A), 245, 336(1)). The Industrial Relations Amendment (Industrial Organisations) Act 2012 (NSW) introduced provisions in relation to misconduct within NSW registered organisations. The amendments allow for the appointment of an administrator in cases of serious misconduct either directly by the minister or by the NSWIRC on application by interested parties (IR Act, Part 4, Division 11). The Act also extended the statute of limitations period for misconduct offences from 12 months to five years (IR Act, s. 398(2)). The third Bill, introduced in response to a wave of industrial action in the NSW public sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613480719">Brigden, 2012</xref>: 372), seeks to impose a tenfold increase in penalties imposed on organisations for breaches of NSWIRC orders in respect of industrial disputes. At the time of writing, the Industrial Relations Amendment (Dispute Orders) Bill 2012 (NSW) had not been passed.</p>
<p>One other development of note in NSW should be mentioned. The NSW Legislative Council Standing Committee on Law and Justice delivered its report, <italic>Opportunities to Consolidate Tribunals in NSW</italic>, recommending that the NSWIRC be considered for integration within a new ‘super’ tribunal. However, the NSW government response did not include the NSWIRC within the proposed NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, although it has reserved the option to incorporate it at a later date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185613480719">NSW Government, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0022185613480719"><title>Queensland</title>
<p>Following the landslide election of a Liberal National government in March 2012, the Queensland Parliament enacted significant changes to public sector employment legislation, accompanied by job cuts. The Industrial Relations (Fair Work Act Harmonisation) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Qld) followed by the Public Service and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Qld) both amended the Industrial Relations Act 1999 (Qld) (QIR Act).</p>
<p>The changes render preexisting job security, contracting, organisational change and termination/change/redundancy (TCR) provisions in state public sector awards and enterprise agreements void (QIR Act, s. 691C, D). Under the amended QIR Act, an employer is not required to notify affected entities of a TCR decision until it considers it ‘appropriate’ and is not required to consult with affected entities about the decision, other than in relation to its implementation (QIR Act, s. 691D(2)). The changes further require that the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (QIRC) take into account the state’s (and relevant entities') ‘financial positions’ and ‘fiscal strategy’ when determining public sector wages and conditions through arbitration (QIR Act, ss. 3(p), 149(5)(c)(ii)).</p>
<p>The QIR Act amendments also increased the scope for lawyers to appear in the QIRC. Legal representation is permitted if the parties consent, or if the QIRC is satisfied ‘it is desirable’ (QIR Act, s. 23); however, some proceedings are exempt (see list under QIR Act, s. 23(1)(b)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0022185613480719"><title>Territories</title>
<p>The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) enacted the Long Service Leave (Portable Schemes) (Security Industry) Amendment Act 2012 (ACT), bringing registered security industry workers into the existing ACT portable long service leave scheme and introducing penalties for employers who do not honour long service leave entitlements.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory (NT) passed amendments to the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2012 (NT) (WRC Act), which commenced on 1 July 2012. The enactments remedy a gap between the NT workers compensation scheme and the age pension qualifying age that affected older workers' ability to access compensation (WRC Act, s. 65(1)). Further, the amendments provide a clearer test for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or not for compensation eligibility (WRC Act, s. 3(2)(a)) and the scheme enables compensation recipients to live overseas, provided that they comply with any relevant regulations and remain incapacitated (WRC Act, s. 65B).</p>

<sec id="sec25-0022185613480719" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As this discussion has demonstrated, 2012 was a bumper year for industrial relations legislation, both with respect to the FW Act and other industry level or issue specific regulation. In particular, the passage of the RSR Act represents an important step in improving working conditions and safety in the road transport industry, and the FWBI Act frees building industry employees from separate industry level regulation of industrial action.</p>
<p>The implementation of around one third of the uncontroversial findings of the FW Act Review panel represents a commitment by the ALP government to ensuring the smooth operation of the workplace relations system. However, the remaining recommendations are considerably more contentious. Minister for Workplace Relations, Bill Shorten, has stated his intention to work closely with stakeholder groups before the introduction of further changes, an approach that reflects a continuation of the consultative approach adopted by the ALP during the development of the FW Act. The next tranche of legislative changes arising out of the Review are likely to be introduced in early 2013 along with some other significant developments.</p>
<p>The Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012 (Cth) is currently awaiting passage through the upper house. If enacted, the Bill will amend the Migration Act to introduce tougher penalties for agents and employers who ‘allow’ or facilitate people to work who are not legally entitled to work in Australia. Under the proposed changes, both civil penalties and infringement notices apply, and liability for employer sanctions will extend to officers, partners and management in certain circumstances; circumstances of aggravation extend to situations where a person allows work to be undertaken by an undocumented worker, the worker is (or is likely to be) exploited and the person knows or is reckless about it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613480719">Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also major change forecast for anti-discrimination legislation. At the time of writing, the federal Attorney General's Department had released the exposure draft Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012, the culmination of the consolidation of Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws process, discussed in the previous two review essays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Orchiston, 2012</xref>: 279; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480719">McCrystal and Smith, 2011</xref>: 297). The draft Bill has been referred to a Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Inquiry for stakeholder consultation before being introduced to Parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185613480719">Roxon and Wong, 2012</xref>).</p>
