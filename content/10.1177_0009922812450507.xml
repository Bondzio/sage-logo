<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past few decades, there has been increased interest in global health (GH) training, both at the medical student and resident levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812450507">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812450507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812450507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812450507"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812450507">6</xref></sup> Residents indicate that the experience of GH electives is a useful part of their training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812450507">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812450507">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812450507">8</xref></sup> Many medical students enter residency with prior GH elective experience. This has increased dramatically over the past 30 years from 6% in 1980 to 30.5% in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812450507">9</xref></sup> Increased interest and opportunities have led to higher training expectations, including goals to complete residency with adequate knowledge of tropical medicine and a formation of cultural humility when caring for immigrant and refugee populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812450507">1</xref></sup> Earlier articles have suggested guidelines for creating a useful international elective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812450507">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812450507"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812450507">12</xref></sup> and described the development of GH training programs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812450507">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812450507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812450507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812450507"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812450507">17</xref></sup> but there has been no assessment to date of what factors were deemed essential for the development of a GH track by track directors. Prior studies on GH track development have emphasized the need for resident preparation, mentorship, and funding sources, but these have largely been single-institution studies. With the increase in GH training in pediatric residencies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450507">3</xref></sup> there is now an opportunity to learn from GH track directors which factors have been crucial to the development of a successful and sustainable pediatric GH track and which factors have been obstacles to the development of a track. Such experience-based information would be highly valuable for programs wishing to start a GH track. We conducted a survey of directors of pediatric residency GH training programs in the United States and categorized them into 2 groups based on the formality of their education structure (track vs nontrack). They were asked to outline the characteristics and components of their GH training programs and discern which factors they deemed essential to the development of a GH track.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812450507" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our study focused on pediatric residency programs with formalized GH tracks or nontrack structured educational programs. Nontrack educational programs had preelective GH training such as curriculum, workshops, seminars, or other formal preparation in addition to an international elective. To identify these programs, we used 2 methods. First, we surveyed the leadership of the major national organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on International Child Health, Academic Pediatric Association International Health Special Interest Group, and Association of Pediatric Program Directors. Second, in the e-mail containing the survey link, we asked the GH education directors identified by these surveys to note any additional programs they were aware of that were potentially missed by the national organizations. Through these methods, we identified 24 US pediatric residency programs that included a formal GH track or nontrack GH education as a part of their pediatric residency. The time from initial notification of national organizations to the last completed survey was October 2010 to February 2011.</p>
<p>We then e-mailed an online survey to the 24 GH education directors. Two subsequent follow-up e-mails were sent along with a final attempt to contact nonresponders with a phone call or personal e-mail. The survey contained questions on components of the GH education program, including questions about factors considered essential to a GH track and the factors that had been or were currently obstacles to the development of a GH track. The authors listed factors that from experience and previously published guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812450507">18</xref></sup> they thought might be essential (10) or obstacles (14) to the development of a GH track. In addition, for both essential factors and obstacles, the education directors were asked to write in any factors that they felt were important that were not listed. Education directors rated their agreement for essential factors and obstacles according to a 5-point Likert scale (<italic>strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree</italic>).</p>
<p>Programs were asked if they had a formal GH track, as defined by the criteria listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812450507">Table 1</xref>. To be identified as a track, all 4 criteria had to be met. These track criteria were formed on the basis of consensus opinion among the authors, all of whom are involved in residency GH education. The complete survey questionnaire is provided in Supplemental Appendix A (Supplementary Tables for this article is available on the <italic>Clinical Pediatrics</italic> website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clp.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://clp.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>.) Nontrack programs answered questions 5 to 9, and track programs answered questions 10 to 23 (including additional questions concerning when the track started, financial support for residents, and protected faculty time for GH education). All programs provided demographic information and answered questions 24 and 25.</p>

<p>Institutional participants who completed surveys are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812450507">Table 2</xref>. A total of 20 programs responded to the survey, which is a response rate of 83%. One responding institution, Baylor College of Medicine, did not complete the survey because the program there is structured differently than all others, with residents in the track completing an additional year of residency in an international site. The survey completion rate was 19 of 24 programs (79%).</p>

<title>Factors That Had Been or Were Currently Obstacles to the Development of a GH Track</title>
<p>The survey also asked GH education directors about factors that had been or were currently obstacles to their institution’s development of a GH track. This question focused on issues specific to a director’s experience in developing or attempting to develop a track at his or her own institution, in contrast to the prior question, which related to factors that he or she considered essential to the development of a formal GH track at any institution. More varied responses were seen in answers to obstacles actually experienced as opposed to factors deemed essential (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922812450507">Table 4</xref>). Two factors had been or were currently obstacles to the development of a GH track at &gt;80% of all institutions: lack of overall track funding and lack of funding for track faculty. Two additional factors were noted to have been or to currently be obstacles at ≥60% of institutions: lack of sufficient protected time for faculty and lack of administrative support. A smaller proportion of track directors, as opposed to nontrack education directors, agreed that each of these factors was or had been an obstacle, but none of the differences was statistically significant (eg, lack of overall funding, 82% vs 86%, <italic>P</italic> = .99; lack of faculty funding 82% vs 100%, <italic>P</italic> = .5; lack of protected faculty time 55% vs 100%, <italic>P</italic> = .5; and lack of administrative support, 60% vs 86%, <italic>P</italic> = .34).</p>

<title>Components of GH Track or Nontrack Education Programs</title>
<p>Required and optional components of the GH education programs are listed in Supplemental Table 1. As compared with nontrack education programs, programs with GH tracks were significantly more likely to offer a local GH elective (100% vs 25%, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and to offer a course in clinical tropical medicine and traveler’s health certified by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH; 45% vs 0%, <italic>P</italic> = .04). Lecture topics offered by track and nontrack programs are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Track programs were significantly more likely to offer education in some topics that were not disease specific, including cross-cultural health care, maternal health, and poverty and development. The average number of lectures per year was 23 for tracks and 20 for nontracks. Requirements for resident participation in an international elective are listed in Supplemental Table 3.</p>
<p>Track-specific characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0009922812450507">Table 5</xref>.

<p>With the increased demand for GH training opportunities during residency, many programs are developing or enhancing GH programs, including GH tracks.

In the present study, education directors of successful GH tracks in pediatric residencies and those who led nontrack education programs were asked which factors they considered essential in the development of a GH track. These data thus provide a first assessment of essential factors for successful development of a GH track using data from the most valid source: the directors of GH tracks. There has been no prior delineation or assessment of the factors most commonly agreed on in the literature, and other factors that might be considered equally important (eg, a GH administrator and faculty with GH research projects) did not reach this almost unanimous consensus. Some of the identified essential components and potential obstacles (ie. institutional support, collaboration with international sites, protected time for education, and legal/monetary concerns)are consistent with the guidelines for the development of GH programs suggested by the GHEC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812450507">18</xref></sup> The current study provides an evidence base for these guidelines; adds a focused look into these broader categories, such as focusing on an administrator specific to GH; and addresses the additional issues of protected time and funding for faculty and overall program budgets. As interest in GH training increases and an increasing number of residencies aim to include GH training in their educational mandate, a careful assessment of how available and sustainable the factors deemed essential are within their program will allow them to make more informed decisions on track or education program development.</p>
<p>Some of the essential factors outlined may seem self-evident, but they have not previously been published or articulated and are easy to miss in the enthusiasm of setting up a GH training program within a residency. It was important to survey both formalized tracks as well as nontrack education programs because many of those without tracks aim to create a track, and it was important to learn what obstacles these programs currently face. For example, support of the residency director and department chair are intuitively important for any program within a residency, yet the authors are aware of GH initiatives within residencies that have operated without specific support by either. These initiatives may provide admirable results for the limited number of residents that pursue them, but they are often hampered by a lack of adequate training or preparation for the residents and a lack of sustainability because they generally depend on a single faculty member. Recent working group recommendations from the Federation of Pediatric Organizations emphasize the need for a core curriculum and other training initiatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812450507">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450507">3</xref></sup> that are available only through an organized training program. With the recent call for GH training for all residents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812450507">11</xref></sup> we concur that GH training should be formalized and integrated into residency programs, as is training for any other area of medicine. Such integration can only occur with buy-in from department chairs and residency directors.</p>
<p>Other factors deemed essential may be less immediately intuitive. A number of residency programs struggle with attempts to provide international electives when there is no guarantee for protected time for such electives. Without this guarantee, planning and pursuit of international electives will remain haphazard and lack academic rigor. If needs assessments of resident interest are not done prior to launching a program, it may lead to a program with a defined structure but lack of participation. Collaboration with at least 1 low-income country partner site is clearly important because there is no substitute to learning on-site, and partnerships between universities or departments may allow smaller departments to leverage the established relationships developed by larger departments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812450507">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812450507">29</xref></sup> However, defining a collaborative approach with the partner site, as opposed to a “medical tourism” approach, is critical to a successful long-term relationship that benefits both the partner site and the visiting residents.</p>
<p>Education directors identified lack of overall funding for GH training and lack of funding for protected faculty time for the training as the 2 major obstacles to integration of GH training into their residency programs. Several articles have begun to stress the importance of adequate funding for GH education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812450507">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812450507">35</xref></sup> Although many faculty donate time, funding, and supplies to their GH efforts, GH training does not differ from any other academic training: it also requires protected time and funding for adequate curriculum and program development. All 11 programs with GH tracks had faculty with funding for protected time for track education work. This appears to have been a key element that affected their program’s ability to develop a track from a previous nontrack educational format. Two other factors had been or were currently obstacles to the development of a GH track in &gt;60% of GH education programs: lack of protected faculty time and lack of administrative support. Based on these data, an early emphasis on adequate overall track funding, provision of funding for protected faculty time, and provision of administrative support may be particularly important in the successful development of a GH track. We have not identified consistent or obvious methods of funding that would work across residency programs, but within our programs, data on the importance of GH education in attracting the best residents to the program has been important in sustaining departmental funding for this initiative.</p>
<p>The authors defined a track based on considerations of the minimum requirements for a structured training program in GH. They are not aware of any other formal definition for a track. The criteria provided may be considered a starting point for a track definition. Those GH education programs that fit the track definition offered more education options, such as a local GH elective and an ASTMH-certified course in travel and tropical medicine. The differences, and the ability to build a formal track, may relate to differences in institutional support (eg, administrative support).Track programs were also able to offer education on a greater breadth of topics, including non–disease-focused topics. This could be secondary to the broader expertise available at a program able to support a formal GH track and the faculty on-site and available to deliver the identified lectures. All the lecture topics listed overlap with the suggested competency goals suggested by GHEC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812450507">18</xref></sup> Many of the non–disease-focused topics fulfill the American College of Graduate Medical Education competencies of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice, which are the more difficult competencies to assess and essential to the development of a GH resident.</p>
<p>The present study chose to list possible essential elements and obstacles and then leave space for open entry of factors not listed. The approach was validated by agreement or strong agreement of education directors with many of the factors listed. It is possible that some of the write-in factors would also have elicited strong agreement, and it is important to note these in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922812450507">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922812450507">4</xref>. Some of the open entry responses may have been specific to program size and/or resources. A follow-up qualitative study could address and uncover further experiences in the development of a GH track. The query of national pediatric organizations was considered the best method of obtaining information about pediatric GH education programs, but it is possible that some GH programs were missed with this approach. There are many programs with varying degrees of GH education that were not included in the study because we chose to focus on those with a structured GH educational curriculum. This was consistent with the intent of our study to assess structured programs in GH education, as opposed to all residency programs offering international electives; so our study reflects the essential components and obstacles identified by such programs and does not reflect the experience of all residency programs providing international electives. As GH becomes better defined as a discipline, we hope that education in this area will move toward structured and competency-based programs in all residencies as in other major areas of pediatric education.</p>
<p>Looking forward, one way to extend faculty expertise and programmatic support across institutions may be the formation of regional consortia. The authors of the present study helped to found the Midwest Global Health Education Consortium, which is now in its second year of building a network of shared educational resources, experiences, faculty, and international sites among several training programs. A similar model in other regions around the country may allow for increased success with program development.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study identified 6 factors that ≥95% of GH education directors agreed were essential to the development of a GH track and 4 factors that more than half of GH education directors agreed had been or currently were an obstacle to the development of a GH track at their institution. As an increasing number of residencies aim to include a GH training in their educational mandate, a careful assessment of the availability and sustainability of the essential factors and of the presence of the related identified obstacles within their program will allow them to make informed decisions on track or program development.</p>
