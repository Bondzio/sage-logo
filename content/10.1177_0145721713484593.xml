<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of a treatment algorithm and education intervention for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia presenting to the emergency department (ED) and stable enough to be discharged home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713484593">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Urban hospital ED patients (n = 86) with BG ≥ 200 mg/dL were enrolled in a 4-week prospective, nonrandomized pilot intervention with historic self-controls. Follow-up visits occurred at 12 to 72 hours, 2 and 4 weeks, and 6 months. T2DM medications were initiated or adjusted at each visit using a guideline-based diabetes medication management algorithm. Survival skills diabetes self-management education and navigation to outpatient services were provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713484593">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants were 51.8% male and 92% black, and 87.3% had private or public insurance. The top reasons for presenting to the ED were no provider appointment available (41.7%) and no primary care provider (14.6%). No hypoglycemia occurred in the first 24 hours following ED T2DM medication initiation or titration and overall hypoglycemia rates were low. BG was reduced from 356 ± 110 mg/dL at baseline to 183 ± 103 mg/dL at 4 weeks (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721713484593">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Diabetes medication management and survival skills education for uncontrolled diabetes may be safely initiated in the ED, as demonstrated by the multidisciplinary STEP-DC intervention, which effectively enabled glycemic control in this pilot study.</p>

<body>
<p>Utilization of the emergency department (ED) for treatment of acute symptoms of chronic illnesses imposes an economic burden on the US health care system. ED crowding is a nationwide problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713484593">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713484593">2</xref></sup> In the District of Columbia, there were 39 857 ED visits accrued for diabetes in 2006 at a cost of approximately $27 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713484593">3</xref></sup> A significant portion of such visits are likely ambulatory care sensitive and could be prevented with prior primary care visits and appropriate diabetes self-management education (DSME).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713484593">4</xref></sup> ED charges for minor problems may be 2 to 5 times higher than those of an office visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713484593">5</xref></sup> The ED also presents an opportunity to identify previously unrecognized or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes so that appropriate management may by initiated to help prevent both acute and chronic complications of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713484593">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Guidelines are in place for outpatient type 2 diabetes management and type 2 diabetes medication management algorithms have also been published by organizations including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484593">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484593">8</xref></sup> however, clinical inertia in advancement of the antihyperglycemic medication regimen remains common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713484593">9</xref></sup> Best practices for management of the hyperglycemic patient presenting to the ED, and strategies for the prevention of ED revisits have yet to be determined. Only a few reported studies have assessed type 2 diabetes antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapeutic strategies for implementation at the time of discharge from the ED. Two early reports suggested that maximal dose sulfonylurea is safe and effective for treating such patients and could avoid need for hospital admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713484593">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713484593">11</xref></sup> A more recently reported randomized study found that sulfonylurea with or without 10 units of insulin glargine improved blood glucose (BG) levels in type 2 diabetes patients discharged from the ED to the outpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713484593">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, complex medical condition that requires daily self-management on the part of the patient. Basic DSME includes instruction in capillary BG monitoring, the prevention, recognition, and treatment of hypoglycemia, and core strategies for dietary and medication management. This information aids patients in making informed decisions regarding type 2 diabetes care on a daily basis, offering the possibility of better overall control. Despite evidence that DSME reduces ED visits, A1C, and hospital admissions, fewer than 55% of all diabetes patients in the United States receive any DSME during the entire course of their illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713484593">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713484593"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713484593">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, acute ED management of hyperglycemic type 2 diabetes patients who are otherwise stable for discharge is often accomplished using short-acting insulin in the ED. The patient is then sent home with or without a new or adjusted medication regimen. There is appropriate concern that starting antihyperglycemic medications, particularly insulin, may precipitate hypoglycemia in patients who are not well educated about diabetes self-management and/or are not trained in self-monitoring of BG.</p>
<p>The ED setting presents a unique opportunity to intervene in the overall management of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. The ED is well positioned to identify persons with previously undiagnosed or previously diagnosed but uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, to prescribe type 2 diabetes medications, to initiate an effort to address deficits in DSME, to provide glucometer and insulin self-administration instruction, and to effect transition to an appropriate primary care medical home for ongoing management, per the principles of the Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713484593">16</xref></sup> Accomplishing these tasks in a busy ED setting remains challenging.</p>
<p>The objective of this project was to pilot a focused intervention for management of ED hyperglycemia, incorporating a type 2 diabetes medication management algorithm, survival skills DSME, and health system navigation. This was accomplished by implementing the Synergy to Reduce ED Visits Project in the District of Columbia (STEP-DC), which allows antihyperglycemic medications, including basal insulin therapy, to be safely initiated and/or titrated in the ED. To test algorithm safety, the primary outcome measure was the incidence of hypoglycemia (BG ≤ 60 mg/dL) within 24 hours following ED initiation or titration of sulfonylurea or insulin therapy. Any episodes of hypoglycemia within this period were considered significant.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0145721713484593">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The study design was a nonrandomized, prospective feasibility study, conducted to evaluate a treatment algorithm and education intervention for managing uncontrolled hyperglycemia in ED type 2 diabetes patients otherwise stable for discharge home. The intervention was developed by a collaborative multidisciplinary team representing ED physicians and nurses, an endocrinologist, and diabetes educators. Funding was provided by the District of Columbia Department of Health, Community Health Administration Preventive Health Block Grant Program. The research protocol and informed and HIPAA consents were reviewed and approved by the MedStar Health Research Institute Institutional Review Board. The intervention was initiated in the ED of a large, urban tertiary care hospital. Subsequent visits occurred in an ambulatory care clinic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721713484593">
<title>Sample and setting</title>
<p>The criteria for inclusion were age ≥ 18 years with known or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes; random BG ≥ 200 mg/dL; willing and able to provide informed consent and participate in DSME; and otherwise stable for discharge from the ED. Patients presenting with type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar nonketotic state were excluded. The patients were recruited from the ED of a large urban tertiary care teaching hospital in Washington, DC, which accrues over 14 000 visits annually for diabetes. It is located in the Ward with the highest prevalence of diabetes in DC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721713484593">
<title>Study Procedures</title>
<p>Screening and recruitment were conducted by the project team certified diabetes educator (CDE). All BGs performed in the ED in the hospital’s Amalga (Microsoft) ED data integrator were reviewed. Upon determination that a potential participant would likely be discharged from the ED to the outpatient setting, the attending ED physician directed the project team to approach the patient to invite them to join the study. Informed consent was then obtained.</p>
<p>Baseline visit 1 was conducted in the ED by a CDE. Hydration and insulin therapy were provided per the STEP-DC ED correction dose insulin algorithm, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713484593">Table 1</xref>, which was developed by the study team. The discharge antihyperglycemic medication regimen was prescribed by the ED attending physician per the STEP-DC guidelines for ED hyperglycemia discharge management which utilized metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713484593">Table 2</xref>. The guidelines shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713484593">Table 2</xref> were developed by the hospital’s diabetes team endocrinologists in collaboration with ED staff attending physicians. The oral agents Metformin and sulfonylureas were selected for inclusion in the algorithm due to their lower cost, universal availability, long-term safety data profile, and an expressed preference from the ED physicians that the algorithm be relatively simple. Medications for each patient were selected or titrated based on the ED admission BG level and the prior DM medication regimen, if any. Therapy with basal insulin (glargine or detemir) at a dose of 0.2 units/kg/day was initiated for BG ≥ 300 mg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484593">8</xref></sup> Survival skills DSME based on current Joint Commission Inpatient Diabetes Certification program specifications was initiated in the ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713484593">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Fingerstick BG results from the patients’ BG monitoring device were reviewed and discussed at each visit. Self-reported blood sugar readings of 60 mg/dl or less and /or symptoms of hypoglycemia were recorded in a hypoglycemia log in the patient’s chart with the specific date, time and conditions related to each incident. This was done at each site visit and/or if the patient called interim to visits to report an episode of hypoglycemia. Medications were adjusted by the CDE per the algorithm at visits 2 to 4, as needed, under the supervision of an endocrinologist. At each visit, patients were queried by the CDE about self-reported medication adherence and interim ED visits, and fingerstick BG was measured. A1C was tested at baseline and at 2 weeks using a Bayer A1C-NOW+ device. The individual treatment plan was communicated at the conclusion of each visit by the CDE to the designated primary care provider (PCP) by fax or telephone. Navigation to a PCP was provided if needed using the hospital’s physician referral line.</p>

<sec id="section10-0145721713484593">
<title>Methods of Measurement</title>
<p>ED BGs were measured using the Abbott i-STAT system. Ambulatory clinic and self-BGs were obtained using the Bayer Contour™ glucometer. Fingerstick A1C testing was performed by trained study staff using the Bayer A1C-Now+™ test device, which has an A1C upper limit of 13%. This assay is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified and CLIA waived.</p>

<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>The primary aim of this pilot study was to establish the safety of the STEP-DC program type 2 diabetes Guidelines for Emergency Department Hyperglycemia Discharge Management, shown on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713484593">Table 2</xref>. The primary outcome measure was day 1 hypoglycemia (BG ≤ 60 mg/dL). Secondary outcome measures included overall hypoglycemia rates, occurrence of severe hypoglycemia (BG ≤ 40 mg/dL or requiring assistance to treat) changes in BG and A1C from baseline, medication adherence, effectiveness of navigation to PCP care, and reduction in self-reported ED visits for uncontrolled diabetes. ED visits during the study period were compared to the patient self-reported ED visits that had taken place in the 6 months preceding enrollment in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721713484593">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The choice of an 86-person sample size for this prospective pilot study was related primarily to duration and amount of funding available and to study team staffing constraints. Ninety-two patients were approached for participation in this study, and of these 86 consented to participate. The data points (hypoglycemia, mean BG, baseline and postintervention A1C) were selected to demonstrate safety and to provide data to power a subsequent randomized controlled study. The postintervention A1C was obtained at 2 weeks rather than at 4 weeks as participants were given the option of conducting the week 4 visit over the phone to limit their travel to the clinic if such travel was inconvenient for them.</p>
<p>At each time point, quantitative measurements were summarized using means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequency and percentages for categorical variables. Changes between each of the time points were calculated and summarized. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar test were performed to determine if there were significant changes from the baseline to postintervention visit for continuous variables with normal distribution, continuous variables with high skewed distribution, and categorical variables, respectively. Observations with missing data were removed from the comparison analysis models.</p>

<p>Seventeen patients reported ED visits for uncontrolled BG in the 6 months prior to the baseline visit. Of these 17 patients, 9 completed the 4 week intervention and only 1 of the completers reported an ED return visit for uncontrolled BG in the 6 months postintervention. The sample size for this subanalysis was too small to achieve statistical significance.</p>
<p>Other findings were as follows. Of the 86 subjects, almost 30% had no prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 71% had never had DSME. Reasons for the ED acute care visit were stated to be unable to get provider appointment (41.7%); sent by PCP to the ED (10.4%); no insurance (12.4%); ran out of diabetes medications (4.2%). Self-reported adherence to sulfonylurea, metformin, or basal insulin during the study period was over 90%. By study end, 40% of subjects had either seen or were scheduled to see a PCP.</p>
<p>Examination of retention rates following the initial ED visit revealed that 81% of subjects returned for the 12- to 72-hour, 67% for the 2-week, and 60% for the 4-week visits. Patients who did not return for the first follow-up visit at 12 to 72 hours following ED discharge had often provided the ED and the project team with a nonworking telephone contact number.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are only a small number of reports on specific therapeutic strategies for addressing hyperglycemia management in the ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713484593">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713484593"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713484593">12</xref></sup> This intervention delivered ADA/EASD guideline-based medication management, survival skills DSME, and health system navigation. Improvement in glycemic control was safely achieved in a small cohort of African American subjects presenting to an urban hospital ED. We have demonstrated the feasibility of conducting this intervention in the ED. Our results support the safety of the medication algorithm tested. Evidence supporting the safety of starting ED patients with a BG ≥ 300 mg/dl on 0.2 units/kg/day of basal insulin, was demonstrated by the absence of hypoglycemia with BG ≤ 60 mg/dl in the first 12 to 72 hours following basal insulin initiation in the ED. We have also demonstrated the general feasibility of engaging ED staff and patients with type 2 diabetes in a concise targeted intervention initiated in the ED setting and delivered over 4 weeks following ED discharge to enable significant improvement in glycemic control over this relatively short period.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia risk had been identified by the ED physicians as a significant barrier to initiation of insulin therapy during the study design period. The STEP-DC guidelines for ED hyperglycemia discharge management (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713484593">Table 2</xref>) suggest initiation of basal insulin therapy for patients with severe hyperglycemia, defined as random BG &gt; 300 mg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484593">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were no episodes of hypoglycemia reported in the first 24 hours following initiation of insulin-providing therapy (insulin or sulfonylureas) in the ED in the 80% of subjects who returned for the 12- to 72-hour first follow-up visit. Initiating insulin therapy with once daily basal insulin at 0.2 units/kg/day appeared to be safe, as reflected by low hypoglycemia rates obtained by fingerstick self-BG testing or self-reported hypoglycemia symptoms. In fact, during the second visit at 12 to 72 hours following ED discharge, many patients required a further increase in insulin dose. As total daily insulin requirements in type 2 diabetes approach or even exceed 1 unit/kg/day, the necessity of further increase in basal insulin dose and low hypoglycemia rates were not unexpected, given the high presenting BG levels and the conservative weight-based insulin doses prescribed. The overall 1.3% hypoglycemia rate over the 4-week study was reassuring.</p>
<p>Hyperglycemia was significantly reduced, with BG at the 4 week visit being close to 180 mg/dL postactive intervention. This BG level is consistent with ADA recommendations for peak capillary BG for nonpregnant adults with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484593">7</xref></sup> The 3 post-ED visits over 1 month allowed rapid titration of medications and ongoing DSME, thereby enabling timely improvement in BG control and overcoming clinical inertia in medication titration.</p>
<p>Modest improvement in A1C was also observed. As the upper limit of the A1C-Now+™ test device is 13%, and fully 50% of subjects had A1C readings at this level, the ability to interpret this finding was limited. From a practical perspective, A1C levels did help guide therapy. Where lesser degrees of hyperglycemia or no prior diagnosis of diabetes were present, A1C results were used to help confirm a diagnosis of diabetes or to guide decisions regarding medication selection.</p>
<p>The sample size was too small to reach statistical significance or to show a clear trend in return visits to the ED by subjects who completed all study visits.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of this pilot, a randomized controlled trial will be the appropriate next step in utilizing the STEP-DC program.</p>
<sec id="section15-0145721713484593">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The ability to generalize the results of this study is limited by the small sample size and by the lack of randomized controls, both of which were inherent in the design of this pilot study. Relative to our model for integrating care between the ED and primary care settings, several concerns are apparent. For example, not all subjects completed the intervention, and while a relatively high proportion returned for 3 or 4 visits, barriers to returning need to be investigated and addressed.</p>
<p>In addition, there are no data on hypoglycemia occurrences for patients who were lost to follow-up. The CDE or endocrinologist made every effort to contact each patient. However, some were unreachable. There is the possibility that some of the patients who were lost to follow-up may have had hypoglycemia, contributing to not following up with the project team. Assessment of reasons for low rates of scheduling follow-up provider visits will be helpful in the future. As this was a pilot study, the sample size was too small to perform any sensitivity data analysis for ED return visit rates.</p>
<p>In considering the possibility of replicating this approach in other hospital EDs, another limitation may be the cost of the intervention. Labor cost of providing the complete 4-week intervention was approximately $350 per patient. This figure does not include the cost of the materials provided to the patients, that is, glucometers, strips, insulin pens, and the cost of the A1C Now™ kits. However, since 87.6% of participants had insurance, the costs of the meters, strips and insulin pens were largely covered. Nonetheless, while the costs associated with this intervention are not insignificant, they are still much lower than the average cost of an ED visit due to uncontrolled diabetes estimated at $677.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713484593">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, this concise, prospective pilot intervention for hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes presenting to the ED provided preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy. We have also demonstrated proof of concept for the feasibility of initiating a multi-disciplinary intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled hyperglycemia, with ED providers and a diabetes team successfully engaging patients in a busy ED setting. Low hypoglycemia rates following initiation and/or titration of insulin-providing therapy in the ED and discharge to the outpatient setting, as well as improved glycemic outcomes during the intervention follow-up period were observed. An integrated care model utilizing a medication algorithm, survival skills education, and health system navigation led to improvement in BG control and a trend for reduction in ED revisits for uncontrolled diabetes. The methods used by the study team were shown to be feasible and safe, and we have demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy as measured by improvement in glycemic control within the small sample of patients enrolled. The next step, based on both the findings and the limitations of this pilot study, will be a randomized controlled trial to further examine the potential for the STEP-DC intervention to affect outcomes.</p>
