<p>
<italic>The Reformation of the English Parish Church</italic> is a captivating study of the material culture of Reformation-era Christianity in England. In two parts (and fourteen chapters), the book engages with the question vexing all historians of the Reformation period – what changes did the Reformation of religion bring to the people in the pews? In examining objects ranging from altars and fonts to the pews themselves, Whiting emphasizes the degree to which the items Christians encountered in the practice of their faith could influence or be influenced by larger theological transformations.</p>
<p>Part one of the book investigates the objects associated with sacramental life – the engine of early modern Christianity. Objects like cups and/or rood screens are followed through their Reformation-era life spans. They are shown to be sacred objects within the pre-Reformation context, as they played key roles in the upkeep of sacraments and took on a devotional quality that reflected local values and peculiarities. With the onset of the Reformation, screens might be defaced or destroyed, while cups might have the nature of their uses altered to reflect the new belief systems that required communion of both bread and wine. The ebbs and flows of the objects’ uses reflected the nature of the English Reformation, where the restoration of Catholicism was a consistent fear and an occasional reality. Most of Whiting’s approach to the English Reformation in the parish operates ‘beyond the book,’ which is highly valuable as so much of Christianity in this period was tied up in sacred objects and ceremonies, which are not always a focus for historians.</p>
<p>Part two of the book focuses on objects not directly associated with the sacraments, but instead those that conveyed meaning through their communication of religious ideas, like paintings, memorials, or organs and bells. Of particular strength is chapter twelve, with its discussion of pulpits and seats in English parishes. Whiting shows that the Protestant focus on preaching prioritized the pulpit in England as it did throughout Europe. Carvings and inscriptions reflected this reality as well as the associations of the church with the crown, as Tudor roses carved into pews, and inscriptions on pulpits such as “God save King James,” exemplified. Again, this research reflects the church as it was experienced by the average parishioners and does well to reflect the dynamic complexities of religious life in early modern England. The book also includes eight useful appendices, which include tables that provide statistical quantification that complements the book’s findings nicely, and would be useful for future excursions into this topic by other historians.</p>
<p>The high quality of this book is directly connected to the level of detail it provides in charting the changes religious objects endured in their transformation from Catholic to Protestant forms. Whiting presents his work in a consistent formula throughout the book’s fourteen chapters, as he notes the traditional use of these objects, their changes under Henry VIII, a brief revival of Catholic uses under Mary I, and finally their eventual role in an unequivocally Protestant English Church. The formulaic presentation is useful at first, but after fourteen chapters on fourteen types of objects it becomes somewhat predictable and unexciting, even if the material remains highly interesting. These are minor quibbles, however, and should not distract from the valuable research that forms the basis of this book.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Reformation of the English Parish Church</italic> provides an excellent analysis of Christianity as it was encountered by believers in this period. Average Christians consistently asserted their local authority as they were simultaneously exposed to the religious and political negotiations of national and international Christian forces. Whiting has shown these negotiations to be reflected in the objects that people touched and gazed upon and in the music or sermons they listened to. Historians or others interested in the holistic experience of religious belief – in the Reformation or any period – should read this book.</p>
