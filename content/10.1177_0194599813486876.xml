<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To investigate the correlation between the percentage of metastatic tumor present in lymph nodes resected from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and level of expression of 3 marker genes: pemphigus vulgaris antigen (PVA), parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP), and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 1 (TACSTD1). In addition, we investigated whether the level of expression of these 3 markers was associated with clinical outcomes for patients with HNSCC.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599813486876">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>A total of 448 lymph nodes from 92 patients with HNSCC were evaluated for expression of the gene markers PVA, PTHrP, and TACSTD1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Confirmation of metastasis was determined by histologic examination. The expression level of these markers versus tumor percentage was analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813486876">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All 3 markers were studied independently and were associated with tumor percentage in metastatic lymph nodes. PVA had the strongest correlation, followed by PTHrP and then TACSTD1. PVA levels had a trend toward association with clinical outcome, specifically time to death caused by cancer, but this was confounded by tumor stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599813486876">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>All 3 tumor gene markers were associated with percentage of tumor cells in metastatic lymph nodes. PVA had the strongest correlation. PVA may add prognostic utility beyond pathologic staging, but this requires analysis of a larger cohort. Prospective studies of tumor volume in metastatic nodes should determine a lower limit threshold of molecular marker detection.</p>

<p>For patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), regional lymph node involvement is arguably the most important prognostic factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813486876">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813486876">2</xref></sup> Studies have shown that patient survival correlates strongly with nodal staging of the tumor at the time of presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486876">3</xref></sup> Despite this, up to 40% of patients with node-negative (N0) malignancies will develop recurrent disease and distant metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813486876">4</xref></sup> This evidence supports the existence of micrometastases within these N0 lymph nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486876">5</xref></sup> Micrometastases are tumor metastases smaller than 2.0 mm, which enables them to evade detection by standard diagnostic procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486876">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486876">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is hope that with the discovery of molecular markers of metastatic disease and highly automated, real-time, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), there may be a novel way to detect micrometastasis within an intraoperative time frame, without sacrificing accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486876">8</xref></sup> We have investigated molecular markers of positive disease within lymph nodes. From a panel of 40 highly expressed gene markers of HNSCC, pemphigus vulgaris (PVA), parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP), and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 1 (TACSTD1) are 3 gene markers that proved to have the highest sensitivity and specificity to distinguish positive and benign lymph nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813486876">9</xref></sup> The study assembled a cohort of 448 lymph nodes from 92 patients who underwent routine elective neck dissection (END) for HNSCC. The lymph nodes were sectioned, and alternate sections were sent for either pathological assessment as per the gold standard or qRT-PCR for the 3 gene markers. The results of both were then compared to assess the diagnostic properties of qRT-PCR for the 3 gene markers based on the pathologic gold standard at detection of tumor cells within the lymph nodes. All 3 gene markers had a specificity of 98% to 99%. PVA was shown to have the highest sensitivity (92%) compared with the pathologic gold standard followed by TACSTD (70%) and then PTHrP (60%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813486876">10</xref></sup> We previously extended these studies to develop a completely automated multiplex qRT-PCR assay to detect lymph node metastases in HNSCC with a level of conformity to the current pathologic gold standard.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated whether the level or amount of expression of each of these 3 tumor markers would correlate with the amount or percentage of tumor present within the lymph node and with clinical outcome. This information would enable us to determine whether the level of expression of these markers could provide us with information about the burden of disease of each individual patient, such as might permit outpatient molecular analysis of cytologic specimens.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0194599813486876">
<title>Patient and Lymph Node Selection</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients assembled from the previous study. The University of Pittsburgh institutional review board (UPCI 99-069) approved the entire collection, storage, and subsequent analysis of the tissue samples. Informed consent was obtained from all patients who donated samples. All cervical lymph nodes were collected from 92 patients, a total of 448 grossly negative lymph nodes.</p>
<p>The lymph nodes were sectioned in alternating 1-mm sections; half of the sections were used for pathologic diagnosis, and the other half were used in the original study. For the present analysis, we looked at the slides that had been set aside for pathologic diagnosis and designated for research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813486876">
<title>Histological Analysis</title>
<p>The slides had previously been analyzed for the original study. Histologic analysis by 2 pathologists was performed at 3 separate occasions for each lymph node. All of these data were amalgamated to form an overall “consensus pathology” reading. For our study, we used this consensus pathology result to classify the lymph nodes as either positive or negative for metastatic tumor.</p>
<p>To determine tumor percentage, 2 slides from each of the lymph nodes were examined by a head and neck pathologist. To avoid bias, the pathologist was blinded to the previous consensus pathology results as the slides were read. Tumor percentage reading denotes an estimate of the percentage of cells within the slide that microscopically appeared to be tumor cells; it is not routinely undertaken during pathological evaluation of lymph nodes. We chose to include this in our study as it is believed to approximate the amount of tumor within the particular section of lymph node.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599813486876">
<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>The results for the level of expression for each of our genes were derived from the qRT-PCR performed during the previous study, with methods published previously.8,9 Briefly, serial sections were cut from each optimal cutting temperature-embedded lymph node. Sections were placed in chaotropic lysis buffer for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using the Stratagene RNA isolation mini-kit. Reverse transcription reactions were completed with random hexamer priming and SuperScript II. All qRT-PCR was performed on the Stratagene MX3000P qPCR system. Relative expression of the 3 marker genes was calculated using the ΔCT method. B-glucuronidase was used as the endogenous control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813486876">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Patterns of association between percentage tumor and marker expression by qRT-PCR were investigated by fitting a linear regression model based on a 3 degree-of-freedom–restricted cubic spline. To explore the diagnostic potential of individual markers with qRT-PCR, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using all individual lymph nodes, and the cutoff value of each marker that produced the highest overall classification accuracy was selected. The diagnostic parameters sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy were calculated for each cutoff. In addition, the area under the ROC curve was estimated. The Spearman correlation coefficient was also calculated. For the study of association between lymph node markers and oncologic outcome, we estimated 2 outcome variables: disease-free survival (DFS), defined as time to recurrence or death due to cancer, and disease-specific survival (DSS), defined as time to death from cancer. For both of these endpoints, patients who died of other causes were censored on their day of death. The effects of individual makers, percentage tumor, (T) stage, and node (N) stage were calculated with proportional hazards regression. Patient-level lymph node expression levels were computed 2 ways: by taking the maximum expression value among all nodes for a patient and by computing an empirical Bayes estimate of the average lymph node expression. The empirical Bayes estimate shrinks the patient average toward the grand mean, with the amount of shrinkage proportional to the variance of the patient average. Variables with sufficient correlation as a univariate measure were included as components of a joint multivariate proportional hazards regression model. The adequacy of the proportional hazards assumptions was verified with Schoenfeld residuals. To rule out undue influence of death due to other causes as a competing risk, cumulative incidence curves were constructed, and Grey’s test was applied to measure the influence of covariates upon cumulative incidence.</p>

<title>Pathologic Analysis</title>
<p>A total of 430 lymph nodes were included in our analysis. Nodes that had been classified as isolated tumor cells were omitted from the analysis. Three hundred seventy-one slides were confirmed negative for tumor, and 51 slides were confirmed positive by both the consensus pathology results and percentage tumor readings of 2 slides from each lymph node. There were 4 nodes that had been classified as negative under consensus pathology, but histological examination of tumor percentage showed tumor cells in at least 1 of the 2 sections examined. Eight nodes that had been classified as positive for tumor by the consensus pathology results were found to have no tumor cells in either of the 2 sections examined. One explanation for this is that the slides that were used to estimate the percentage tumor were different from the slides used in the analysis for consensus pathology.</p>

The variables within our study (percentage tumor and the 3 gene expression markers) are listed along the central diagonal from top left to bottom right. The intersection of each column and row represents the scatter plot of the respective variable, with the column variable along the x-axis and row variable along the y-axis. Pathologically positive nodes (more than 0% tumor) are indicated by crosses and benign nodes (0% tumor) by circles. Within each scatter plot, data points representing the benign nodes are tightly clustered, and points representing the positive nodes are more widely spread, representing the variation in the percentage of tumor within the positive nodes. The scatter plots show a positive correlation between the level of gene expression of each of the 3 genes and the percentage of tumor present in positive lymph nodes. There also appears to be a positive relationship between the level of expression of all of the 3 genes, the strongest of which appears to be PVA and TACSTD1.</p>

The upper, dashed line of correlation of the scatter plot of PVA and percentage tumor appears flat at first and then starts to show a positive linear correlation following the line at PVA expressions levels greater than −1.

<p>In addition to maximum expression of PTHrP and PVA, percentage tumor, T stage, and N stage were also modestly associated with DSS. We next conducted multivariate proportional hazards regression for DSS using maximum PTHpR, maximum PVA, T stage, N stage, and percentage tumor. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813486876"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>, after simultaneous covariate adjustment, only T stage remained significant; specifically, the risk of DSS increases by a factor of 8.5 for state T4 versus T1 (<italic>P</italic> = .0070). We conclude that lymph node markers PTHrP, PVA, and percentage tumor are not independently associated with DSS but rather were confounded by T stage.</p>

<title>Given T Stage, the Role of Tumor Gene Markers as Predictors of DSS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813486876"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref> shows 2 Kaplan-Meier survivor function plots. Here, max nodal PVA expression was divided into 3 groups: high, middle, and low. The plot on the left was not adjusted for T stage. The probability of survival to 60 months postsurgery is 80% with middle, 75% with low, and 40% with high nodal PVA expression. This result is statistically significant with a <italic>P</italic> value of .0079. Once this was adjusted for T stage, as in the plot on the right, the results were no longer statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .12) but suggest a trend association may exist. However, the significance of this trend is unclear as the sample size is too small. A greater sample size is needed to improve the statistical power of this analysis.</p>

<p>Max nodal PVA expression is divided into high, middle, and low levels of expression. The probability of survival appears to correlate with middle and low levels of PVA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813486876"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref> not adjusted for T stage is statistically significant, <italic>P</italic> = .0079). However, once this has been adjusted for T stage, the result is no longer statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .12) but suggests a trend association may exist.</p>
<p>This indicates that level of expression of PVA is only marginally more effective than T stage at determining DSS. Hence, once the T stage of a patient’s disease is known, the level of expression of PVA provides little additional predictive power of clinical outcome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With the advent of molecular markers of lymph node disease and the development of rapid and precise molecular techniques, there is hope for developing improved tools for identifying and treating lymph node metastases in HNSCC.</p>
<p>As shown in previous studies, PTHrP, TACSTD1, and PVA are molecular tumor markers that can be used in conjunction with qRT-PCR to predict nodal metastases in HNSCC accurately. A cartridge-based assay has been developed so that rapid qRT-PCR can now be applied to the intraoperative time frame; it may be possible to know the nodal status of the patient during the procedure to remove the primary tumor, resulting in reduced morbidity associated with END.</p>
<p>Nodal disease status plays a crucial role in the prognosis of HNSCC; as well as the number of positive nodes, the size of the metastases within the node is a pertinent factor in staging of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813486876">11</xref></sup> Although PTHrP, TACSTD1, and PVA are highly sensitive and specific markers for lymph node metastases, we investigated whether the level of these markers correlates with the amount of disease present within the nodes. Our results show that there is a moderately strong, and statistically significant, correlation between the level of expression of all of these markers and the percentage of tumor within each lymph node. PVA has the strongest correlation with tumor percentage. We can use the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value as an approximate measure of how much variation in percentage tumor can be explained by the level of expression of PVA independently. The square of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for PVA against percentage tumor (0.52) provides a similar interpretation to the standard <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value. The outcome of this calculation is 0.27, or 27%. This indicates that almost 27% of the variability in the percentage of tumor within a lymph node can be explained by the variability in the expression levels of a single tumor marker, PVA.</p>
<p>One reason for these correlations appears to be the cluster of lymph nodes with none to low tumor percentages. This correlation could be greatly influenced by the large ratio of benign to malignant nodes, 375 to 55.</p>
<p>We have attempted to explore the clinical significance of these gene markers in HNSCC. While both PVA and PTHrP are associated with DSS, a multivariate analysis revealed that their association was not independent of T stage. The apparent association between lymph node markers and DSS was confounded by the correlation between lymph node markers and T and N stage, which are themselves highly prognostic. Thus, the expression of the molecular markers, while relevant for diagnostic accuracy, do not improve outcome prognosis when patients are staged by surgical pathology.</p>
<p>An area of future interest would be to expand our analysis of the extent to which qRT-PCR levels for these 3 gene markers alone or taken together compare with the current gold standard (pathology and/or cytology) in correctly identifying disease status and clinical outcomes. This would offer valuable information regarding the practical applicability of this technique and may enable us to improve our standards for detection of metastases, including possibility of molecular analysis of cytologic speciemens obtained from suspicious nodes subjected to surgical excision.</p>
