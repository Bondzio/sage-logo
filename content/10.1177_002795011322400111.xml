<p>Global growth projections for 2013–14 are unchanged, overall, from three months ago, with some upward revisions, most notably for Japan, offset by some downward revisions, including for the group of non-OECD countries. With world output growth again projected at 3.3 per cent in 2013 and 3.7 per cent in 2014, the forecast again points to a global recovery that is hesitant, below par, and uneven.</p>
<p>This outlook reflects, especially in the advanced economies, weak demand resulting from several factors, especially continuing fiscal consolidation and deleveraging by private sectors, impaired credit intermediation in many cases, and significant policy uncertainties. Of most concern is the continuing slump in the Euro Area, which is expected to remain in recession in 2013 and seems unlikely, on current policies, to experience better than weak growth next year. In the United States, private sector demand has continued to be strengthened by a substantial improvement in the financial positions of banks and households, but this is being partly offset by accelerated fiscal adjustment. Our growth projections for Japan have been raised to 2 per cent per annum in 2013–14 to take account of the announcement of significant fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. But the main drivers of global growth remain the developing and emerging market economies, especially in Asia; prospects seem good for a broad strengthening of growth in these economies this year and next, following the moderate slowdown experienced in 2012.</p>

<p>Our global projections are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011322400111">table 1</xref>. The methodological approach to the forecast and key underlying assumptions are discussed in Appendix A, while detailed projections for 40 countries are reported in Appendix B at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>The growth of world trade in goods and services in 2012, at 2.8 per cent, fell below the growth of world output; and the World Trade Organization's estimates indicate that world merchandise trade last year grew by only 2.0 per cent, the second lowest annual growth rate in 32 years of comparable data. We project only a moderate recovery in trade growth in 2013–14. The recent weak growth of trade, a vital engine of global growth, points to the importance of resisting protectionist pressures and reviving negotiations on multilateral trade liberalisation. Crafts (2013) in this <italic>Review</italic> emphasises the importance of avoiding policy mistakes that were made <italic>in the inter-war period</italic>, when a steep rise in protection contributed to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>In the advanced economies, output and employment gaps generally remain wide. In the Euro Area, unemployment reached a new peak of 12 per cent in February, while in the United States continued moderate declines in unemployment – to 7.6 per cent in March – have been partly due to reduced labour-force participation. The employment situation in emerging market and developing countries is more mixed, with indications of capacity constraints in some cases. These countries, nevertheless, account for three-quarters of the increase of about 4 million in global unemployment in 2012, to a total of about 197 million.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Inflation and inflation expectations globally remain generally subdued, helped by a stabilisation of commodity prices over the past two years; the expansionary monetary policies in operation in many countries seem to have had no significant inflationary effects. Consumer price inflation in the advanced economies is projected to remain around 1.8 per cent annually in 2013–14 – in most cases, close to or below central banks’ targets – with continuing declines elsewhere lowering the global average towards 3–3% per cent a year from 4.2 per cent in 2012.</p>
<p>The improvement in financial markets that began in late 2012 has been broadly maintained, with government bond yields in the major advanced economies remaining near historic lows and significant gains in major equity markets, with some stock markets reaching all-time peaks in early April. Neither the financial crisis in Cyprus in March nor the continuing failure to reach a political agreement on the federal budget in the United States appears to have had a significant impact on major markets. In emerging markets, risk spreads on sovereign and corporate bonds have narrowed with rising capital inflows. These favourable conditions in financial markets may augur well for the global economy, but they may also be vulnerable to disappointments about policies as well as economic and financial developments. The financial market assumptions underlying the forecast are discussed in Appendix A. The possibility of a partial reversal of the recent improvement in markets poses a clear downside risk to the outlook.</p>
<p>A major factor underlying improved financial market conditions is the stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies, which has not only kept short-term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for more than four years, but also worked through unconventional measures, including official operations in government bond markets and other asset markets, to reduce yields on longer-term and, in some cases, riskier assets. These policies have brought essential benefits in supporting demand and activity, but they also carry greater risks the longer they are in place. Thus, while reducing banking sector vulnerabilities in the short term, they may over time be delaying the repair of banks’ balance sheets by encouraging the rolling over of nonperforming loans. They may also, more broadly, encourage risk-taking, leverage, and asset bubbles. Thus in the United States, there has recently been a significant increase in the issuance of high-yield corporate bonds, unusual for such an early stage in a cyclical upswing.<sup>2</sup> Moreover, the eventual (or anticipated) unwinding of easy monetary conditions, and associated reversals in bond markets, could expose financial vulnerabilities among companies and households facing higher long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>Easy monetary policies in the advanced economies are also having international spillovers, especially in the form of capital flows to emerging market and developing economies. Concerns have arisen about the danger that associated upward pressures on these countries’ currency values can lead either to currency appreciation and associated unwarranted losses of international competitiveness, or to excessive domestic credit growth if the currency pressure is resisted through official intervention in the foreign exchange market or easier domestic monetary conditions. In China, for example, recent months have seen both increased concerns about domestic credit growth and a resumption of large-scale accumulation of foreign exchange reserves to absorb exchange market pressure. There has even been talk of ‘currency wars’. To some extent, the recovery of capital flows to emerging markets is a natural process reflecting their relatively strong growth performance and prospects, and in some cases appreciation of their currencies is a desirable part of the global rebalancing that is needed. Also, while easy monetary policies in the advanced economies may indeed put additional upward pressure on emerging market economies’ currencies, sight should not be lost of the beneficial spillovers of the improved growth in demand in the advanced economies that their monetary expansion engenders. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, in a recent speech in London, noted that the Fed's models suggest that these effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies.<sup>3</sup> The National Institute's model, NiGEM, indicates that the benefits tend to outweigh the costs, at least beyond the short term (see Box A for further discussion). Thus the effects of exchange rate changes brought about in association with monetary expansion in some countries are not to be viewed as akin to ‘beggar-thy-neighbour’ exchange rate policies that do not involve demand expansion.</p>

<title>Box A. Impact of loose monetary policy in advanced economies on emerging markets</title>
<p><bold><italic>by Dawn Holland</italic></bold></p>
<p>A loosening of the monetary policy stance at home generally causes a depreciation of the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets, whether under the assumption of uncovered interest parity or in more general portfolio balance models. A depreciation of the domestic currency, in turn, necessarily implies an appreciation of foreign currencies. The recent ultra-loose monetary stance in the advanced economies has raised concerns in emerging markets about its effects on their competitiveness and capital inflows, leading to talk of currency wars. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has noted that the Federal Reserve's models suggest that the effects of upward pressure on emerging market economies’ currencies are largely offset by the improved growth in demand in the advanced economies that results from the looser monetary stance. While this may be true for some countries, the emerging market economies are a heterogeneous group, and the effects in individual economies may differ.</p>
<p>In this box we use the National Institute's model, NiGEM, to assess the expected impact of a loose monetary stance in the advanced economies on the major emerging market economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil. The impact on their respective GDPs in the first year of a temporary monetary loosening in the US, Japan, Euro Area and UK, depends to a large extent on the sensitivity of domestic demand to export revenue. Export volumes from each of the emerging market economies would be expected to rise in response to the shock, as the estimated rise in external demand of 1–1½ per cent would tend to offset any loss of competitiveness. The emerging market economies tend to be global price takers, rather than price setters, and their relative export prices would be expected to rise by less than 1 per cent in response to a 4–6 per cent appreciation of the exchange rate. However, nominal export values would be expected to fall once the revenue from exports is converted into domestic currency at the higher rate of exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-002795011322400111">figure A1</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Impact on export volumes and values from monetary expansion in the US, UK, Euro Area and Japan</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011322400111-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Based on historical behaviour, the estimated relationships underlying the NiGEM model suggest that domestic demand in Russia and India is more sensitive to export revenue than domestic demand in China or Brazil. As a result, the model projects a small negative impact on GDP growth in Russia and India in the first year following a monetary expansion in the advanced economies. This negative effect dissipates by the second year. A positive impact on GDP growth is expected in Brazil and China.</p>
<p>In the case of China, the stronger positive impact on GDP projected by NiGEM is partly a reflection of the exchange rate regime, which fluctuates within a relatively narrow band of 1 per cent against a targeted value relative to the US$. As a result, monetary stimulus in the US is effectively a monetary stimulus in China as well. This is one factor behind the rising inflationary pressures observed in China recently, as the average impacts on GDP growth and inflation are likely to be matched roughly 1 for 1 in the first three years.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, emerging market countries need to be alert to the risks associated with increased capital inflows, including not only possibly excessive currency appreciation and domestic credit growth but also rising external debt and foreign currency exposure. The appropriate policy response will depend on the circumstances, and may or may not involve intervention in the foreign exchange market, adjustments of the stance and mix of macroeconomic policies, the use of macroprudential instruments, and capital controls. These economies will also need to ensure that they have sound defences against capital flow reversals, including appropriate macroprudential policies, and sound banking regulation and supervision.</p>
<p>In the context of talk of ‘currency wars’, weak trade growth, dormant multilateral trade talks, and pervasive protectionist pressures, it was appropriate and encouraging that G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors have agreed, as noted in their February and April 2013 Communiqués, that ‘Monetary policy should be directed toward domestic price stability and continuing to support economic recovery’, that they would ‘refrain from competitive devaluation’, ‘not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes …’, and ‘be mindful of unintended negative effects stemming from extended periods of monetary easing’; and also that they agreed to ‘resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open’.</p>
<p>With the global economy now in its fifth year of working its way out of the largest financial crisis for several decades, prospects for the medium term are unusually uncertain. In many cases, progress with fiscal consolidation, private sector deleveraging, and the repair of financial sectors has far to go; all these factors form constraints on growth that may remain for several more years. In some advanced economies, major questions have arisen about the true size of output gaps, possible structural shifts in the sensitivity of inflation to output and employment gaps, and trend rates of productivity growth. In the Euro Area, there are major uncertainties about feasible progress towards completion of the economic and monetary union – particularly through the establishment of a banking union and fiscal union – and about progress with adjustment toward sustainable external and internal balances, including reasonably high levels of employment in the weakest economies. In addition, there are uncertainties surrounding the inevitable slowing of trend growth in the economies that in recent years have been the most dynamic, especially China.</p>
<p>Our medium-term projections for 2015–19 reflect particular assumptions about both demand-side policies and supply conditions. On the demand side, fiscal consolidation is expected to continue through the period in many of the major economies, given debt levels close to or above 100 per cent of GDP. Our assumptions about supply conditions relate to productivity growth, demographic developments, labour market participation, and factors driving the capital–output ratio. In Box B, our medium-term projections for the major economies are decomposed into labour productivity growth and the underlying assumptions explaining labour input dynamics. We expect a slight slowing of global growth in 2015–19, to 4.2 per cent a year, as compared with 4.4 per cent in the pre-crisis period 2003–8. This is more than accounted for by a projected slowing of growth in non-OECD economies as their productivity levels converge further towards the advanced economies. Most notably, average growth in China in 2015–19 is projected at about 7 per cent a year, down from 11 per cent in 2003–8. The partly offsetting rise in medium-term growth in the OECD group of countries, to 2.6 per cent from 2.3 per cent a year, is mainly accounted for by faster growth in the United States, reflecting a gradual closing of the output gap and some recovery in labour force participation.</p>

<title>Box B. Decomposition of medium-term growth projections</title>
<p><bold><italic>by Dawn Holland and Miguel Sánchez-Martínez</italic></bold></p>
<p>Our medium-term projections reflect assumptions about both demand-side policies and supply conditions. On the demand side, fiscal consolidation is expected to persist throughout much of the next decade in many of the major economies, given debt levels in excess of 100 per cent of GDP. Supply conditions depend on our assumptions on productivity growth, demographic developments, labour market participation and factors driving the desired capital–output ratio. In this box we decompose our medium-term growth projections to 2019 into measures of the growth of labour productivity and labour input, to give some insight into the assumptions underlying these forecasts. We model trend productivity growth in NiGEM as a very gradual approach towards an expanding global technology frontier, with a significant degree of inertia, so that recent productivity trends have an important role in the short- to medium-term.</p>

<p>China has undergone a period of rapid catching up over the past two decades. GDP per working age person has increased at an average rate of close to 9 per cent per annum since 2001, much more rapidly than in any of the other BRIC economies, and indeed elsewhere in the world. While this is not too surprising given the distance from the technology frontier of the Chinese economy in the 1990s, if this pace of productivity growth were to persist, GDP per worker<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-002795011322400111">1</xref></sup> in China would be expected to exceed that in the US by 2021, making China the new global technology leader. This would seem very unlikely, and we have therefore assumed a moderation in productivity growth in China over the forecast period. Our medium-term forecast for China sees GDP growth of about 7 per cent per annum on average over 2015–19, which reflects this moderation in productivity growth as well as the demographic turning point in China related to the one-child policy introduced in 1979. By contrast, the IMF forecasts average annual growth in China over 2015–18 of 8.5 per cent, which would require a rate of productivity growth that would rapidly narrow the productivity gap between the US and China, which currently stands at 45–50 per cent.</p>
<p>Population growth in Brazil and India is also expected to moderate slightly over the forecast horizon, but not to the extent expected in China. Russia, on the other hand, has a demographic outlook more similar to some of its European neighbours, with population on a downward trajectory. Productivity growth in India is expected to remain high, but to ease gradually over the coming years as the economy converges towards the technology frontier. Productivity growth in Brazil has been comparatively weak since 2001, but has accelerated moderately since 2007, in stark contrast to developments in Russia. Our forecast assumes some convergence in GDP per capita growth rates across the BRIC economies, although we do not anticipate any rapid shifts away from recent historical patterns.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-002795011322400111">Figure B2</xref> disaggregates our forecast for GDP growth for 2013–19 in major advanced economies into the contributions from labour productivity and labour input, measured as total hours worked. Germany stands out as the only country where labour input is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. However, the weakness in growth of labour supply is expected to be partly offset by relatively strong growth in labour productivity. However, the latter will not be sufficient to allow average GDP growth of more than about 1.2 per cent per annum over our forecast period.</p>

<p>The US is expected to exhibit the highest growth in real output among the G-7 economies. This is underpinned by the combination of a growing working age population, anticipated declines in unemployment and steady advances in workers’ productivity levels, at rates similar to that expected in Germany. Labour productivity growth in Japan and the UK is expected to remain moderate, at about 1.4 and 1.2 per cent per annum, respectively, while in Italy labour productivity is forecast to grow by less than 1 per cent per annum on average, given its relatively flat profile since 2000. Productivity growth in France will also remain weaker than in the other major advanced economies, reflecting a slow recovery from the very weak productivity developments exhibited since 2007.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-002795011322400111">Figure B3</xref> delves more deeply into the factors underlying labour input developments in Germany, Italy and Japan. All three economies are expecting declines in the population of working age over the forecast horizon, with the most significant declines anticipated in Japan, reflecting an acceleration in a process that has been ongoing since 1997.</p>

<p>Labour input can be decomposed into contributions from demographic developments in the population of working age, labour force participation, unemployment and average hours of work per employee. According to this decomposition, the fall in total number of hours worked in Germany can be attributed almost entirely to the large reduction in the number of individuals potentially employable. The modest increment in labour input expected for Japan in the next few years relies on a significant recovery in average hours worked, reversing the downward trend that has been ongoing since the mid-1990s. Italy is expected to compensate for a predicted decline in its working age population of around 0.2 per cent per annum by, first, increasing labour force participation, from a relatively low level by European standards and, second, by fostering job creation for the unemployed, while maintaining average hours worked roughly constant.</p>
