<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal cord injury is often sudden, unexpected and brings with it extensive, life-changing consequences. Current literature investigating the combined physical, social and psychological impact following spinal cord injury is limited and the success of rehabilitation is often assessed in purely physical and functional terms. Recently however, researchers have proposed that successful rehabilitation should be addressed from a more comprehensive biopsychosocial approach which incorporates physical, social and psychological components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442669">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442669">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of clinical rehabilitative settings for spinal cord injury aim to optimize the patient’s potential to achieve previously held life goals and values. This overarching aspiration occurs in addition to regaining lost skills or obtaining new ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512442669">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512442669">4</xref></sup> One of the essential fundamental tenets of such goal setting theory is patient involvement in the rehabilitative process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512442669">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512442669">6</xref></sup> Positive investigations regarding patient involvement in goal setting have shown an increase in patient adherence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512442669">7</xref></sup> goal attainment and satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512442669">8</xref></sup> Further positive results have facilitated greater physical gains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512442669">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442669">10</xref></sup> and increased patient control in managing the consequences of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512442669">11</xref></sup> In the area of spinal cord injury research, such patient involvement is known to enhance and extend physical, social and psychological adjustments following discharge from the acute management setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512442669">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512442669"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512442669">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patient-focused goal planning practice has become a recognized and favoured approach within physical rehabilitation services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512442669">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512442669">15</xref></sup> However, there has been limited research examining the process and outcomes on the physical, social and psychological adjustment of spinal cord injury inpatients through qualitative and quantitative analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512442669">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current clinical audit constituted an evaluation of a multidisciplinary goal planning inpatient rehabilitation programme utilized within a specialist spinal injury unit setting. The research involved an evaluation of the extent to which the current programme has demonstrated shifts in physical, social and psychological functioning. The quantitative outcome measures were obtained at the commencement of inpatient rehabilitation and upon discharge from the rehabilitation setting. In addition, a qualitative assessment which addressed the satisfaction, perceptions and experiences of the spinal cord injury patients with respect to their individual inpatient-focused goal planning programme was conducted at the time of discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512442669" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The specialist spinal injury rehabilitation unit for this investigation provided acute and chronic rehabilitation and life-long care to individuals who have sustained spinal cord injury. It constituted 40 inpatient beds and since 1998, all patients who attended this specialist spinal unit have been provided with a multidisciplinary goal planning rehabilitation programme, based on the Stoke Mandeville Goal Planning model of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442669">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This goal planning model of care recommends a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the patient’s needs followed by implementation of a specific patient-focused goal planning programme. The comprehensive assessment of the patient’s physical, social and psychological adjustment to the spinal injury is achieved through the administration of the Needs Assessment Checklist (NAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442669">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512442669">17</xref></sup> at the commencement of rehabilitation. Based on this comprehensive needs assessment, personal patient-focused goals are then planned and constructed in small, practical and achievable steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512442669">18</xref></sup> The checklist is readministered upon discharge from the spinal injury unit.</p>
<p>On admission to the spinal injury unit each patient is allocated to a rehabilitation programme coordinator who is selected from a cohort of allied health professionals (e.g. nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, clinical psychologists, or specialist medical practitioners). The responsibility of the rehabilitation programme coordinator is to coordinate the goal planning meetings, facilitate the selection of specific and challenging goals and collate and document the planned and achieved goals between admission and discharge. This rehabilitative care is negotiated with the patient and/or their family and the healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Such a patient-focused approach aims to promote active patient involvement through self-responsibility in the rehabilitation process. This is in direct contrast to the traditional medical model which creates limited autonomy for the spinal cord injury patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512442669">19</xref></sup> The proposed patient-focused model of care in this investigation, by contrast, has been shown to be a positive and effective way to improve rehabilitation outcomes for spinal cord injury individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512442669">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>One hundred consecutive newly injured spinal cord injury inpatients participated in this clinical audit. Exclusion criteria included spinal cord injury patients who did not complete their entire rehabilitation at the spinal injury unit or who had incomplete questionnaires or progress forms. Each of the 100 spinal cord injury patients completed the NAC, which is a checklist of 216 behavioural indicators across nine rehabilitation domains: activities of daily living, skin management, bladder management, bowel management, mobility, wheelchair and equipment, community preparation, discharge coordination and psychological issues. The questionnaire uses a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3 to assess the level of independence on each indicator with 0 representing ‘completely dependent on staff’, 1 representing ‘mostly dependent on staff’, 2 representing ‘moderately independent’ and 3 representing ‘completely independent’. Item scores for each subscale are totalled and a ‘percentage achieved score’ is derived using a conversion table which reflects the patient’s level of independence in each rehabilitation domain. Each NAC subscale total score ranges between 0 and 100% with higher NAC scores indicating greater level of independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442669">16</xref></sup> The questionnaire has strong internal consistency, item validity, test–retest reliability and concurrent validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512442669">17</xref></sup> The NAC was completed at baseline admission and at discharge.</p>
<p>In addition, each patient completed the patient-focused goal planning questionnaire upon discharge from the clinical setting. This 36-item survey contained both quantitative and qualitative components and was developed by the spinal injury unit multidisciplinary team to measure the patient satisfaction, perceptions and experiences with the goal planning process. The quantitative responses obtained were rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6 with 1 representing ‘strongly agree’ and 6 representing ‘strongly disagree’. Additional space was provided within this questionnaire for qualitative comments and recommendations. This questionnaire is available from the authors upon request.</p>
<p>Goal planning meetings commenced within two weeks of completion of the initial NAC with subsequent meetings every 2–4 weeks. For each spinal cord injury patient, the following information was recorded at the goal planning meeting on the goal planning progress forms: (1) the date of the goal planning meeting; (2) the number, type and details of specific goals set at each meeting; (3) the goals achieved/not achieved; and (4) reasons for non-achievement of goals.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were computed for the NAC at baseline and upon discharge, the patient-focused goal planning questionnaire at discharge, and the goal planning progress forms obtained from each goal planning meeting. Paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were calculated for the data obtained from the NAC at baseline and upon discharge and Pearson’s correlational analysis was calculated for the data obtained from the patient-focused goal planning questionnaire. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512442669">20</xref></sup> An alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was applied to all statistical tests.</p>
<p>The qualitative perceptions and opinions of the spinal cord injury patients were obtained from the qualitative section of the patient-focused goal planning questionnaire. All comments were collated and transcribed verbatim and analysed using QSR Nvivo 8 qualitative analysis software. The process of analysis included open, axial and selective coding which resulted in a set of designated, representative themes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512442669">21</xref></sup> Each of the themes identified discrete ideas and phenomena. After the initial themes were stipulated, a subset of text was selected for analysis of inter-rater reliability by three of the authors of this paper. The three clinical researchers agreed on the coding of themes in 94% of the passages. Subsequent themes and subthemes were examined and agreed upon by all three authors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Spinal cord injured patients who had experienced traumatic injury such as road traffic accidents and falls accounted for 74% of the sample population, with the remaining 26% of patients incurring non-traumatic injury (i.e. tumour or infection). Of the 100 spinal cord injury patients assessed, complete paraplegic injuries occurred in 25% of the cohort, incomplete paraplegic injuries in 27%, complete tetraplegic injuries in 25% and incomplete tetraplegic injuries in 23% of the patients. There was a gender distribution of 73 male and 27 female spinal cord injury patients and a mean chronological age of 42.75 years with a range distribution of 18–86 years. In terms of marital status distribution, 43 of the spinal cord injury patients were single, 38 were married, 7 in defacto relationships, 4 were separated, 6 divorced and 2 were widowed from their partners. In terms of breakdown according to level of education obtained, 2 patients had completed postgraduate studies, 25 had completed tertiary studies, 29 had finished high school studies, 40 had participated in some level of high school education and 4 had a primary school only level of education. The average length of inpatient stay of the patient group was 115.20 (95.60) days with a range distribution extending from 19 to 764 days.</p>
<p>The goal planning model in this study specified the use of a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the spinal cord injury patient’s needs followed by explicit goal planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512442669">18</xref></sup> The optimal practice within the spinal injury unit entailed completing the first NAC within two weeks of admission. Fifty-seven patients completed the first NAC within 14 days of admission and a further 30 patients between 15 and 21 days of admission. Ten patients completed the NAC between 22 and 28 days after admission and the final 3 patients completed the NAC more than 29 days after admission.</p>
<p>An important recommendation of the goal planning programme was for meetings to commence within two weeks of completion of the initial NAC with subsequent meetings following every 2–4 weeks. The mean time between the NAC being completed and the first goal planning meeting in this clinical audit was 15 (13.2) days. The mean time between goal planning meetings across the sample was 23 (8.4) days.</p>
<p>Further quantitative data obtained outlined a total of 547 goal planning meetings implemented across the 100 participants with 8531 goals stipulated across the meetings. The mean number of meetings per patient was 6.23 (3.1) with a range of 1 to 14.</p>
<p>In this cohort of 100 spinal cord injury patients, 1958 goals were established at the first goal planning meeting with 75% (1468 goals) achieved by the second. The rate of goal achievements at subsequent meetings dropped to 56% (5728). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512442669">Table 1</xref> shows the mean number of goals set and achieved through the goal planning programme for each domain of the NAC. The greatest numbers of goals set and achieved were for the areas of mobility and activities of daily living.</p>

<p>This noteworthy improvement in psychological issues at the macro level was a reflection of the important changes to psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety. The positive shift was also attributable to a significant increase in the use of active coping strategies such as problem solving coupled with a significant decrease in the use of passive coping strategies such as denial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512442669">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The overall scores for mood symptoms (total as measured by item 9.1 on the NAC) increased significantly from the commencement of rehabilitation (baseline) to the time of discharge. This key improvement was based on a significant reduction in both depressive and anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>The scores obtained for the active coping strategies subscale increased from baseline to discharge. This constituted significant shifts in all five active coping strategies: ‘coming up with strategies when facing a problem’ <italic>t</italic>(99) = −6.63, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ‘getting used to the idea that it happened’ <italic>t</italic>(99) = −5.65, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ‘looking for something good in what is happening’ <italic>t</italic>(99) = −3.46, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ‘taking direct action to get around a problem’ <italic>t</italic>(99) = −2.78, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; and ‘talking to someone about how I feel’ <italic>t</italic>(99) = −2.43, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>There was also a significant change in the scores obtained for the passive or avoidant/disengaged coping subscale between baseline and discharge. These results indicated that the spinal cord injury patients became less reliant on unhelpful passive coping strategies during the course of their rehabilitation process. A significant reduction was demonstrated in all three of the passive coping behaviours with the most significant reduction in ‘pretending it didn’t happen’, <italic>t</italic>(99) = 4.27, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. The next reduction was ‘giving up the attempt to get what I want’, <italic>t</italic>(99) = 3.18, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; followed by ‘using alcohol or drugs to help me get through’, <italic>t</italic>(99) = 2.15, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>Quantitative and qualitative findings were also obtained from the patient-focused goal planning questionnaire whereby the spinal cord injury patients rated their overall satisfaction of the goal planning programme on a scale of 1 to 6 as moderately strong (<italic>M</italic> = 1.64; SD = 1.27). The relationship between the patient’s overall satisfaction of the goal planning process and specific components of the programme was also assessed by correlating the overall satisfaction scores with other key variables.</p>
<p>The spinal cord injury patient’s overall satisfaction with the goal planning programme was associated with their willingness to participate, <italic>r =</italic> 0.62, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, and their acceptance of their limitations after their injury, <italic>r</italic> = 0.50, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>These strong quantitative relationships were further supported by the qualitative recounts of several spinal cord injury patients including the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought that the goal planning programme was wonderful and I gained control of the direction, progress and success of my rehabilitation journey.</p>
<p>Goal planning helped me to accept and cope with my spinal cord injury.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Overall satisfaction with the goal planning programme was associated with the patient’s understanding of the role each professional played in the rehabilitation program, <italic>r</italic> = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, how comfortable they felt in openly discussing concerns with the team at the goal planning meetings, <italic>r</italic> = 0.58, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and the support of their partner within the goal planning rehabilitation process, <italic>r</italic> = 0.22, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>These associations were further reinforced with the reflections of several patient’s:
<disp-quote>
<p>My research programme coordinator really knew how to get the most out of me and was always challenging me to set and achieve my goals.</p>
<p>My wife and family and friends saved my sanity, greatly assisted my rehabilitation and I healed quicker with their 24 hour support.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By contrast, some qualitative insights indicated frustration with aspects of the multidisciplinary team:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wasn’t fully aware of the role of each member of the team and more open communication is needed – Don’t just say stuff and go.</p>
<p>More planning for goal planning, more notice to inform family of dates and times so that they can be present.</p>
<p>The research programme coordinator needed to chase up if the goals set have been achieved BEFORE the goal setting meetings.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Overall satisfaction with the goal planning process increased when goals were set by the patient and not the rehabilitation team, <italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. In addition, when the patient felt the frequency of the goal planning meetings were appropriate, <italic>r =</italic> 0.59, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and the meetings were a quality use of time, <italic>r</italic> = 0.81, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, ratings improved.</p>
<p>Such improvements are summarized with the following qualitative comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>It [goal planning] enabled me to feel I had some personal control over my treatment.</p>
<p>Goal setting was a little bit intimidating in the first meeting however I became more active in the process and achieved all of my really important goals.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Again, by contrast, several spinal cord injury patients indicated frustration with their experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was satisfied with the goals I worked on BUT I would have liked more involvement in the goal planning process–I felt that the goals were not my goals.</p>
<p>My personal goals were not necessarily adhered to or listened to by my research programme coordinator.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The patient’s overall satisfaction with the goal planning process increased when meetings diminished worries and frustrations, <italic>r</italic> = 0.73, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, alleviated sadness and low emotional mood when progress was slow, <italic>r</italic> = 0.59, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, helped acceptance of resignation regarding things that they were unable to do post injury, <italic>r</italic> = 0.50, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and finally assisted with emotional resilience with rehabilitation, <italic>r</italic> = 0.93, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>Such tolerance and resignation are supported with the following reflections:
<disp-quote>
<p>I commenced whilst depressed and goal planning lifted my spirits.</p>
<p>Goal planning assisted me accept and cope with my spinal cord injury.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, several spinal cord injury patients indicated that they required more psychological assistance:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes I agree that goal planning helped me a little with my emotions BUT I needed so much more help emotionally than I was given.</p>
<p>The whole process was too clinical and not enough psychological help was given.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The spinal cord injury patients identified many challenges and barriers within the goal planning process. These challenges included patient issues such as unrealistic goals, lack of understanding, motivation, self-efficacy or psychological distress as well as medical complications. Despite these perceived challenges according to the quantitative and qualitative findings, the spinal cord injury patients appeared to have found the goal planning process helpful and satisfying in the management of their rehabilitation post spinal cord injury. They also deemed the goal planning process commendable in assisting them to adjust to their spinal cord injury.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this clinical audit of 100 patients from a state-wide spinal injury unit demonstrate that this multidisciplinary goal planning rehabilitation programme constituted an effective rehabilitation framework for spinal injured inpatients. The benefits to the patients relate to improvements in physical, social and psychological functioning between the commencement of their rehabilitation and their discharge from the spinal unit. Furthermore, the patients consistently reported through qualitative findings, improvements in their physical, social and psychological adjustment to injury. These outcomes highlight the clinical benefits of patient-focused goal planning for the rehabilitation of spinal cord injury patients. In addition, the results underpin and emphasize the need for active, individually tailored rehabilitation programmes involving a comprehensive multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>This investigation lends support to findings of other studies which embrace this goal planning model in rehabilitation spinal units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512442669">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512442669">22</xref></sup> It provides further evidence for the patient-focused goal planning model of care in spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Patient-focused goal planning is important for facilitating increases in independence and gains in physical, social and psychological functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512442669">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scientific research has previously indicated that in order for individuals with spinal cord injury to cope and adapt to physical disability, the interrelationships between biological/physical, psychological, social, technological, cultural and political factors need to be carefully managed in order to facilitate optimal health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442669">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442669">2</xref></sup> The results from this study have specifically focused on changes in the physical, social and psychological functioning domains of rehabilitation and demonstrated the interrelationships these domains have for each patient’s goal planning programme. This integrated approach constituted a unique rehabilitation package for each of the patients in this specialist spinal injury unit.</p>
<p>A retrospective clinical audit of process and outcome data was used which proved to be a representation of authentic current clinical practice at a spinal injury rehabilitation unit. A mixed methods design was utilized to enable distinctive trends in the goal planning rehabilitation process to be highlighted. This investigation enabled insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the goal planning rehabilitation programme from the spinal cord injury patient’s perspective. This study therefore provides invaluable client focused feedback regarding areas in which clinical improvements in therapeutic care can and should be focused.</p>
<p>However, there were a number of limitations of the study which were identified and should be noted. This study attempted to obtain a representative sample of spinal cord injury patients within the specialist injury rehabilitation unit, however only spinal cord injury patients attending this specialist spinal unit as inpatients that completed a full rehabilitation programme and completed all of the questionnaires were included in this investigation. The spinal cord injury patients who failed these inclusion criteria were not included in this research cohort. These clients may well provide valuable evidence as to why their rehabilitation journey within the spinal injury unit was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Although the optimal practice within the spinal injury unit was to complete the first NAC questionnaire within two weeks of admission, the results indicated that only 57% of the spinal cord injury patients did so within this timeframe. Unfortunately data elucidating this delay in the initial completion of the first NAC questionnaire were not transparent. It was also difficult to obtain comprehensive in-depth information from the goal planning progress forms regarding specific short- and long-term goals set during the rehabilitation process. Clinical insight has now been gained and as a clinical recommendation, prospective detailed information is currently being collected regarding these short- and long-term goals. One of the most notable findings of this clinical audit was the priority given to physical and functional rehabilitation for the patients. Yet, in this study, a number of adverse psychosocial outcomes were observed. A future recommendation is to identify these potential psychosocial issues as an intrinsic and necessary part of rehabilitation following a spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Future studies regarding the long-term outcomes of goal planning on a patient’s physical, social and psychological function post discharge would lend support to the philosophy of multidisciplinary interventions and goal planning rehabilitation. In addition, clinical investigations which study more specifically the psychosocial functioning, quality of life and coping behaviours and strategies of spinal cord injury individuals in the community would augment the planning for optimal health outcomes for individuals living with a spinal cord injury in society.</p>
