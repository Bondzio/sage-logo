<p>The <italic>Strategic Review into Health Inequalities in England</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112441574">Marmot, 2010</xref>) was commissioned by the last government to look at the causes of health inequalities. What it confirmed, apart from the connection between social position and individual health outcomes, was the importance of understanding the critical link between child health and societal outcomes and social health and long-term emotional wellbeing. Poverty alone does not explain poor health outcomes for the individual, although its effect is significant for health inequalities. Marmot also highlighted the dearth of research clarifying the best way of delivering services to improve outcomes for children, but recommended universal and targeted approaches to address the gradient in health inequalities. All political parties in the UK have taken the results of Marmot very seriously, indeed they should have international resonance – every government should want to make an impact on child public health as this can ultimately reduce fiscal spending.</p>
<p>Early intervention is a much-misused term in England, often applied to prompt interventions in response to pathology, rather than to prevention. Real delivery of early intervention must be preventative and in part take place through universal child public health services such as maternity, health visiting/public health nursing and school nursing. This special edition features research that I hope will have relevance for these services, as they are designed and delivered across the world. Much of the research included will also have particular value to policy makers. It has been chosen for its generalizability and although it may be more relevant to those countries with well-developed community health services I hope that it will demonstrate the benefits for child public health of having such community services.</p>
<p>This edition starts with a timely editorial that reminds us that it is not enough just to generate research evidence as individuals. There is immense value in professional networking, which can promote usage of research and bring new perspectives into its meaning, both across professions and across nations. Kendall and Bryar describe a range of international professional networking opportunities, which many researchers and practitioners are already linked into, but I hope that they will be of interest to those hearing about them for the first time. Such networking supports the researcher, particularly the novice researcher. Research and professional networks allow for critical appraisal of research, consideration of its value to professionals, and for an assessment of its value to the public in health systems it may not have been designed for.</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges of having finite health services is how the available resource can be used most effectively to maximise health gain. The first paper in this edition is designed to challenge current thinking on just this issue, and offers a new theoretical opinion for that decision making process. Based on the recommendations from Marmot, and the experience of a new model of universal service delivery in Australia (Kemp paper), Cowley et al. put forward new arguments for the dangers of just using targeted approaches to improve child public health. They highlight the limitation of targeted services that they think can only be effective with the narrow populations they are developed for. These authors emphasise the importance of service designers understanding the gradient in health inequalities and the critical importance of being able to work with resilience factors in any families. What they expose is the complexity of this work when planning services and the importance of being able to provide well evidenced individually and population level targeted interventions, as well as programmes such as the Family Nurse Partnership to groups within a population. They emphasise that ‘the majority of “cases” are likely to be found outside the selected groups or areas, because of the greater numbers in the general population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112441574">Rose, 2008</xref>). My belief is that the reasoning in this paper will become an essential framework both those designing health visitor services, and for students of the profession. This paper was first presented to an international conference so has already been informed by professional feedback which helped shape the version presented in this journal. Its reviewer was the discussant at that conference and her evidence based comments validating this paper and suggesting how it should sit with both global audiences and policy makers are astute and helpful.</p>
<p>The second paper in this focused edition describes one research team’s successful attempts to research a service model that addresses the needs of the most vulnerable children from within a universal service. One of the reasons that there is so little research into public health nursing/health visiting practice is the complexity of conducting this research. That fact makes this paper all the more important as it explores the challenges that this research team encountered, as well as the successes, and will provide essential information for others wanting to engage in similar such research. The hybrid approach to the research and the flexibility of the researchers, to adapt to the ‘real’ world situation of exploring a new community service, demonstrates new possibilities where others have ‘feared to tread’. The fact that the MESCH research has international applicability makes it all the more interesting; indeed it is shortly to be tested in England. MESCH is a programme which can reach all those families in need of additional services, making this in depth understanding of the research conducted into its effectiveness, all the more important. The review, by a UK expert in health visiting, research and quality is also welcome, providing as it does an unbiased view of this new programme from the context of a deep understanding of the complexity of both delivering effective interventions, and researching the process of delivering such new services.</p>
<p>No one queries the importance of promoting breast feeding as a public health measure and the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly initiative has provided a great impetus to working towards as near universal breast feeding as possible. In the UK there is also good evidence based guidance to support practitioners as they encourage mothers to breastfeed. However, even with such guidance, and access to appropriate training, there remains many discrepancies in the incidence of breastfeeding in different communities. The paper by McFadden et al is a very important one, acknowledging as it does the need to get under the surface of why women are choosing not to breastfeed. Many column inches, and much dialogue, acknowledges the importance of obtaining a consumer view when developing services, however the reality of this happening in practice is not as frequent as it should be. This imperative is well exposed by this paper, which describes how the professional stereotypical views of why one community of mothers had low breastfeeding rates, a view based on their ethnicity, were exposed by the researchers having a direct dialogue with the mothers themselves. For me it is a classic example of the value of qualitative research’s ability to delve deeper into behavioural choices, which can have a profound impact on public health outcomes. It is a human weakness of many, including health professionals that they can stereotype individuals, according to the views of others, rather than getting to the crux of the issues themselves. This paper exposes how this professional behaviour can be a block to delivering effective public health outcomes for children. It would suggest that where existing practices are not bringing about health improvement, it is essential to connect better with the reasons a particular community or individual is making the health choices they do. Whilst this may, at one level, seem time-consuming, it only has to be done once and the information gained can then be used to more effectively direct any health interventions. Many of our nations are now multicultural, unless we better understand what influences health choices for any specific ethnic or cultural group how can we expect to deliver effective public health interventions – this is a powerful message from this paper. The reviewer provides very helpful additional value by considering the paper in the context of the BFI and a case study of a project to increase breast feeding rates amongst the Bangladeshi population in London.</p>
<p>The Powell and Appleton paper raises a very important issue with respect to safeguarding children, that is, how services are organised when vulnerable children are not brought to appointments. It advises that so called ‘did not attend’ appointments must be treated differently when they occur with children, as in fact the child ‘was not brought’, this is particularly significant in the case of vulnerable children. The reality of practice is that do not attend situations cause anxiety to health visitors/public health nurses and others with a specific safeguarding role who experience this situation on a regular basis. The author’s suggestion of renaming these situations for children as ‘was not brought’ seems justified in the light of the results of serious safeguarding reviews reported. It is important that those conducting such reviews make recommendations for how practice could be improved to offer greater protection to vulnerable children. Following review of the literature this paper offers a legitimate recommendation. As the reviewer points out though, it is important that any improvements to practice are just that, and do not create a new layer of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It is now around 20 years since John Cox and Jenni Holden and colleagues did their classic work, developing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and applying it in a service model delivered by health visitors across the UK. This initiative, researched by randomised controlled trial, was to detect postnatal depression early and to manage its effects though easy to deliver non-directive counselling. Since then, although this study has been successfully replicated a number of times, and many health visitors have delivered and continue to deliver the Cox/Holden model successfully in practice, the value of the EPDS has been challenged from many directions including for its use as a population wide screening tool and for its acceptability to mothers. However it has weathered these storms, and once again a randomised controlled study into its use alongside a service delivering non-directive counselling to mothers has demonstrated that this package can, and does, lead to the early detection of postnatal depression, successful management of that depression, and a reduction in the mother’s levels of stress. A reduction in maternal stress is very important for reducing negative emotional outcomes for the infant that may be related to their mother’s depression. I was delighted to secure Professor John Cox to act as the referee for Kari Glavin’s study, and welcome his interesting views on how it was conducted and the service need any country must put in place to provide a really effective clinical pathway to managing the incidence of maternal depression depression. I can see no reason now, such is the body of research, that policy makers across the world, don’t start to understand the fiscal benefits from implementing such a programme for their mothers. However, as was the case in the USA when this was tried, the absence of a universal health visiting or public health service is a considerable impediment to success.</p>
<p>The final paper focused on a range of research methodologies used with the Netmums, social networking site, and will introduce many readers to a new phenomenon, the power of social networking, and with it the power of social networking research. There is little existing literature on the potential of social networking sites to conduct research and to provide samples for researchers. Clearly for the purist researcher the limitations are clear, bias, self-selected samples and little knowledge of the characteristics of the sample drawn, for example. However as this paper demonstrates these are in part offset by new opportunities to conduct rapid survey and other research with very large samples, to modify the method or numbers required during the research, and still get an answer from a significant population of mothers, within hours rather than months. Clearly this has value, particularly to policy makers wanting to test planned policy with consumers, but can it ever have real currency for the purist researcher? Certainly the paper would suggest that a great deal of qualitative information can be gathered quickly, e.g. on the quality of current services. The randomised controlled trial conducted by Exeter university using a Netmums sample, once published, will provide more information as to whether it can really have real potential for quantitative researchers- it may be that the benefit of large numbers will help to compensate for the sampling challenges. Clearly the intention of the research will also be important, for example, it is very difficult to find and keep a homogeneous sample when conducting an RCT into an area of mental health such as postnatal depression, perhaps a social networking sample does have something to offer, not only in terms of the capacity to recruit large numbers quickly, but as research with its users may be regarded to be more ‘naturalistic’ than can often be achieved when working with community samples. It was helpful that the reviewer of this paper was such an experienced epidemiologist, who works in a policy research unit. He was able to see the potential of using social networking research to inform policy, particularly by offering the public voice. However equally was wary of the need to understand its limitations.</p>
<p>The intention is that this collection of papers will encourage policy makers and service leaders to consider how they plan their child public health services, and whether their models can deliver the most effective outcomes for children in their population context. They offer researchers the opportunity to explore new methodologies, and most importantly ways of delivering ‘real world’ research in a community, or service context, with significant size populations. It is the intention of the editors though that, more importantly, they will lead to professional and policy debate and further research in other contexts and countries. However by bringing papers by these distinguished researchers together, all focused on child public health, into one volume, and supported by the commentaries by equally distinguished reviewers, our real purpose is to enhance the development of effective health services for promoting the child public health.</p>
