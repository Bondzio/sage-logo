<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Socioeconomic health inequalities are partly attributed to different physical activity (PA) patterns. Psychosocial factors interacting with PA are suggested to explain the socioeconomic differences in PA to some extent. The aim of the present study was to examine whether PA self-efficacy, PA social support, and general self-control contribute to the socioeconomic status (SES) differences in leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and in total PA. <italic>Methods</italic>: The sample consisted of 25–74-year-old Finnish men (<italic>n</italic> = 2325) and women (<italic>n</italic> = 2699), who participated in the cross-sectional FINRISK Study in 2007. Physical activity was measured as total PA (MET-h/week) and as LTPA (inactive/active). A psychosocial factor questionnaire included scales measuring PA self-efficacy, PA social support, and general self-control. SES was defined by household gross income and years of education. <italic>Results</italic>: Both higher education and income were associated with higher levels of LTPA, whereas total PA was higher among those with lower SES. Subjects with high SES reported higher levels of PA self-efficacy and PA social support, but general self-control correlated only with higher income. PA self-efficacy, PA social support and general self-control had positive associations with both LTPA and total PA. These psychosocial factors partly explained the SES differences in LTPA, but not in total PA. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Future intervention studies should examine whether, by influencing PA self-efficacy, PA social support, and general self-control, it is possible to diminish the SES differences in PA.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Although the health benefits of physical activity are well known, a considerable part of the Finnish population does not meet the recommended activity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813481642">1</xref>] as is the case in many other Western countries as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813481642">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813481642">3</xref>]. Socioeconomic status (SES), often measured by means of education and income, has been found to determine a person’s physical activity (PA) habits. Lower SES is mostly associated with a sedentary lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813481642">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813481642">5</xref>], though a different pattern has been established when work-related PA is taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813481642">6</xref>]. Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813481642">7</xref>] noted that half of those who were inactive in their leisure time reported being engaged in hard occupational PA at least 1 hour per day.</p>
<p>Besides socioeconomic status, psychosocial factors have been found to influence leisure time physical activity (LTPA). Especially PA self-efficacy, which refers to an individual’s confidence of her or his ability to be physically active on a regular basis, and PA social support from family or friends have been found to be consistently and positively associated with LTPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813481642">8</xref>]. Although the connections between PA and the aforementioned separate psychosocial factors have been well established, there are fewer studies examining the strength of the associations of different predictors in the same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813481642">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813481642">10</xref>]. There is also less information about whether, in addition to PA-specific psychosocial factors, a general factor such as self-control has an effect on PA. Tagney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813481642">11</xref>] define self-control as an ability to override one’s impulses in general and have observed its utility in many areas of an individual’s life. In health behaviour research, general self-control has been associated with, for instance, restrained eating, less alcohol consumption and lower BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813481642">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813481642">12</xref>]. In their study of adolescents, Junger and van Kampen found self-control to be positively related also to physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813481642">13</xref>]. In a recently reported weight-loss programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813481642">14</xref>], trait self-control predicted both attendance in exercising and increase in the activity level over the course of the programme.</p>
<p>Along with physical activity, many psychosocial factors have been noted to be unevenly distributed among socioeconomic groups. This is the case with PA self-efficacy and PA social support, for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813481642">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813481642">16</xref>]. Furthermore, a few studies suggest that socioeconomic differences in LTPA are at least partly explained by psychosocial factors. Cerin and Leslie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813481642">15</xref>] reported that the impact of SES on moderate-to-vigorous LTPA was mediated by self-efficacy and social support. However, in a study by Droomers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813481642">17</xref>], the proportion of educational group differences in LTPA that was explained by emotional social support was only minor, one reason probably being locus of control in the same model.</p>
<p>Research related to the determinants of physical activity has mainly dealt with LTPA and there is a need to diversify the knowledge of the associations with other forms of physical activity as well. In the present study we examine whether there are socioeconomic differences in LTPA, total PA and psychosocial factors. Furthermore, we investigate whether psychosocial factors explain the expected SES differences in LTPA and total PA.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494813481642">
<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>The National Cardiovascular Risk Factor Survey (the FINRISK Study) is a cross-sectional survey conducted in Finland every 5 years. The present study consisted of two phases carried out in 2007. A random sample of 10,000 people was drawn from the Finnish population register and stratified by gender, 10-year age group and area. Participants were 25–74-year-old men and women from five distinct areas. In January 2007, the participants received by mail an invitation to take part in a health examination and a self-administered questionnaire, which included items about sociodemographic factors, health behaviour, medical history and diseases. Participants were asked to bring the completed questionnaire with them as attending medical examination in a health centre. All those who participated in the health examination (<italic>n</italic> = 6258, response rate 63%) were asked to take part in the second phase. These DILGOM (Dietary, Lifestyle and Genetic Determinants of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome) sub-study health examinations were conducted from April to June 2007, where such things as weight and height of the participants were measured, and the participants filled in questionnaires concerning psychosocial and lifestyle factors. The response rate in the second phase was 80% (<italic>n</italic> = 5024). The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute for Health and Welfare, and participants provided their informed consent.</p>

<sec id="section4-1403494813481642">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Total physical activity</italic> was measured with the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which covers three intensity levels of physical activity: vigorous PA, moderate PA and walking. The given frequencies and the time of the three domains were transformed to MET (Metabolic Equivalents of Task) hours per week according to the IPAQ manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813481642">18</xref>]. Subjects being physically active at least on the moderate level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813481642">18</xref>] were classified as reaching the recommendations.</p>
<p><italic>Leisure time physical activity</italic> was defined with four statements such as “In my spare time I walk, cycle, or exercise in some other way at least 4h/week. This includes walking, fishing and hunting, light gardening, and so on, but excludes travel to work”. The scale is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813481642">19</xref>]. The respondents were asked to choose the alternative that best described their average level of PA. For logistic regression analyses, the variable was dichotomized so that subjects who had chosen the lowest alternative (indicating less than 4 hours of LTPA per week) were classified as inactive and not having reached the recommended activity level.</p>
<p><italic>PA self-efficacy</italic> was measured with a 10-item scale containing both adoption self-efficacy and barrier self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813481642">20</xref>]. The measurement is an adaptation of PA self-efficacy scale and nutrition self-efficacy scale which was reformulated to measure only PA self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813481642">21</xref>]. Respondents were asked to rate items such as “I can manage to carry out my exercise intentions even when I am tired” on a scale ranging from 1 (“very certain I cannot”) to 4 (“very certain I can”). The mean score was calculated for the scale if the respondent had no more than two missing items. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.91).</p>
<p><italic>PA social support</italic> was defined as having friends and family members to encourage or help the participant change their PA habits during the past 3 months. A modified Social Support for Exercise Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813481642">22</xref>] consisted of seven items such as “How often did your family members, friends, or relatives exercise with you?” The frequency was specified as “never” (1), “sometimes” (2), “often” (3), or “does not apply” (4). After excluding from the analyses those who chose the fourth alternative, one missing item per respondent was allowed in calculating the mean score. Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was 0.87.</p>
<p><italic>General self-control</italic> was measured with the Brief Self-Control Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813481642">11</xref>], consisting of 13 items. Respondents were asked to rate themselves on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (“I do not agree at all”) to 5 (“I totally agree”), according to items such as “I am good at resisting temptations”. The mean score for the scale was calculated with an allowance of up to two missing items per respondent. The scale was internally consistent (Cronbach’s α = 0.77).</p>
<p><italic>SES</italic> was defined by self-reported total years of education and last year’s gross household income level. Education years were categorized into tertiles according to birth year to adjust for the general increase in average school years in the course of time. Income level was weighted with the number of household members and thereafter categorized into tertiles.</p>
<p><italic>Body mass index</italic> (BMI) was calculated as [weight (kg)/height (m)<sup>2</sup>].</p>

<sec id="section5-1403494813481642">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Bivariate associations between LTPA, total PA, SES and psychosocial factors were assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relations of SES and psychosocial factors with LTPA. In order to compare the strength of the associations, the scores of the psychosocial factors were standardized in logistic regression. Linear regression analysis was used to analyse the associations of SES and psychosocial factors with continuous total PA variable. The first model of both the logistic and linear regression analyses included education or income, age, and gender. The second model was adjusted for PA self-efficacy and PA social support. General self-control was added to the analyses in the third model and BMI in the fourth model. We also tested interaction terms between gender and SES on LTPA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.840 for education and <italic>p</italic> = 0.963 for income) and total PA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.033 for education and <italic>p</italic> = 0.341 for income). In the case of total PA, the association between education and total PA was stronger among males (β = −0.10) than among females (β = −0.07). Since the difference was modest between genders, we decided to analyse both genders together. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 15.0 for Windows.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The characteristics of the study sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813481642">Table I</xref>. No gender differences were found with respect to leisure-time physical activity. More women were categorized as active according to total PA measures, but the level of total PA (MET-h/week) was higher in men than in women. Men had a higher level of PA self-efficacy than women, but received less PA social support from friends and family. In self-control, no gender differences were observed. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813481642">Table II</xref>, both education and income correlated positively with LTPA (<italic>r</italic> = 0.13 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.12, respectively), whereas the association was negative between total PA and education (<italic>r</italic> = −0.12). BMI had a negative association with LTPA (<italic>r</italic> = −0.25), but the correlation with total PA was nonsignificant. All psychosocial factors were positively related to LTPA and total PA, although the associations between psychosocial factors and LTPA were stronger. PA self-efficacy and PA social support were positively associated with both education and income, whereas self-control had a significant association only with income.</p>

<p>In the logistic regression analysis, subjects in the highest-education tertile were more likely to be physically active in their leisure time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813481642">Table III</xref>). When PA self-efficacy and PA social support were added in the second model, the association between LTPA and education became nonsignificant. The adding of general self-control in the third model did not change the associations. In the fourth model, with adjustment for BMI, the impact of self-control became nonsignificant, but PA self-efficacy and PA social support remained significant. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813481642">Table IV</xref>, subjects in the middle- and highest-income tertile had higher levels of LTPA. After adjusting for PA self-efficacy and PA social support in the second model, only the relationship between the highest-income group and LTPA stayed significant. The association became nonsignificant when general self-control was added in the next model. PA self-efficacy and PA social support remained significant correlates of LTPA in the final model including BMI. When we ran an additional analysis in which both SES variables, education and income, were in the same model, the association between education and LTPA became nonsignificant (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to increase understanding on the associations between SES indicators, PA-specific and general psychosocial factors and PA, which was measured as total PA and LTPA. People with higher education and income reported more LTPA, whereas total PA was associated with lower SES. Subjects with higher SES had higher levels of PA self-efficacy and PA social support, while general self-control was higher only among the more affluent. All psychosocial factors correlated positively with both LTPA and total PA, although the associations with LTPA were stronger than with total PA. Psychosocial factors explained the SES group differences in LTPA to some extent. The association between SES and total PA was negative and therefore such mediation was not observed.</p>
<p>According to the self-report measures used in the present study, most of the subjects reached the recommended level of LTPA, with higher educated and more affluent subjects more likely to meet the standards. Education is known to provide people with knowledge and tools to acquire healthy lifestyle habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813481642">23</xref>], and additionally, occupational PA is suggested to reduce the eagerness to engage in LTPA among the less educated subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813481642">24</xref>]. However, when we analysed both education and income simultaneously, the association between education and LTPA became nonsignificant. This might indicate that not only do the aforementioned factors attributed to low education diminish the LTPA level, but also that individuals with higher income have better opportunities to engage in recreational PA.</p>
<p>The number of subjects categorized as active in total PA resembled the number of subjects who were sufficiently active in their leisure time. However, the total PA level correlated negatively with education and also with income, when gender and age were adjusted for. These results concerning total PA and SES are explicable, given the likelihood of occupational PA to be higher among less-educated workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813481642">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813481642">26</xref>]. Still, as shown in a recent review by Beenackers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813481642">27</xref>], the association between total PA and SES indicators is a complex issue. Also, the lack of association between total PA and BMI noted in our study is a matter of concern. It seems that defining the activity level using total PA as an indicator is not necessarily sufficient when the need for health-enhancing practices is considered.</p>
<p>In addition to education and income, other significant predictors of LTPA were PA self-efficacy, PA social support and general self-control. Despite the reverse association of LTPA and total PA with SES, PA-related psychosocial factors and general self-control were positively associated with both total PA and LTPA. However, psychosocial factors had weaker relations with total PA than with LTPA. This might also be the result of work-related PA constituting a part of total PA. It is obvious that, as LTPA is more voluntary than occupational PA, engaging in it is more highly dependent on the effect of psychosocial factors. It has also to be noted that many environmental factors which were not included in the present study can have a different impact on different domains of an individual’s physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813481642">8</xref>].</p>
<p>PA self-efficacy, PA social support and general self-control also partly explained the education and income group differences in LTPA. A similar result regarding PA self-efficacy and PA social support has been observed, for instance by Cerin and Leslie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813481642">15</xref>], but studies including general self-control have, to our knowledge, not been done. In our analyses, even with the relatively high correlation between PA self-efficacy and general self-control, both of these factors had independent associations with LTPA. This is notable, for PA-specific psychosocial factors are known to be strong predictors of PA. Also in this study PA self-efficacy and PA social support had a stronger association with LTPA than general self-control. Still, concentrating solely on PA-related factors can be insufficient where changing PA habits is concerned. The importance of general self-control in increasing PA reported by Crescioni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813481642">14</xref>] suggests that taking into account also other than PA-specific factors could enable better targeting of health behaviour interventions.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic differences in psychosocial factors such as PA self-efficacy and PA social support found in this study were consistent with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813481642">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813481642">16</xref>]. Moreover, an association of general self-control with higher income was observed. These psychosocial factors affecting PA could be the focus of interventions aiming to increase the PA level among different populations. Social support, defined as friends to exercise with, has been found to be important especially for the low income group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813481642">28</xref>], while in an intervention study by Hankonen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813481642">29</xref>], the increase in self-efficacy increased PA in all educational groups. Longitudinal studies are needed to show, whether general self-control can be a practical component of interventions as well.</p>
<p>The strengths of the present study are the large population-based sample and the simultaneous measurements of PA on two different levels. A further advantage is the inclusion of various psychosocial factors in the same model when examining the SES differences in PA. This has seldom been done in studies examining the correlates of PA, and the knowledge of the role of general self-control in particular is limited.</p>
<p>The main limitation of our study is the cross-sectional study design, therefore no causality can be attributed. Also the self-reporting nature of the physical activity measurements is a limitation. Measuring physical activity is known to be biased especially by overreporting and the same problem has affected studies using IPAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813481642">30</xref>]. In our study both total PA and LTPA measurements showed equally high activity prevalence; a similar LTPA prevalence among the Finnish population was found also earlier in the FINRISK Study 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813481642">19</xref>]. Presumably, the number of subjects attaining the recommended PA level is in reality considerably lower, as has been reported in another Finnish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813481642">1</xref>]. Overreporting of prevalence is not crucial if all subjects are overreporting equally and the ranks remain the same, but this is unlikely to be the case. Therefore, the complex associations between different PA measures and SES indicators, which could include different biases, should be examined in future population studies.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Total PA, in contrast to LTPA, was negatively associated with SES, which indicates the importance of considering what sort of PA indicator is used when examining SES differences in PA. PA self-efficacy, PA social support and general self-control were all significant correlates of PA and they also partly explained the socioeconomic differences in LTPA. Further intervention studies are required to clarify to what extent it is possible, by influencing these psychosocial factors, to diminish the SES group differences in PA as well as in health. In addition to interventions concentrating on psychosocial factors, also PA supporting environments, which can benefit the whole population, should be a target of interventions.</p>
