<p>The Organ Transplantation Act, including transplantation of organs from brain-dead donors, entered into force in Korea on February 9, 2000. This article introduces the Organ Transplantation Act, focusing on scope of the Act, determination of brain death, removal of organs from brain-dead or deceased donors, removal from living donors, organ allocation, and prohibition of trade in human organs. Especially, some primary ethical dilemmas surrounding organ allocation arise from the shortage of available organs. The primary ethical problems surrounding organ allocation are as follows. A key purpose of the organ donation incentive system is to increase the number of organ transplants from brain-dead donors. In particular, the priority for kidney patient was allowed in consideration of doctor’s strong desire to increase the brain-dead donors. Also, the organ allocation criteria based on the organ donation incentive system appear unfair, especially for the kidney patient, because the criteria do not fit the principles of distributive justice. In the future, the organ donation incentive system itself may need to be reexamined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Organ Transplantation Act,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539513476935">1</xref></sup> including transplantation of organs from brain-dead donors, entered into force in Korea on February 9, 2000. The present Act was enacted on February 8, 1999, and amended on September 7, 1999, August 26, 2002, September 27, 2006; and May 31, 2010.</p>
<p>Recognizing the issues, the Organ Transplantation Act was revised to encourage organ donation. Under the amendment on September 27, 2006 of the Organ Transplantation Act, as mentioned below, organ donation incentive system was introduced to governmental matching criteria (Article 26). And under the revision on May 31, 2010, Organ Transplantation Act, the Korea Organ Donation Agency (KODA) was established for the purposes of managing organ donation issues (Article 20).</p>
<p>The Organ Transplantation Act will be introduced as follows, focusing on scope of the Act, determination of brain death, removal of organs from brain-dead or deceased donors, removal from living donors, organ allocation, and prohibition of trade in human organs. Especially, some primary ethical dilemmas surrounding organ allocation arise from the shortage of available organs.</p>

<sec id="section2-1010539513476935">
<title>Overview of the Act</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539513476935">
<title>Scope of the Act</title>
<p>The present Act applies not only to organs such as the human kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, lung, and marrows but also to eyeball, pancreas islet, and small intestine (Article 4 Number 1). Even if such organs are listed under the Organ Transplant Act, the Act applies to only the organs removed and transplanted for the purpose of transplant for functional recovery of another person’s organs. The organs are prescribed in the Act under Article 4 Number 1 and Article 5. Therefore, it does not apply to the case of transplantation for cosmetic surgery or autotransplantation for one’s own disease treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539513476935">
<title>Determination of Brain Death</title>
<sec id="section5-1010539513476935">
<title>Total brain death</title>
<p>Under the Organ Transplantation Act, the term <italic>brain death</italic> means a person whose whole brain function is determined to have irreversibly ceased according to brain death determination criteria and procedures (Article 4 Number 5). Therefore, the Act prescribes whole brain death as brain death. However, brain death under the Act can be determined on the request of a patient’s family, or if not, on the request of a physician who was charge of a patient’s medical treatment. Thus, brain death in Korea is not generally approved as a death of person yet, but restrictively approved only in relation with organ removal. In contrast, cardiac death has been traditionally approved as the death of a person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539513476935">
<title>Observation time</title>
<p>The Act provides the brain death determination criteria in detail. The observation time is 6 hours in principle, but 48 hours for a baby between 2 months and 1 year old and 24 hours for a child between 1 and 6 years old.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539513476935">
<title>Brain Death Determination Committee</title>
<p>The determination of brain death is concluded in the Brain Death Determination Committee with majority attendance of committee members, including more than 2 specialists and more than 1 non-doctor member, and unanimous approval (Article 18 Section 2). The Committee is composed of between 4 and 6 members, including more than 2 specialists and more 1 one non-doctor member (Article 16 Section 3). The number is reduced from between 6 and 10 members to between 4 and 6 members. By reducing the number of members comprising the committee, the Brain Death Determination Committee is little more than a name, because it becomes possible for medical insiders to determine brain death. It is suggested that the determination method of brain death by the Brain Death Determination Committee is the product of compromise for swift legislation under the circumstances presenting skepticism for brain death, passiveness to organ donation, distrust on medical practitioners, and so on, at the time of legislation.</p>

<title>Removal of Organs From Deceased Donors</title>
<sec id="section9-1010539513476935">
<title>Restrictively extended consent method</title>
<p>The removal of organs from deceased donors includes brain-dead donors. The removal of organs from brain-dead and deceased donors under the Act can be done only with the consent of donor before brain death or death as well as with no explicit refusal by any bereaved family member (Article 22 Section 3 Number 1). If it is not certain that donor consented to or refused the removal of organs before brain death or death, but his or her bereaved family member agreed with the removal, then the removal of organs from brain-dead and deceased donors can be approved (Article 22 Section 3 Number 2). However, minors younger than 16 years can donate, but only when their parents agree to the removal of organs (Article 22 Section 3 Number 2, conditional clause). The Act adopts “limited but extended consent form,” so-called extended “opt-in” method by requiring the absence of explicit refusal by the family member of the deceased, even if the donor gave consent. It reveals the Korean value system that the organ removal is not possible if the bereaved family member of the deceased refuses in spite of the consent of the deceased donor, emphasizing “we” more than “I.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1010539513476935">
<title>Range and order of the family of the deceased</title>
<p>The Act lists the family member of the deceased in the order of a spouse, lineal descendants, lineal ascendants, siblings, and relatives up to cousins older than 14 years (Article 4 Number 6).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1010539513476935">
<title>Removal of Organs From Living Donors</title>
<sec id="section12-1010539513476935">
<title>Incompetence for donation</title>
<p>Under the Act, the removal of organs from living donors is approved only with consent of the donor (Article 22 Section 1). However, it is prohibited to remove organs from minors younger than 16 years, pregnant women, women who gave birth less than 3 months ago, the mentally handicapped and retarded, and drug addicts (Article 11 Section 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1010539513476935">
<title>Minors</title>
<p>The living donors older than 16 years can donate organs in the same manner as the adults; however, it requires consent from their parents in addition to their own consent (Article 22 Section 1, conditional clause). Moreover, the Act restrictively permits the removal of organs from living donors older than 16 years to protect them only if they donate their organs to a spouse, lineal descendants, lineal ascendants, siblings, and relatives up to cousins, so-called “donation between relatives” (Article 11 Section 4). However, the exception is permitted for bone marrow; therefore, organs can be removed from minors younger than 16 years and donated to a person other than the relatives (Article 11, Section 3, conditional clause). This is because the removal of certain amount of bone marrow, which is reproducible, has little impact on body growth and does not significantly influence one’s life or health and the bone marrow itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1010539513476935">
<title>Range of organs regulated by the Act</title>
<p>The Act extremely limits the range of organs removable from living donors to kidney, liver, bone marrows, and other organs such as pancreas, pancreas islet, and small intestine. Moreover, even these organs are partly permitted to be removed from living donors: 1 of 2 kidneys and within the range medically approved for livers, bone marrows, and other organs as prescribed by the President (Article 11 Section 5).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1010539513476935">
<title>Organ Allocation</title>
<sec id="section16-1010539513476935">
<title>General principle of governmental matching</title>
<p>The Act authorizes the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) to match the organ recipients and donors among the wait-listed recipients according to the matching criteria in principle (Article 26 Section 1). The Act intended to elevate fairness and efficiency of organ allocation and prevent the trade in human organs by centralizing organ allocation through nation-wide organized KONOS, which, before the enforcement of the Act, was performed by hospitals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1010539513476935">
<title>Matching criteria</title>
<p>There are 2 types of matching criteria in the Organ Transplantation Act. One is medical matching criteria and the other is nonmedical matching criteria or the so-called “political matching criteria.”</p>
<p>Organ allocation follows the equal opportunity (Article 2 Section 3) and the medical matching criteria in principle (Article 2 Section 4). Therefore, the matching of organ recipients is automatically determined in order by the computer system (called the Organ Transplant Information System) under the matching criteria considering factors such as organ type, blood type, organ size, distance from the donor organ to the patient, level of medical urgency, time on the waiting list, recipient weight, recipient age, and so on (Article 26 Section 1).</p>
<p>On the contrary, organ allocation criteria include political matching criteria, as mentioned above, so-called organ donation incentive system. According to the organ donation incentive system, first, the brain-dead donor’s relatives are to be given the priority for receiving organs. The range of relatives is limited to spouse, parents, children, brothers and sisters, or relatives within the fourth degree of affinity. The second choice is to allow a registered kidney patient who is on a waiting list in hospital (Hospital-based Organ Procurement Organization or HOPO) for a prospective brain-dead donor. The third choice is a registered kidney patient on a waiting list in hospital finding a prospective brain-dead donor. The fourth is to allow a patient on a waiting list within the same boundary with a prospective brain-dead donor. There are 3 organ transplantation boundaries, namely boundary I, boundary II, and boundary III. These political matching criteria should be examined, as mentioned below, according to the principles of justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1010539513476935">
<title>Exceptions for governmental matching</title>
<p>As an exception, the Act permits a director of the organ transplantation hospital to select the organ recipients if there is any compelling reason such as losing the time of transplantation because of such a delay from the selection of matching recipients such as eyeball (Article 26 Section 2). Moreover, the Act approves living donors older than 16 years and bone marrow donors younger than 20 years to select a recipient by themselves with the approval of the Executive Director of the KONOS in advance as an exception (Article 22 Section 3). In this case, so-called “direct donation” is allowed. This is a special and characteristic clause to respect the will of donors and to encourage organ donation. However, the approval of the Executive Director of the KONOS is required to prohibit the supply of organs with improper or illegal motivation such as trade of human organs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1010539513476935">
<title>Prohibition of Trade in Human Organs</title>
<p>Any kind of acts in trade of human organs is prohibited under the Organ Donation Act; moreover, the Act prohibits even any act related to instigation, intercession, and abetment (Article 7). Trading of human organs means the acts to provide and receive organs in return of any monetary or financial interest or to promise to do so (Article 7 Section 1). The Act does not include any exceptional clause related to trade in human organs; nevertheless, the Act is interpreted in a way that actual reimbursement, including surgery and medical fee for organ removal, hospital fee during recovery period, loss of daily earnings, funeral expenses, and corpse transport expenses are not kinds of trading acts. The Act punishes the physicians who removed organs as well as the physicians who transplanted them in the same manner (Article 7 Section 3).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1010539513476935">
<title>Suffering Problems and Perspectives of the Act</title>
<p>According to statistics of KONOS, the number of people on the waiting list had increased exponentially to 17 055 in 2009 from 5343 in 2000, 6869 in 2001 and 17 412 in 2008. Although the number of organ donors has gradually grown from 1361 in 2000, 1772 in 2001, 2781 in 2008, to 2973 in 2009, organ donation still falls far short of organ demand and need.</p>
<sec id="section21-1010539513476935">
<title>Korea Organ Donation Agency</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the Organ Transplantation Act established the Korea Organ Donation Agency (KODA), the so-called Independent Organ Procurement Organization or IOPO, for the purposes of managing organ donation issues (Article 20).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539513476935">2</xref></sup> As a result, we hope that the Act will give an opportunity to provide organ transplant to all recipients who are in need. In addition, the transplant act was revised to actively procure organs from brain-dead patients by having the head of hospital where the brain-patient is being treated to report KODA of potential brain-dead patients. The revised provision is crucial and it is not an overstatement that it will decide the future of the Organ Donation Act. Taking these into account, we need to put our heads together to make the institution of organ donation take firm root in Korea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1010539513476935">
<title>Current Organ Allocation Policy</title>
<p>The primary ethical problems surrounding organ allocation are as follows. A key purpose of the organ donation incentive system is to increase the number of organ transplants from brain-dead donors. Especially, the priority for kidney patient was allowed in consideration of doctor’s strong desire to increase the number of brain-dead donors. Because of the organ donation incentive system, the number of brain-dead donors had increased to 256 in 2008 from 148 in 2007. However, the organ donation incentive system did not operate as expected. The number of brain-dead donors had increased only to 261 in 2009 and to 268 in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539513476935">3</xref></sup> Also, the organ allocation criteria based on the organ donation incentive system appear unfair, especially for the kidney patient. The above criteria are not fit for distributive justice principles, namely, to each person an equal share, to each person according to need, to each person according to effort, to each person according to contribution, to each person according to merit, and to each person according to free-market exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539513476935">4</xref></sup> Moreover, the aforementioned organ transplantation boundary is to be replaced by the geographic distance from the donor organ to the patient. The above criteria are not introduced for patients but for doctors or hospitals. Policies must be aimed at increasing organ donations and also creating a system that allocates them in the fairest way possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539513476935">5</xref></sup> In the future, the organ donation incentive system itself may need to be reexamined.</p>
