<p><italic>Belonging in an Adopted World</italic> explores the practice of transnational adoption and examines the complex interplay of meanings arising out of this experience for adoptive parents, birth parents and adoptees whose adoption and relocation signify the crossing of both geographic and sociocultural boundaries. The focus of the book is on children who have been moved from less developed countries (such as Ethiopia, Columbia, India and Korea) to Euro-American countries largely to fulfil wealthier first-world families’ desires for family completion. As white adoptable children have become fewer in number, interest in seeking out unwanted, racially different, children from ‘outside the nation’ has increased. Sweden is placed under the spotlight in the book both because it is the author’s country of origin and because of the very high proportion of adopted children entering the country since the 1980s. The author raises critical concerns about the extent to which foreign children are truly able to become fully integrated citizens in a relatively racially homogeneous country such as Sweden. Simultaneously, she raises questions about the transformative and unsettling effects that large numbers of ethnically diverse adopted children can have on both adoptive families and the ethos of the society itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580912452369">Marre and Briggs, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The book begins sensitively with a focus on a letter written by a young birth mother who explains why she gave up her child for adoption. In this narrative, the anguished mother expresses her deep love for her child but claims that a lack of social and economic support compelled her to give him up. While Yngvesson maintains that the reasons mothers might abandon their children are various, the ‘relinquishment narrative’ is of extreme interest and becomes a focal point for many adopted children who return as adults to the land of their birth to probe reasons why they were given up for adoption, and to search for some connection with a pre-adoptive heritage. The author’s own approach as an adoptive parent has been to recognize the place of her son’s birth parents and to, rather than make them invisible, attempt to build a progressive, amicable and purposeful relationship with them. The book is fascinating in the way that it sustains the allure of the child’s birth family and in the way it disconnects and reconnects the birth family to the adoptive family at different points in the child’s life trajectory.</p>
<p>The author draws on her rich ethnographic work and presents the stories of numerous adoptees, who, although emotionally bonded to their legal (adoptive) families, feel some ‘pull’ towards a motherland that they either never knew or have only vague memories of. Clearly, the search for a hidden, mystical past is partly driven by emerging anxieties of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580912452369">Antze and Lambek, 1996</xref>). Thus, the narratives offer a lens into the contradictions of Euro-American societies, e.g. legal contentions and discourses that reiterate the promise of inclusion and belonging but strong sentiments of adoptees who express feelings of marginality and exclusion in their countries of adoption – these ambiguities, as Yngvesson suggests, lead adopted young people to view themselves as being ‘both within and outside the family and nation’ (p.124). She also expresses scepticism about assumptions that sociopsychological problems of adopted children are a consequence of their pre-adoptive years (the ‘early disturbances’) rather than the sociological realities of the adoptive family and the contradictions of the nation (the ‘post-adoptive relations’).</p>
<p>The large number of adoptees introduced in the book include Yngvesson’s son, Finn, Sara Nordin, Maria Andersson, Kanthi Grunewald, Mattias Kollberg, Hanna Wallensteen, Daniel Rosenlind, among many others. We are also introduced to the ways in which their adoptive parents dealt with questions about the origins of the child and ‘who the real mother is’. Additionally, we envision parents who exhibit the cherished ideals of non-racialism and social justice but whose adopted children are often in a state of deep emotional turmoil in contending with experiences of racism and otherness. The processes involved in converting the foreign child into one that is ‘fully Swedish’ are complex and often incoherent – successful conversion also entails that the child must be dissociated from the immigrant that resides in Sweden (the immigrant, who is often of the same ethnic and national origin as the child). As Yngvesson suggests, the presence of immigrants ‘unsettles pictures they have formed of themselves as Swedish’ and this leads to ripostes such as ‘I, too, am a kind of immigrant’ (p.141).</p>
<p>As suggested earlier, the stories the adoptees tell reveal moments of great curiosity and longing for links with their pasts, but some of this reconnecting seems to happen as they marry and become parents themselves. There is mention, for example, of Sofia Berzelius, who gave her child an Ethiopian middle name, ‘Abeba’ (derived from Addis Abba) and Anna Chuchu Petersson, who married in Stockholm and then went on to have a wedding celebration in Ethiopia as well – with her newly discovered birth family. The theme of searching for biological and cultural roots is a common one in adoption literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580912452369">Kim, 2010</xref>) and the author places emphasis on moments of confusion or of non-identity when adopted children feel ‘split’ between two selves, and on the transformative power of the journey of discovery and the final coming to terms with belonging in two countries and assorted networks of kin.</p>
<p>The concerns that are raised in the book about the foreign child’s fit in a reconstituted kinship network and new social environment tease out interesting issues regarding adoption policy and political attitudes on both sides of the global divide. Some attention is given in the book to child welfare policy in sending countries that was shaped in response to the rapid growth in the number of child adoptions and to critical sentiments about the need to protect children as national resources and not to reduce sending countries to ‘markets for babies’. Most efforts of states to limit transnational adoption, inhibit child abandonment and encourage domestic adoption have stood in tension against the huge demand for adopted children from developing countries and the substantial numbers of children in need of family care. In India, for example, potential adoptive parents did not readily reach out to the ‘stranger child’, thus implying that unwanted Indian children remained without familial connections (and thus, an important resource for foreign adoptions).</p>
<p>On the whole, the strength of <italic>Belonging in an Adopted World</italic> lies in the way the different stories come together thematically to illuminate a rich and detailed account of adoptees’ emotions, dilemmas, memories and belonging in the current era. It is a moving and well-written book that adds to a growing number of scholarly works now available on transnational adoption. Sociologists, however, might note two shortcomings. The first is the limited integration of social theory. While there is much descriptive and critical reflection on individual subjectivities, there are few efforts to engage theoretically with them. Erik Erikson’s insights on identity development resonate in the text but some integration of macro-sociological perspectives or gender analysis would have been useful. Second, I was hoping to hear more of the adoptive parents’ voices as well, e.g. their initial motivations for wanting to adopt a foreign child. Stronger exploration of parental desires for adopting foreign children and reflection in this regard would have helped build understanding of why ‘markets for babies’ remain popular and resilient. Generally, there was insufficient interrogation of the adoptive parental responses to the multiple dilemmas facing their children and their own transitions and ‘ruptures’ over time as their adopted children began to reach out for their birth families. This said, I found the book extremely enjoyable and insightful and would highly recommend it for family sociologists, sociologists studying the changing dynamics of race in the global domain and practitioners working in the adoption and child welfare fields.</p>
