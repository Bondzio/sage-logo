<abstract>
<p>The authors describe the development of a campus-based radio show about psychological science. The authors’ goals in creating the show were to inform the public about the science of psychology and to create a teaching and learning resource for faculty members and students. The show, <italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic>, airs twice a week and consists of 2-minute summaries of research and theory. Issues related to show format, medium, and script writing are discussed. The authors also present ways in which they have used this show as an activity in their courses as well as for faculty development.</p>

<p>Psychologists made their first appearance on radio over 80 years ago. The earliest psychology-related programming appeared on WEAF, in New York, in September 1927. The show included weekly talks about children with titles such as <italic>Child Study Talk</italic>, <italic>Concerning Parents</italic>, and <italic>Parents Talk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430311">Behrens, 2009</xref>). By the 1950s, therapy call-in shows were on-air fixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430311">Bouhoutsos, Goodchilds, &amp; Huddy, 1986</xref>) and Dr. Joyce Brothers was an American icon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430311">Behrens, 2009</xref>). Although call-in shows are occasionally criticized for the voyeuristic nature of on-air therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430311">McGarrah, Alvord, Martin, &amp; Haldeman, 2009</xref>), the shows can spark interest in psychology, provide listeners with access to experts, and offer a behind-the-scenes look at therapy.</p>
<p>Compared with call-in therapy shows, there have been fewer radio programs focused specifically on psychological research and theory. This type of show represents an opportunity to “give psychology away,” an initiative of the American Psychological Association (APA) first voiced by APA president George Miller in 1969. Miller argued that psychologists have largely been ineffective communicating research findings to the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430311">Miller, 1969</xref>). More recently, Cialdini (2007) reiterated Miller’s admonishment, stating, “the larger society, which has paid for social science, deserves a fuller and more meaningful exposure to what social scientists have learned with its money” (p. 675). Cialdini also noted that “media presentations of scientific activities give the activities legitimacy in the public eye” (p. 677).</p>
<p>With a goal of focusing on the research of social scientists, we created a radio show that provides listeners with palatable overviews of classic and contemporary psychological studies. The show emphasizes the scientific foundations of psychology, and we hope that it broadens the public’s perception of the role of psychologists. In our show, we highlight the science of psychology for the general public and work to dispel stereotypes of psychologists as solely focused on clinical work. Additionally, we wanted to create another outlet for faculty members to write and share their specific interests within psychology. As we have continued producing the show over time, we have also discovered several different ways to use it as a teaching tool within our courses.</p>

<title>Creating the Show</title>
<p>
<italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic> is a weekly radio show consisting of 2-minute summaries of psychological studies. Minnesota State University, Mankato Psychology Department faculty members write scripts representing a cross-section of psychological disciplines. The format of the show was inspired by public radio programs such as <italic>A Moment in Time</italic> and <italic>Earth and Sky</italic>. These shows air on public radio stations and include short lessons about advances in science, as well as interviews with scientists. <italic>A Moment in Time</italic> is a 2-minute history show produced in association with the University of Richmond (http://www.amomentintime.com) and hosted by Dan Roberts. <italic>Earth and Sky</italic> (http://earthsky.org) is a 90-second show covering a wide variety of topics, including water, energy, earth, biodiversity, health agriculture, and space. Although the Internet offers inexpensive broadcast and interesting mixed-media opportunities, there is still a need for radio-based shows. Unlike a blog or Web site where viewers “go to the broadcast,” radio shows “go to the listeners.” Radio shows reach out to people in their cars, offices, and homes. The advantage of radio is that we can wedge a psychology lesson between music and news and educate the public when they least expect it.</p>
<p>We began by working with KMSU, a college radio station affiliated with our university. KMSU is an FM public radio station and is characteristic of state university radio stations. The station serves a geographic area of approximately 350,000 people within a 50-mile radius. The station manager explained that his station, similar to many college radio stations, was interested in developing partnerships with academic departments and expanding the type of programming available to listeners. We started without a budget, so we were fortunate that KMSU was willing to allow us to use its recording studio at no charge, as well as being willing to give us free airtime. Working with the generous staff at KMSU allowed us to create and distribute this show without costs.</p>
<p>Next, we developed a show template to help faculty members write scripts. We set a 300-word limit on scripts, which keeps the show time at 2 minutes. Each show begins with an interesting question or provocative statement designed to catch the attention of the audience. The segments include summaries of specific studies with descriptions of the research methods and data collected. We ask writers to mention the names and institutional affiliations of study authors, to help listeners to understand the role research institutions play in the scientific process. We also ask that writers discuss the implications of the studies and any applications to the real world.</p>
<p>Finally, we reminded faculty members to consider the APA guidelines for ethical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430311">American Psychological Association, 2002</xref>) when writing scripts. It is important to write within our competence, that statements we make be accurate, and that all content be based on “appropriate psychological literature and practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430311">American Psychological Association, 2002</xref>, p. 1069). Fortunately, a scripted radio show helps contributors avoid some of the ethical pitfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430311">McGarrah et al., 2009</xref>) of call-in and interview radio shows. Scripted shows are also less likely to be affected by the whims of an editor or the confessions of a caller.</p>
<p>To ensure that the show would have a consistent voice, one faculty member volunteered to take on the process of recording all the scripts. She worked with our radio station to learn how to use the equipment and record shows. We ask faculty members to turn in two scripts every semester, and we record with regularity to avoid backup.</p>
<p>
<italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic> began airing in February 2010, and we air new episodes throughout the academic year and reruns in the summer. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430311">Table 1</xref>

<title>Evaluation and Assessment of <italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic>
</title>
<p>To evaluate our shows, 43 students listened to a selection of radio shows and rated them in terms of clarity, how interesting the shows were, and how much they wanted to hear more radio shows about psychology. Students rated the clarity of the shows an average of 4.20 on a scale of 1 (<italic>not at all clear</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very clear</italic>) and rated the interest of the shows an average of 4.31 on a scale of 1 (<italic>not interesting</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very interesting</italic>), demonstrating that the shows were easy to understand and interesting to the students. Additionally, when asked how much they were interested in hearing more radio shows about psychology, students gave an average rating of 4.19 on a scale of 1 (<italic>not interested in hearing more</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very interested in hearing more</italic>), which highlights the usefulness of these shows as an engaging teaching tool. We have also solicited community feedback through our radio show’s Web site, but to date we have not received any nonstudent feedback about the shows. We continue to publicize our show in local news outlets and on the KMSU radio station, to encourage the community to both listen and respond with their reactions via our Web site, so that we can gather community assessment data about the response to the show. As we gain feedback, we can include topics in demand and work to fit the show with the interests of the community.</p>
<p>We have also adapted the process of script writing into an undergraduate assignment to aid in the teaching of psychology. First, students identify potential articles from the literature relevant to the areas they are studying in class and submit the abstracts and citation information for these articles as well as a rationale for why they think each would make an interesting show. This portion of the assignment provides an excellent opportunity to review how to identify peer-reviewed sources. For each student, the course instructor chooses one article to develop further, and the student writes a detailed summary of the article in his or her own words, which is then peer reviewed by other students in class. This step in the assignment also lends itself to discussions of the intricacies of plagiarism and how to avoid it when writing about the work of others. Finally, the students use the script template to write scripts and create audio recordings of their shows. The instructor grades the scripts, and the class listens to and rates the audio files. The script ranked highest by both the class and instructor is edited and submitted for inclusion on <italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic>, offering undergraduates a well-earned line on their curricula vitae as well as contributing to the diversity of show topics. The primary benefit of this assignment was that students reported on course evaluations becoming more confident with paraphrasing academic work. When examining their drafts, the instructor noted that early drafts of their radio shows were stilted and did a poor job of effectively communicating the material without directly copying the language in the articles. As students worked through the process of peer reviewing one another’s drafts, their writing became clearer, and they successfully translated the research into their own words.</p>
<p>Faculty participation has been extensive, with almost every department faculty member contributing multiple scripts. This participation is essential to the success of the show, and we are pleased that faculty members have been supportive. Indeed, we have found that writing scripts is a challenging and useful exercise. It can be difficult to summarize a study, present data, and describe interesting applications in clear, easy-to-understand language, all in less than 300 words. However, script writing is useful practice for psychologists who need to translate their work for students and the public. Because we find script writing a good developmental exercise, we are now inviting our graduate students to write scripts for the show. In addition, faculty members can include their script writing as a line on their curricula vitae in terms of both writing and department service, which also helps motivate participation.</p>
<p>Currently, we have been keeping up with producing content for the show: Faculty members continue to write scripts, and as more graduate and undergraduate students gain this experience, they are becoming an important source of scripts also. As we listen to one another’s shows, we are learning more about all areas of psychology and the diverse interests represented in our department, and we have a unique resource for our courses as well. We feel that Internet- and radio-based shows are one valid way to give psychology away to the public, and we are pleased with the continuing success of <italic>Psychological Frontiers</italic>.</p>
