<abstract>
<p>The objective of this article is to investigate learning in museums through the lens of John Dewey’s philosophy of education and experiential learning. The influence of Dewey’s philosophy of education is widespread and resounding. In this article, I examine the experiential qualities of Dewey’s philosophy and compare it with the objectives of the museum educational experience, explaining the relevance to adult education. There can be no doubt that museums are unique arenas for learning, made rich by the experiential nature of their environment. They have a long history of educating the public through informal and nonformal learning. Through their interactive nature, museums have the power to confront individuals’ schemata and transform the way people view the world. Recent museum educational theory focuses on the social, personal, and physical interactions that combine to create meaningful learning experiences. Museums are often not given the consideration they deserve as meaningful centers for learning, especially in adult education. It is my hope that through a discussion of Dewey’s educational philosophy and its implications for museum learning theory, I can illustrate the relevance of museums as alternative sites of learning for adult educators.</p>

<p>The objective of this article is to investigate learning in museums through the lens of John Dewey’s philosophy of education and experiential learning. The influence of Dewey’s philosophy of education is widespread and resounding. Two fundamental questions guide this article: What are the links between adult education and museum learning? Why is there not more integration between museums and adult education? In this article, I examine the experiential qualities of Dewey’s philosophy and compare it with the objectives of the museum educational experience, explaining the relevance to adult education.</p>
<p>When I was in Vietnam, I had the opportunity to visit the Cucci tunnels museum. This outdoor museum portrayed a view of history I had not considered—the Vietcong as victors in the Vietnam War. The museum included parts of hidden tunnels stretching some 250 kilometers, reaching all the way to Cambodia. They were three-levels deep, complete with kitchens, rooms, and secret entrances. I was able to see and touch a variety of weapons, and their effects through pictures, including homemade grenades and pits with spikes inside. With the aid of guides, visitors can crawl through the tiny, pitch black tunnels if they dare, stand in gigantic bomb craters, eat in an underground dining room, and try to find the entrances from above. I could barely fit in the tunnels, and could feel the terror big American soldiers must have experienced going through them blind. The 100 meters I crawled through were certainly enough for me. Not only did my preconceived notions of the Vietnam War shift, but so did my interpretation of the world.</p>
<p>The learning experience I just described was an experiential process that involved a guide who facilitated my physical interaction with the environment and social surroundings to help me form a unique and memorable learning experience. The experience enabled me to interact with my previous experience of learning about the Vietnam War, challenging my preconceived notions of history, and provided continuity of experience as I developed a new and more critical way of interpreting both historical and current events.</p>
<p>Museums have a long history of educating the public through informal and nonformal learning. Through their interactive nature, they have the power to confront individuals’ schemata and transform the way people view the world. Recent museum educational theory focuses on the social, personal, and physical interactions that combine to create learning experiences for adults such as the one described above. Museums are often not given the consideration they deserve as meaningful centers for learning, especially in adult education. It is my hope that through a discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey’s (1966)</xref> educational philosophy and its implications for museum learning theory, I can illustrate the relevance of museums to adult education. Museums are a vast resource that adult educators should be cognizant of, promote, and make greater use of through field trips. Findings from this review suggest there is room for greater coordination of adult educational theory in museums, and Dewey’s theory of experiential learning could be a good place to start.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that although museums are inherently experiential in nature, many museums do not engage the learner to provide a continuity and interaction of experience which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey (1963)</xref>, is a vital part of learning. Learners should be given the space to reflect on their past experiences to challenge the status quo and think critically about new experiences in the future. The role of the museum curator in facilitating such thought is much like that of a teacher in a classroom and is extremely important. Similarly, adult education theory teaches critical thought, reflection, and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159513477842">Freire, 1968</xref>). Museums are an often overlooked educational tool for adult educators, and increased interaction between the two fields would prove beneficial to both. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey’s (1963)</xref> focus is primarily on how children learn, the experiential nature can also be interpreted as relevant to adult learning.</p>
<sec id="section1-1045159513477842">
<title>Theoretical Foundations: John Dewey and Experiential Learning</title>
<p>John Dewey’s educational theory was extremely influential in the 20th century and remains significant today. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">John Dewey (1966)</xref> claimed his philosophy of education is based on a social need and is defined as “an explicit formulation of the problems of the formation of right mental and moral habitudes in respect to the difficulties of contemporary social life” (p. 331). He considers philosophy of education to be the theory of life. This is not to say that philosophy and education are coterminous, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159513477842">Noddings (2007)</xref> pointed out, for Dewey it was the most important branch of philosophy because all others depend on it in some manner. Therefore, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref>, education becomes intertwined with moral and social goods. He highlights the importance of education, including social aspects such as occupations of the household, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and intercourse “so as to enable the coming generation to acquire a comprehension now too generally lacking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1966</xref>, p. 275). Education is about providing tools for individuals to grow, live, and contribute to society.</p>
<p>In <italic>Democracy and Education</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref> criticized traditional educational practice as “teaching by pouring in, learning by a passive absorption” (p. 36). He interpreted learning as a social process through which the mature should impart knowledge and skills to make the young successful in life. He claims learning is a process that depends on students establishing meaning in what they learn. Dewey suggested schools should encourage greater opportunity for the active participation of the students, so they can achieve a social sense of their own powers. He warns the tendency of the teacher risked being one of enforcer rather than a guide or facilitator in traditional schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey (1963)</xref> cautioned that because of the traditional method of teaching and the lack of student input in lessons, students are less able to relate, become passive, and thus learning is sacrificed. He claims that in such cases, the gap between adult experiences and those of the young is “so wide that the very situation forbids much active participation by pupils in the development of what is being taught” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1963</xref>, p. 17). Through greater student involvement, this assumed gap can be removed. Similarly, in <italic>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic>, adult educator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159513477842">Paulo Freire (1968)</xref>, suggested too often teachers view students’ minds as empty vessels to be filled in the same manner that money is deposited in a bank account.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey (1963)</xref> reinforced that learning depends on the quality of an experience. He explained the activity can either be initiated by the environment or individual. He noted learning does not necessarily involve only the subject matter but can take place on several levels. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref>, the concept of prior knowledge and experience of the individual and the society is very important. He highlights continuity and interaction as being prime aspects of experiential learning and explains experience is<disp-quote>
<p>no longer a mere summarizing of what has been done in a more or less chance way in the past; it is a deliberate control of what is done with reference to making what happens to us and what we do to things as fertile as possible of suggestions (of suggested meanings) and a means for trying out the validity of the suggestions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1966</xref>, p. 273)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This means experience is experimental and involves the interaction of past experiences with the present situation as well as between people and their natural and social environment. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref>, learning is a process whereby the individual reacts to, learns from, and builds on experiences. He posited experiences are continuous in that they build on each other, each one affecting future experiences. Continuity signifies that each experience influences a person whether it is for better or for worse. Therefore, the educator is responsible to see where the experience is heading and to guide the learner appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1963</xref>). To accomplish this, Dewey believed the educator must have knowledge of the individual and social environment and considered all experiences to be essentially social involving interaction, contact, and communication with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref> attested the learning experience is essentially a mental one so, while active or even physical involvement is important, learning will not take place unless there is understanding of what it consists of, why one is performing the action, and how it interacts with past experiences. Dewey explained this meaning can be made by thinking about what is done, for what purpose, and with what consequences. Therefore, reflection is an important aspect of a learning experience, especially when considering continuity of experience. Dewey was clear that learning is formed through the continuity and interaction of experiences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref> emphasized the social nature of learning and explained the importance of the educator’s role. As a facilitator of learning experiences, the educator enables the learner to reflect on the outcomes of a current situation based on past experience, and form new knowledge and skills as instruments of understanding to effectively deal with situations in the future. Dewey was critical of traditional schools because they deposit information in the minds of passive learners. In this situation, educators risk becoming enforcers rather than facilitating experiences that are relevant to the learner, which challenge them to think and construct knowledge for themselves.</p>
<p>Similarly, while museums are experiential in nature, the manner in which traditional museums convey information is often static, simply depositing <italic>facts</italic> to the passive learner. To create a meaningful and engaging learning experience, museums stand to learn from Dewey’s theory of education. Curators and docents assume the role of educators and have the responsibility to facilitate significant learning experiences that encourage reflection and interaction of experiences and foster continuity through growth.</p>

<title>Linking Dewey, Adult Learning, and Museum Education</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, Dewey’s experiential learning theory is primarily focused on children, but his theory of experiential learning also embodies adult learning principles. In this section, I outline some of the theory behind learning in museums. To clarify the importance of museums as alternative learning sites for adult educators, I make links to adult learning theory in museums.</p>
<p>Museums are an important resource often overlooked by adult educators. Dewey believed museums are important learning spaces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477842">Hein (2004)</xref> outlined some of the direct references that Dewey made to education in museums. He explained, “Dewey consistently described the ideal school as an institution that includes libraries and museums in an organic whole in which life-experiences and specialized-experiences such as reading and museum visits are unified” (p. 418). Hein also pointed out the Laboratory Schools set-up by Dewey made substantial use of museums in education. Dewey was critical of traditional museums to the same degree he was critical of traditional schools. Museums that simply convey <italic>facts</italic> do not engage visitors to make meaning of the learning experience or challenge them to think. In addition, they risk imposing the <italic>facts</italic> from the point of view of hegemonic social forces. Hein notes, that for Dewey, the ideal museum would reflect life experiences outside of the school or museum and suggested that therein lay the challenge for museums today.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477842">Ansbacher (1998)</xref> emphasized the quality of experience, as discussed by Dewey, is important for learning to take place in museums. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477842">Hein (1998)</xref> established learning in museums should be an interactive process between the visitor and the exhibition and, therefore, must consider the experience and prior knowledge of the individual. “We see a combination of meaning making based on the interests and background the visitors bring with them and visitor reaction to the topics and objects provided by the museum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477842">Hein, 1998</xref>, p. 147).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor (2010)</xref>, an adult education theorist, discussed informal learning in museums. He defines informal learning for adults in museums as “the incidental unplanned and unconscious learning that is most prevalent as visitors wander around” (p. 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor (2010)</xref> referred to informal learning in a museum as incidental, unplanned, and unconscious in terms of no guide or set tour, rather visitors approach and engage with exhibits on their own. The learner does not rely on another to explain a meaning, but interprets meaning for self. The process involves numerous factors, including motivation for visiting the museum, prior knowledge, and exhibit arrangement. Therefore, the layout and method by which the museum’s exhibition captures attention and communicates with the visitor is vital to the informal learning experience. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159513477842">Bradburne (2001)</xref> provided an excellent example of how exhibit labeling can make a difference. In a display case containing glasses, one label read “glasses throughout the century” (p. 79) and another read “one of these glasses is fake” (p. 80). The second label elicited more learner concentration and engagement with the exhibit.</p>
<p>Based on extensive research on adult learning in museums, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> concluded, “the extent to which museum programs are successful can indeed be measured by their ability to affect, inform, empower and change people and, in doing so, help them improve themselves” (p. 19). Therefore, the curator has the responsibility to create an experience that will engage visitors to think critically and make new meaning and knowledge they can use in future situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor (2010)</xref> cautioned curators need to consider whose story they tell through the exhibition. To engage the visitor and promote new thinking and interaction, museums must carefully select the material they use and how it is displayed. In presenting new and perhaps shocking information, museums hold the responsibility of doing so in an accurate fashion. Histories have a tendency to side with hegemonic power portraying the dominant forces in history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor (2010)</xref> clarified the need for an exhibition to include careful consideration of history, so that it includes multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Drawing on Freire’s critical theory, the adult education theorists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159513477842">Mayo and Borg (2010)</xref> referred to museums as arenas of critical pedagogy for adults whereby the visitors’ assumptions of power relations and dominant cultures are challenged and their perspectives changed. “These exhibits can serve as instruments to arouse epistemological curiosity, as Paulo Freire would argue . . . The process would therefore be one that is not static but dynamic, in the classic Freirean and critical pedagogical sense” (p. 41). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477842">Ansbacher (1998)</xref> explained the job of the exhibit developer, much like teachers for Dewey, involves understanding the community and the learners to facilitate the best learning experience for the visitor. Dewey (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477842">Archambault, 1964</xref>) would most certainly agree as he is critical of <italic>traditional schools</italic> for not reflecting social norms and imposing “adult standards, subject matter and methods upon those who are only growing slowly toward maturity.” (p. 19). He suggests schools should represent real life and education should be a process rather than a preparation for future living.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits . . . but is there as a member of a community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these influences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159513477842">Dewey, 1897</xref>, p. 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another important similarity between Dewey’s philosophy and museum learning is the combination of physical interaction and mental processing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477842">Dewey (1966)</xref> wrote educational experience is active, but the value of an experience is derived from the mental process of interpretation and development of meaning in the experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477842">Ansbacher (1998)</xref> correspondingly pointed out that learning in museums cannot occur strictly through interaction, but also requires reflection on the experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477842">Hein (1998)</xref> suggested “social interaction allows learners to go beyond their individual experience, to extend their own knowledge and even their ability to learn” (p. 172). Similarly, adult educator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159513477842">Grenier (2010)</xref> referred to the interaction between visitors and the museum exhibit as play, explaining the potential of such interaction in museums “lies in the possibility of engaging adult visitors in learning and reflection on museum content and context” (p. 83).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159513477842">Heimlich (1993)</xref> defined nonformal learning as “any organized intentional and explicit effort to promote learning to enhance the quality of life through non-school settings” (p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor and Neill’s (2008)</xref> research on nonformal adult learning in museums established that museums are unique learning environments for several reasons. For example, people who attend museum events or take tours have the option to come and go as they please and the time allotted for instruction is shorter. Therefore, a method of teaching different from the traditional classroom is needed. E. W. Taylor and Neill suggest docents and lecturers need to be aware of visitors’ interests and ensure they provide an entertaining and meaningful experience. This involves a dialogical learning process, whereby the visitor is an active participant. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159513477842">E. W. Taylor and Neill (2008)</xref> contended learning that takes place in situ augments the experience by “bringing to life the inherent connection between the site/objects and the setting or natural environment” (p. 27). The role of the educator is to interpret the context for the visitor. This is not unlike Dewey’s observation that the individual who is to be educated is linked to the society from which he or she learns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477842">Archambault, 1964</xref>). For Dewey, education is a social process and the school<disp-quote>
<p>is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477842">Archambault, 1964</xref>, p. 430)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159513477842">Falk and Dierking’s (1992)</xref> Interactive Experience Model demonstrates how interactive learning takes place in museums. The model depicts three intersecting ovals—personal, social, and physical contexts—with interactive experience at the intersection. They use the term <italic>interactive</italic> to define how the different factors affect each other. The personal context involves motivation and expectations, prior knowledge, interests and beliefs, and choice and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159513477842">Falk &amp; Dierking, 2000</xref>). The social context includes group sociocultural mediation and facilitated mediation by others. The physical context involves advance organizers and orientation, design and reinforcing events, and experiences outside the museum. The personal, social, and physical factors affect each other and contribute to the overall learning experience. To the extent possible, the curator should consider the variables when designing exhibits and the layout of the museum. Dewey also emphasizes the significance of these factors in the design of a learning experience. How these factors interact with each other will be different for each museum and audience; however, they need to be considered to facilitate a meaningful learning experience.</p>
<p>To consider how Dewey would view adult learning in museums, let us revisit the museum experience at the Gucci tunnels through the lens of Dewey’s theory of education. First, Dewey would most likely agree with the nature of this particular museum because of the engaging nature of the exhibit. I was able to physically experience and actively learn by touching armaments, crawling through tunnels, and trying to find the hidden entrances. This physical experience was combined with the guide’s narrative explaining the nature of the war, length of the tunnels, use of the weapons, and other relevant information about living styles. Throughout the experience, the guide asked stimulating questions, checking to see what we knew and our impressions. Our guide encouraged us to take time to reflect. For example, we stood in a 30-foot-wide bomb crater and imagined the resulting damage. We climbed into a camouflaged pit full of spikes and contemplated the terror one would feel of falling into one. Thus, the experience was a mental and physical process, involving a high degree of participation by the visitor in the learning experience.</p>
<p>Dewey would applaud the planning involved in this experience. The museum was clearly intended for an audience familiar with a Western portrayal of the Vietnam War. It took into account preconceived notions of history and challenged the visitor to rethink this history from the point of view of the Vietcong. It considered previous experiences of visitors and facilitated new knowledge-making through active mental and physical engagement.</p>
<p>In terms of continuity of learning, it is difficult to evaluate as we were not explicitly encouraged to think about other wars or hegemonic tales of history. However, it is not such a large step to take and the experience provided the tools to rethink different histories and critically evaluate current and future events, for example the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, in a different light.</p>
<p>While this was an invaluable personal experience, Dewey’s theory of education offers two possible improvements to the learning experience. The first improvement is to include a space for visitors to reflect on their experience and explicitly consider the implications for understanding other situations. This could be accomplished through a discussion facilitated by the guide at the end of the tour or a questionnaire or pamphlet with questions given to the visitor, and would provide greater continuity to the experience. Second, some form of feedback from the visitors would include the learner to a greater degree in the learning environment. Dewey contends the educator should be aware of the social environment and background of the learner and suggests learner participation in the experience is important. While the experience was geared toward Western tourists, it is not apparent how the target audience was discovered and if Westerners are really the only visitors. I wonder if the same meaning is made by Vietnamese or visitors of other non-Western backgrounds. A brief questionnaire asking who people are, where they are from, and what they liked and did not like about the museum would accomplish both these tasks. At the same time, a few questions about what was learned would give the visitor an opportunity to reflect.</p>

<title>Historical Changes in Perspective on and Practice of Adult Education in Museums</title>
<p>Museums are institutions of knowledge, representing the freedom to learn for all. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477842">Anderson (1995)</xref> explained Henry Cole was a pioneer in adult education because of his development of adult learning programs in museums in England in the 1850s. Museums were “a massive experiment in public education, of which adult education was the principal part” (p. 15). Anderson documented how Cole opened museums to the public for the first time and integrated them with the national network of schools of public art. Students in these schools were “from Japanners to governesses among females, and from shoe-makers to surgeons among males” (p. 17). According to Anderson, Cole also introduced extension activities in the form of public lectures and demonstrations with mandatory contributions from professors. Cole’s program was used as a model for adult learning until it lost popularity due to a shift toward the formal education sector around the beginning of the 20th century. “The administrators . . . placed their hopes instead on the rapidly developing formal education sector as a better means to achieve their social and industrial goals” (p. 20). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159513477842">Hooper-Greenhill (1991)</xref> confirmed that during the 19th century, education was the prime function of the museum, but by the 1920s, a new generation of curators was less interested in the public use of museums and more interested in the accumulation of collections.</p>
<p>Once again, adult educators are directing their attention to the potential learning experiences that museums can offer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477842">Hein (1998)</xref> explained “for a variety of reasons, ranging from changing definitions of learning and pressures on museums to justify their existence to expanding socio-political roles of museums in increasingly self-conscious societies, museum education is increasing in significance” (p. 9). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045159513477842">Mark Taylor (1995)</xref> suggested museums offer adult education a critical opportunity to convey their message using exciting concepts and imaginative approaches to objects within museum collections. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> stated “the nature of museum learning is indeed broad, rich and multifaceted” (p. xviii). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159513477842">Hooper-Greenhill (1995)</xref> described the range of activities offered as “extensive, varying from short one-off drop in sessions for families to year-long accredited courses for serious students” (p. 35).</p>
<p>Some practical examples are outlined here to serve as models for adult practitioners to recognize the richness of museums as alternative spaces of learning and incorporate museum trips in the curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> identified the most common types of museum programs as docent training, lectures, and guided tours. Activities at science museums might include field trips, gallery demonstrations, and workshops, while art or history museums offer performing arts events, symposia, and film series. These examples are typified as <italic>bread and butter</italic> programs. Sachatello-Sawyer et al. explain most adult programs rely largely on programs that bring in money; however, there are other less frequent programs equally opportune for learning. The latter are often offered in collaboration with other community groups, businesses, libraries, or government agencies. They include outreach programs, workshops ranging on anything from HIV to horticultural therapy, festivals, field schools, certificate programs, book signings, and more. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159513477842">Hemming (1995)</xref> identified language courses at the Geffrye Museum as an important outreach program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477842">Akbar (1995)</xref> discussed the Mughal tent project at the Victoria and Albert Museum in which members of the community were involved in the creation of Mughal tent hangings for the exhibit as another successful community project.</p>
<p>While there tends to be a common understanding among adult educators that more research is needed on museums as areas of learning, there is little available research and theory on which to base future considerations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477842">Anderson (1995)</xref> explained although curators seem to have a good idea of what they are doing, they are unable to explain <italic>why</italic> they are doing it. I have identified some adult education theorists who have contributed to the application of nonformal and informal learning in museums, but the literature base remains small. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> study of adult programs in American museums revealed many museums have little cooperation with adult educators, suggesting much is left to chance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477842">Hein (1998)</xref> claimed, we can either use theory to make a method of learning or we can rely on chance and risk sending confusing messages, which are unproductive in learning. This is where Dewey’s theory can guide museum educators, much in the way it can guide teachers.</p>
<p>There are a growing number of programs aimed at adults; however, opportunities for them remain largely untapped. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159513477842">Dudzinska-Przesmitzki and Grenier (2008)</xref> also found a general lack of theory to guide practice when it comes to adult education in museums:<disp-quote>
<p>Considering that museum education and learning has distinguished itself in the literature as a contextually-based experiential alternative to traditional expert-centered teaching, the absence of adult education theory in museum education research is all the more peculiar. (p. 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159513477842">Hooper-Greenhill (1995)</xref> on museums in Britain revealed that most museums spent less than one third of their educational work time on <italic>adult</italic> education. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> reported “adult oriented museums made up only 16 percent of the population . . . and . . . only 27 percent of their programs were intended for adults” (p. xix).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Given the revelations of recent studies concerning the importance of museums for adult education, there is a clear need to further integrate adult education and museums. There are three ways in which this can be done. First, adult educators need to continue to exert efforts in the field of museum learning to further the understanding of how learning takes place. Second, museums need to appreciate the need for adult educators within their domain to better cater to the needs of the adult population who, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref>, <italic>demand</italic> to learn at the museum. Finally, adult educators and museum professionals need to work together to actively promote the image of museums as interesting and provocative, to encourage a greater number of adults to take part in the learning experience. This can be done through class trips, advertising in classes, and homework assignments on the part of adult educators. Museums can take their work to the people either through promotional activities for exhibits or by making public presentations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159513477842">Sachatello-Sawyer et al. (2002)</xref> pointed out, “museums offer access to unique objects, unique people, and unique places, and it is through this access that museums can offer unusual and valuable learning opportunities” (p. xxv). The example of my experience in Vietnam embodies Dewey’s philosophy of education and principles of adult education and museum learning theory, illustrating how they are intertwined and how important museums are as spaces for adult learning. The potential influence of Dewey’s philosophy of education on museums is widespread and resounding and there can be no doubt that the implications for learning in museums especially for adults are unlimited. Dewey’s concepts of interaction and continuity of experience based on experimentation with the social and natural environment are significant for learning in museums especially given their experiential nature. Not all museums offer stimulating learning experiences and, therefore, much is to be gained from Dewey’s theory of experiential learning. Further analysis of individual museum projects through a Dewian lens could provide more insight into how exactly learning can be expanded. It would be useful to experiment setting up exhibitions based entirely on Dewey’s theory. With greater integration of museum education theory and adult education theory, a vast learning source can become more useful in a quest to provide quality lifewide learning experiences for all.</p>
