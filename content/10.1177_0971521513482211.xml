<p>As feminists who have tried to understand women’s labour in all its complexities, we have relied on the intellectual and political legacies of Marxists and the feminist reworkings of those legacies. At the current juncture, these conceptual insights have to be situated in the new terrain of shifting and fracturing of organised labour processes and the co-existence of multiple forms of labour, such as, ‘factory’ work, unpaid work, caste-based work and so on. Further, the ongoing efforts to render visible the devalued labour of women face new challenges arising out of contemporary local and global re-organisation of labour. A conceptual category which tries to encompass the extended labour of women, its invisibility, devaluation and relegation to locations that refuse to recognise contributions of women and other marginalised groups in the reproduction of society, is that of social reproduction.</p>
<p>The articles in this collection emerged out of a workshop that looked at ‘Gendered Labour and Attempts to Recover Social Reproduction’ organised by the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in July 2011 that was coordinated by this writer with generous support from all those who participated in the workshop. The workshop aimed at bringing together scholars/activists who have engaged with the questions of women’s labour, political economy and culture. The resounding insights were that changes in society over the last 40 years have challenged us with the enormity of newer forms of labour configurations and gendered realities. These changes now require renewed conceptualisation of former categories for understanding the contributions as also the entitlements of workers and women who increasingly have come to shoulder the responsibilities for the regeneration of society. Thus, social reproduction needs to be understood and reformulated anew.</p>
<p>The selection compiled here is but a small sample of the variety of locations and contexts from which social reproduction of society is understood. The challenge was in drawing and establishing the links so as to understand the varied structural realities as an interconnected whole rather than as isolated or disparate instances of change. The locations and contexts discussed here range from the traditional handloom sector to textile production in the export processing zone; from women in traditional midwifery, stigmatised caste-based labour and migrant unskilled labour; culminating in the newly envisaged women’s work within entrepreneurial activity through micro-credit inputs. The discussions also bring to the fore two significant institutional locations which look at women’s contributions and social reproduction but which largely remain outside state and society’s vision of incorporating and recognising women’s labour: the family/household and school. The articles seek to go beyond the conventional binary separation of productive and reproductive activities with the latter being confined to the household. The focus on these diverse contexts and locations not only removes this artificial separation of these two spheres but also establishes their interconnectedness by distributing the responsibility for social reproduction across these locations.</p>
<p>Caste-based labours in social reproduction is one of the least acknowledged, be it the traditional <italic>dai</italic> or those in the performance of other public labour. Krishna Soman sketches the important role that the traditional midwife had in colonial Bengal in specialised and skilled birthing and care, and the systematic marginalisation that the institution of the <italic>dai</italic> underwent both in the colonial period and subsequently in the post-Independence phase. She demonstrates how despite the downgrading of the knowledge and practices of midwifery, the <italic>dai</italic> continues to have a significant position among groups who still have limited access to modern institutions of care. Meena Gopal foregrounds the realm of sexual labour and how women in their everyday performance of such labours, attempt to disrupt the reproduction of social relations through their negotiations in everyday life, and their struggle for dignity and respect in the domain of work, thereby distancing themselves from ‘stigmatised’ labours. One of the significant ways in which this is done is by ‘moving away’ in their continued search for livelihoods and survival.</p>
<p>Focusing on two sites of labour, one the traditional handloom sector and another the Special Economic Zone, Sonia George brings the spotlight on the gendered structures of the new labour paradigm. The traditional handloom sector is held up by female labour, who take the place of men who are leaving, while the newly structured Special Economic Zone is made up of jobs filled by young women! This peculiar formation is an anachronism reproduced by a poorly waged and precariously ordered female labour process, within a historical context of struggle in Kerala spearheaded by a largely male working class.</p>
<p>Labour in the context of women’s enterprise buttressed by micro-credit is seen as a panacea for poverty and unemployment. Nilanjana Sengupta effectively brings to light the discursive construct of liberation and empowerment that micro-credit enterprise is supposed to provide, but which obscures the fact that women bear the burden of survival and social reproduction in poor rural households in West Bengal. While being unable to secure them the rights and entitlements that labour deserves, micro-credit nevertheless serves as a coping strategy in a milieu of increasing work for women. Jitha T.J. focuses on the paradoxical practices of the micro-credit enterprise in the city and suburbs of New Delhi. Micro-credit in this instance, she says, only serves as a bargaining tool rather than as the vehicle of empowerment that it proposes to be, without altering any of the relations of social reproduction, ending up strengthening the existing system, ‘re-powering’ patriarchy.</p>
<p>Finally, zooming in on the much discussed household as a location of reproduction, Mary E. John charts a theoretical review in order to understand the elusive problem of the devalued labour of women. She makes a novel attempt by bringing in autobiographical narratives from a range of women that contemplate the place of labour in women’s lives, lives that range from that of a housewife and an actress in the 19th century; a Dalit leader, a domestic worker and a sex worker from the 20th century, the article expands the questions on labour for feminism to address. Clarity on the lack of reproduction of value is unattainable without focus on the intersectionality of caste, class and sexuality, including marriage and family, highlighting the stigmatised and domestic nature of female labour.</p>
<p>Departing from conventional discussions but narrowing down to the significant site of social reproduction, the school, Nandini Manjrekar urges attention to the life and roles of school teachers who are entering the profession in large numbers at a critical juncture of reforms reflecting the neoliberal shifts in the education sector. Women teachers are thus at the cusp of the shifts in the paid workforce as well as within the households which cohere in consolidating ideologies and practices of regulation with respect to the broader processes of social reproduction.</p>
<p>Together, this small set of articles will insist that our visions for understanding women’s labour, as much as the labour of other marginal groups, requires a much larger scope and interconnectedness, brushing away some of the segmentations of earlier formulations, while looking at newer conceptualisations that complicate our earlier understandings. The authors must be given the credit for directing their work towards reclaiming social reproduction for this new era. A concluding note of gratitude—the final shape that this special number took would not have been possible without the unfailing, enthusiastic and tireless support and editorial contribution of Mary E. John. Mary has an equal role in honing my initial idea and shaping these articles for this volume. Her sharp and incisive comments have been extremely instructive in not just finalising these articles but also generating ideas for further work.</p>
