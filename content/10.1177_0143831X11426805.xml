<abstract>
<p>Professions and unions have often been positioned as opposing alternatives or logics of action in theories of labour. Professions embrace a spirit of individualism and mystique, privileged by a social status, while unions are collectivist and seek respect and to usurp power from a dominant class. How do professionals successfully shift their position from dominance to subordination when they engage in collective bargaining? This article proposes that collective representation of professions is not a substitution of one form of power for another, but rather is the expression of a new arena of power for labour playing itself out at the forefront of work regulation in Canada. Three cases of labour disputes of professionalized workers highlight the struggle over the exercise of discretion and illustrate that collective bargaining is an occupational closure strategy that alters the boundaries of a profession in an attempt to maintain professional control.</p>

<p>All trade associations are attempts by those who sell their labour to determine how work shall be done, and by whom. Professions also do this. But they go further: they decide what shall be made, for whom and how their decrees shall be enforced. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11426805">Illich, 1977</xref>: 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The professional project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11426805">Larson, 1977</xref>) is the web of structures, rules and behaviours which define, isolate, protect and perpetuate a group’s claim to exercise a particular expertise in the production of a good or service. Professions are juxtaposed with trade unions in the literature as competing options for occupational power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11426805">Crouch, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin, 1979</xref>), often as opposing alternatives or logics of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11426805">Freidson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11426805">Offe and Wiesenthal, 1980</xref>), or as options that force workers to ‘choose between conflicting identities in constructing themselves as “organizable” workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11426805">Isler, 2007</xref>), by which Isler means likely to form collectives to represent workplace interests. While the unionization of professionals is not new, the literature presents two distinct streams of theory: the unionization project and the professional project, and seldom are the two regarded as compatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11426805">Harrison, 1994</xref>). Our empirical findings indicate that professionalization and collective bargaining strategies are two complementary processes which lie within a continuum of action. This continuum is anchored at one end by more informal, weaker and looser forms of association, and at the other by stronger structure, legislated authority and monopoly control. Professionalism and bargaining are integrated in the case of employed professionals and those who work independently but under conditions of subordination and dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11426805">Muehlberger, 2007</xref>). Professionalization and collective bargaining achieve analogous goals when they influence power relations with parties external to the group. One significant goal is social closure: the creation and protection of a boundary though which access to the group is controlled.</p>
<p>With social closure, the terms of access are defined and managed by the group itself. Closure enables a collective to retain a position of power and privilege relative to others in its sphere of influence. Closure also contributes to defining the identity of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11426805">Weber, 1947</xref>) and establishes occupational practice norms. Circumstances leading to the choice of a strategy of professionalization versus that of collective bargaining according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin (1979)</xref> differ as a function of class relations, production and social control over opportunity and capital. The effectiveness of closure is to some extent a function of social power and command of resources. However, the model that traditionally pits professions against unions from a class perspective is challenged when professionals seek collective bargaining. Our article addresses the question of how professionals successfully adopt both professionalism and collective bargaining, strategies that require them to reconcile their position of dominance as an elite with one of subordination as employees.</p>
<p>We draw upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11426805">Krause’s (1996)</xref> model of guild power that broadens the scope of professional control beyond the elements of membership, work conditions and market domination as described in our opening quotation, to include a fourth component: relations with the state. The four elements are present in each instance of guild-like activity, although they may be balanced differently in different contexts depending on market centralization, economic models and relative power of pressure groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11426805">Krause, 1996</xref>). In his model Krause argues that the traditional sources of professional power are eroded by the growth of capitalism and the modern state. Krause’s model gives us an indication of the multidimensional aspect of professionalism. We show that collective bargaining among professionals has emerged to challenge the power of the state and attempt to reclaim professional power. The strategies of collective bargaining and professional monopoly are both used to achieve the closure and control goals of professions.</p>
<p>In the following we discuss the theoretical elements of professionalism, closure and Krause’s continuum then proceed to illustrate the way these work together to reinforce professional control over working conditions. We discuss in depth three important recent labour struggles in Canada as illustrations of our thesis. The article concludes with a broader discussion of struggles and the implications of these findings for emerging definitions of work relationships and work regulation.</p>

<title>Professionalism</title>
<p>The significant economic expansion that followed the Second World War marked a watershed of growth for the North American labour movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11426805">Kumar and Schenk, 2006</xref>), for managerial roles and for bureaucratic forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11426805">Genoe-McLaren and Mills, 2007</xref>). Professions also rode the wave of expansion in the postwar period, including the burgeoning of the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11426805">Godard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X11426805">Stager and Arthurs, 1990</xref>). Since the 1970s the decline in the industrial base in North America has led the labour movement to focus on the service and public sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11426805">Kumar and Schenk, 2006</xref>) where proportionally more unionized professionals exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11426805">Jackson, 2006</xref>). The public sector has emerged as the arena for the reconciliation of two formerly divergent strategies of work control: professionalization and collective bargaining.</p>
<p>The profession is a collective whose goal is to establish and maintain, as far as possible, exclusive control over an occupation and as a result gain a status position in society. Members strive for this exclusive control through rules and conventions of membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11426805">Weber, 1947</xref>). Restriction of practice to a limited group is known as social closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11426805">Weber, 1947</xref>). Full control over membership where others are kept away through power over access and conventions of practice is considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin (1979)</xref> as exclusionary closure. Its goal is to establish and maintain exclusive control and status for members of the profession; it has both social and economic implications. Social position is reinforced when a profession recruits and admits members of similar background. A state-granted economic monopoly with its fee-setting and supply power affirms the economic advantage. Regulatory relationships with the state become increasingly complex as professions move towards self-regulation and gain the power to set explicit and tacit admission standards.</p>
<p>The guild originally held several workers in a common work setting, where the conditions of work were maintained by the master craftsperson. In contemporary times the control over the workplace is achieved along a continuum of arrangements: through self-employment, partnership in professional service firms, or negotiation with an employer in cases of large-scale professional employment. But more and more we find professionals employed directly by the state in large, heterogeneous organizations.</p>
<p>In contrast to exclusionary closure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin (1979)</xref> posits usurpationary closure – where workers take power from the employer/engager or force their way into formerly restricted domains. This is exemplified in the trade union. The negotiation of terms of work and the creation of a collective agreement pits union against employer over control of the workplace conditions. Admission to an occupation can be limited in this scenario when terms of the collective agreement limit membership (closed or union shops). Simultaneous usurpationary and exclusionary closure constitute what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin (1979)</xref> calls dual closure.</p>
<p>The professions we examine here practise dual closure. Parkin, however, questions the enthusiasm with which professions join the labour movement and find solidarity in views and values based on class. Traditional class theories highlight a distinction between the owners of the means of production and those they exploit. But many professionals are in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143831X11426805">Wright (1978)</xref> calls a ‘contradictory class location’. They have a claim to their own intellectual capital and may work either autonomously or semi-autonomously (in conditions of dependency and subordination) or in a fully captive employment relationship. Subordination is also present in self-employed professionals who face a dominant ‘engager’. (In order to describe both employers and engagers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11426805">Haiven [2006]</xref> has used the term ‘deployers’ of labour.) The ownership of one’s own intellectual capital contributes to a strong professional identity, yet dependency provokes practitioners to unite against the deployers’ power. Rather than limit the utility of closure theory, this duality opens up a new perspective on professionalization.</p>
<p>The collective of individuals with a shared identity, who create a social role through ongoing practice of a profession, may exist with or without state sanction and monopoly control of the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11426805">Krause, 1996</xref>). With this broad definition of profession it is possible to conceive of individual professions along a continuum of action and forms, achieving different degrees of control at different stages of evolution of their professional project.</p>

<sec id="section2-0143831X11426805">
<title>Continuum</title>
<p>The idea of a continuum of progress towards full professionalization is not new. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11426805">Greenwood (1957)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11426805">Hickson and Thomas (1969)</xref> have addressed the processual nature of professionalization and suggest continua. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11426805">MacDonald (1985)</xref> describes such a framework in his discussion of the accounting profession’s use of multiple strategies to achieve social closure though they lack a full legal monopoly in the marketplace. We propose that a more finely graded continuum is warranted, with several additional points to fully describe stages of professional closure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11426805">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, a comparable model can also apply to collective bargaining and frames a comparison of these two closure strategies. Finally, consideration of Krause’s dimensions of guild power broadens the professional continuum beyond social closure and class.</p>

<title>Professional continuum</title>
<p>There is a spectrum along which occupations move in their quest for full professional status which could be said to include Krause’s four dimensions of association, workplace, relationship with the state and market control. High professional status would include doctors and lawyers. Accountants, teachers, engineers, laboratory technicians, etc. are distributed across the continuum. Not all professions strive for or are allowed full closure. Accountants abandoned their quest for legislated self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11426805">MacDonald, 1985</xref>) and the dominance of women in some occupations can also limit their status to that of a semi-profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11426805">Bolton and Muzio, 2007</xref>). The steps of progress along the continuum are mutable as well, dependent on the context and the myriad goals of the membership. Some strategies of professions span the length of the continuum of action. Lobbying is common at several points in the progress of a profession, though the target of lobby efforts and the goals of the effort will change as the profession evolves.</p>
<p>We thus reject the strict dichotomy between ‘full professions’ and ‘semi-professions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11426805">Etzioni, 1969</xref>). Among other criticisms, Witz claims the dichotomy is ‘based on an androcentric model of profession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11426805">Witz, 1992</xref>: 61). We have adopted instead a differential placement upon the professionalization continuum. In each of the cases we discuss in this article workers are engaged in an evolving professionalization project.</p>
<sec id="section4-0143831X11426805">
<title>Discretion</title>
<p>A key concept in the quest for professional status is ‘mystique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11426805">Larson, 1977</xref>). As well as a knowable ‘science’, each profession purports to be an unknowable ‘art’. To practise their art, professionals seek wide discretion as unfettered as possible. Professional discretion is manifest in the interpretation of core knowledge and the exercise of tacit knowledge in the execution of work functions. The notion of discretion also resists the reduction of work into mere tasks. Discretion and the ability to exercise it lie at the heart of professional control.</p>
<p>Routinization in bureaucratic workplaces threatens to strip professions of their discretion as work processes become more carefully detailed and specified, and process steps are codified in the quest for better public accountability and quality control. Several professions have experienced a continual differentiation into specialties as they mature and as technological and scientific advances become embodied in professional practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11426805">Evetts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11426805">Gawande, 2007</xref>). As a result, employers or engagers have the potential to exercise greater control over work. Thus the routinization of much professional work jeopardizes professional control in the contemporary workplace, particularly in the case of publicly employed professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11426805">Dent and Whitehead, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11426805">Misztal, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11426805">Freidson (1973)</xref> anticipates that continued fragmentation of the professions would lead to increased management control over functions and contribute to proletarianization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11426805">Coburn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11426805">Johnson, 1972</xref>) and the deskilling of professional work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11426805">Evetts (2003)</xref> summarizes the arguments for deprofessionalization and decline in the professions’ ability to exert occupational control as well as to self-regulate, clearly indicating the threat to professional discretion. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11426805">Muzio and Ackroyd (2005)</xref> illustrate specific closure strategies in the current context of legal practice that reinforce the profession rather than undermine it.</p>
<p>We have also found that professions respond to the incursion into discretionary power by exercising greater or different closure strategies, as we show in the examples which follow. The professions may make efforts to move rightward along the continuum, enlarging their market monopoly, or they may attempt to organize more members within and beyond their profession. The goal is to more clearly define the boundaries of the profession, and thus exert control over access through that boundary. In some cases, these professions have turned to the usurpationary closure strategy of collective bargaining.</p>

<sec id="section5-0143831X11426805">
<title>Collective bargaining continuum</title>
<p>Trade unionism is of two types. The workplace focus defines industrial unionism and occupation defines craft unionism. Craft unionism has roots in the guilds of the Middle Ages and declined amid the industrialization surge in the middle years of the 20th century. But, as industrialization ebbs towards a knowledge economy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143831X11426805">Stone (2004)</xref> argues that a ‘new craft unionism’ is reasserting itself today across a broader spectrum of workplaces and employers. This is where we find most of our unionized professionals. Craft unionism runs alongside the professional project, where the focus of collective action is to protect the dimensions of the work itself, and to control admission to the practice of an occupation.</p>
<p>In North America key indicators of the union project include state certification of the union’s right to bargain for a worker group, membership of the union in the broader labour movement and active organization of workplaces and workers. Towards the other end of the collective bargaining continuum are workers who gather together informally without formal status under any labour legislation, to express their concerns and suggestions collectively to the employer. The employer may or may not recognize and bargain collectively with such an association. Moving along the continuum represents greater organization and engagement of members in developing worker–organization policy and negotiation priorities. The mechanics of dues collection and formal membership rituals likewise increase with progress on the continuum. Recognition also follows the continuum from informal to voluntary recognition without certification, to full unionization under applicable legislation and formal, ongoing bargaining. Thus the elements of Krause’s model and the continuum of action seeking closure can apply to collective bargaining as well.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11426805">
<title>Structures and scope of practice</title>
<p>A professional’s sense of respect, esteem and belonging begins at an early point, in socialization prior to entry into a profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143831X11426805">Pratt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143831X11426805">Stern and Murphy, 1980</xref>) and a notion of ‘professionalism’ is reinforced throughout a career in activities and relationships with others within, and at the boundaries of, the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11426805">Montgomery and Oliver, 2007</xref>). It is further regulated through the professional school, apprenticeship or internship, and eventual practice in strongly institutional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11426805">Kuhn, 2006</xref>). Professional identity is strongly based on the scope of practice defined by the profession and derives much of its value in relation to broader societal structures and relationships.</p>
<p>If work conditions and a sense of professionalism are in conflict, an accommodation is required to reconcile the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143831X11426805">Pratt et al., 2006</xref>). In our examples, the structure and conditions of work have undergone dramatic change putting pressure on workers’ professionalism. The tension brought on by these changes leads professionals to adopt new strategies in response to reconfiguration of institutions and their relative power. Professionals often refuse to respond with quiescence to these infringements.</p>
<p>Thus, we argue, where professionals are unionized, most of their struggles against management at the very least carry the flavour of, and more often centre around, issues of professional control. Even disputes seemingly over economistic issues like pay and other forms of remuneration are inseparably bound up in professionalism. For example, pay and fee increases sought by lawyers and physicians are at least in part a reflection of internal comparisons within their profession; nurses’ comparison of pay with other allied health professionals is tied to infringements on their scope of practice. Likewise, class size limits sought by teachers enable them to reinforce autonomy and professional discretion in the exercise of their duties. For performing artists the issue of revenue from new media, which might seem like a compensation issue, is inextricably bound up in control of their intellectual capital.</p>
<p>Moreover, anyone familiar with labour negotiations knows that ‘distributive bargaining’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143831X11426805">Walton and McKersie, 1965</xref>), where infinitely divisible amounts of money are in dispute, is far more amenable to settlement than more complex issues of rights, job control and professional autonomy. In the heat of negotiations, serious issues that begin as ‘non-monetary’ often succumb, at the 11th bargaining hour, to the lubricant of money. While this applies to non-professionals as well, we would argue that their proportion, complexity and contentiousness of non-monetary issues are qualitatively lower.</p>

<title>Leading collective bargaining disputes over professional control</title>
<p>There is a tension between the mystique of professions and the codification of work processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11426805">Parkin (1979)</xref> does not probe the challenges presented by employed professionals who bargain collectively over terms and conditions of work. Rather than abandoning the professional project or succumbing to a ‘deprofessionalization of everyone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11426805">Haug, 1975</xref>), collective bargaining seeks to reclaim control over the dimensions that are at the heart of professional work – individual discretion over work execution, creativity, professional identity and identity maintenance through individualized work, and not through the structural mechanisms of membership, apprenticeship, or certification. Creating and maintaining professional control can be achieved not only through a professional society and its lobby but also at the individual workplace level. The rest of the article discusses three specific instances of collective bargaining disputes among professionals.</p>
<sec id="section8-0143831X11426805">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>This article presents three in-depth case studies of important Canadian labour disputes among unionized, employed professionals: crown prosecutors, nurses and actors. We place these cases in context with brief descriptions of four analogous cases. Together these disputes illustrate the proposition that strategies of collective bargaining and professional monopoly are both used to achieve the closure and control goals of professions.</p>
<p>Data were collected through ethnographic observation, particularly of the nurses’ and ACTRA (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Radio and Television Artists) struggles, in-depth interviews and archival data that include local and national media coverage of disputes, articles and books on the historical context of the studied professions and data collected from emails and websites. The long nurses’ struggle was written about extensively by one of the authors. Semi-structured interviews with 16 state prosecutors provided extensive narrative data regarding their struggle for collective bargaining and their evolving professional identity as dependent employees. Similar focus groups and interviews with nurses and leading ACTRA informants provided personalized accounts.</p>
<p>These cases have been selected as they arguably represent labour struggles that changed the ground rules of labour relations in Canada and, perhaps, in North America. Each struggle centred on issues of professional control, and each was expressed in ways that departed from the professions’ traditions; traditions that have been state-sanctioned. The cases also represent a range of professions, at different places on the closure continuum. As a result we illustrate the applicability of the closure continuum as an interpretive framework for a range of professional projects.</p>
<p>These cases are compelling for several reasons. They represent both male and female dominated professions and they run the gamut of employment forms, from captive through semi-autonomous employment to self-employment. They redefine aspects of the ‘Wagnerist’ labour relations model. By Wagnerism we mean the collective bargaining norms in North America spawned by the 1935 US Wagner Act. The Act emerged within a Fordist model of production employing a largely white, male workforce in standard, full-time, full-year employment. Wagnerism involved narrow worksite collective bargaining, majoritarian union representation and passive and reactive government labour policy and severe restriction on the right to strike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11426805">Fudge and Vosko, 2001</xref>). Our selected examples had an impact in the public policy debate over the regulation of work, or rearranged the labour relations status quo, and in some cases challenged, either directly or indirectly, what is permissible and not permissible in both professional and collective projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0143831X11426805">
<title>State prosecutors</title>
<p>Our first case involves lawyers who function as state prosecutors. State prosecutors are civil servants, employed by Canadian provincial, territorial and federal governments. All Canadian lawyers are certified and regulated by a public protection association. All of them also belong to lawyers’ professional advocacy societies and enjoy the benefits of self-regulation and a position of almost full realization of the professional project (at the extreme right of the closure continuum). But these societies consist mainly of self-employed lawyers in private practice and have shown themselves inadequate to the exigencies of negotiating terms and conditions of employment. The 1990s saw state prosecutors across Canada struggle for work improvements and recognition of the unique nature of their professional work within the civil service. In some provinces, they joined and bargained through new associations but many provinces still legally bar them from formal collective bargaining. They are positioned only four or five points from the far left on the collective bargaining side of the continuum.</p>
<p>Our example is the Province of Nova Scotia. Through the 1990s, in a regime where collective bargaining was absolutely prohibited, prosecutors made some modest workplace improvements. But many prosecutors still lacked even the rudiments of professional legal practice like desktop computers, internet access and electronic and paralegal support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11426805">Kaufman, 1999b</xref>). Nova Scotia prosecutors interpreted these conditions as a lack of respect. Prosecutors in several other provinces had successfully achieved collective bargaining, but in Nova Scotia the government refused this and prosecutors’ conditions worsened compared to others in the legal profession and their counterparts across the country.</p>
<p>The political environment in the Public Prosecution Service (hereafter the Service) was also strained. The Service had come under much public scrutiny as a result of several controversial prosecutions, including the notorious wrongful conviction of an aboriginal man, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11426805">Kaufman, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11426805">1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11426805">2002</xref>). One prosecutor describes it thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was a groundswell among crown attorneys to say ‘look we’re professionals and we’re not being treated in a way that’s proper’. . . . We were employees of government and after you have worked for a while it is hard to leave, you are captive here. We did not receive compensation for the fact that we had devoted ourselves to careers to a particular practice of law. (Lawyer 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that bothered me the most during all of that [time] because it just kept getting crazier and crazier, was that people that practise criminal law spend their professional lives making sure that everybody gets their rules applied the same way to them. That’s what we do for a living. We get paid to make sure that fairness and transparency and the rules of natural justice apply to the person charged with the most egregious thing out there and it didn’t feel like we were getting that in return. (Lawyer 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As with many other professionals, prosecutors made an appeal to the public interest – in this case the necessity of a well-resourced prosecution service to balance the goal of public safety with the rights of the accused. Prosecutors describe their position as ‘taking whatever the Government decides to give us’. Frustrated, the prosecutors formed the Nova Scotia Crown Attorneys Association and sought full statutory collective bargaining rights. Denied the legal right to unionize and strike, in June 1998 Nova Scotia prosecutors staged an illegal strike, mounting a picket at the provincial legislature. Ironic and highly significant is the fact that this was a wilful and purposive illegal act by professionals sworn specifically to uphold the law. The prosecutors did not enter into the strike lightly, they were wary of the uncharted ground on which they were treading but clear in their intent:
<disp-quote>
<p>I saw myself as a professional who would be treated [fairly] I thought in private practice you would never have to do it [go on strike], or if you worked for government you would be treated fairly and with more respect than we were getting at the time and that it would just never, ever come to that, and I was absolutely horrified when it did. However, it was important that we did it and I participated completely and was docked the two days’ pay or whatever it was that happened. (Lawyer 4)</p>
<p>It [lack of fairness] drove me crazy. So I supported [the strike] completely. (Lawyer 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As well as work improvements, Nova Scotia prosecutors sought respect and recognition of their professional status through wage parity with local private practice lawyers and with prosecutors in other Canadian jurisdictions. Traditional exclusionary closure strategies in the professionalization project had failed the prosecutors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X11426805">Stager and Arthurs, 1990</xref>). The alternative was a strategy of usurpation, aimed ostensibly at the legal practitioners in the management of the Service. However it was also a protest against denial of collective bargaining rights.</p>
<p>Despite the continuing legal prohibition of collective bargaining, by 2001 the Nova Scotia government had finally agreed to voluntary recognition of the prosecutors’ association and a process for negotiating salaries. To date, the prosecutors have not achieved full bargaining rights but a recent Supreme Court of Canada decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11426805">Health Services, 2007</xref>) may well spell the removal of all remaining legal roadblocks.</p>
<p>The significance of this struggle is that the prosecutors successfully pushed back the barriers that many Canadian jurisdictions erected to deny lawyers, engineers, architects, physicians and previously nurses from full trade unionism and collective bargaining rights. The struggle was all the more momentous because the prosecutors defied the law to do it.</p>

<title>Performing artists in recorded media</title>
<p>The Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Radio and Television Artists (ACTRA) fulfils both advocacy and collective bargaining functions in a single organization (there is no public protection organization). Among Canadian organizations of cultural workers, ACTRA is a leader in high profile advocacy, appealing to the public interest and to government policy in areas like public support for the arts and copyright law.</p>
<p>ACTRA represents performers (actors, singers, dancers) in recorded media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11426805">Hallier and Forbes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143831X11426805">Roderick, 2006</xref>) across English Canada. Like a true craft union or guild, access to membership is based on an apprenticeship (strongly enforced, though not state-sanctioned). Indeed, membership in a performers’ union is often considered the mark of full status as a ‘professional’ performance artist in Canada.</p>
<p>By and large, ACTRA members are self-employed, working under individual service contracts with engagers for each work assignment. Under labour law in most Canadian provinces, only workers in a legal employment relationship have full legal collective bargaining rights. Accordingly, ACTRA and the independent producers of motion pictures and television shows have negotiated a voluntary national collective agreement specifying minimum standards for pay, benefits and other working conditions. Individual ACTRA members (especially the ‘stars’) are free to bargain better terms.</p>
<p>Because film projects are atomized and evanescent and producers had little cohesion, it was ACTRA that had historically to cajole the engagers to form an association so the union would have a party with which to negotiate. ACTRA’s ability to work outside the Wagner model and still enforce voluntarism is described by one ACTRA officer thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>So how were we able to negotiate agreements with employers, engagers of talent? . . . it all relates and boils down to . . . the solidarity of the membership. And that’s enforced through our constitution and by-laws and the discipline procedures in our constitution and by-laws. It’s through the solidarity of membership, the agreement amongst the membership, that they are not going to work for any engager that is not a signatory to our agreement that brings about the solidarity and the unity that demands that engagers deal with us; they can’t get professional talent unless they deal with the guild. (Artist 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The performers’ profession reaches back to the guild structure of the Middle Ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11426805">Frederickson and Rooney, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143831X11426805">Slocum, 1996</xref>). Its fight over control of its members’ image and intellectual property, however, is a modern development. In blue-collar industrial work any intellectual property generated by workers defaults to the employer. Creative workers in self-employment, however, have legal claim to their intellectual property. But they must be able to track, claim and realize the value of downstream electronic uses of their talent. This is often difficult to do and a copyright collective allied to ACTRA, the Performers’ Rights Society (PRS), is assigned that task. The PRS charges onward users of performers’ recorded work a fee and distributes it back to its members.</p>
<p>One intellectual property issue bedevilling creative workers and their deployers in the motion picture and television industry is payment for the use of creative work in new digital media (content delivery avenues like internet downloads, Internet Protocol Television, smart phone programming, straight-to-internet content and other ‘on-demand’ online distribution methods, including video on cable and satellite television). It was this issue that tested the long-standing voluntaristic arrangement and was pivotal in the February 2007 ACTRA strike, the first in its 65-year history (a dispute that had major US studios and US unions looking on with active interest). Given the voluntary nature of the relationship between the Canadian parties, the legal status of the strike was in uncharted waters.</p>
<p>To be safe, the union followed the traditional labour law route province by province to make sure that the strike was not illegal. But its main tactics were more innovative. Exploiting the lack of cohesion among the individual producers, ACTRA signed ‘continuation deals’ with willing producers to allow ongoing productions to continue, as long as those producers raised salaries and met working conditions demands. Thus many members were able to continue work while the union was on strike. As a senior ACTRA official summarizes it:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . it was all about splitting the employers and having the employers scab on their association which everyone did; on the first day of the strike every production that was in production broke from their trade association and signed an interim agreement with ACTRA. . . . I take pride in the fact that this has got to be one of the most unique strikes in labour history in which the members went on strike and got a pay increase and continued working and got a 5 percent pay increase and 2 percent into their benefits and continued working. Have you ever heard of that before? (Artist 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The uncertainty born of a vague legislative framework enabled a novel and different usurpationary strategy for ACTRA and broke new ground in the industrial relations system. Solidarity grew from a network of independent workers, rather than a traditional worksite-based organization and resulted in an ACTRA victory.</p>
<p>Performing artists highlight a different aspect of the professional labour process in that they are not collected together for extended periods of time at a common workplace in any permanent relationship. Performing artists are divided and quite vulnerable in their individual contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11426805">Coles, 2007</xref>), so collective action in a network form protects their interests in the power relationship with producers. The struggle also established the legitimacy and the viability of a network approach to professionalism. The control of digital images has gone on to be an issue in other artistic disputes, most notably the much-publicized Writers Guild of America strike later that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11426805">Banks, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0143831X11426805">
<title>Nurses</title>
<p>Most Canadian health care professionals are employed by non-profit institutions funded by provincial governments. Entrance to nursing once involved post-secondary training at a hospital, but in pursuit of fuller closure, nursing now requires a university degree. Canadian nurses can belong to up to three affinity organizations: for advocacy there is a nurses’ professional society; for public protection, there is a College of Nurses. (In smaller provinces one organization will fulfil both of these roles and both of these will include nurses who are managers.) For collective bargaining there is a trade union. In most provinces, a single union has exclusive bargaining rights for nurses.</p>
<p>Nurses came relatively late to trade unionism (the early 1980s) and have been playing catch-up ever since. In that time, nurses have shown their willingness to strike, often illegally. Many of the main issues – professional responsibility clauses, care of patients and redressing a shortage of nurses – are issues of professional control, particularly resistance to fragmentation of work:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . we’re responsible for the patient and the care that the patient receives and so we have a lot of concerns about who’s giving that care. We are very very concerned as a union that our profession is being eroded . . . well it’s unclear now whose responsibility is what. I mean, everything now, we’re being, told is a task. You know, every time we complain about these issues [work control] . . . it seems that everything is just a task. (Nurse 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even more mundane items, like overtime pay, weekend work and seniority, address access to the profession. In public relations, most nurses’ unions have successfully couched their appeal in terms of the welfare of patients and the survival of Canada’s vaunted public health care system. There is no denying that this is an opportunistic strategy. But, as with other unionized professionals, strong public interest issues pervade their employment, their work and their relationship with those they serve.</p>
<p>Nurses’ crucial role in health care delivery makes strikes tumultuous. Strikes cause tremendous health system turmoil and sometimes grievous political injury to the presiding government. Several provincial governments in Canada have outlawed nurses’ strikes entirely, substituting binding arbitration in their stead. In other provinces, strikes are allowed but severely restricted. However, this has not stopped Canadian nurses from defying the legislation to achieve their aims. Nurses in the Province of Alberta struck illegally in the late 1980s and those of Quebec, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland did so in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>The illegal strikes have occurred despite the threat and the actuality of severe legislated penalties. Indeed, governments have found it difficult to devise a punitive scheme that will conclusively deter such civil disobedience. For example, faced with such sanctions during a struggle in the Province of Nova Scotia in 2001, nurses threatened to resign en masse:
<disp-quote>
<p>When we mass resigned [in 2001] there were people 6 months from retirement. ‘Take your job’, you know. And it’s still, in fact this has been very much the topic of conversation in emergency the last two weeks. The treatment and the decline of how nurses are treated. I can’t believe the decline I’ve seen in 30 years. It’s incredible. (Nurse 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The subsequent surge of public sympathy for the nurses forced the government to back down. When a subsequent Nova Scotia minority government later introduced legislation to outlaw health care strikes in 2007 that initiative foundered on public and political opposition as well. Despite a wide array of policy alternatives, the problem of nurses’ working conditions and their determination to disregard legislation in the pursuit of its amelioration remains an ongoing and thorny question for governments and policy specialists in health care and industrial relations.</p>

<title>Teachers</title>
<p>The past quarter century has witnessed a struggle by elementary and secondary school teachers in all Canadian jurisdictions to resist government attempts to rein in education costs amid fiscal restraint and to limit the power of teachers both in the classroom and the political realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143831X11426805">Poole, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The highest profile dispute was the 2005 British Columbia Teachers Federation strike over pay and class size. Declared part of the province’s essential services, teachers defied a strike ban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11426805">Annis, 2005</xref>). Their demands directly reinforced the discretion and exercise of tacit knowledge of the professional in a generally autonomous work milieu.</p>
<p>The ensuing illegal strike had the support of the already militant British Columbia labour movement and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11426805">Jones, 2005</xref>). After two weeks of crisis, the union was able successfully to challenge both the strike ban and the restriction on scope of bargaining.</p>

<title>University professors</title>
<p>Academicians across Canada have unionized only in the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X11426805">Ponak and Thompson, 1984</xref>), but union density is now very high, reaching 79 percent of faculty under legally certified unions and most of the rest with voluntary recognition agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11426805">Dobbie and Robinson, 2008</xref>).

<p>One of the most contentious issues concerns the segmentation of the academic labour market, with a growing proportion of classes taught by non-permanent and part-time staff. Job security and career prospects for both permanent and non-permanent university teachers are affected by this phenomenon. Other issues are illustrated in the strike of York University faculty in 1997:
<disp-quote>

<title>Physicians</title>
<p>Like lawyers, Canadian doctors in private practice have long captured the full spectrum of the professionalization continuum. While the proportion of physicians in self-employment is shrinking, the majority still are in private practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11426805">Canadian Policy Research Networks, 2005</xref>). But since the advent of universal health insurance (known as ‘Medicare’), doctors’ professional societies have bargained collectively with provincial governments for a schedule of fees-for-service. Medical professional societies are not unions in the usual sense of the word. But the process through which they negotiate fees schedules is surely a form of collective bargaining. And strikes have not been uncommon.</p>
<p>The most famous Canadian doctors’ strike occurred in 1962 when the Saskatchewan government introduced universal medical insurance (the first such scheme in Canada). Claiming socialized medicine would destroy their professional relationship with patients, a majority of Saskatchewan physicians closed their practices for 23 days in protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11426805">Badgley and Wolfe, 1967</xref>). The strike was defeated and ‘Medicare’, as it is now known, spread to the rest of Canada within 10 years.</p>
<p>Several doctors’ strikes have followed, most of them over issues the doctors define as ‘professional’. Quebec specialists struck in 1970 to keep the option to opt out of Medicare. Ontario doctors struck in 1986 over an extra-billing ban and ‘stormed the legislative buildings, publicly castigated the government as Nazis and/or Communists, and eventually went on a twenty-day strike in which they withdrew all but essential services (in some areas, even hospital emergency rooms were closed)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11426805">Coburn, 1988</xref>: 106).</p>
<p>Doctors struck in Montreal in 1998 over crowded hospitals and in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2002 over pay and working conditions, framing the dispute as over ‘the long-term future of health care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11426805">CBC, 2002</xref>). Nova Scotia doctors have staged slowdowns over medical personnel shortages in rural emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Reviewing doctors’ militancy, Coburn concluded in 1988:
<disp-quote>
<p>A decline in dominance, yes. The beginnings of the proletarianization of medicine in Canada, a change in medicine’s objective class position, if not its class relationships, yes.

<title>The clergy</title>
<p>In the 3-million member United Church of Canada, clergy are formally hired, assigned and directed by Church central administrations. But their working conditions, often in remote locations, are influenced by their parishioners. This presents a challenging labour problem in one of the oldest professions in the world, which, however, has a myriad of problems including public humiliation, harassment, defamation and stalking that leave one in five of them on stress leave. The pastors attempted to join the Canadian Auto Workers Union in 2004 and 2005.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11426805">Evetts (2003)</xref> argues that a discourse of professionalism is replacing closure mechanisms as a viable explanation for the power of specific groups in the social order. However, professionalism expressed in a discourse alone is insufficient to explain the active developments we have seen in collective bargaining among professionals. This article’s exploration of three leading cases of labour relations struggles in the professional realm demonstrates there is neither a substitution of union ideology for professional ideology, nor an abandonment of closure strategies. The shift in status for professionals from self-directed self-employment to subordination and dependency has caused professions to redraw professional boundaries on each of the four elements of Krause’s model of guild power. The full realization of each professional project requires resolution of the tension between subordination and professional autonomy. Accompanying the shift in employment status is an ever-increasing fragmentation of professional work. The active pursuit of collective bargaining strategies further delineates the labour process and helps to clarify professional status and roles within the broader workplace. In this way, both streams of the closure continuum support the professional project. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11426805">Figure 2</xref> provides a visual representation of placement on the continuum for each professional project discussed here.</p>

</fig>
<p>For example, the evolution of the prosecuting lawyer from independent practitioner, acting under contract to the government, to full-time permanent employee as a prosecutor necessitated an administrative structure to grow up around the functions of prosecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X11426805">Stager and Arthurs, 1990</xref>). The growing public service, including policing, prisons, courts and related supports, as well as the civil service itself, provided an opportunity for the prosecutors to define boundaries around the profession and between professions in an increasingly complex, bureaucratized work milieu. Professional socialization and the subjugation of employees to management control are both powerful forces shaping prosecutors’ demands for control over the knowledge and practice within their profession. These forces cause an occupational identity crisis that occurs when workers are overburdened with bureaucracy, with the resulting need to renegotiate their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11426805">Evetts, 2003</xref>), their occupational scope, or both. Management control over prosecution work is countered to some extent through the adoption of the usurpationary strategy of collective bargaining. This strategy enables prosecutors to negotiate control over aspects of work that reaffirm their professional power and at the same time redefines their professional role in the employment context.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11426805">Freidson (1973)</xref> describes an ideal type profession where management does not control the work and professionals resist administrative authority over work. Overt involvement in the definition of the roles and rules governing others is the full expression of this ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11426805">Witz, 1992</xref>). In contrast to the ideal, nurses illustrate perhaps better than any other case here the reality of unionized, employed professionals. Their profession has a long history of struggle with professions, above and below, over boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11426805">Witz, 1992</xref>). First doctors attempted to define the nursing profession and more recently nursing’s boundaries are threatened by technological and medical advances and the emergence of secondary health professions such as Licensed Practical Nurses. The state offers some protection through its sanction of professional registration. However, the state is also the direct employer or paymaster in almost all instances of nursing care and thus collective forms of negotiation are necessary to counteract the power imbalance in the relationship between nurses and the state. Nurses thus rely on their unions to negotiate directly with government representatives for workplace control. This enables nurses to influence staffing levels as shown in professional responsibility and workload clauses of their collective agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11426805">NSNU, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X11426805">UNA, 2010</xref>). These clauses in turn impact the scope of duties and the exercise of professional discretion in nursing jobs. Nurses are thus better able to resist fragmentation and erosion of their professional domain.</p>
<p>The structural issues in the ACTRA dispute illustrate an innovative organization in a network that spans multiple employers, worksites and individual employees. While these performers are self-employed, they are almost entirely dependent upon the initiative of a deployer to organize the project in which they are engaged. The ACTRA dispute of 2007 is important not only because it directly addressed intellectual property rights but also because it pushed the frontier in ACTRA’s relationship with the state, challenging the long-held legal definition of ‘strike’ and ‘collective bargaining’.</p>
<p>The restrictions on entry and education in the teaching profession help to form and protect a professional boundary. Teaching is not a fully self-regulating profession and teachers channel their energy into the usurpationary struggle over working conditions and bargaining rights. Significant is the fact that only in the past 15 years have teachers and nurses unions affiliated with the Canadian central labour federations after decades of demurral, moving further along the collective bargaining continuum as a strategy to preserve professional interests. Faced with a state that increasingly imposes limits to discretion in medical practice, physicians are increasingly resorting to insurgent usurpation. Pushing forward to change the relationship with the state and choosing to strengthen a usurpationary strategy have helped the teaching profession across Canada to define for teachers and for the public clearer boundaries of professional discretion.</p>
<p>The three forms of representation: advocacy, public protection and collective bargaining are linked in our selected cases. The structure varies by profession and jurisdiction but the struggle persists in advancing the cause of professional control. Each dispute used usurpationary strategies to move the professional project along the continuum of professionalization, collective bargaining, or both. In each case the four elements of Krause’s model of guild power were altered either in substance or in their balance relative to each other. As for the public interest, unions position the struggle as a matter of protection of a public good, the public buys into this argument and management and state legitimacy are undermined as a result. These developments illustrate not only the intensity of the collective voice of workers, but also the mutual support between professional control and active collective bargaining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0143831X11426805">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The driving force behind the labour action and the collective bargaining demands of professionals is a need to reassert professional control over work, and to re-establish autonomy and discretion inherent in the profession’s role. Prestige, within and beyond the profession, along with self-worth are at the heart of the collective bargaining demands driving professions to withhold their labour power, as these examples have shown. When professional or exclusionary closure strategies failed to achieve the necessary control over membership, exercise of expertise and discretion, service monopoly and relationships with the state, then the professions here turned to usurpationary strategies in order to achieve these goals. The shift from a position of dominance to one of subordination is facilitated by the dependent employment status of the professionals examined here and it is successfully managed by positioning the struggle as being about professional discretion. This strategy does not conflict with the professional societies’ and associations’ maintenance of a guild framework because the power of the professionals resides at the level of the job site where the frontiers of each of Krause’s four elements are being challenged.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, performing artists and nurses cannot abandon the professional project and the accompanying exclusionary closure mechanisms just because they also adopt a usurpation strategy; they must maintain professional exclusion if they wish to continue to practise in their chosen field. Therefore, the two closure strategies must coexist. This pressure from two interests challenges the professionals examined here to reassert their professional project and appropriate the arguments necessary to reconcile competing interests. The exercise of tacit knowledge and discretion are inherently entwined with professionalization. The need to protect that discretion will shift the balance in the four elements of the guild model, and trigger labour action that pushes the frontiers of the relationship between the state and the professions. Thus closure strategies are not merely class issues but instruments to define and maintain the boundaries of the profession.</p>
