<p>For many members the pre-Congress workshops are a highlight of their trip to Congress each year, and this year will be no different. In 2013, Congress is offering more than a dozen pre-Congress workshops covering a plethora of topics ranging from ‘Preventive interventions for children of parents with a mental illness’ and ‘Entering Private Practice’ to more technical sessions training Fellows as Examiners and Accredited Site Visitors, and supporting Trainees. It is difficult to imagine a member not finding a pre-Congress workshop relevant to their interests.</p>
<p>For Fellows wanting to train to the standard required to examine Trainees in the clinical (OCI/MOCI) examination, this Accredited Examiner workshop each year is one of the best opportunities to build their training and supervision skills to the highest calibre. All attendees should apply to their Branch prior to the workshop – information on the process can be obtained from <email>exams@ranzcp.org</email>. Another important workshop covers training Assessors for the substantially comparable pathway to Fellowship for Specialist International Medical Graduates. The Section of Psychotherapy is also running a workshop for Case Supervisors which relates to supervising the College Psychological Methods (Psychotherapy) case as part of the new competency-based Fellowship program.</p>
<p>Fellows looking for something different might want to consider the Accredited Practice Visit workshop – Practice Visits have been recognised by the Committee for Continuing Medical Education (CCME) for their value in enabling collegial psychiatrists to share and reflect on practice improvement, and benefit from an enhanced sense of fellowship – especially for those located in rural areas. Practice visits conducted by Skype are now also supported by the College. Other information sessions which are always popular pre-Congress include the series for Trainees (Approaching the RANZCP written exam; Approaching the RANZCP OCI/MOCI Assessment and OSCE/MOSCE Assessment).</p>
<p>Apart from College-specific workshops, attending pre-Congress offers an opportunity to hear from a range of expert Fellows in specialist areas of practice and development. Key topics include improving professional practice, treating fellow doctors and running a private practice, as well as clinical discussions of how to best treat eating disorders, sleep disorders and autism as well as effective interventions for children in families with mental illness and for families and carers of people with personality disorders.</p>
<p>Workshops are held at the Congress site – Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre in beautiful Darling Harbour – and many are complimentary with Congress registration. Pre-Congress workshops fill up fast every year; for more information go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ranzcp2013.com/">www.ranzcp2013.com/</ext-link>.</p>
