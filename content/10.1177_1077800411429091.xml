<abstract>
<p>This article explores a father–son relationship and the death of the author’s father through mythically framed autoethnographic stories. The author confronts persistent anxieties that haunt him, as he struggles with his initiation into “maturity,” an initiation that began with his father’s death and continues today—fifteen years later. By juxtaposing intimate stories of his father with classic, archetypal exigencies of the human quest for meaning in a troubled, limited world, the author seeks to open up multiple layers of <italic>possibilities</italic>: personal <italic>and</italic> collective, autoethnographic <italic>and</italic> mythic, comic <italic>and</italic> tragic, masculine <italic>and</italic> feminine. This piece is a tribute to the author’s father and their love that also explores shadowy, unconscious complexities. The author finds wisdom and insight in reclaiming and recasting an ancient, archetypal orientation to myth in the interdisciplinary world of qualitative inquiry. Simultaneously, through crafting a myth of a fallen hero/trickster, the author embraces the transformational process of facing his personal <italic>splits</italic> while suggesting possibilities for mending <italic>splits</italic> that still frame and divide our world today.</p>

<title>Betwixt and Between Myth and Experience: Life and Death</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>Liminality is the realm of primitive hypothesis, where there is a certain freedom to juggle with the factors of existence.</p>

<p><disp-quote><p>Dad, you were always a <italic>myth</italic> of a man, even when you were alive. . . .</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I use <italic>myth</italic> in a way different from how the term is commonly used today. I use the word to juggle with the factors of my existence while juggling with the factors of existence writ large. My own embodied sense of liminality—of betweenness—frees me up to overgeneralize and overspecify at the same time. I’ve been in-between for fifteen years now—one year longer than I knew my father, who died at age 39. Identifying with Tom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411429091">Frentz (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411429091">2008b</xref>), I also have felt like a trickster, ever since my dad’s death. But something is changing in me.</p>

<title>Evoking the Shadow</title>
<p>How do I write and tell a story about a man who holds such an archetypal place in my life, consciousness, and body, about my hero who died too young? How can I possibly share him and this feeling?</p>
<p>As I have struggled to write about our relationship the past few months, I’ve broken down and opened up wounds and windows into my own anxieties. In confiding this feeling to my girlfriend Beck and my brother Jeff, I’ve taken to calling it “the fear.” At night, just before I go to sleep, in the liminal period between conscious and unconscious, “the fear” manifests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429091">Bochner, 1997</xref>). My monkey-mind<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411429091">1</xref></sup> races. My absurd anxieties and failures flood in:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Could my dog have heartworms? Could I have internal bleeding? Why is it that, in my times of fear and stress, my body feels so fragile? Why can’t I just be with this fear, allow it to be? Why can’t I break out of my habits of dulling the fear, of temporarily evading it, when I know that just makes the fear stronger the next day? Why can’t I change? Why can’t I move forward? Why can’t I just be?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>I have the Patti heart (and I mean that emotionally and physically). Like Dad, I’m six foot two. My body mass index is an ideal 20.5. I’m active and eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables, take an Omega-3 supplement every day. Yet, like my father before me, and my grandfather, and his father, and his—I have had high blood pressure since I was a child. Stress goes right to my stomach and right to my head. <italic>Am I going to have a brain aneurism? Could my stress manifest itself like my father’s, as a fatal cancer? Why do I overthink everything?</italic></p>
<p>Despite the fear, a myth about my relationship with Dad—Walter Arthur Patti, Jr.—calls: “Called against his will . . . Shaul on the eve of his greatest trial is reduced to restoring to necromancy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800411429091">Friedlander, 1979</xref>, p. 12). Perhaps like Saul Friedlander and like the Biblical Shaul, as a storyteller, I too wish to restore (re-story) to necromancy—to raise the dead and evoke the spirit. This is an attempt to conjure a dead father through story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429091">Bochner, 2008</xref>) and one I hope opens up existential <italic>possibilities</italic> for “self” and “other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800411429091">Poulos, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800411429091">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411429091">2010</xref>). But this tall tale is a tall order and one I don’t take lightly. Every time I sit down to edit the eighty pages of stories I’ve crafted, they expand. The rhizomes of memory. One story recalls ten.</p>
<p>To deal with this issue and my anxieties, I frame my father in the deepest and broadest way conceivable: <italic>My father the myth. My father the tragic hero.</italic> He deserves to be remembered as a mythic hero. As an ethnographic storyteller, I believe everyone deserves this same respect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800411429091">2</xref></sup> And now it’s my chance to immortalize Dad in this way. But how? How to recall and tell <italic>quintessential</italic> stories of my father and me?</p>
<p><italic>Quintessential</italic>—now there’s a word to ruminate on. Like <italic>mythic</italic> and <italic>archetypal</italic>, quintessential sticks with me. That is what I’m after—the <italic>essence</italic>, the <italic>essential</italic>. And with such limited space, I can’t tell all the stories I have exhumed. But I can tell five. (Quint)essential: five essential stories of my dad—just the essentials, there’s not enough space for all the details. There’s not enough space for an odyssey, just enough for a personal mythology that hints at the collective materials underneath the surface. I’ll give it my best shot—just like Dad taught me.</p>

<title>(Quint)essential Myths of a Lost Father and Son</title>
<p>My father’s funeral, back in 1996, overflowed with people: family, life-long friends, colleagues, business associates. That day, my mother made a simple request to those in attendance, who knew and loved my dad. She asked that his friends write and send her their stories of “Pat,” so that she could compile them for his children and create an archive of memories. To this day, no such stories have been written. There is a void of stories. And, like Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077800411429091">Wyatt (2008)</xref>, I too fear the loss of loss, forgetting my father: “Surely there were more [reminders of my father] once. They are slipping away. Sometimes, it is as if he had never been here” (p. 958). This is a fear I have struggled with for years now. In 2003 I wrote a song called “On My Way Home” about this feeling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800411429091">Patti, 2009</xref>). The chorus goes like this: <italic>Thoughts in my head. Painting a masterpiece. Plastic a hollow dream of you. All the color. Bright as your memory. Is slowly fading away.</italic> I search my memory in order to craft stories about Dad with the hope of slowing the unstoppable process of forgetting him and his loss.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077800411429091">
<title>A Lesson on Language</title>
<p>As my grandpa confirmed for me, my dad had a gift for language. He was exceptionally straightforward and used “colorful” words. I’m the same way. I’ve learned that I can sometimes put things in ways that offend people. Most of the time, however, the male Patti use of language is seen as charming and clever. But every so often, we can say something that is just a bit too far out of culturally acceptable norms. And, as Grandpa Walt told me in an all-too Patti way, “If people are offended, fuck ‘em.”</p>
<p>I remember a hot summer afternoon. I was about nine years old, my brother around seven. Dad had taken a Saturday to drive us an hour north to the Los Angeles Convention Center for a show. I don’t remember what we were going to see. What I do recall, vividly, is the car ride home. The three of us, men, were thirsty. “Hey, Chris and Jeff. How ‘bout we stop and get a soda?” Dad’s eyes were wide and had a mischievous gleam. Our mom didn’t allow such unhealthy things. “YES! We are soooooooo thirsty, Dad! We need some Sprites,” Jeff and I shout. I’m sitting shotgun. “OK, guys, that sounds like a plan. I’ll pull through the nearest fast food joint.” And so he did.</p>
<p>Pop found a Jack-in-the-Box off the 5-South freeway, pulled his red Acura Legend up to the order window and, in an overly affected, jovial voice, responded to the employee’s “Welcome to Jack-in-the-Box. Can I take your order”: “Yes, thank you! How are you today?” “Fine, sir. What would you like?” “Well, let’s see, we have three thirsty men in the car, so we’ll need three LARGE Sprites and that’s it. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Dad felt that he had placed a perfect order—clear, concise, courteous—no room for ambiguity. We wanted three large Sprites. What could be easier? Following proper fast food protocol, the employee asked a standard follow-up question: “Would you like fries with that?” To which Pop responded, imitating the employee’s tone and pacing, “Would you like me to fart in your mouth?”</p>
<p>My brother and I exploded with laughter and admiration. We beamed with pride. We could not believe our father had the guts to make such a crude joke. Even at nine and seven, we knew he had gone against the social grain—and with such bathroom-humor gusto! We got our drinks, finishing only a fraction of each. Since that day, Jeff and I have recalled this moment hundreds of times, laughing proudly each time. When we want to tell a story about Dad that shows his sense of humor, his fearlessness, and his all-around “bad-assness” (as well as his potentially rude nature), this is the one we tell.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077800411429091">
<title>“No Fair Pulling Hair”</title>
<p>When it comes to being a man, one thing we’ve been taught since time immemorial is that courage and physical power are important. Like his father before him, Pop was an athlete growing up, eventually playing soccer at the University of Connecticut. He was a taller-than-average 6’2’’, was very thin up until his 30s, and was, as his father tells it and he told it, fearless. Back in Connecticut in the 1970s they had “gangs.” Not quite like the gangs I’d heard of in Los Angeles or Long Beach, Dad would tell me; these were gangs from a different time and place. My dad said his gang was a bunch of friends who liked to drink and get into trouble.</p>
<p>They called themselves the Yahoos. I guess his gang had its enemies. Pop had his enemies. And, in a gruff, movie-trailer-announcer voice, he used to tell my brother and me his famous “no-fair-pullin’-hair” story. We asked him to repeat it every so often and felt like we had the strongest and most fearless dad around.</p>
<p>The story goes that Pop was walking home by himself one evening when a rival gang spotted him. Five or six guys backed him into a corner. They taunted, “You’re in for it now, Patti. Where are your Yahoos? Not so tough when you’re all alone, are you, Patti?” With a last name most often heard as a woman’s first name, we Patti men are used to it being used against us.</p>
<p>A couple of the men pulled out blades. One of them had a bat. As they closed in, my dad knew he was in trouble. He figured he had two choices: <italic>get my ass kicked by a bunch of guys without putting up a fight, and hopefully they will take it easy on me; or take out as many of these fucking punks as I can, before they get me</italic>. He opted for the latter choice and started kicking ass in all directions, doing anything he could to get an advantage in the unfair fight. Grabbing two guys by the hair, he shouted and kicked another in the crotch. The gang was overwhelmed by his spontaneous aggression and do-anything-necessary fighting style. “Hey! No fair pulling hair,” yelled the leader of the men attacking (or being attacked by) my dad. To which my dad laughed in exasperation and said, “There are six of you and one of me! I’ll do whatever I damn well please!” The men decided it was best to leave him alone at this point.</p>
<p>My dad taught us a number of lessons with this story. As a feminist, academic, “artsy” son, I can tell you that some of those lessons weren’t positive. But I still feel proud of my dad. Is that wrong? Why do I still love telling this story? Why am I still so proud of Pop? Why is MMA (mixed martial arts—cage fighting) the only professional sport in which I have any interest?</p>

<title>Holding Me (Against My Will)</title>
<p>We were big on family dinners when I was young. I didn’t always appreciate the ritual. The sun was setting as I played in the backyard with my best friend, Chris McGlone. Chris asked me to come to his house for dinner. <italic>Much more interesting than dinner at my house</italic>, I thought with the snotty, spoiled attitude of a privileged ten-year-old. I went over to Pop, who was hard at work digging a small Koi pond in the back yard, and asked, in my most persuasive voice, “Dad, Chris invited me for dinner. His mom made ‘stinkies’, and I have never tried them and have always wanted to. Chris says they are his favorite. Is it OK if I go with him for dinner?” I laid out a perfect case. He would have to allow me, surely. After all, my mom said I was going to grow up to be a lawyer, since I was so persuasive and had a gift for making my case.</p>
<p>Dad replied, “Chris, I already told you. You’ll stay here tonight. You can have ‘stinkies’ another night. Thanks, buddy.” <italic>He’s got no reasoning</italic>, I thought to myself. <italic>Why tonight? I’ve waited for months to try ‘stinkies!’</italic> With no logical, rational recourse, I threw a full-blown temper tantrum: screaming, flowing tears, running, flailing, heaving. As I made one of my high-speed, freaked-out passes, Dad grabbed me with his enormous hands, wrapping them fully around my upper arm. They hurt as they pulled the skin. But my momentum was broken. I was stuck, so I raised my voice even louder, in full hysterics. Dad pulled me to his chest, held me, my arms folded in front of my chest. He was seated on the two-foot wall that surrounded the Koi pond. I was immobilized but fought with every ounce of my being to escape. <italic>This is abuse!</italic> I thought to myself. <italic>I hate him! He’s too big!</italic> Slowly, my hyperventilation stopped, and I calmed down and breathed normally. My tears stopped. I accepted my fate: dinner with the family.</p>
<p>At the time, my father’s hold felt like prison. I felt seized against my will, even though this may sound like the privileged whining of a spoiled brat. But now, with the meaning and moral force afforded by hindsight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411429091">Freeman, 2010</xref>), the dominant feeling I have is one of embrace. I feel the strength and love of a man who always put his family first. He told us he loved us every day, hugged and kissed us every day. He would say things like, “I love you kids more than anything else in the world. You can’t possibly understand how I feel right now. But I know you will understand one day, when you have kids of your own.”</p>
<p>By the way, I never did try “stinkies”—or even find out what they were, for that matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077800411429091">
<title>All That <italic>He</italic> Wants</title>
<p>It’s Saturday morning, Dad’s day of yard work and recreation. The Southern California sun fills the house, windows wide open. I run from my room, jump loudly down each of the three sets of stairs, land on the hard wood floor, and execute a flawless four-foot sock-slide to a stop. Looking outside, I see Dad wearing his short blue shorts, “Frankie the Flamingo” t-shirt, a pink hat, and sunglasses. <italic>What a sense of style</italic>. He waves and smiles from the backyard, tree clippers in hand. I take out my prize—my first cassette tape: Ace of Base’s 1993 mega-pop hit “All That She Wants.” I’m eleven. Anyone who’s heard the song can attest to its not-so-masculine sound and subject matter: “All that she wants, is another baby, she’s going tomorrow boy. All that she wants, is another baby, oh-eh-eh.” I wind it up with my finger, which seems important to do.</p>
<p>I stare dumbfounded at my dad’s enormous grey and black stereo system, which I’d never used before, and admire the endless racks of CDs on both sides. I push one of the tape decks labeled “1” instinctively and it opens. I place the tape in so it fits and close the deck. Then I’m stumped. I turn and yell through the open widows to my father working outside, “Hey, Dad!” “Ha?” he calls back from behind a bush. “Can I play my tape in the stereo, on the outside [speakers] too?” “What?” he says, as he walks toward me wiping sweat from his brow. “Oh, sure,” he says, seeing what I’m up to. “Hold on a minute, and I’ll help you.” He strolls into the family room smelling sweet and musky, like a gorilla. Swooping in, he gives me a big, sweaty hug that lifts me off the ground. He’s making me pay a sweaty-dad-hug tax for using his stereo. His thick stubble roughs me up like sandpaper.</p>
<p>Dad presses the power button on the stereo and it glows red. I hear the click and hum of tiny mechanical gears and then, BANG: out pours the smooth, Swedish synth beat of “All That She Wants” on the surround sound speakers inside the house. But I want more—I want to play the song on all the speakers—on the ones strategically placed throughout our spacious backyard too. Dad knows this and says, “Here, use this to control the volume, and here is how you turn on and off the outside speakers.” “Cooooooooool! Thanks, Dad!” In my mind, I forgive his sweaty, sharp Dad-hug. He goes back to his yard work. I spend the next <italic>four hours</italic> running around, inside and outside of the house, scream-singing “All That She Wants.” The song is on repeat and plays over and over and over and over and over. I remember my dad’s smile.</p>

<title>Adult Conversation</title>
<p>I can’t sleep again. I’m thirteen. It is early on a Saturday morning. For the past six months, since my parents separated, my brother and I have been trading weeks between my mom’s and dad’s houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800411429091">3</xref></sup> For the past six months I have had biweekly insomnia. My dad is getting sicker, and I can’t find sleep at his house. At night <italic>the fear</italic> manifests. It is not conscious, but I feel it in my body. I become a restless zombie. I wander around aimlessly in the darkness most nights. My mind never stops. Some nights I drag my blanket and pillow out into the hall and sleep on the floor. Tonight Dad hears me rummaging around downstairs. “Hey Chris, why don’t you come on up? Let’s have a chat,” he calls, his voice straining. The sun is still asleep, not yet threatening to rise, still hiding my fear and my father’s withered form.</p>
<p>“Buddy,” my dad says, as I walk through the threshold of his bedroom door. “I know you’re upset. It’s OK,” he tells me. He is a shadowy figure backlit by the Catalina green banker’s lamp on his nightstand. He sits up, a bag of bones with softballs sticking out. The fear strikes—<italic>I have to run</italic>. “It is time to have an adult conversation,” he tells me. I don’t run. “You are a strong young man. You are very intelligent and are old enough to understand what is happening to me. Jeff’s still too young to hear this, but you will be able to explain it to him and help him understand.” I realize what my father is getting at. I don’t leave. I face my fear. I listen.</p>
<p>Climbing into Dad’s bed, I stick my head under a pillow and cry while he talks, nodding my head so he knows I can hear. He sits next to me and lets me hide. He places a bony hand on my back and rubs my neck as he talks, speaking softly, gently. “Sometimes life is hard, Chris. Even the strongest people can get sick. I have fought with every ounce of my being. I have used my love for you and your sister and brother and mom to help me fight. I love you all more than anything else in the world. Chris, I’m dying. The doctors have tried everything, and there is nothing more they can do. I am still fighting. I will never stop. <italic>You are the best son a dad could ask for</italic>,” he says, as he begins to cry with me. “I know you will grow up to be a great man, and you will have a family of your own one day that you love as much as I love you. I know that you will be strong for your sister and brother and mom and you will take care of them.” I lie there in the darkness hiding and crying, but feel confident that he is right. That he trusts me enough to tell me the truth makes me proud, yet I am overwhelmed with sadness. Buried in the darkness of his pillow, I imagine I am at the bottom of the ocean, crushed by water so deep that no light penetrates, yet somehow I can still breathe.</p>
<p>Have I lived up to my father’s dreams? To my own? Sometimes, I still feel like a scared, fourteen-year-old boy. Somehow, at the same time, I feel like an ancient man who thinks about things usually reserved for the “twilight years,” like death and sentimentality and our connections to one another. I’m like my grandfather but at a much younger age, emotionally vulnerable and sensitive. Now, I wonder whether these stories are mythic enough to do justice to my archetypal memories of my lost father. Did I <italic>restore to necromancy</italic>, evoke the dead and the living?</p>

<title>Crafting a Restorative <italic>Mythos</italic>: Recasting a Fallen Hero in Troubled Times</title>
<p>Humans are storytelling animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411429091">Burke, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411429091">Fisher, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411429091">1987</xref>). At a basic level, my (Dad’s) story is an old one. It is a myth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411429091">Campbell, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411429091">Rank, 1922/2004</xref>), one that parallels stories Buddhists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411429091">Chodron, 2001</xref>) and existentialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411429091">Frankl, 1984</xref>) tell: Life entails suffering. Life is limited and we live in a troubled world. My father’s death imprinted this myth into me, intimately, experientially. My split, tragi-comic telling relates to a number of personal and collective tensions. Before I synthesize these, I should clear up my usage of <italic>myth</italic>, as I embrace a culturally minor yet more ancient orientation to the word.</p>
<p>I agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos (2009)</xref> that myth has been given a “bad” name in contemporary, common usage—even in the academy. Yet, from a different perspective, <italic>myth</italic> can be productively reclaimed and recast in the interdisciplinary worlds of qualitative, social scientific research to help us explore some of our most intimate, foundational, and complex human relationships—like the archetypal relationship between a father and a son, life’s relationship to death, or love’s relationship to loss. As Poulos says, “Myth is a tie that binds us” (p. 147). In 2008 I wrote a song titled “Ties (Lies) That Bind.” This song was about my father’s death and my struggle to come to terms with life in the face of his passing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800411429091">Patti, 2009</xref>). Telling my dad as a myth shows the ties that bind him to me and the ties that bind us all as human beings in a shifting world.</p>

<title>Old Myth, New Myth: Making the Personal Mythical</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>The personal creative act is related to the realm of myth, the realm of muses, because myth is the homeland of the inspiration of the arts. The muses are the children of the goddess of memory, which is not the memory from up there, from the head; it is the memory from down here, from the heart. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411429091">Campbell, 1997</xref>, p. 151)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A more ancient yet simultaneously intimate/affective engagement with myth, especially as it is connected to masculinity, offers different <italic>possibilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800411429091">Poulos, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411429091">2010</xref>) for how I understand myself, my father, and human connection/communication generally. My approach is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos (2009)</xref> when he says, “Some stories reside in the liminal space between the mythical and the everyday, drawing from the energies that emanate from both poles” (p. 146). As I hope to make clear by the end, drawing on the energies that emanate from both poles is one of the core lessons I find in my father’s life and death as well as in the struggle to navigate the dichotomies that still divide our world.</p>
<p>Myth from this perspective is meant as the symbolic, storied connection between human beings and how the human animal understands itself in the world (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411429091">Campbell, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411429091">1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800411429091">Jung, 1947/2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800411429091">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411429091">Pirsig, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos, 2009</xref>). As Campbell puts it, “The first and most essential service of a mythology is this one, of opening the mind and the heart to the utter wonder of all being” (p. 18). We are born into symbols, stories, and conversations that preexist us, change over time, and will continue, likely, long after we die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411429091">Burke, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411429091">Eisenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800411429091">Goodall, 2005</xref>). And the existential rub of it all is that our lives, all of them, are over in an instant—all life ends.</p>
<p>In that sense, then, we are all tragic heroes/heroines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411429091">Rank, 1922/2004</xref>). But we are not without <italic>hope, possibility</italic>, and <italic>meaning</italic>—even in such a troubled world in which we face the fact of suffering. Tragedy is tied intimately to comedy, as death is tied to life and loss to love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411429091">Bochner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411429091">Burke, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077800411429091">Pelias, 2000</xref>). Through sharing in the complex symbolic stew of myth, we spark possibility, insight, compassion, and communion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411429091">Frentz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A personal myth shows the epic and trivial, collective and personal, conscious and unconscious, hero and the trickster at the same time. It mixes the sacred and the profane in a way that fits with what I call post-postmodern sensibilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos (2009)</xref> argues myth is a move toward the sacred, which “strikes at the core of what it means to be human” (p. 147). The synergies created between collective myth and our personal stories, he goes on to argue, “may well prove to be transformative” (p. 170). This transformative potential is precisely what I am after. As with myth generally, I use the myth of my father as “guidance for living well in a troubled world” (p. 144). Underlying this use is a profound sense of love, connection, and admiration for my father, and by extension, life itself.</p>
<p>The stories above are at the edges of my intimate memory of my father. They are <italic>small</italic> stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429091">Bamberg, 2006</xref>) that manifest as I meditate on the <italic>archetypal</italic> meaning of <italic>father</italic> and <italic>son</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077800411429091">Turner (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411429091">Knapp (1988)</xref> both define archetype as an imprint, stamp, or impression. My father was my archetype—he impressed me and continues impressing me to this day. But it is not a perfect stamp. His impression is refracted through my own experiences in the world, creating a new-yet-referential/relational sense of self and other.</p>

<title>The Trickster/Hero: Autoethnographic, Mythic Possibilities</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>The stage is set for the emergence in adolescence of the archetypal opposition of the trickster vs. the hero and its resolution is an encounter with the father. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800411429091">Saunders, 1987</xref>, p. 177)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Dad, writing about you again, this time for a public, interpretive audience, has forced me to look deeply into a number of anxieties I have lived with for years, anxieties I have consciously ignored but felt nonetheless. “The fear” I spoke of at the outset, I feel it now. The curious thing is that my anxieties have no conscious connection to your life and death. They seem, to my conscious mind, unrelated. But I sense, at a deep, unconscious level, at the corner of my eye, that they are connected. As I struggle through writing I begin to <italic>face my fear</italic>, to let it be, to sit with it, and <italic>listen to it. I don’t run and hide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411429091">Ellis, in press</xref>). So many years later, I still feel your gentle, strong hand on my back. I hear your voice and sense of humor. I sense your love. I feel your strength and your weakness in me. I am your son.</p>
<p>While “the hero” may seem more explicit in the stories I tell, the trickster is no less present. By its archetypal nature, the trickster is trickier to show than the hero—she or he lives in the ambiguous, flowing, in-betweenness of our lives and stories. She or he is there in the feminine moments in my myth of male initiation. She or he is there in the explicit sacred-profanity, comedy, anxiety, and violence of our stories and relationships. She or he is the implicit and largely unconscious rhetorical glue that holds this myth together. As a rhetor/rhetorician, I’ve been drawn to the trickster—like an ancient sophist or the character <italic>Phaedrus</italic> from Dad’s and my favorite book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411429091">Pirsig’s (1974)</xref> <italic>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411429091">Frentz, 2008a</xref>, for a more detailed discussion of the trickster and <italic>Zen</italic>). <italic>Zen</italic> too is about a father and son and mending the split between the ego and shadow—hero and trickster—and mending the classic splits that divide a troubled, flattened world before it is too late.</p>
<p>In mythology, the trickster disobeys normal social rules and causes havoc, often unconsciously. Citing Lewis Hyde (1988, p. 7), Tom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411429091">Frentz (2008a)</xref> explains that the trickster is a “wise fool . . . cross-dresser, the speaker of sacred profanities . . . the mythic embodiment of ambiguity . . . contradiction and paradox” (p. 22). What makes the trickster bearable is that, often times, his or her tricks, while seemingly destructive and negative at first, have ultimately positive consequences (Hyde, 1988). I’m tired of only embracing my trickster—it’s too risky. And I work to see my father as more than a one-dimensional hero. As my mom reminded me, this story is about “John Wayne, the complicated man, not the hero he played on screen.”</p>

<title>Two Tricksters Play</title>
<p>1994: It’s been a few months since my parents split and we’re hit with it: Dad’s got stage four melanoma. Mom and Dad made plans six months ago to visit a family friend’s beach house, so, despite their separation and Dad’s illness, he coaxes, “Ah, what the heck. Let’s just go have a fun night with friends, away from all this. We can let off some steam.” Mom begrudgingly agrees. When the night of the party arrives, Mom takes me and Jeff to pick my dad up in a friend’s yellow Volkswagen bus. Pop’s convinced her to drive.</p>
<p>My dad enjoyed drinking socially. He was used to being the life of the party. I can picture him singing with bravado, standing on a table, acting out a strip-tease to the crowd. The party loves him for it, cheers him on, and he loves the attention. I can see my mom shaking her head in the corner, knowing that he’s putting on a show to cover up the deep troubles they’ve found themselves facing. As the night wears on, Dad drinks more. I don’t usually notice when he’s drunk, but tonight he is at a level of public intoxication I have never seen. Everyone has left the party except Dad, Mom, me, and Jeff and the hosts. Dad’s shitfaced; his head is flopped back on the couch as he sing-mumbles happily away. Mom and our family friends have to shoulder him to the car. He drags his feet like a 200-pound toddler, cracking jokes along the way: “You ever see such a big baby? I’m not fat, just the most in-shape, overweight guy you’ve ever seen. Lori, do you really need all this help just to get me into bed?” I walk behind, sad, scared, not really sure what is going on. My dad knew what he was doing the entire time. He was forcing my mom to take care of him while he had a drunken temper-tantrum.</p>
<p>2008: My first semester of doctoral work, I take a seminar called Feminism &amp; Performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800411429091">4</xref></sup> For my first presentation in a doctoral seminar, still basically an anonymous new student in my department, I come dressed in “cyborg-drag”—a female colleague’s jean skirt, a tight, open-chested silk blouse, and high heels, completing the look with some aluminum dryer piping as a cyborg arm—and present on Donna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800411429091">Haraway (2004)</xref>. I bring a box of glue-gun fashioned “cyborg” parts my brother and I crafted and a box of “men’s dress clothes” (since the rest of the class save one are women). We play cyborg cross-dress-up.</p>
<p>Since beginning my doctoral work I have been a philosophically, theoretically, and romantically ambiguous man, which has not led to the most stable romantic relationships over the past three years. Yet I remain friends with almost all the women with whom I have related romantically, something my trickster skills helped to achieve. One telling instance occurred with a woman who was a long-time friend. She was having trouble with her romantic partner before we became involved. I convinced her to visit, knowing full well our attraction, and we spent a dream-like week together floating in the cyan, eighty-five degree waters of the Gulf. Her last day with me, she knew my feelings without me having to say a word: “You are the most ambiguous man I’ve ever met,” she said with a smile. “There is deep confusion in you.” I responded, “Too much of this postmodern theory—I’ve taken it to heart. I don’t know how to get out of it.” We remain close friends today. She told her partner about her visit and she and her partner have since moved forward in their relationship. They got past a block. Two years later, I am moving forward for myself, letting go of identifying only with ambiguity, finding deeper, more whole senses of myself and my father.</p>
<p>In his chapter, “The Split-Shadow and the Father-Son Relationship,” Donald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800411429091">Saunders (1987)</xref>, a Jungian analyst, illuminates the critical tension I feel. My struggle is tied to the archetypal masculine rite of passage. As Saunders explains, “The split [between the ego and shadow, the hero and trickster] must in some way be resolved by every young man as an initiatory stage leading to maturity” (pp. 179-180). Saunders uses the classic Navajo myth of Badger (hero) and Coyote (trickster) to show the need for father and son, ego and shadow, hero and trickster to realize they are not separate. Each must realize itself in the other in order to move forward into maturity.</p>
<p>As the Navajo myth predicts, therefore, I must make sacrifices on both sides: “His sacrifice will not be, as in the past, for the perfection of Christian virtue or Eastern enlightenment, but rather to become a more complete human being, consciously aware of both unattainable idealizations as well as instinctual temptations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077800411429091">Saunders, 1987</xref>, p. 187). By embracing the heroes and tricksters in my father and myself, my split myth of initiation becomes unified. It is a classically masculine hero’s quest for existential freedom, mastery, and enlightenment—while simultaneously a feminine trickster’s jest filled with shadows, creativity, humor, intimacy, fear, and anxiety. Synchronically, this “becoming whole” is just what my collective mythic inheritance calls for, just what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411429091">Jung (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800411429091">Rushing and Frentz (1995)</xref> envision as individual and collective “individuation.” This is a collective wisdom our troubled, split world could use as well.</p>
<p>In the humanities and social sciences, our posttheories/philosophies/methods mirror both the fragmented fracturing that has happened over the past hundred years and the <italic>possibilities</italic> afforded by the breakdown of dualistic mono myths like science over spirit, objective over subjective, masculine over feminine, self over-and-separate-from other, hero over trickster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800411429091">Gergen, 2004</xref>). In my experience, my father’s early death fractured my world and sent me off in directions I could not have imagined. I was given an intuitive sensibility for the postmodern theories, methods, and philosophies that have come to the fore in the realm of qualitative inquiry. But I also faced unforeseen challenges. And as I alluded to at the beginning of this automythology, I have been in crisis, that “split in consciousness—the interruption—that comes just before moments of breakthrough” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411429091">Poulos, 2009</xref>, p. 145). I hurt. I miss my father. I have anxieties. I am struggling to move from this liminal, potential-rich initiation phase before I lose my mind/body.</p>
<p>As my final story suggests, my moment of insight and breakthrough comes not solely from my father or from the myth of the father but also from a feminine/feminist influence on the father–son relationship. Behind this particular article, in the shadows of my father’s shadow, is an embodied foundation of compassionate feminism I was taught first by my mother, two powerful female grandmothers, four influential aunts, and an eight-years-older sister.</p>
<p>The <italic>sacred feminine</italic> is part of the unconscious of this story, not only personally, but academically as well. Carolyn Ellis, my advisor/mother, showed me that, through the struggle to share intimate, evocative stories, we can compassionately connect our ideas and lives to other ideas and other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411429091">Ellis, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411429091">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411429091">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411429091">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800411429091">2009</xref>). For me, compassion through sharing in stories of suffering/joy is what mythic storytelling is all about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411429091">Chodron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411429091">Ellis, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411429091">Frank, 1995</xref>). Of course, I’m not alone here either: “The awakening of compassion, ‘com-passion’, ‘<italic>Mit-leid</italic>’, ‘suffering-with’, enveloping that person’s pain in your skin, so that you are suffering with him or her equally, that is the awakening of the heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411429091">Campbell, 1997</xref>, p. 153). Or as Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411429091">Freeman (2004)</xref> illuminates, personal stories as scholarship are not only about increasing knowledge and understanding, they “support the aim of increasing compassion and sympathy, and a sense of connection with others” (p. 79).</p>
<p>As I move forward, I hope to continue following this mythic quest and tell other stories of love and loss in a troubled world. In doing so, I hope to heal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411429091">Ellis, in press</xref>): “Narratives can help one heal the wounds of the past, help one begin again, to remake, revise, to re-story—to re-fresh” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429091">Bochner, 2008</xref>, p. 1323). I aspire to share stories that show other complexities, other anxieties, and other possibilities for mythic communion and compassion.</p>
<p>Dad, I hope I make you proud, even in my limitations. I hope readers have a sense of you and our relationship and a sense of the deep roots that connect them to those they love and connect us all as human beings. I hope I can move forward now and take on the responsibilities that have taken me so long to confront and have caused me so much fear and anxiety. Remember our nightly ritual, when you would tuck Jeff and me into bed? “Good night, sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs bite.” Then we’d reply, “‘Cause they’re outside playing.” And you’d say, “That’s right.” That’s right.</p>

<p><italic>Monkey mind</italic> is an ancient and contemporary term used by Buddhists to refer to a frantic state of mind. A mind untrained in mindfulness and meditation easily and frequently overflows with conscious, unconscious, and semiconscious thoughts and is said to chatter like a monkey. Monkey mind causes suffering, therefore, by detaching one from being present while he or she attaches to conditioned, obsessive, and often destructive thought patterns. See, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411429091">Chodron’s (1999)</xref> <italic>Taming the Monkey Mind</italic>.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, my father and mother separated a few months prior to finding out about Dad’s cancer. I thought divorce sounded bad—but Dad’s terminal illness put things in perspective for me. Despite my parents’ separation, after twenty years of marriage, they were still close, especially as my father got sicker. Love remained between them, and I remember my mom helping to care for my dad, making and bringing him dinner, talking to him. My mom and dad didn’t care if others were unable to understand their postseparation bond. As my mom has told me, “I didn’t stop loving your father, even though I needed to change my life for myself. I wanted to be there for him as much as I could and as much as he wanted me there. Plus, he liked my cooking.”</p>

<p>At this point in my life, I had studied feminism(s), and considered myself a feminist, for years. As a trickster, feminism helped me undermine my socialized notions of masculinity, patriarchy, and hierarchy. Feminism also gave me words for my embodied experience of watching my mom take care of us after our dad died, watching her work construction, “pulling wire” alongside 250-pound men while she put herself through graduate school.</p>
