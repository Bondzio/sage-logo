<abstract>
<p>Work detailed in this paper describes the development of a swimmer-worn, wireless sensor node capable of capturing real time acceleration data during all phases of swimming, i.e. the start, free swimming, and turns. Analysis of results focuses on the interpretation of these data for the tumble turn. Phases of the turn are characterized in the data enabling the contribution of each phase – approach, rotation, and glide – to be evaluated. A single subject, a triathlete, 400 m swim trial was used to capture acceleration data of multiple turns for analysis. Statistical process control (SPC) charts were used to present results and give an indication of whether correlation occurred between each of the turn phases and total turn time. Informal feedback from swimming professionals suggested that these presentation methods supply results in an easy-to-interpret manner, whereby outliers and variations in performance could be visually identified.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Performance in swimming is measured by the time taken to complete a set distance whilst complying with rules outlined by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337111428395">1</xref>]. Swimming events can be broken into four contributing factors: the start, free swimming, turns, and the finish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111428395">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111428395">3</xref>]. The importance of each of these phases is dependent on the specific event. For three events in the 2008 Beijing Olympics the contribution of the turns was analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111428395">4</xref>]. The events observed were the 50 m (no turns), 100 m (one turn), and 200 m (three turns) freestyle women’s races. Turn time was defined as the time from 5 m into and 10 m out of the turn. It was found that for this example a 1 per cent improvement in turning performance would affect the podium placing in the 100 m event for 1st and 2nd places. More significantly, it would change the entire finishing places in the 200 m event, where a 1 per cent improvement equated to 0.24 s, which was greater than the time difference between the finishing times of each of the podium positions. In the case of the 200 m race, the contributions of the turns equated to 21 per cent of total race time.</p>
<p>In swimming there are two types of turn: the tumble turn and the open turn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111428395">5</xref>]. Tumble turns are used for both freestyle and backstroke events, where the swimmer performs a forward roll on approach to the wall and pushes off with only their feet. The open turn is used in butterfly, breaststroke and medley events, between the butterfly and backstroke legs and the breaststroke and freestyle legs, where the swimmer touches both hands on the wall and then pushes off with their feet.</p>
<p>It is conventional to divide the turn into phases to facilitate more specific analysis and a review of current research into turn technique is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337111428395">Fig. 1</xref>. The research reviewed was predominantly focused on the tumble turn technique, which is also the focus for this paper. For this reason, papers have been categorized into phases relevant for this type of turn. These phases translate directly to the open turn, with the exception of the rotation phase and the wall contact phase, which is divided into hand and foot contact, as described in Tourny-Chollet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111428395">6</xref>]. The typical measurements taken and values obtained have also been summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337111428395">Fig. 1</xref>. The phases of the turn have been defined as: (i) approach, (ii) rotation, (iii) wall contact, (iv) glide, and (v) stroke preparation. Techniques used for measuring each of these phases have included hand timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111428395">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111428395">9</xref>], manual digitization of video [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111428395">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337111428395">10</xref>], and collection of force data from instrumented turning walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111428395">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111428395">9</xref>]. All of the research papers reviewed rely on manual vision techniques and hand timing to ascertain the overall measurement of performance, whether this was round trip time (RTT) or velocity off the wall (<italic>V</italic><sub>OT</sub>). The major limitation of these techniques is that they are expensive in terms of time, cost, and operator expertise and knowledge. In addition, they suffer from inherent variability due to their reliance on human judgement. Typical time costs, for example, to digitize a single point on the swimmer during a turn with a 7-second RTT can take ~1 minute for an experienced analyst.</p>

</fig>
<p>There are a limited number of published papers that are focused specifically on swimming turning performance, compared to free swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111428395">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337111428395">11</xref>]. As in the start [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337111428395">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754337111428395">13</xref>], the glide phase out of the turn has been identified as an important factor in overall performance. Lyttle <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754337111428395">14</xref>] reported on the optimal time to initiate kicking after the glide from the wall using tethered swimming. Marinho <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754337111428395">15</xref>] reported more generic research into gliding in swimming using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. It is noted that of all the phases defined in turning, the rotation phase has been addressed the least in literature.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies applied to swimming research have begun to address the shortcomings of current accepted methods of performance analysis. These systems use non-encumbering, swimmer worn ‘nodes’ to monitor performance, using sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Validation trials for the use of accelerometers in swim-specific analysis have been carried out, and results presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754337111428395">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754337111428395">19</xref>]. It was reported that accelerometer data, collected from a node mounted on the small of the back, could be analysed to derive: (i) lap count and timing to ±1 s in 90 per cent of cases, (ii) stroke rate, stroke count to ±1 stroke/minute for 90 per cent of cases, and (iii) stroke recognition for 95 per cent of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754337111428395">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Ohji <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754337111428395">16</xref>] found that acceleration traces when the node was positioned on the wrist could be used to discriminate stroke phases, although this was only achieved by integrating synchronized video with the acceleration data.</p>
<p>The solutions adopting accelerometer data for the performance analysis of swimming have shown that algorithms could be used to monitor successfully parameters such as stroke rate and duration without the need for <italic>traditional</italic> manual vision analysis techniques, discussed in Callaway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754337111428395">20</xref>]. This means that quantitative analysis of multiple parameters could be carried out in <italic>real time</italic> rather than taking minutes or tens of minutes as is the cost (in time) associated with employing vision-based techniques. In addition, accelerometer-based results can result in improved accuracy, consistency, and reliability since the derived performance parameters no longer rely on human judgement for their quantification. Although the use of acceleration data for free swimming has been reported, specific work on their application for starts and turns analysis has not yet been addressed.</p>
<p>Telemetry systems have been previously been reported in a swimming context, for example to enable the measurement of pressure on the hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754337111428395">21</xref>]. However, in recent literature on body worn sensors within the swimming domain, the technologies have been operated in a data logging capacity in which the information is downloaded after the event for analysis and feedback. A system whereby data is transmitted wirelessly in real-time would enable more timely analysis of the data. Note: in the literature, integrated body worn wireless sensor systems are generally classified as body sensor networks (BSNs).</p>
<p>Typically a BSN consists of a number of standard <italic>components</italic> that are common throughout all applications. These have been summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337111428395">Fig. 2</xref>, as <italic>distributed sensor monitoring</italic>, <italic>wireless communication</italic>, <italic>local processing and storage</italic>, and <italic>networked server</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754337111428395">22</xref>]. <italic>Distributed sensor monitoring</italic> can be in the form of implantable or wearable sensors that are used to monitor the capability of the human body, either in a physiological or kinematic capacity. These sensors wirelessly communicate their data to a local processing unit, for example, a laptop or personal digital assistant (PDA). <italic>Wireless communication</italic> allows real-time monitoring, which is essential for applications such as intervention during an elite athlete’s training schedule.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111428395-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Typically the <italic>local processing</italic> unit stores sensor data to a database and enables analysis and feedback to be given to the monitored person. Alternatively, this feedback can be passed directly to other relevant parties; in the case of sport this may be the coach or sports scientist and in healthcare this may be clinicians. This facilitates analysis and feedback to be undertaken without the need for direct contact. This could also be used to flag emergency situations or potential high injury likelihood when performing a particular movement, and enable timely remedial action to be taken. Equally. it allows data to be shared remotely among parties located in different geographical regions within a building; for example used to monitor the behaviour of the elderly within their home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754337111428395">23</xref>], or over a larger geographic region, for example where a PDA can be networked via mobile phone technology (e.g. GSM, GPRS) to enable medical professionals to remotely monitor the state of a patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754337111428395">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754337111428395">25</xref>].</p>
<p>It is believed that a swimmer-based BSN to monitor athlete performance would enable real-time data capture, analysis, and feedback that could be shared among appropriate parties, e.g. sports scientists and coaches, located in different geographical regions. This could facilitate the construction of a large electronic data library that would increase the current knowledge base, where data is normally noted on paper and ‘filed’. These data could be stored over time and trends derived. A <italic>networked server</italic> would also enable constant monitoring of athletes’ performances across the country such that the deployment of experienced support staff could be prioritized to be most effective, e.g. physiotherapists, nutritionists, coaches. Equally important is the capability to provide feedback to athletes <italic>remotely</italic> where they would previously not have had access to expert review and advice.</p>
<p>Currently measured turning performance parameters have included <italic>last stroke into the wall</italic> and <italic>wall contact time</italic> information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111428395">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111428395">9</xref>]. These parameters have been established using manual vision analysis techniques, which incur a high time cost, require operator expertise, and suffer from inherent variability due to human judgement. The research presented in this paper details work undertaken towards characterizing acceleration data collected from swimming tumble turn performance and identifying performance-related features corresponding to the phases of the turn. This has enabled a real-time analysis of turning performance to be derived using automated, reliable, and repeatable techniques, adopting a BSN without the need for skilled operator input.</p>
<p>It was vital that solutions developed for performance monitoring of elite swimmers were capable of deriving relevant information, in a timely manner, with limited demands on the end user, i.e. data should be processed automatically and timely results determined such that they were easy to interpret and facilitate real-time feedback.</p>
<p>The aim of work presented in this paper was to establish the features of tumble turn performance that could be identified in tri-axis acceleration traces. The intention was to determine the potential for the development of algorithms to allow automated analysis of the turn via characterization of these signals, so reducing the quantity of skilled work currently required to derive quantitative measurements of performance from video. It was also hoped that more specific insights would be established with regards to the phases of the turn, i.e. in addition to the round trip time, and that this information could be derived robustly to enable timely feedback to athletes and coaches.</p>

<title>2 Methodology</title>
<p>A male triathlete, aged 23 years and a member of the elite Great Britain squad (i.e. Olympic distance category), performed a 400 m freestyle swim as part of his normal training session, during which time he was asked to wear a wireless accelerometer in the small of his back. The 400 m trial was performed towards the end of the warm-up session at less than ‘competition pace’. The swimmer was instructed to focus on maintaining stroke and turn quality, rather than speed. These instructions were provided to minimize fluctuations in turn performance that may occur due to fatigue and/or mis-timing the approach into the wall as a result of inconsistent stroke rates, and therefore would result in an ‘ideal’ turn profile for analysis. In addition, video data for each of the turns was captured at 25 frames/second (f/s) using a fixed underwater camera. The primary aim of testing was to establish characteristics evident in the acceleration data which could be linked with confidence to specific phases of the tumble turn. Testing was performed in a short course pool, i.e. 25 m, resulting in 15 turns that could be used for analysis. Algorithms were developed in MATLAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754337111428395">26</xref>], to crop turn data from the 400 m swim trace and enable each turn to be analysed individually. Statistical process control charts were used to present the results of the analysis and enable the ready identification of outliers in the data.</p>

<title>3 Wireless Node Description</title>
<p>The BSN node that the swimmer was asked to wear was developed as part of a research project currently being carried out at Loughborough University. The node has been developed in line with the requirements of elite athletes, coaches, and sports science staff based at the University. The developed node design included only core hardware components to minimize the overall footprint, thus producing a more wearable solution. Components included in the design were: microcontroller, analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) with associated sensor, i.e. tri-axis accelerometer (Analog Devices, ADXL 330 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754337111428395">27</xref>]), bi-axis gyroscope (InvenSense, IDG300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1754337111428395">28</xref>]), digital interface to enable the connection of additional memory, the crystal oscillator, radio components, and power. The resulting prototype board was 90 mm × 40 mm, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111428395">Fig. 3</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111428395-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A software data buffer was implemented, using the external (FRAM) memory, to minimize possible data losses resulting from interruptions in wireless communication where a node may be too deep underwater to transmit data successfully. A <italic>star</italic> network topology was implemented that enabled communications to and from multiple nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754337111428395">29</xref>]. For the current single subject study the swimmer wore a single node; however, there is no reason why a squad of swimmers could not all wear nodes or why a single swimmer could not wear multiple nodes at different key points on their body in future tests. Future developments may also require a shift towards a different network topology and communications protocol, e.g. a mesh network adopting a Zigbee-type protocol if a significant increase in the number of nodes or hopping functionality is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754337111428395">30</xref>]. An external physical trigger in the form of a 5 V transistor transistor logic (TTL) signal was used to start the capture of data from the node and enabled synchronized video data to be recorded which supported the characterization of acceleration profiles.</p>

<title>4 Results</title>
<p>The wireless node was worn in the small of the back and the tri-axis accelerometer was orientated such that the <italic>x</italic>-axis was measuring forward motion, the <italic>y</italic>-axis was measuring lateral movements and the <italic>z</italic>-axis was measuring movement up and down, i.e. vertical (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111428395">Fig. 4</xref>). A data level fusion approach was adopted for analysis, whereby sensor data was collected, features extracted via signal processing, and then measurements of performance were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1754337111428395">31</xref>]. The data relating specifically to the turn were isolated by cropping from the last arm pull before the turn to the first arm pull following the turn. For the freestyle stroke, in the <italic>y</italic>-axis (lateral), pronounced waves are produced corresponding to each arm pull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1754337111428395">32</xref>], and a zero crossings algorithm allowed each arm pull to be identified. Peak analysis and thresholding of the <italic>z</italic>-axis was used to determine lap times (see the pronounced signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5(a)</xref>). A combination of lap times and arm pull counts was then used to crop the data to isolate the corresponding turn data for each of the three axes of acceleration. The <italic>z</italic>-axis demonstrated the most pronounced signal during the turn phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111428395">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Since the freestyle event involves a forward tumble turn, the <italic>z</italic>-axis data (i.e. up and down movements) was used to analyse the performance of each of the turns during the swim (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5</xref>). The raw data for the <italic>z</italic>-axis of acceleration collected for the full 400 m swim is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5(a)</xref>. The point where the swimmer turns onto their back during the turn is observed as the sharp positive peak change in acceleration. The cropped data, specifically for each turn in the swim, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5(b)</xref>. From the diagram it is evident that the data representing each turn has a characteristic signature, i.e. a repeatable pattern, but that the time taken for each turn varies. The total duration of each turn in the order in which they were performed is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5(c)</xref>. For this trial, variability of 5 per cent, 0.35 s, was seen between individual turns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111428395">Fig. 5(c)</xref> and discussion below).</p>
<p>To understand better the profile of the acceleration data obtained from the node, underwater video of the swimmer turning was collected from a fixed camera and digitized. The digitized turn allowed a better understanding of the swimmer’s performance in <italic>acceleration space</italic> (more difficult to comprehend than looking at positions or velocity) to be developed. Every three frames (i.e. 0.12 s for a camera frame rate of 25 f/s) a point approximating to the small of the back, i.e. where the node was mounted, was recorded. From the time sequence of these positional data, the velocity and acceleration of the swimmer’s hips were derived (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>). As the swimmer approached the end of the pool to turn, the derived acceleration was relatively constant (see Image 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>), as would be expected during free swimming, with undulations evident resulting from the various phases of the approaching strokes. The swimmer’s acceleration then reduced significantly (see Image 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>) and became negative – approximately –5 m/s s in this case – as the swimmer slows to rotate (see Image 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>) representing the point where the swimmer’s velocity is slowing to enable them to change direction. As the swimmer pushes off the wall they produce a larger acceleration than during the free swim phase (see Image 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>). After the push off the swimmer glides before returning to free swimming where their acceleration profile returns to a constant value in the final phase of the glide, with small fluctuations resulting from the signature of the free swimming profile.</p>

<p>It is important to note that when digitizing the image, the coordinate origin is constant, i.e. <italic>x</italic> was always left-to-right on the image. This situation is different to that of the node, since, in reality, the local (i.e. node) coordinate origin depends on the orientation of the small of the back of the swimmer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111428395">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Video and <italic>z</italic>-axis (vertical) acceleration data obtained from the swimmer-worn node during a turn are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111428395">Fig. 7</xref>. It is to be noted that the <italic>z</italic>-axis acceleration signal shares similarities with the digitized acceleration detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111428395">Fig. 7</xref>, orthogonal coordinate axes have been superimposed onto the small of the back of the swimmer to understand better the acceleration contribution from gravity in the recorded signal. The <italic>z</italic>-axis data were considered, since this axis was likely to experience the greatest variation in profile (due to gravity) compared with the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes. As observed in the digitized video analysis, the acceleration on approach to the turn was fairly constant, fluctuating with the stroke cycle for freestyle. Note: the affect of gravity on the accelerometer is such that when a given axis is placed perpendicular to gravity it reads ±9.81 m/s s (i.e. ±1 g). In reality this means that the orientation of the accelerometer with respect to gravity is responsible for the overriding component of the observed signal, since the contribution from gravity produces a significantly bigger acceleration than the acceleration the swimmer generates as the result of his techniques and the phase of the swimming event. For this data set the maximum magnitude of acceleration measured for the turns was &lt;2 m/s s, i.e. 0.2 g, this value was derived from the digitized video captured alongside the accelerometer data.</p>
<p>As the swimmer initiates the turn they rotate to where the coordinate axes (initially +<italic>z</italic> vertical and +<italic>x</italic> in the direction of motion) have turned through + 90°  clockwise. Practically, this means that the component of gravity would be absent from the <italic>z</italic>-axis and instead observed on the <italic>x</italic>-axis. This is represented in Image 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111428395">Fig. 7</xref> and by the point where the acceleration signal reduces to a figure close to zero (indicted by the arrow in the diagram). As the swimmer turns onto their back during the turn rotation, the contribution of gravity observed on the <italic>z</italic>-axis becomes negative (Image 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111428395">Fig. 7</xref>) compared to when the swimmer initiated the turn in a prone position. Once the swimmer starts to rotate back to a prone position following the turn, the acceleration data on the <italic>z</italic>-axis can be seen to return to fluctuating about the initial value of + 1 g. This motion was observed to initiate at the time of the negative peak in the acceleration trace included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111428395">Fig. 6</xref>, where the start of the rise of the trace (i.e. positive gradient) could be used to determine the point where the swimmer started to rotate off their back.</p>
<p>Integrated analysis of vision and accelerometer data allowed the signature of the tumble turn, from last arm pull before the turn to first arm pull after the turn, to be understood in acceleration space in terms of the time sequence of position and orientation of the athlete’s body. This enabled the generation of robust algorithms for determining the phases of the turn automatically, i.e. the approach, rotation, and glide, independent of vision data. These algorithms were then applied to the sample set of data to enable the assessment of the contribution of each of the phases to total turn time for the athlete under investigation.</p>
<p>The data collected from the turns undertaken by the subject in the study were further analysed by discriminating between the different phases, i.e. the approach, rotation, and glide, that are evident from the acceleration data of each turn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111428395">Fig. 8</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111428395">Fig. 8(a)</xref> a sample of a complete cropped turn has been shown, with the segmentation of the approach, rotation and glide phases indicated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111428395">Fig. 8(b)</xref> the percentage of total turn time for each of the above three elements of the turn has been shown. It was found that, for the swimmer tested, on average, 46 per cent of the turn was spent in the approach phase, 32 per cent in the rotation, and 22 per cent in the glide.</p>

<p>Statistical process control charts were used to highlight the time sequence of the times taken for each of the phases identified during the turn. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337111428395">Fig. 9</xref> for the approach times and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1754337111428395">Fig. 10</xref> for the rotation times. There are a number of interesting features within the approach time sequence. First, there is a general trend towards increased approach times throughout the trial (from 2.42 ± 0.31 s at turn 1 to 3.1 ± 0.31 s at turn 14), possibly the result of fatigue. Second, for the first 10 turns there is an apparent variation in which the approach times of every <italic>even</italic> numbered turn (i.e. turns 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) are on average 0.4 ± ms longer than the preceding <italic>odd</italic> numbered turn (i.e. turns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9). This behaviour is perhaps best explained by a preference of the swimmer when turning at one end of the pool than the other. The R<sup>2</sup> value, i.e. 0.22, of the best fit line indicates there may be a gradual trend towards increasing approach times throughout the swim, although this would not be considered significant.</p>

<p>A SPC chart for rotation times is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1754337111428395">Fig. 10</xref>. In contrast with approach times, the rotation time does not appear to increase significantly throughout the sequence. Features of note are as follows.</p>

<list-item><p>Turns 1 and 2, where the rotation times (<italic>T</italic><sub>rot1</sub> = 1.96 s, <italic>T</italic><sub>rot2</sub> = 1.94 s) are longer than the average turn time (<italic>T</italic><sub>rot_average</sub> = 1.83 s), perhaps attributed to going off too fast for the first 50 m of the 400 m trial.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The indication of an end to end variation in rotation times with the even number turns (i.e. 8, 10, and 12) being on average 0.17 s longer than the following odd numbered turn (i.e. 9, 11, and 13).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is noted that within the uncertainty associated with these measurements these conclusions have limited statistical significance but nonetheless provide topics for discussion and further investigation for both coach and athlete.</p>
<p>The SPC for glide times demonstrated more random fluctuation about the mean than observed within the approach and rotation charts. A straight line fit to the data indicates no significant trend throughout the sequence of the data (i.e. R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.003) or any sub-sequences or correlations with approach or rotation sequences that indicate the possibility of differences due to which end of the pool the swimmer is exiting.</p>
<p>Without reading too much significance into the information present within the SPC charts detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337111428395">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1754337111428395">10</xref>, the characterization of the swimming turn acceleration profiles into approach, rotation, and glide phases (evidenced by features within the profile and verified by study of integrated video information) has allowed differences in turns to be noted quickly, and trends to be highlighted. This kind of analysis is appropriate in swimming, particularly, for example, when monitoring long distance swimmers, to highlight the effect of fatigue on turn performance and whether these effects are seen in any particular phase of the turn. This analysis may also be useful in identifying a level of competence, whereby a smaller distribution of turn timings would be expected from a more competent swimmer than from an amateur, supporting the expectations of the authors that these SPC charts could be used to compare visually, qualitatively, and quantitatively the consistency within and between the performance of different swimmers.</p>

<title>5 Summary</title>
<p>The performance of a single subject case study has been undertaken to identify and quantify the phases of the tumble turn in swimming. A triathlete was asked to perform a 400 m swim, including tumble turns at the end of each length, during a training session taking place in a 25 m pool. A wireless node, which has been developed as part of the current research project, was used to provide acceleration data regarding the swimmer’s turning performance, and a fixed underwater camera, recording at a frame rate of 25 f/s, was used to capture visual information about each turn. Using the visual data it was possible to understand the turning phases in acceleration space. Rotation information, last stroke to wall, and first stroke after the turn timing could be automatically distinguished from the captured acceleration data. Turning information, automatically cropped from the raw data stream within these stroke time limits, enabled a more complete analysis of turning performance than has been previously possible as the approach, rotation, and glide features could be individually identified and quantified. The timing of foot contact with the wall has not yet been identified as a characteristic in the acceleration data, but future work incorporating an integrated underwater force plate/mat is expected to shed light on this feature within the acceleration profile.</p>
<p>SPC charts were used to display the sequence of turning feature throughout the trial, and the representation was found to be useful in highlighting possible events, such as progressively increasing turn times and preferences for approaches to one end of the pool over another. Although the statistical significance of these events within the current data set is limited, the information within the SPC charts provides enhanced training feedback and can be used as evidence to promote detailed discussion of turning strategy and the structure of future focused training sessions between the athlete and the coach.</p>
<p>Turn performance, especially in longer races, can have a significant impact on overall race outcomes. Current analysis in day-to-day training is limited to subjective feedback from video and hand timings of RTT. These technologies and performance monitoring processes do not suit themselves to constant application within training, as they require high levels of input in terms of operator time and expertise. During these specific sessions athletes will typically be asked to perform a small number of turns, i.e. 2–5, maximally. The potential application of automated analysis via a wireless network of accelerometer-based sensor systems would enable the turns of multiple athletes to be monitored in real-time during entire sessions, without impacting on coach or sports scientist time. This would provide more detailed measures of swimmers’ turn performances and consistencies, even in situations when they are not specifically focussing on optimizing their turns. It is anticipated that this solution will add more value for middle and long distance swimmers, where there is a greater requirement to perform consistently quick turns for the duration of 400–1500 m races in order to achieve a podium finish.</p>
<p>Although results presented in this paper illustrate the potential of detailed analysis of turns using features derived from tri-axis acceleration traces, it is important that further work should investigate a larger number of trials, incorporating different athletes undertaking different swimming strokes (i.e. backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke) to assess the consistency of turn profiles and ensure the robustness and generic capabilities of the analysis algorithms.</p>
<p>Future work is also in progress to incorporate integrated concurrent analyses of the other two axes of acceleration (i.e. forward and lateral (<italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes)) that need to be analysed throughout the phases of the turn, that have been identified using the <italic>z</italic>-axis. Acceleration off the wall will also be an important factor in overall turn performance, and it is expected that, though the gravity component is not removed from these data, -axis acceleration data (i.e. forwards as the swimmer is in the horizontal, i.e. prone, position) will give an accurate indication of this parameter. In addition, further work is being undertaken to implement inertial measurement unit (IMU) capabilities into the embedded sensor to enable the determination of best estimates of the swimmers’ velocity and positional information from the raw data in real time. The intention is to provide the coach with more easily interpretable data regarding the swimmers velocity into and out of the turn, and their maintenance of this velocity into stroking, without the need for (expensive in terms of time and effort) vision systems.</p>
