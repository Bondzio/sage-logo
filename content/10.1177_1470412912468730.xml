<p>With his recent retrospective at Tate Modern, Damien Hirst has once again become a topic of hot debate. The impact of the show was bolstered as an artworld and media event through a series of tie-in exhibitions, such as the <italic>Complete Spot Paintings</italic>, which featured internationally across all of Leo Gagosian’s galleries, and the launch of Hirst’s latest Bacon-inspired paintings at the White Cube.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912468730">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Hirst’s deftness in maintaining a presence in the media is nothing new, neither, however, is the overall negative tenor of the critical response. There were, of course, a few (measured) endorsements of Hirst’s work. Notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470412912468730">Marina Warner (2012)</xref> in an article for the <italic>London Review of Books</italic>, who made a lucid and not unsympathetic analysis, remembering the early work of the yBas (young British artists) as a critical insertion into the urban and cultural fabric of London, and discussing both the strengths and weaknesses of Hirst’s work as stemming from a symbolism so complete that it leaves little to experience in the work itself (pp. 16–17). However, the critical knives were generally sharpened with an urgency that they had generally been lacking for some time in the case of Hirst. Jonathan Jones, a long-time champion of the artist, went as far as to equate the ‘arrogance and stupidity’ of the new paintings at the White Cube with the artistic endeavours of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, calling them ‘the kind of kitsch that is foisted on helpless peoples by Neros and Hitlers and such tyrants so beyond normal restraint or criticism they believe they are artists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912468730">Jones, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912468730">Adrian Searle (2012)</xref>, reviewing the Tate show, found Hirst’s <italic>A Thousand Years</italic> (1990) and <italic>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</italic> (1991) still-powerful works, but concluded his review complaining of Hirst’s ‘capitulation as an artist. He could have been so much better. It is an enormous disappointment.’</p>
<p>For those more clearly active on the left, Hirst seems to have offered an even more compelling opportunity for attack. One of the sharpest such critiques was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468730">Hari Kunzru’s (2012)</xref> onslaught in <italic>The Guardian</italic>. Kunzru argues that Hirst will be remembered not for any excellence in his work, but
<disp-quote>
<p>because he has almost single-handedly remade the global art market in his image: that is to say, the image of the artist as celebrity clown … who not only shits on us from on top of his pile of cash, but persuades us to buy that shit and beg for more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kunzru’s attack – like so much criticism of this artist – spreads out from the work into the personal (highlighting Hirst’s relations with his assistants as exploitative), and into a general critique of an artworld overtaken by a speculative market that ends up, at its worst, little more than a Ponzi scheme. Anatomising Hirst’s business model and its ideological effects, Kunzru’s most devastating criticism is that Hirst’s is an oeuvre that in its very visual form celebrates the power of capital’s ‘disembodied ubiquity’ to transcend the ‘trash’ of the human body and the ‘rotting flesh’ of the classes engaged in corporeal work. Hirst’s output appears, then, as an analogue of a postmodern capitalism that fantasizes freeing itself from its ultimate dependence on labour, and hence of being able to finally eliminate its enemy class.</p>
<p>My point here, however, is not so much to agree or disagree with these authors about Hirst’s work itself, but to understand better the nature of the outpouring of vehemence around it. I take this, ultimately, as a sign of a renewed ‘contemporaneity’ of Hirst within the art world.</p>
<p>It seems to me, however, that Hirst’s contemporaneity is of a different kind now to what it was in the early 1990s, when he first crashed onto the art scene along with the other yBas. Hirst and his peers could then be discussed – however problematically – as defining the newest, or at least most novel, of art practices. For my generation, passing through art college in their immediate wake, the yBas cast a long shadow over everything, forming a vision of the present which we had in some way to negotiate, whether responding in rally or revolt. The intervening decades have, of course, thrown up new issues, phenomena and artists around which current students form their now-different attachments and rebellions, with Hirst and his contemporaries becoming an increasingly distant point of orientation.</p>
<p>Hirst’s retrospective, in fact, lies almost precisely a generation after the first furore around the yBas. I find myself wondering to what extent Walter Benjamin’s memorable comment that ‘each generation experiences the fashions of the one immediately preceding it as the most radical antiaphrodisiac imaginable’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470412912468730">2</xref></sup> may now be in play – and even whether the hostility of critics today might as much mark the perspectives opened by this temporal distance as it marks Hirst as someone of pressing current concern. In this regard, there is a difference, as well as an obvious continuity, between contemporary attacks and the kind of critique of 90s British art launched by Julian Stallabrass in the wake of the <italic>Sensation</italic> exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470412912468730">3</xref></sup> The question would thus be, quite why it is that the urgency of such a task has returned, when just a few years ago even Stallabrass, in his preface to the second edition of <italic>High Art Lite</italic>, thought that this had waned, and that the republication of the book was more useful as a document of its time, rather than still having a vital polemical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912468730">Stallabrass, 2006</xref>: xi).</p>
<p>If this is so, then we might need to nuance the question of the contemporary. Hirst has, after all, managed with peculiar dexterity to repeatedly reinvent his ‘currency’ – a term whose monetary double meanings highlight the link today between contemporaneity and the art market. Hirst’s ‘currency’ is something, after all, clearly traded. (With Hirst, this is done more obviously, perhaps, than other artists, but he exemplifies a broader logic.)</p>
<p>In establishing this currency, Hirst has managed to become emblematic of a series of somewhat different (even contradictory) ideological moments. At the end of the 80s, he appeared as the personification, within art, of Thatcherist entrepreneurialism. The mid 90s found him at the heart of a Blairite ‘cool Britannia’ that hymned the brash popular-cultural confidence of a rebranded London. <italic>For the Love of God</italic> (2007) once again redefined his cultural significance within media discourse, as emblematic of the unreal values of finance capital, and the obscene wealth of the global elite of its super-rich, for whose purchase Hirst’s work seemed to be produced. Such an equation was only reinforced by the synchrony (to the day) of his 2008 Sotheby’s mega-auction, <italic>Beautiful Inside My Head Forever</italic>, with the collapse of Lehmann Bros, and the onset of a financial crisis in which we are still enmired some four years later. It is as such a figure, and in the context of the continuing crisis, that Hirst has become a renewed critical target in the left and left-liberal media.</p>
<p>In part through chance, and in part by opportunistic design, then, Hirst seems to have been remarkable in his ability to reinvent himself, with a career that starts to become legible as a synecdoche of the course of Neoliberalism itself. However, Hirst’s many comebacks seem to have the logic of the returns of movie-monsters, who can’t be killed off because, ultimately, they are already (un)dead, rather than alive. Hirst’s ‘nowness’ – a form of cultural capital, if you like – thus has something of the characteristics of Marx’s famous description of capital’s logic in general as vampiric: the power of the accumulation of dead labour rather than something living and breathing in itself.</p>
<p>The current polemic on Hirst, of course, plays a valuable role in setting out an opposition to everything that he seems to stand for at our current political moment – especially inasmuch as this is so often a critique that extends beyond Hirst to interrogate the structures of the art system. However, the very polemic may simply be (to extend the last paragraph’s metaphor) serving up blood for Dracula, reinforcing the artist’s status as ‘controversial’, and thus having a currency to trade on.</p>
<p>I find myself wondering whether such a dilemma might be symptomatic of something broader and deeper in committed art criticism’s temporal relation to avant-garde and modern art. The question of the ‘contemporary’ is inherent to such discourses: they treat their object as co-temporal with their writing, and their mode is to measure that which is against that which should be. They attempt to apply a temporal model of dialectical progress with a utopian teleology which binds the critic and the artist. Situating Hirst – or for that matter much of a current art world subsumed by the logic of Neoliberal capital – within such a critical framework is profoundly problematic. The nature of contemporary art’s ‘currency’, with its link to the market as outlined above, is rather different from the contemporaneity implicit in art criticism’s address to contemporary art. If such criticism assumes to be itself in dialogue with artists in the form of a discussion amongst contemporaries, Hirst is the prime case of an artist who – even if the pageant of controversy aids the economic function of Hirst’s art machine – has never really been in dialogue with criticism, short-cutting its validatory mechanisms through the media’s alternative specie of celebrity and spectacle.</p>
<p>There may be alternative modes of continuing a critical discourse on work such as Hirst’s, though such writing would need a different temporal alignment with its object of study. The Tate show could be taken as a definitive signal that Hirst has in fact now (whatever the appearances of the media) finally slipped out of the present and into a past which, though still recent, is nonetheless one on which we can gain a critically historical perspective. After all, a retrospective such as this marks the conclusion of a distinct shift from the absolutely contemporary spaces of the guerrilla warehouse shows with which Hirst made his name into those of the museum, where, as if figuratively preserved in formaldehyde, they are fixed into the narratives and canons of an art history. Art history has a rather different temporal alignment to its object of study to criticism, and its questions are thus different, too. A critical art history would not deal directly with the task of measuring what is and what should be, but with the question of how we are made by the past, and how our present in its turn fills and remakes the past that makes us. Seen in this regard, a different Hirst may start to emerge from the Tate show.</p>
<p>The Hirst I discover there is a paradoxical figure. He is, after all, distinctly a capitalist artist, rather than a properly vanguard one. As a capitalist artist, in common with the visual cultures of capitalism more generally, his work is profoundly animated by the contradictions that structure capital itself. The value of Hirst is the emergence in his work of the ‘symptom’ of the Neoliberal order he has managed so consistently to court, and to whose logic he has stayed so close. This, for me, explains something of my experience of Hirst, who although as an artist stands for so much that I find disturbing and distasteful, nonetheless at his best has produced powerfully iconic images which preserve the power to haunt a wider culture, a culture that momentarily assented to see its own reflection in his work.</p>
