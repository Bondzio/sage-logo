<abstract>
<p>Brain Bingo is a tutorial activity for helping undergraduate psychology students learn complex physiological terms. In two experiments, the authors tested pretest and posttest knowledge, and in Experiment 2, the authors tested retention after 5 weeks. In Experiment 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 41), the experimental group (Brain Bingo) recalled more terms than the control group (standard tutorial activities). In Experiment 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 107), control and experimental groups did the Brain Bingo activity, but only the experimental group received feedback during the activity. Both groups recalled more terms at posttest and follow-up than at pretest, and the experimental group outperformed the control group at both time points. Brain Bingo, particularly with feedback, is a useful activity for learning physiological terminology.</p>

<body>
<p>Many students find it difficult to learn the large number of terms relating to structures of the nervous system, the brain, and the body in physiological psychology units. Although online flash cards and crossword activities are commonly available for this purpose, students in a physiological psychology class reported they would like to explicitly cover this material in tutorials; without knowing the terminology, they stated that they struggled to understand processes related to the terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628311430639">Unit Satisfaction Survey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that games help students learn; for example, Mathingo helps students learn the rules of calculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430639">Forman &amp; Forman, 2008</xref>). When content is specific, games and simulations are effective learning tools in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430639">Randel, Morris, Wetzel, &amp; Whitehill, 1992</xref>). The terminology used in physiological psychology is a good example of this type of content. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430639">Carney and Levin (1998)</xref> used mnemonics as an aid to learning physiological terminology, linking keywords with meaning to improve student learning of physiological terms and their associated functions. An example they cited is linking medal to medulla and the concept of racing hard to win, with the winner experiencing a pounding heart and rapid breathing. Inference matching and backward recall (recalling a term from a definition) are also effective methods of teaching these terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430639">Carney &amp; Levin, 2008</xref>). We propose an activity for learning terminology that integrates backward recall and a game in the form of Brain Bingo.</p>
<p>The cognitive processes of learning involve different levels of engagement with the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430639">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>). Students start with lower level (surface) learning through memorizing and identifying the material, but for university education, more structural learning must occur to allow students to use that knowledge in an applied manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430639">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628311430639">Holyoak &amp; Koh, 1987</xref>). When only surface learning occurs, it is easy to confuse similar terms. Deeper learning, such as that promoted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430639">Carney and Levin (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430639">2008</xref>) activities, results in improved differentiation between similar concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430639">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>). Encouraging students to describe, comprehend, and relate key terms to other physiological terminology and concepts through Brain Bingo should result in this deeper learning, allowing better retention of the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430639">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>). We examined the effectiveness of Brain Bingo as a tool for learning physiological terminology in this manner and hypothesized that those in the experimental group would perform better at posttest than those in the control group as a result of the Brain Bingo activity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0098628311430639">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>The experiment was a 2 (control, experimental) by 2 (pretest, posttest) mixed factorial design with one between-subjects factor (group) and one within—subjects factor (time of recall). Participants were 41 undergraduate students enrolled in physiological psychology at an Australian university (26 female, 13 male, 2 undisclosed) aged from 19 to 49 years (<italic>M</italic> = 24.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.99). We assigned participants to the experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 27) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 14) condition based on tutorial group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0098628311430639">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<sec id="section5-0098628311430639">
<title>Key terms</title>
<p>The 26 key terms came from the three summary sections of Chapter 14 (“Cognitive Functions”) of the textbook, <italic>Biological Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628311430639">Kalat, 2009a</xref>). They included terms such as <italic>anterior commissure</italic>, <italic>aphasia</italic>, <italic>Broca’s aphasia</italic>, <italic>Broca’s area</italic>, <italic>corpus callosum</italic>, <italic>Wernicke’s aphasia</italic>, and <italic>Wernicke’s area</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0098628311430639">
<title>Brain Bingo sheets</title>
<p>There were four separate bingo sheets. Each sheet consisted of a four-by-four grid showing 16 of the 26 key terms from the chapter. Hence, not all sheets included all terms. We listed key terms in alphabetical order across the page from top left to bottom right of the grid to make it easier for students to find them (see appendix). The grid of key terms took up two thirds of the sheet, leaving the bottom third of the page free. We labeled this section <italic>cheat sheet</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0098628311430639">
<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Participation and pre- and posttests were voluntary. At the start of the tutorial, the tutor read aloud seven free-recall questions based on the definitions of key terms from the chapter (pretest). Examples of questions included “What do we call the ability to use language to produce new signals or represent new ideas?” (expected answer: productivity) and “What condition is evidenced by lower intellectual ability but normal speech fluency and grammar?” (expected answer: Williams’ syndrome). Students wrote their answers on a sheet of paper with a self-generated four-digit code and gave them to the tutor.</p>
<p>Both the experimental and control groups then spent the first hour of the tutorial doing tutorial activities on hemispheric lateralization, handedness, and hemispheric dominance (the Townsend-Merino [as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628311430639">Kalat, 2009b</xref>] activity and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430639">Oldfield, 1971</xref>]). After 1 hour, the control group did the posttest (the same seven questions as the pretest) and then played Brain Bingo. Those in the experimental condition did the Brain Bingo activity first and then the posttest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0098628311430639">
<title>Brain Bingo activity</title>
<p>Participants formed teams of two or three, and tutors gave each student the four different Brain Bingo sheets. Participants selected one sheet for the first round with the understanding that all participants in a single group should select the same sheet for a round. Participants then had 3 minutes to look up definitions of terms they did not know and to record notes in the cheat sheet section of the Brain Bingo sheet. They did this using the textbook glossary or the list of key terms at the end of the chapter. At the end of 3 minutes, the tutor instructed students to stop writing and the round began.</p>
<p>The tutor had a set of laminated flash cards consisting of all key terms for the chapter. Each flash card had a key term on one side and the definition of the term on the other. The tutor shuffled the flash cards and began the game by reading a definition aloud. The tutor told participants that on hearing a definition, they should cross off the corresponding key term on their bingo sheet if it was present. Once they had crossed out four key terms in a single row, column, or diagonal, they called out bingo and won the round.</p>
<p>Tutors read the definitions aloud with a delay of approximately 15 seconds between each definition. After reading a definition, tutors placed the card on the table in front of them. When a team said bingo, the tutor returned to the first definition used in that round, read it aloud, and asked that team to tell the rest of the class which key term they had crossed off. If they had crossed off the wrong key term, the tutor asked the tutorial group whether anyone knew the correct answer. If they did not, the tutor advised them of the correct answer. If the team gave an incorrect answer, the tutor clarified why the answer was incorrect and how the term differed in meaning from the correct term. After the tutor had revisited all definitions and terms covered in that round, another round began. Each tutorial group did three iterations of Brain Bingo. The activity lasted 30 minutes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, the experimental group showed significantly better recall for key terms than did the control group. The experimental group recalled, on average, four additional key terms than those in the control condition. We suggest that this learning may be due to the engagement of both lower and higher level learning strategies. As well as becoming familiar with key terms through repetition, participants in the experimental group were encouraged to understand concepts more thoroughly by discriminating between similar concepts while identifying them. Repetition of definitions and key terms and explanations of why terms did not match similar definitions are likely to have assisted in this deeper understanding.</p>
<p>However, methodological limitations in Experiment 1 prevent firm conclusions from being drawn. First, unlike the experimental group, the control group had no opportunity to familiarize themselves with the key terms during the tutorial. This is evident from the lack of improvement between pre- and posttest for this group. The control group participated in tutorial activities that focused on concepts rather than terminology (hemispheric lateralization and handedness) and did not rehearse the terms being tested. This is likely to have contributed to the difference between control and experimental group posttest performance. Second, we tested only immediate recall. The posttest occurred immediately after the Brain Bingo activity, with the result that any improvement of the experimental group may have been due to a recency effect. For this activity to contribute to the teaching and learning literature, we needed evidence that deeper learning does occur and is maintained over time. We addressed these issues in Experiment 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0098628311430639">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, we developed a modified form of Brain Bingo for the control group to address the methodological problems of Experiment 1. Feedback is beneficial because it allows students to focus on errors in interpretation and improve their own error identification ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430639">Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007</xref>). In Experiment 2, only the experimental group received feedback to assist learning. The only difference between the control and experimental conditions in Experiment 2 was that the experimental group received feedback on their answers and the control group did not. The control Brain Bingo activity exposed students to the terminology without the benefit of feedback. To address the issue of whether improvement was due to a recency effect, we gave participants a follow-up test (identical to the pre- and posttests) 5 weeks after the Brain Bingo activity.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that those in the experimental group would have higher posttest scores than those in the control group due to a better understanding of the material. Furthermore, we predicted this activity would lead to enhanced learning and that the experimental group would perform better on the delayed follow-up test than would the control group.</p>

<p>The experiment was a 2 (control, experimental) by 3 (pretest, posttest, follow-up) mixed factorial design with one between-subjects factor (group) and one within-subjects factor (time of recall).

Of the original 155 participants, 107 participated in the follow-up test 5 weeks later (45 in the experimental group and 64 in the control group). There were 22 male and 85 female participants aged between16 and 53 years (<italic>M</italic> = 21.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.28).

<title>Brain Bingo sheets</title>
<p>As in Experiment 1, we created four separate bingo sheets consisting of a four-by-four grid with 16 of the 41 key terms on each sheet. For the experimental group, these sheets also included the cheat sheet section. The control group’s bingo sheets did not have this section included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0098628311430639">
<title>Brain Bingo activity</title>
<p>Psychology 101 tutors ran the experiment. We provided each tutor with detailed written instructions to ensure consistency across all 18 tutorial groups. We gave tutors running more than one tutorial the same condition for all their tutorials. Before beginning the experiment, tutors briefed students about the purpose of the study and advised that their participation was voluntary.</p>
<p>At the start of the activity, the tutor read aloud 15 free-recall questions in a similar manner to Experiment 1. Examples of questions included “What are the branched fibers of neurons that receive incoming signals?” (expected answer: dendrites) and “What part of the brain is responsible for controlling emotion, aggression, and the formation of emotional memory?” (expected answer: amygdala). Students wrote their answers on a sheet of paper with a self-generated five-digit code and gave the sheets to the tutors.</p>
<p>As in Experiment 1, students formed teams of two or three. The experimental procedure was identical to Experiment 1. For the control group, the tutor did not check the winning team’s answers, nor did the tutor give feedback on answers. In all other respects, the control group’s activity was identical to the experimental group’s activity.</p>
<p>Each tutorial did three iterations of Brain Bingo, and the activity lasted approximately 30 minutes. At the end of the Brain Bingo activity, the tutor read aloud the same 15 free-recall questions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, the results supported the first hypothesis. The experimental group outperformed the control group at posttest. The findings also supported the second hypothesis that the experimental group would outperform the control group at follow-up. Although both groups experienced a significant drop in number of terms recalled at follow-up, each group still had significantly better performance at follow-up than at pretest.</p>
<p>We suggest these outcomes support the proposition that the experimental group engaged in deeper learning due to feedback. Despite exposing both groups to the terminology for the same period of time, the experimental group outperformed the control group on subsequent testing. However, the finding that the control group’s performance in Experiment 2 did not revert to pretest levels was surprising and suggests Brain Bingo, through exposure to the terminology, helps students improve their acquisition of key terms even when feedback is absent.</p>

</sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="section29-0098628311430639">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>It appears that the exposure to terminology through the Brain Bingo activity improves retention. In addition, feedback during the activity enhances learning with improved retention of that information in comparison to a group without feedback. This is consistent with the belief that feedback may be an important contributor to structural learning when it aids in distinguishing correct from incorrect answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430639">Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Experiment 2 results indicate that the control group activities (standard tutorial activities) used in Experiment 1 were not suitable as comparison tasks for evaluating Brain Bingo. As was seen in Experiment 2, engaging with the terminology for a period of 30 minutes, even without feedback that assists error detection, improves retention of that knowledge over time. This may be due in part to the testing effect. Testing improves long-term retention of information regardless of the test outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430639">Butler &amp; Roediger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628311430639">Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are three limitations for consideration. First, finding comparable activities to use as a control task is challenging, with the result that the control task in Experiment 2 was very similar to Brain Bingo. We suggest there is merit in investigating Brain Bingo’s efficacy using other validated activities as control tasks, such as mnemonics, keywords, and inference matching (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430639">Carney &amp; Levin, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430639">2008</xref>). This is particularly important when considering the second major limitation of the study—the time taken to prepare the materials. We spent a considerable amount of time preparing laminated cards and Brain Bingo sheets. Without evidence comparing Brain Bingo to another established form of learning, some educators may consider this time allocation not justified. However, if Brain Bingo compares well to established activities, time spent preparing these materials is a sound investment as they are easily reused. Third, this was a quasi-experimental design with students allocated to group by tutorial. Future research could address this through random allocation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Brain Bingo offers an engaging and productive way for students to learn physiological terminology. In particular, the feedback component leads to better long-term retention of the information. Verbal feedback from students indicated they enjoyed the activity and they found building on team members’ knowledge insightful and helpful. However, research is needed to investigate the role of this activity in conjunction with other learning activities in tutorials. This activity aims only to teach terminology and not to address more complex concepts. It would also be valuable to determine if the style of activity and feedback component provide similar learning outcomes in other fields.</p>
