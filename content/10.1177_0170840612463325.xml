<abstract>
<p>This study highlights significant discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and the actual operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. Our findings are based upon an empirical investigation undertaken in the context of the European Emissions Trading Scheme between January 2009 and May 2010. CO<sub>2</sub> markets are examined from a practice-based perspective in which actors are engaged in exchange, representational and normalizing practices. Discrepancies between the actual and intended CO<sub>2</sub> market practices are explained using the concepts of framing, overflowing and regulatory capture. We argue that the design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme has been influenced in such a way that it does not actually challenge market participants to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In this way, the study challenges the near universal reliance upon CO<sub>2</sub> markets as the primary policy mechanism for mitigating climate change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Climate change mitigation represents a significant challenge for society, one in which businesses will have to play a role. Over the past 20 years the scientific, political and business communities have widely accepted the technical potential to manage CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to a sustainable level. Systematic efforts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have recently focused upon designing and operating CO<sub>2</sub> markets. The objective of these CO<sub>2</sub> markets is to monetize businesses’ CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, thereby providing a financial incentive to reduce them. In terms of scale, CO<sub>2</sub> markets have proven to be significant, trading an estimated $144 billion in 2009, which represented a volume of CO<sub>2</sub> that was approximately equivalent to 25% of 2009’s global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612463325">Kossoy &amp; Ambrosi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840612463325">Olivier &amp; Peters, 2010</xref>; Rekacewicz &amp; Bournay, 2005).</p>
<p>One of the challenges facing researchers interested in CO<sub>2</sub> markets is to adopt a suitable framework for the definition of what we call the ‘market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612463325">Araujo, Kjellberg &amp; Spencer, 2008</xref>). Previous research suggests that markets emerge as collective initiatives that mobilize economic, cultural and socio-political resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612463325">Fligstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612463325">MacKenzie &amp; Millo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612463325">Quinn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0170840612463325">Weber, Heinze &amp; DeSoucey, 2008</xref>). Research emphasizes that markets are institutionalized, legitimized and adapted to particular circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612463325">Fligstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463325">Healy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612463325">MacKenzie, Muniesa &amp; Siu, 2007</xref>); and highlights the challenges faced by regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612463325">Peltzman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612463325">Stigler, 1971</xref>). Specifically, CO<sub>2</sub> markets are often presented as institutionalized exchanges in ‘permits to emit greenhouse gases’ or in ‘credits earned’ by not emitting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840612463325">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>). However, this definition talks more to the design or purpose of CO<sub>2</sub> markets and neglects questions which relate to the actual operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets and efforts to explain recent failures of CO<sub>2</sub> markets to influence organizations’ operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463325">Araujo, Finch &amp; Kjellberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463325">Callon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612463325">Reverdy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The present research aims to unpack CO<sub>2</sub> market practices and explain the discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and its actual operation. In this way, the aim is to investigate the extent to which CO<sub>2</sub> markets have influenced businesses’ actual behaviour. Considering CO<sub>2</sub> markets as networks of interacting actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612463325">Beckert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612463325">Easton &amp; Araujo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612463325">Lazonick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612463325">Mouzas &amp; Ford, 2009</xref>), the study adopts a practice perspective in which interconnected actors are engaged in exchange, representational and normalizing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612463325">Hagberg &amp; Kjellberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg &amp; Helgesson, 2007</xref>). This practice perspective advocates descriptions of the real-life operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. By adopting this perspective we have attempted to answer calls for more examinations of the actual operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463325">Callon, 2009</xref>) and to respond to the need to provide in-depth views of ‘<italic>actions and consequences’</italic> instead of focusing upon ‘<italic>aims and intentions</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612463325">Hopwood, 2009</xref>,p. 439). The study examines a manufacturer’s response to Phase II of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. We are particularly interested in learning more about the constituents who are involved in a market-based response to climate change, the specific practices observed in the operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets and how they link with each other, and finally in explaining the discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> markets as designed by regulators and the practices observed during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation. We develop explanations of the observed discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation based upon an analysis of the different <italic>frames</italic> adopted by the regulator and market participants. We also apply the concept of <italic>overflows</italic> to discuss how technical, temporal and uncertainty-based aspects of CO<sub>2</sub> markets have been left out of the regulator’s CO<sub>2</sub> market frame. Finally, we use the concept of <italic>regulatory capture</italic> to discuss the existence of over-allocations of CO<sub>2</sub> permits and low CO<sub>2</sub> prices.</p>
<p>Our findings are relevant for policy-makers who aim to improve the efficacy of market-based efforts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and scholars who aim to develop a practice perspective of markets that explains how these real-life practices interact to produce the outcomes that we observed. In the following sections, we start by examining previous research on market-based responses to climate change and elaborate a conceptual framework for the study of CO<sub>2</sub> markets; we detail our research methods, discussing our data collection and data analysis; and then report our findings in a case study. Finally, we analyse our findings using the proposed conceptual framework, discuss theoretical and policy implications and suggest steps for further research.</p>

<title>Co<sub>2</sub> Market Design: Practices and Context</title>
<p>Within business and organization studies, the term ‘market’ is often used quite loosely; challenging this raises ontological questions about the nature of what we call the ‘market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612463325">Araujo et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore essential to clarify what we mean by the term ‘market’ before embarking upon an examination of CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation. A starting point in this ontological examination of markets is to consider markets as ‘institutional arrangements’ which facilitate the exchange of goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840612463325">North, 1990</xref>). Such a perspective, however, addresses more the purpose of a market, as opposed to giving a description of the practices that produce markets. Are markets a static arrangement, or rather a matter of constant maintenance through ongoing practices? If markets are ‘cultural phenomena’ or ‘moral projects in their own right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612463325">Fourcade &amp; Healy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612463325">Healy, 2004</xref>) that mobilize economic and socio-political resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612463325">Fligstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612463325">Quinn, 2008</xref>), then it should be possible to study the mechanisms by which CO<sub>2</sub> markets are realized in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612463325">Bebbington &amp; Larrinaga-Gonzalez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612463325">Braun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612463325">Kolk, Levy &amp; Pinkse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840612463325">Lohmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840612463325">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To study CO<sub>2</sub> markets in their real-life context, a more fine-grained theoretical perspective is required. To this end, we have employed a practice perspective which examines the substance of markets as a mix of market representations, attempts to regulate markets and efforts to perform exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612463325">Callon, Millo &amp; Muniesa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612463325">MacKenzie, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612463325">2007</xref>). This practice perspective is the basis of Kjellberg and Helgesson’s proposed typology of three categories of practices that constitute markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612463325">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">2007</xref>); these are (a) exchange, (b) representational and (c) normalizing practices, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612463325">Figure 1</xref>. Exchange practices are give-and-take processes among interdependent actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612463325">Biggart &amp; Delbridge, 2004</xref>) that involve ‘agreement [concerning] the offer of any sort of present, continuing, or future utility in exchange for utilities of any sort offered in return<italic>’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0170840612463325">Weber, 1978</xref>, pp. 72–73). Understanding exchange practices requires a fundamental insight into the process by which interconnected actors seek to create joint gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612463325">Biggart &amp; Delbridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840612463325">McGinn &amp; Keros, 2002</xref>). Representational practices are those which aim to depict how markets work. It is through ‘representation’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612463325">Cooper (1992</xref>, p. 257) succinctly puts it that ‘the affairs of the world are made pliable, wieldable and therefore amenable to human use’. Finally, normalizing practices are those which aim to introduce normative guidelines for how a market should work. The conceptual framework used for the analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> markets is adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg and Helgesson (2007</xref>, p. 151) and is presented below.</p>

<p>This model identifies a number of ‘translations’ through which the three types of market practice interact. Translations are the ways in which the outcomes of one set of practices, e.g. normalizing practices, may come to influence the others, such as ongoing exchange or representational practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg &amp; Helgesson, 2007</xref>). The importance of these translations is that they provide a framework which enables researchers to capture the dynamics of how different types of market practice influence each other. Each of the market practices and their related translations are now discussed in turn.</p>
<p>Exchange practices influence representational and normalizing practices through translations of ‘interests’ and ‘measurements’. Interests influence normalizing practices; examples relevant to the field of climate change are the maximization of shareholder value and the protection of established power bases, such as the supply of fossil fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612463325">Bazerman &amp; Hoffman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Egan, 2003</xref>). The interests of CO<sub>2</sub> market designers are typically to incentivize CO<sub>2</sub> reductions at the least cost to industry. Measurements are quantified valuations of exchange which feed back into representational practices and inform how actors see the market. Designers of CO<sub>2</sub> markets measure CO<sub>2</sub> markets in terms of the absolute costs of CO<sub>2</sub> which are introduced by the market.</p>
<p>Representational practices influence exchange and normalizing practices through translations of ‘results’ and ‘descriptions’. Results are outcomes that influence how participants view their exchanges. For example, designers of the European Emissions Trading Scheme saw the results of the market as being to introduce a price of CO<sub>2</sub>, which at the time of this study was around £15 per tonne CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0170840612463325">Veal &amp; Mouzas, 2010</xref>). Descriptions are articulations that drive normalizing practices by informing how designers view CO<sub>2</sub> markets. For example, regulators describe CO<sub>2</sub> markets as market-based mechanisms which aim to incentivize CO<sub>2</sub> reductions at the least cost across industry and to make CO<sub>2</sub> management a strategic concern for businesses.</p>
<p>Normalizing practices influence exchange and representational practices through translations of ‘rules and tools’ and ‘measures and methods of measurement’. Rules and tools influence exchange practices by governing and performing exchanges. For example, the European Union’s rules dictate that taxes are regulated by ‘unanimity’, while environmental issues are regulated by ‘qualified majority voting’. These rules significantly influenced the selection of a market-based response to climate change that could be treated as an environmental measure, thus avoiding the need for unanimous support, as would have been required for a tax on CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612463325">MacKenzie, 2007</xref>). Research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke (2007)</xref> shows that weak policy frameworks, uncertainty about governments’ actions and uncertainty about the marketplace are hampering efforts to incentivize businesses to manage their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Measures and methods of measurement influence representational practices. For example, regulators of CO<sub>2</sub> markets focus upon measures of the absolute cost of CO<sub>2</sub> in £/tonne, as set by the market; while in comparison, businesses tend to depict markets based on fiduciary obligations to safeguard long-term business interests and in reliance on measures of profitability, risk management and ethical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612463325">Banerjee, Iyer &amp; Kashyap, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptual framework of market practices allows us to integrate the concepts of framing and overflowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612463325">Callon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612463325">Goffman, 1971</xref>) in order to examine what is excluded or omitted from market practices. Framing is a process whereby actors define the boundary within which ‘interactions take place more or less independently of their surrounding context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612463325">Callon, 1998</xref>, p. 4). The ambition of regulators is that CO<sub>2</sub> markets should provide frames that enable businesses to internalize the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and therefore reduce them. Overflows are connections to the outside world which the frame does not take into account, but which the frame is also unable to abolish or prevent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612463325">Araujo &amp; Kjellberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612463325">Araujo, 2007</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> markets have been designed by regulators to combat one overflow that has been neglected by traditional market economics, namely, externalities which relate to the costs imposed upon others due to businesses’ CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612463325">Coase, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612463325">Cornes &amp; Sandler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612463325">Hardin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612463325">Olson, 1965</xref>). However, there may be other overflows in relation to the design of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. As such, we now discuss technological considerations, time constraints and uncertainty as potential CO<sub>2</sub> market overflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840612463325">Molisa &amp; Wittneben, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612463325">Shi, Peng, Liu &amp; Zhong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840612463325">Sutherland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0170840612463325">Veal &amp; Mouzas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612463325">Veal &amp; Mouzas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840612463325">Wittneben, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Technological overflows in relation to CO<sub>2</sub> markets are immutable physical laws and the limits of today’s knowledge and capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463325">Jaffe, Newell &amp; Stavins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>). Technological overflows are observed in the renewables industry which looks to a market for CO<sub>2</sub> to help fund its development. However, no matter what price CO<sub>2</sub> reaches, the fundamental challenge in the renewable industry is the need for technological developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612463325">Shi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840612463325">Tsoutsos &amp; Stamboulis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840612463325">Vermeulen, Buch &amp; Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840612463325">Walawalkar, Apt &amp; Mancini, 2007</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> markets will help to provide the business case for further research, but they will not be able to force innovations, or circumvent the laws of thermodynamics. Acknowledging this overflow encourages the examination of how regulation can better support technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612463325">Jaffe et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, this overflow points to the need to avoid a fixation upon technological solutions and to give sufficient weight to efforts that seek CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions through changes in behaviour.</p>
<p>Temporal overflows in relation to CO<sub>2</sub> markets are ‘windows of opportunity’ and ‘lock-ins’. Windows of opportunity exist in many markets which seek to solve problems or meet needs within a fixed time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840612463325">Vaughan, Lenton &amp; Shepherd, 2009</xref>). In the case of CO<sub>2</sub> markets, atmospheric concentration levels are effectively cumulative, meaning that emissions must be curbed before safe thresholds are breached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612463325">Moser, 2010</xref>). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that business-as-usual emissions pathways will result in atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> reaching 540 to 970 parts per million by 2100, up from about 280 (ppm) in the pre-industrial era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612463325">IPCC, 2001</xref>). Taken together, these two considerations suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> markets face a window of opportunity of around 20 to 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840612463325">Stern, 2006</xref>). The second temporal aspect relates to decisions which cause lock-ins that result in extended and irreversible impacts. For example, CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive coal-fired power stations have a 40-year life span, so there is a 40-year lock-in for decisions taken today to invest in new coal-fired power stations. As such, CO<sub>2</sub> market designers must acknowledge temporal overflows relating to the need to influence large-scale capital investments which involve temporal lock-ins that are comparable to the window of opportunity for successful climate change mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612463325">Meinshausen &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Uncertainty is an important aspect of markets, since it introduces ambiguity regarding the best or most expedient way to cope with the problems that the market is designed to tackle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612463325">Ford &amp; Mouzas, 2010</xref>). Many markets, including CO<sub>2</sub> markets, tackle uncertainty through the use of auctions. Auctions are particularly useful in situations where the conventional ways of establishing price and ownership are inadequate. For example, in CO<sub>2</sub> markets, auctions are meant to compensate for the regulator’s incomplete knowledge, such as the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities available to each participant, or each participant’s level of motivation to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612463325">Hepburn, 2010</xref>). In such settings, it is argued that ‘auctions serve as rites of passage for objects shrouded in ambiguity and uncertainty, providing a means for establishing the value and allocation of objects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840612463325">Smith, 1989</xref>). Previous research has attempted to describe the construct of uncertainty and elaborate on its application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612463325">Downey, Hellriegel &amp; Slogum, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612463325">Duncan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840612463325">Milliken, 1987</xref>). It appears, however, that uncertainty is an amorphous topology for which market participants cannot assign any probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612463325">Knight, 1921</xref>). Emphasis on the open-ended and emergent nature of markets highlights the challenges faced by CO<sub>2</sub> markets. One example of uncertainty in CO<sub>2</sub> markets is due to the CO<sub>2</sub> permit allocation process. Allocations are set in advance and the scarcity of permits helps to uphold their price. However, the level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during any one period is linked to the state of the economy and the corresponding activity of industry. During economic downturns, which are inherently unpredictable, the price of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will fall due to the higher levels of permit availability resulting from the reduced levels of industrial activity. These levels of uncertainty make it difficult for market participants to price CO<sub>2</sub> into their investment appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463325">Hoffmann, Trautmann &amp; Hamprecht, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612463325">Veal &amp; Mouzas, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Up to this point, the discussion of previous research has taken for granted the implicit assumption made by much research on CO<sub>2</sub> markets, that regulators and market participants act independently of each other. We now examine literature which challenges this assumption and acknowledges the importance of political behaviour during the development of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. The following section discusses how theories of economic regulation might help to explain discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation. Theories of economic regulation are based on the premise that it is not enough to look at the ‘public interest’ in order to understand how regulation is developed or enacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612463325">Stigler, 1971</xref>). Instead, it may be beneficial to consider political activity as a dimension of companies’ competitive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840612463325">Shaffer, 1995</xref>) and give an examination of the regulation of markets which looks beyond ‘normative wishings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612463325">Kalt &amp; Zupan, 1984</xref>). The literature on the political economy of regulation acknowledges the structural power of businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840612463325">McCubbins, Noll &amp; Weingast, 1989</xref>) and highlights that regulation tends to be demand-driven, since lobbying organizations often use regulation as an instrument to create barriers to entry and to protect the interests of market incumbents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612463325">Keohane, Haas &amp; Levy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840612463325">Maloney &amp; Brady, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612463325">Nelson &amp; Donihue, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840612463325">Revesz &amp; Stavins, 2004</xref>). The concept of ‘regulatory capture’ suggests that regulation is designed in response to the demands of interest groups, such as trade associations or industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612463325">Peltzman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612463325">Stigler, 1971</xref>). The concept of regulatory capture appears to be useful in making sense of the observed over-allocations of CO<sub>2</sub> permits and CO<sub>2</sub> prices in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Free allocations of CO<sub>2</sub> permits result in little discomfort to firms, the majority of which were found to be able to pass on CO<sub>2</sub> costs to their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840612463325">Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward &amp; Grubb, 2006</xref>). Existing research on the allocation process within the European Emissions Trading Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612463325">2011</xref>) demonstrates that this process is politically driven; rather than optimized on an economic or environmental basis and that ‘in spite of the [regulator’s] declarations and intentions… free assignment of permits will remain the dominant allocation criterion for the ETS manufacturing sectors even during the third ETS trading period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>, p. 2430). Clò’s findings are in agreement with suggestions that the European Emissions Trading Scheme has succumbed to capture and local political agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463325">Helm, 2010</xref>). These findings are aligned with other research which cites uncertainty regarding the longevity or enforcement of CO<sub>2</sub> market designs as one of their major challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463325">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Kolk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612463325">Shi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840612463325">Sutherland, 1991</xref>), and indicates the need for governments to preserve a role for target- and policy-setting by a body that is politically independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463325">Helm, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>Investigating CO<sub>2</sub> market operation, as a contemporary phenomenon in its real-life context, can most suitably be achieved through the case study research method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612463325">George &amp; Bennett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612463325">Halinen &amp; Törnroos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612463325">Perry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>). Our choice of the case study research method was guided by the desire to directly examine the target of new CO<sub>2</sub> markets. We examined ‘Manufacturer Alpha’ and their extended climate change network because the energy characteristics of Manufacturer Alpha’s production process make them representative of the energy-intense organizations targeted by new markets for CO<sub>2</sub>. In order to develop rich case study data relating to actual CO<sub>2</sub> market practices, we asked the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0170840612463325" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Who is involved in a market-based response to climate change?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the actual practices in CO<sub>2</sub> markets; how do they link with each other; and what discrepancies can we observe?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can we explain discrepancies between actual market practices observed and those designed by regulators?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research question 1 ensures that a complete view of the constituents involved in CO<sub>2</sub> market operation is developed. Research question 2 attempts to draw out an in-depth view of the three types of market practices proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg and Helgesson (2007)</xref>. Research question 2 also considers the influence of the three types of market practice upon each other, by examining the translations which link them. Research question 3 aims to explain any discrepancies between the actual practices observed during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation and those intended by regulators who designed the market. These questions are designed to support the development of rich and informative case studies that provide insights into how CO<sub>2</sub> markets are actually operating. The next section discusses how data were collected during the development of the case studies.</p>
<sec id="section4-0170840612463325">
<title>Data collection process</title>
<p>Data collection was based on an empirical investigation conducted between January 2009 and May 2010 in the context of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Specifically, data were collected during participant observation at Manufacturer Alpha over a period of 17 months, with primary access to twenty decision-makers within the company and its extended network. During the research, participant observation and access to sources of evidence such as reports, e-mails or archival records was possible at all times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840612463325">Neyland, 2008</xref>). The work was conducted with oversight and collaboration from the company director and regional operational manager. In this way, we adopted an ‘engaged scholarship’ method of research in which the researchers involved other stakeholders and leveraged their different perspectives to learn about the problem domain of market-based responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840612463325">van de Ven, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840612463325">van de Ven &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). At the site, we had direct access to and collaboration with the plant manager, plant engineer, plant accountant and plant compliance manager. The relationship involved mutual respect and dialogue to identify, collect and reflect upon relevant evidence. Case material typically included representative policy responses, strategy documents, project documentation, interactions with industry associations and interactions with regulators. E-mails, proposals, strategy documents, audit reports and trading statements all informed the development of the case studies, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612463325">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Certain regulatory communications were sent out as letters, such as details regarding European Emissions Trading Scheme audits. A total of 15 such letters were drawn upon during the development of the case studies; 15 proposals by CO<sub>2</sub> market service providers and 12 strategy documents were also accessed through the participant observation role. Furthermore, 10 industry or government training events were attended and 3 e-mail lists provided 140 e-mail updates during the data collection process. Observations and data sources were logged daily in a research diary and a library of case documents was created to capture relevant material. Archival records were of less importance to the case studies, because of the contemporary nature of the research subject. The only CO<sub>2</sub> market that had any significant trading history at the start of the research was the European Emissions Trading Scheme. For this CO<sub>2</sub> market, access was granted to archival records of the case participants, giving historical data on compliance and trading back to the start of Phase I of the European Emissions Trading Scheme in January 2005.</p>

<sec id="section5-0170840612463325">
<title>Data analysis process</title>
<p>The analysis of the evidence gained from CO<sub>2</sub> markets involved a process of confrontation between empirical observations and theoretical concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612463325">Ragin &amp; Becker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>). More specifically, our data analysis involved ‘examining, categorizing, tabulating, testing, or otherwise recombining evidence to draw empirically based conclusions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>, p. 126). The use of a conceptual framework, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840612463325">Figure 1</xref>, enabled us to adopt a market practice perspective in order to link theoretical concepts and empirical observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840612463325">McKinney, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612463325">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612463325">Ragin &amp; Becker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>). In this way, the conceptual framework allowed us to structure and build explanations consistent with what Elman would call an ‘explanatory typology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612463325">Elman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>). Explanatory typologies are ‘multidimensional conceptual classifications based on explicitly stated theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612463325">Elman, 2009</xref>, p. 121). Specifically, the framework enabled us to locate empirical evidence within the conceptual framework’s ‘market practices’ and ‘translations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg &amp; Helgesson, 2007</xref>). The concepts of ‘framing’ and ‘overflowing’ facilitated the examination of relevant contextual factors within a market practice framework of CO<sub>2</sub> markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612463325">Araujo &amp; Kjellberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463325">Callon, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Early stage data analysis involved the interplay between observations logged in the research diary and the conceptual framework, allowing iterative changes to the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840612463325">Yin, 2003</xref>). To supplement the research diary, a case study database was employed that enabled the handling of multiple sources of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612463325">Bennett &amp; Elman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840612463325">Numagami, 1998</xref>). The case study database contained empirical evidence from the six sources listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612463325">Table 1</xref> and was kept distinct from the case reports. The case database was divided on the basis of the data’s fit with the conceptual framework. The conceptual framework of market practices was then used to re-present and summarize the empirical material from the research diary, case database and case reports, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612463325">Table 5</xref>. In this way, the conceptual framework facilitated the triangulation of different sources of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612463325">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Moreover, data analysis was an iterative process that was influenced by peer review. Early versions of the data analysis were presented as part of three conference papers and one invited lecture to the Institute for Sustainable Energy and Environment at the University of Bath. During the review process in <italic>Organization Studies</italic>, the reviewers drew our attention to concepts of framing, overflowing and capture that helped us refine and explain our findings. Employing the case study research method, we sought generalization of our findings through the causal explanations which they provided, rather than through statistical quantification. In other words, we sought not only to quantify events in CO<sub>2</sub> markets, but also to explain them. In our data analysis, our generality is not ascribed to the observed regularities in events. Instead, our generality is ascribed to the operation of mechanisms as chains of cause and effect, such as market practices and translations, which produced the observed events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg &amp; Helgesson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840612463325">Tsoukas, 1989</xref>). Thus, we generalize by applying analytical rather than statistical logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612463325">Easton, 2010</xref>). This is in line with our efforts to move beyond an econometric analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> markets, in order to describe and explain the mechanisms underpinning discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612463325">Easton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840612463325">Tsoukas, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Market Operation: Evidence from the Carbon Market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme</title>
<p>This case study examines the response of ‘Manufacturer Alpha’ to Phase II of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. The European Emissions Trading Scheme is a market for CO<sub>2</sub> which covers industrial facilities within all European member states. The case study describes the market as designed by regulators and as enacted by Manufacturer Alpha and the network of supporting organizations that were also involved in calculating, verifying and attempting to reduce Manufacturer Alpha’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Manufacturer Alpha is based in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the case also describes national initiatives that target CO<sub>2</sub> reductions, namely the results of an audit from the UK’s Carbon Trust and the interaction with the UK Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements. The case explores how Manufacturer Alpha’s capital appraisal process and operational key performance indicators affected their response to the European Emissions Trading Scheme and the national CO<sub>2</sub> reduction initiatives. The next section introduces Manufacturer Alpha and explains why they are representative of organizations targeted by the European Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
<sec id="section7-0170840612463325">
<title>Manufacturer Alpha as a CO<sub>2</sub> market participant</title>
<p>Manufacturer Alpha specializes in the production of dairy nutrition goods. The energy characteristics of their production process make them representative of an energy-intense manufacturer responding to new markets for CO<sub>2</sub>. Their manufacturing process relies heavily upon pumping to move the product around the site. The complex process means that raw material entering the site typically takes 3 to 4 days of continuous processing to convert to finished product. Large pumps are required at all stages of the process to keep the product moving. Heating and cooling requirements also represent large draws on energy. This is because the product requires pasteurization (heating) and preservation (cooling) at a number of stages. At the end of the process, steam drives large evaporators, which convert the treated liquid into a powder. Another reason that energy use is so intense is that the production process is continuous. The site engineer explained that
<disp-quote>
<p>all stages of production feed into each other and hence all parts of the site have to run simultaneously. Extra storage could isolate production stages to allow independent operation, but as the product is perishable, this would require extra energy for refrigeration.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In combination, these factors mean that energy costs represent around 50% of Manufacturer Alpha’s controllable overhead costs, or 20–25% of the direct costs at site.</p>
<p>Manufacturer Alpha’s participation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme involves interactions with the organizations which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0170840612463325">Figure 2</xref> and discussed below.</p>

These responsibilities include the allocation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission allowances to all UK participants in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Each year Manufacturer Alpha is required to calculate and report their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and reconcile their surplus or shortfall against the number of allowances granted from the Environment Agency. If Manufacturer Alpha emits less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than their allowance, then they are able to sell the surplus into the CO<sub>2</sub> market, or to retain the surplus for future years. If Manufacturer Alpha exceeds their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions allowance, then they are required to purchase CO<sub>2</sub> allowances equivalent to the shortfall. In this way, the CO<sub>2</sub> market is designed by regulators to allow the cheapest CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions to be made first, by giving a market mechanism to redistribute CO<sub>2</sub> reductions among companies participating in the market. Manufacturer Alpha received support from a ‘carbon consultant’ in calculating and submitting their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data as per the Environment Agency’s guidelines. A mandatory step for compliance with the European Emissions Trading Scheme is to have the reported annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figures verified by an independent third party, this role was filled by ‘independent verifier 2’.</p>
<p>A number of organizations influenced Manufacturer Alpha’s participation in the European Emissions Trading scheme, but were not directly involved in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading. The Carbon Trust is tasked by the UK government to facilitate the de-carbonization of the UK’s industry. The Carbon Trust provided Manufacturer Alpha with funding to hire an accredited ‘technical consultant’ to complete a review of Manufacturer Alpha’s CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities, the results of which are described in the next section. Manufacturer Alpha’s participation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme was also influenced by their participation in the UK’s Climate Change Agreements. The Climate Change Levy is a tax on the industrial use of energy. Organizations which undertake voluntary efforts to implement best practices in energy management can apply to be part of a Climate Change Agreement which gives them access to a discount on the Climate Change Levy in return for their efforts in energy management. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0170840612463325">Figure 2</xref> shows that Manufacturer Alpha participated in a Climate Change Agreement through their trade association and had their annual return to the Department of Energy and Climate Change verified by ‘Independent verifier 1’. The case now describes the results of the technical consultant’s audit of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities available to Manufacturer Alpha.</p>

<title>An audit of Manufacturer Alpha’s CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities</title>
<p>The Carbon Trust is tasked with de-carbonizing the UK’s industry and runs a programne to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing sites. This affects CO<sub>2</sub> markets, since CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions achieved by efficiency projects may be sold on the CO<sub>2</sub> market. The Carbon Trust manages an accreditation programme for energy and CO<sub>2</sub> consultants and keeps a number of technical consultants on its books to perform energy efficiency audits at sites. In July 2008, one of the Carbon Trust’s accredited consultants visited Manufacturer Alpha and agreed the scope of the project as to ‘identify between 7 and 10 opportunities, which typically have a payback of three years or less and would provide a noticeable reduction in both energy use and carbon emissions’. Prior to the visit, the Carbon Trust sent a checklist, asking the site to prepare the following material: the last 12–24 months of energy meter readings and invoices; copies of any company energy policies; details of any existing energy reduction work; site plans and a list of equipment on site. During the visit, the technical consultant worked with the site engineer and identified nine energy efficiency opportunities which fitted into the categories summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612463325">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Collectively, it was estimated that these measures could deliver a 5% reduction in energy use. The average payback of the projects identified was around 0.5 years, with the maximum payback being 1.2 years. In the recommendations for energy management practices, the company was scored between 0 and 4 in the areas of energy policy, organizing, training, performance measurement, communication and investment. A score of 0 meant that no policy was in place, running up to a score of 4, which would acknowledge examples of best practice. Manufacturer Alpha achieved an average score of 2.4, with training and communication highlighted as areas to work on. Manufacturer Alpha’s energy policy is currently subsumed within the site’s wider ISO 14001 environmental procedures. These manage environmental impacts which include, but are not limited to, energy use. It was recommended that a specific energy policy be drawn up and the appendix of the report gave an example energy policy to use as a starting point. With regard to the energy efficiency projects proposed, each was detailed in a standard table giving projected savings in terms of cost, CO<sub>2</sub> and energy savings; the project payback; project details; project rationale; a risk assessment; next steps; and relevant Carbon Trust documents which could help move the project forwards. In all, the report consisted of 34 pages, and contained a significant amount of detail for the scoping stage of each project.</p>
<p>This section has discussed the audit of Manufacturer Alpha’s CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities, as it influenced Manufacturer Alpha’s ability to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The next section describes Manufacturer Alpha’s interactions with the UK Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements and their participation in the CO<sub>2</sub> market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<title>Manufacturer Alpha’s interactions with the UK Climate Change Levy and the CO<sub>2</sub> market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme</title>
<p>As an industrial user of electricity, Manufacturer Alpha was covered by the UK’s tax on industrial energy use, the Climate Change Levy. This tax applies to electricity, gas and coal. Oil is excluded since it is mostly used as a transport fuel and is taxed in a different way. Of the different fuels covered by the Climate Change Levy, Manufacturer Alpha only used electricity. An average rate for industrial electricity costs, at the time of the case study, was 7.5 pence per kilowatt hour. The Climate Change Levy was added to this energy cost at a rate of 0.45 pence per kilowatt hour, representing an increase in electricity costs of 6%. However, Manufacturer Alpha was able to apply for a Climate Change Agreement through their trade association. The trade association managed Climate Change Agreements on behalf of their industry as a whole and acted as a point of contact for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. In signing up for a Climate Change Agreement, Manufacturer Alpha had to adopt energy management policies and best practices and was subject to an annual inspection by independent verifier 1 to check that these were being undertaken. These energy management practices detailed who was responsible for different aspects of energy management onsite and set targets for energy efficiency which were tracked and reviewed each year by the management team. These policies were embedded within existing ISO 14001 documentation and did not impose a significant burden upon Manufacturer Alpha. Participation in the scheme was voluntary and the only sanction available to the Department of Energy and Climate Change was to eject Manufacturer Alpha from the scheme. In return, Manufacturer Alpha received an 80% discount on the Climate Change Levy, meaning that they paid the Climate Change Levy at a discounted rate of 0.09 pence per kilowatt hour. At this discounted rate, the net costs of the Climate Change Levy represented just over 1% of annual electricity expenditure.</p>
<p>Examining Manufacturer Alpha’s engagement with the European Emissions Trading Scheme requires a switch in attention to their consumption of oil. Manufacturer Alpha primarily uses electricity and oil, as its rural location means that it is not connected to a mains gas supply. Furthermore, electricity is not relevant to the European Emissions Trading Scheme, as it is a secondary form of energy. The European Emissions Trading Scheme covers the large primary energy consumers, i.e. the power station, rather than dealing with the dispersed electricity consumers. These considerations meant that the only items which Manufacturer Alpha had to include within the European Emissions Trading Scheme were their large oil-fired boilers. These boilers are primarily used to produce steam to run the evaporators that convert the liquid product into a powder at the end of the production process. There are two boilers, one always fully running and the other kept up to temperature as a backup. The boilers are the subject of an annual European Emissions Trading Scheme verification, where the verifier checks that the energy consumption figures and their conversion to CO<sub>2</sub> have been carried out in accordance with the Environment Agency’s guidelines. Manufacturer Alpha then has the option to engage the market for CO<sub>2</sub> in order to sell any surplus CO<sub>2</sub> permits, or to purchase those required to cover any end-of-year shortfall. During the 2008 audit, the verifier praised the systems in place and made small changes to the volume of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reported in order to account for one missed oil delivery and a mistake in data entry. These errors amounted to less than a 0.5% change in the reported annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the site and the verification was passed with only minor comments. First, it was requested that the temperature of an oil meter be recorded, to ensure that consumption was adjusted to take account of differences in temperature. Second, the verifier recommended that some of the site practices should be recorded in the existing ISO 14001 documentation to ensure that procedures were formally acknowledged and recorded.</p>
<p>The annual European Emissions Trading Scheme verification did not involve any discussions of the market-based aspects of the European Emissions Trading Scheme; instead it focused upon ensuring that the correct volume of CO<sub>2</sub> was reported. Although Manufacturer Alpha had accumulated a significant surplus of European Emissions Trading Scheme credits for the past two years, they did not discuss or explore the option to trade these on the market for CO<sub>2</sub>. Instead, the surplus was held as a ‘float’ to ensure compliance was possible in coming years. Despite significant CO<sub>2</sub> credit surpluses affording a very large margin for expansion of emissions in coming years, Manufacturer Alpha did not engage the CO<sub>2</sub> market and monetize their surplus credits. The plant manager explained this decision: ‘Achieving compliance and managing the risks associated with the European Emissions Trading Scheme is our priority- when the verifier comes it feels more important to have the required credits for compliance than to trade them on the market.’ These surplus CO<sub>2</sub> allowances came from a generous allocation to Manufacturer Alpha. Within the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the number of allowances each site receives is based upon standard factors applied to an inventory of equipment on site. In terms of the impact of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, Manufacturer Alpha was in the position where they received more allowances than they needed to run their processes, leaving them with surplus CO<sub>2</sub> allowances at the end of each year. This will continue until Phase II finishes at the end of 2012. In terms of scale, the CO<sub>2</sub> credits gave a surplus that, sold at market value, amounted to approximately 1% of Manufacturer Alpha’s annual energy bill.</p>
<p>This section described how Climate Change Agreements and the European Emissions Trading Scheme operated in order to encourage Manufacturer Alpha to reduce its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The next section describes how Manufacturer Alpha’s large investment decisions and their day-to-day operations were influenced by the European Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<sec id="section10-0170840612463325">
<title>Manufacturer Alpha’s response to the European Emissions Trading Scheme: CapEx project planning and operational metrics versus CO<sub>2</sub> management concerns</title>
<p>During the development of the case study, we separately interviewed the plant manager, engineer, accountant and compliance manager. It quickly became clear that they were concerned about energy costs. Energy costs represented almost 50% of Manufacturer Alpha’s controllable overheads. In discussions about CO<sub>2</sub>, they did not question the validity of concern over climate change. However, they all seemed to agree with the plant manager’s statement that ‘CO<sub>2</sub> is a much less tangible issue to work with, when compared to energy costs’. They spoke about the Environment Agency’s CO<sub>2</sub> market in terms of compliance and standards, thinking of the market as an issue that had to be managed as a risk of potential noncompliance, rather than as a strategic opportunity. There are a few examples which illustrate that the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> was yet to be factored in to Manufacturer Alpha’s strategic decisions. First we will examine the capital project planning and appraisal processes. Then we will give an overview of how energy was managed within the operational key performance indicators used by Manufacturer Alpha.</p>
<p>The projects included in the site’s CapEx plan are split into four levels of priority: ‘Strategic approved capital’, ‘Normal approved budget’, ‘CapEx to be considered’ and finally ‘CapEx on hold’. In the first category, one of the two projects planned will have a significant impact upon energy efficiency; this involved the replacement of one of the boilers with a more efficient model. The second category included sixteen projects, of which seven will have a significant impact upon energy efficiency. Notably, about half of the projects identified by the Carbon Trust were rolled into one of the Level 2 projects. These projects related to using heat recovery to preheat other parts of the process, installing better insulation and using variable speed drives in some parts of the process. Finally, one in four of the projects in category three had a significant impact upon energy efficiency and none of the three CapEx projects on hold impacted upon energy efficiency. When asked how a project comes to be considered as ‘Strategic approved capital’, it was stated by the plant manager that ‘this judgement is somewhat subjective, but would usually involve concerns of increasing production, improving quality performance, or reducing cost’. Upon further questioning, efficiency and climate change were seen as a subset of the third criterion of cost, but not as a strategic concern in their own right.</p>
<p>In a bid to further explore the allocation of CapEx, we were granted access to the project appraisal sheet on which all CapEx proposals are submitted. This is a five-page document, the structure of which is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612463325">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840612463325">Table 3</xref> details the criteria by which Manufacturer Alpha prioritizes different proposals for capital expenditure projects on the basis of a five-page template. The first page contains basic administrative details such as the project name, the project manager and details of the proposing site. The main content on page 1 which was relevant to the investment decision was the classification of the proposed project within one of the following six potential justifications: ‘extension’, ‘efficiency’, ‘new developments/markets’, ‘quality’ or ‘environment/safety’. These project justifications were tickbox criteria that sorted the project proposals into categories but did not provide any space for further details. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction projects fit two of these criteria in that they are linked to ‘efficiency’ and ‘environment/safety’. Efficiency was a major concern as part of cost management efforts at Manufacturer Alpha. Environment and safety were treated as important standards that had to be complied with, but were not discussed as strategic concerns. The second page gave two ‘free text’ boxes where the proposer was expected to describe the project and give reasons for the motivation to undertake the capital project. Pages 3 and 4 requested specific details as to the required expenditures, the specification of the equipment selected and the plan for project implementation. Finally, the fifth page asked four questions: What happens if we do not invest? What is the influence on environment and safety? What is the influence on automation? What is the influence on factory throughput and storage capacity? Of these questions, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction projects would have only been directly relevant to the second question on environment and safety which, as mentioned above, was treated as a compliance issue, rather than a strategic one.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether CO<sub>2</sub> markets were influencing Manufacturer Alpha’s day-to-day management decisions, we examined Manufacturer Alpha’s key performance indicators. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612463325">Table 4</xref> details the key performance indicators with which Manufacturer Alpha tracked factory performance; these were production costs relative to competitors, order completion in terms of time and specification, adherence to the production plan, efficiency in the use of utilities, materials recovery variance, quality control, the level of customer complaints and factory expenses.</p>

<p>Point 4 is where energy efficiency is accounted for, which is the closest that Manufacturer Alpha got to measuring their climate change impact on an operational basis. ‘Utilities’ is the term referring to site energy supplies; reducing reliance upon these utilities would bring about significant cost savings and help to reduce Manufacturer Alpha’s impact upon climate change. In the case of this site, the main concern of the site engineer was that ‘the boilers are run efficiently to produce steam, and then that the steam is used efficiently to produce powdered product from the liquid slurry’. This means that, at the site level, the ultimate measure of utilities efficiency is tonne of product produced per litre of oil used. This high-level target is then broken down into two components. The first submeasure is tonne of steam produced per litre of oil used; this metric gives a performance measure for the team running the boilers. Their aim was to produce as much steam as possible from as little oil as possible. The second submeasure is tonne of product produced per tonne of steam used; this metric gives a performance measure for the production team’s efficiency in using the steam. The production team aims to produce as much product as possible from as little steam as possible. Supplementing these two measures, there are two further environmental metrics within the site’s key performance indicators. The first tracks compliance with the site’s Climate Change Agreements and the second the number of environmental complaints received. Compliance with the Climate Change Agreement was flagged as a procedural concern but amounted to ensuring ongoing data collection, plus the maintenance of a series of energy management procedures and the organization of an annual audit ahead of data submission to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Tracking the number of environmental complaints received was linked to local community concerns relating to smells produced by the production process. Manufacturer Alpha tracked how often a complaint was received regarding production smells, in an effort to minimize their impact upon the locality.</p>
<p>This case study examined the participation of Manufacturer Alpha in the CO<sub>2</sub> market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. We now discuss the case study’s theoretical implications.</p>

<p>We now analyse our data to explore how the regulator’s CO<sub>2</sub> market design was actually enacted during its operation. The discussion is structured around our three research questions.</p>
<sec id="section12-0170840612463325">
<title>Actors in CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation</title>
<p>Our first research question concerned identification of the actors responsible for performing the CO<sub>2</sub> market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. The actors which were examined and their interconnectivity are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0170840612463325">Figure 2</xref>. The Environment Agency is the administrator of the European Emissions Trading Scheme within the UK and we chose Manufacturer Alpha as being representative of an energy-intense manufacturer responding to new markets for CO<sub>2</sub>. We also found that a number of third parties in the CO<sub>2</sub> market were interconnected with Manufacturer Alpha. First, the UK’s Carbon Trust sponsored work which aimed to flag CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities at site through a subsidized survey carried out by a technical consultant. Second, a trade association and independent verifier were responsible for reporting energy consumption and the equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. This data was required as part of Manufacturer Alpha’s compliance with their Climate Change Agreement, which offered them a discount on the Climate Change Levy, the UK’s tax on industrial energy use. Third, a specialist carbon consultant supported Manufacturer Alpha in preparing their CO<sub>2</sub> emission reports for the European Emissions Trading Scheme on an annual basis. These actors are taken as constituting the network responsible for performing Manufacturer Alpha’s participation in the CO<sub>2</sub> market of the European Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<title>Practices, linkages and discrepancies in CO<sub>2</sub> markets</title>
<p>We now address research question 2 by discussing the actual CO<sub>2</sub> market practices observed, their linkages and the discrepancies between actual and designed CO<sub>2</sub> market practices. By definition a discrepancy is ‘an illogical or surprising lack of compatibility or similarity between two or more [entities or ideas]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840612463325">Pearsall, 1999</xref>, p. 409).

<p>Representational practices are linked to exchange and normalizing practices through translations of ‘results’ and ‘descriptions’. We deal first with <italic>descriptions</italic>, starting with the Environment Agency as the market designer. The Environment Agency described the European Emissions Trading Scheme as a market-based mechanism which aimed to incentivize capital-efficient CO<sub>2</sub> reductions. The Environment Agency’s description was framed by a representation of CO<sub>2</sub> as a strategic concern for business. The first discrepancy is that, in contrast, manufacturer Alpha described the European Emissions Trading Scheme as a compliance scheme similar to other environmental regulations, with costs that were not material. Manufacturer Alpha described the European Emissions Trading Scheme as a threat to be managed, rather than as an opportunity. These differences in representations also manifested themselves in discrepancies between how the Environment Agency and Manufacturer Alpha viewed the <italic>results</italic> of their participation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. The Environment Agency saw results of the European Emissions Trading Scheme as the price of CO<sub>2</sub> which was fixed by the market. At the time of the case study, this price was around £15 per tonne CO<sub>2</sub>. However, Manufacturer Alpha measured the results of their participation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme in a different way, expressing CO<sub>2</sub> costs as being equivalent to less than 1% of their annual energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Exchange practices influence representational and normalizing practices through translations of ‘interests’ and ‘measurements’. In line with their descriptions of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the Environment Agency expressed <italic>interests</italic> in incentivizing CO<sub>2</sub> reductions at the least cost for industry as a whole. This highlights a discrepancy based upon a conflict of interest, whereby Manufacturer Alpha’s main interest was in maximizing production throughput and quality while minimizing costs, including those related to compliance with the European Emissions Trading Scheme. The interest in cost minimization was broadly aligned with the Environment Agency’s interest. However, the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> permits was so low that they did not factor in to Manufacturer Alpha’s efforts to minimize their overall costs and, hence, did not influence their behaviour. These findings are aligned with the discrepancies observed between the <italic>measurements</italic> used by each actor. The Environment Agency measured the CO<sub>2</sub> market in terms of absolute costs of CO<sub>2</sub>, while Manufacturer Alpha expressed the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> relative to other production costs. This was significant, because we have seen that this method of measurement showed the new market for CO<sub>2</sub> to have a negligible financial impact, when compared to other production costs.</p>
<p>Normalizing practices influence exchange and representational practices through translations of ‘measures and methods of measurement’ and ‘rules and tools’. The Environment Agency focused upon <italic>measuring</italic> absolute costs of CO<sub>2</sub> in £/tonne and as set by the CO<sub>2</sub> market. In contrast, Manufacturer Alpha calculated the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> introduced by the European Emissions Trading Scheme, but then converted them to a percentage of annual energy expenditure to put them in perspective. This represents a discrepancy between the measures and methods of measurement employed by the regulator in CO<sub>2</sub> market design and those followed by market participants during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation. Moving on to examine the <italic>rules and tools</italic> of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the Environment Agency set the core framework of the market by being able to specify and mandate the protocols for the annual CO<sub>2</sub> permit allocations, reporting cycles and the potential for significant fines for noncompliance. These ensured that companies such as Manufacturer Alpha acknowledged and participated in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. However, the CO<sub>2</sub> market did not override Manufacturer Alpha’s rules and tools which were the prioritization of throughput, quality and cost management, as embedded in the CapEx appraisal sheet and operational KPIs. Manufacturer Alpha continued to prioritize their rules and tools which existed prior to the introduction of the European Emissions Trading Scheme and hired a specialist carbon consultant to ensure that all mandatory requirements of the CO<sub>2</sub> market were met. This was aligned with Manufacturer Alpha’s description of the European Emissions Trading Scheme as a compliance-type issue and was indicative of a discrepancy between the rules and tools of the regulator and those employed by Manufacturer Alpha during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation.</p>

We start by analysing the different <italic>frames</italic> adopted by the Environment Agency and Manufacturer Alpha; then we apply the concept of <italic>overflows</italic> to discuss what was left out of the regulator’s CO<sub>2</sub> market frame of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612463325">Callon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612463325">Goffman, 1971</xref>). Finally, we use the concept of <italic>regulatory capture</italic> to discuss the existence of over-allocations of CO<sub>2</sub> permits and low CO<sub>2</sub> prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612463325">Peltzman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612463325">Stigler, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>The Environment Agency has been framing their design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme at the level of UK-wide industry and optimizing the incentives at this level. The Environment Agency did not take into account that the market participants have a much narrower frame which is limited to their individual company interests; hence, they failed to design a CO<sub>2</sub> market that takes into account the frame adopted by their target CO<sub>2</sub> market participants, such as Manufacturer Alpha. Individual CO<sub>2</sub> market participants’ interests could, therefore, be regarded as an overflow of the design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840612463325">Veal &amp; Mouzas, 2011</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub> market designers did not acknowledge this conflict of interest between the primary interests of market participants and those of regulators, leading them to overlook the fact that the CO<sub>2</sub> market does not challenge or constrain the operational decision-making processes of participants, or their longer-term capital investments.</p>
<p>The case provides evidence of potential overflows of the regulator’s design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme in relation to technological, temporal and uncertainty-based aspects of CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation. A technological overflow and major stumbling block for Manufacturer Alpha’s response to the European Emissions Trading Scheme was that their business model involved turning slurry into a dried powder and this was inherently energy- and CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive. This presented significant challenges to identifying CO<sub>2</sub> reduction opportunities and, therefore, put a limit on the potential for Manufacturer Alpha to engage with the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Temporal overflows were also found to be relevant to Manufacturer Alpha’s participation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Large-scale capital investments involve time-based lock-ins that are comparable to the window of opportunity for successful climate change mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612463325">Meinshausen &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612463325">Moser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840612463325">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>). The Environment Agency had set a time frame of less than 10 years to set up a CO<sub>2</sub> market and deliver significant reductions; this did not acknowledge the lock-ins embedded in the longer-term investment cycles faced by Manufacturer Alpha. Similarly, uncertainty is another overflow which CO<sub>2</sub> market designers did not explicitly take into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612463325">Ford &amp; Mouzas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612463325">Hepburn, 2010</xref>). Uncertainty over how the CO<sub>2</sub> market would respond to targets set by the Environment Agency and the inherently variable price of CO<sub>2</sub> in a market made it difficult for Manufacturer Alpha to engage with this market. These overflows may help to explain Manufacturer Alpha’s emphasis upon compliance and the minimization of their engagement with the CO<sub>2</sub> market.</p>
<p>The concept of regulatory capture, that regulators may end up acting to protect the interests of the organizations which they were originally set up to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612463325">Peltzman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840612463325">Stigler, 1971</xref>), was found to be relevant in the analysis of Manufacturer Alpha’s practices during the operation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Applying the concept of regulatory capture, the following observations seem relevant. First, Manufacturer Alpha received an allocation of CO<sub>2</sub> permits which exceeded their annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, meaning that they had accumulated a significant surplus of credits for the past two years that gave them a comfortable margin for expansion of emissions in coming years. These observations are in line with other research which examines the operation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612463325">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612463325">Hopwood, 2009</xref>). Second, the net impact of the European Emissions Trading Scheme amounted to approximately 1% of the annual energy bill, meaning that the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> was not viewed by Manufacturer Alpha as being material. In combination, these factors meant that there was very little impetus for Manufacturer Alpha to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of their inclusion in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. These findings seem to be aligned with other research which suggests that the design of CO<sub>2</sub> markets has been ‘captured’ and influenced in such a way that it does not actually challenge market participants to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612463325">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463325">Helm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463325">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Kolk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612463325">Shi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840612463325">Sutherland, 1991</xref>). The implications of these observations and some potential responses to them are now discussed.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>This research has highlighted significant discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and the actual operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. The result of these discrepancies is that businesses have not yet reduced their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions following the introduction of the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Our research demonstrated that the championed benefits of CO<sub>2</sub> markets, namely capital efficiency through market flexibility and the ability to set CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction targets at the outset, are not being realized during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation. As such, this research raises doubts about the ability of CO<sub>2</sub> markets to mitigate climate change.</p>
<sec id="section16-0170840612463325">
<title>Theoretical and policy implications</title>
<p>Our findings arise from a practice perspective, whereby we examined CO<sub>2</sub> markets as networks of actors that are engaged in exchange, representational and normalizing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612463325">Hagberg &amp; Kjellberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612463325">Kjellberg &amp; Helgesson, 2007</xref>). This perspective allowed us to develop rich descriptions of the discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation. In doing so, we have attempted to answer calls for investigations of CO<sub>2</sub> market ‘actions and consequences’ as well as ‘aims and intentions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612463325">Hopwood, 2009</xref>, p. 439). We have also given an examination of CO<sub>2</sub> markets in operation, or ‘in vivo’ as Callon refers to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612463325">Araujo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463325">Callon, 2009</xref>). In this way, the discrepancies identified between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and the actual operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets contribute to a body of literature that challenges traditional theories of CO<sub>2</sub> market design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612463325">Engels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612463325">Hopwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840612463325">Wittneben, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditional theoretical justifications for the design of CO<sub>2</sub> markets typically emphasize the importance of externalities, property rights, economic optimization and the ability to set quantifiable targets from the outset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612463325">Coase, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612463325">Dales, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612463325">Demsetz, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612463325">Hardin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840612463325">Lohmann, 2009</xref>). While it is acknowledged that the economic reasoning behind the design of CO<sub>2</sub> markets is logically sound, the present research has shown that this economic rationality is not sufficient to translate the intended market design into successful real-world market operation. One potential explanation for the discrepancies between CO<sub>2</sub> market design and operation is the difference between how regulators frame CO<sub>2</sub> markets and optimize incentives at the level of industry as a whole, and how CO<sub>2</sub> market participants adopt a much narrower frame for the actual representational, exchange and normalizing practices adopted during CO<sub>2</sub> market operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612463325">Callon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612463325">Reverdy, 2010</xref>). Building on the concept of framing, the study contributes to the identification of technological, temporal and uncertainty considerations as overflows which regulators’ frame has so far failed to take into account in the current design of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. Acknowledging the technological challenges in mitigating climate change provides a case for diverting attention away from developing financial incentives for technological fixes and towards solutions which encourage CO<sub>2</sub> market participants to change their behaviours at a more fundamental level. More attention also needs to be given by regulators to temporal overflows of CO<sub>2</sub> markets as windows of opportunity and lock-ins. Regulators must acknowledge that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are cumulative and irreversible and that large-scale capital investments have lock-ins of a comparable length of time to the window of opportunity for successful climate change mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612463325">Meinshausen &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612463325">Moser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840612463325">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>). Dealing with uncertainty overflows represents a real challenge for the regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. There is a significant level of uncertainty about how CO<sub>2</sub> markets would respond to targets set by regulators and how future fluctuations in the economy, e.g. future growth or future recession, will affect the demand for CO<sub>2</sub> permits. These uncertainty-based CO<sub>2</sub> market overflows demonstrate that the price of CO<sub>2</sub> in a market-based approach to climate change mitigation is inherently uncertain and, hence, immensely difficult to take into account within long-term investment appraisals. These insights provide further support for calls for the certainty of CO<sub>2</sub> taxes to be prioritized ahead of the capital efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840612463325">Wittneben, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the examination of the espoused ‘aims and intentions’ of CO<sub>2</sub> markets, the present study builds on the concept of <italic>regulatory capture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612463325">Kalt &amp; Zupan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612463325">Peltzman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612463325">Posner, 1974</xref>) and provides evidence which suggests that the design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme has been ‘captured’ and influenced in such a way that it does not actually incentivize market participants to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612463325">Clò, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612463325">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463325">Helm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612463325">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Kolk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612463325">Okereke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840612463325">Shi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840612463325">Smale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840612463325">Sutherland, 1991</xref>). The over-allocation of CO<sub>2</sub> permits resulted in low CO<sub>2</sub> costs that did not challenge businesses’ existing behaviour. The present study supports claims that the allocation process within the European Emissions Trading Scheme is politically driven and partially divorced from economic or environmental logic. Accordingly, the study has found that CO<sub>2</sub> market participants’ behaviour was driven by risk management and compliance concerns. This type of agency is in stark contrast to the agency of market participants which the regulator intended to create, i.e. that of market participants making significant efforts to reduce and/or trade CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In this way, the issue of agency appears to be critical; it is a constant reminder that market participants perform markets and, hence, exert considerable control over their operation.</p>
<p>Our findings reinforce the need for governments to establish a role for target- and policy-setting by a body that is politically independent and, therefore, more resistant to capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612463325">Helm, 2010</xref>). An example of such efforts is the UK’s Committee on Climate Change, which is a body set up to advise the UK government on climate change regulation on an independent basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612463325">Committee on Climate Change, 2012</xref>). There is a case to be made that other forms of CO<sub>2</sub> regulation do not face some of the challenges which we have identified during our examination of CO<sub>2</sub> markets. For example, a CO<sub>2</sub> tax might bring benefits in terms of certainty over future CO<sub>2</sub> prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840612463325">Wittneben, 2009</xref>). An argument could also be made for such a CO<sub>2</sub> tax to be supported by mandated targets for CO<sub>2</sub> performance that would acknowledge the short window of opportunity for climate change mitigation and the need to avoid lock-ins caused by decisions taken today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612463325">Apaiwongse, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612463325">Meinshausen &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840612463325">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> markets are a relatively new phenomenon and they are rapidly evolving each year. The current study is based upon an investigation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme conducted in 2009/2010. However, CO<sub>2</sub> markets are now becoming global, such as Australia’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612463325">GGAS, 2010</xref>), or the United States’ Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612463325">RGGI, 2010</xref>). It is important to keep up to date with current CO<sub>2</sub> market practices, so new studies will be needed to see how the operation of CO<sub>2</sub> markets has evolved. Phase III of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, the UK’s new Carbon Reduction Commitment, Australia’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme and the United States’ Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative represent opportunities to examine contemporary efforts to use CO<sub>2</sub> markets to incentivize reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>Future research could also benefit from the examination of contemporary and novel types of market, such as those for electricity grid management services, the provision of parking spaces during planning applications, radio frequency bandwidths, kidney transplants, and even school places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612463325">Roth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840612463325">Roth &amp; Peranson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840612463325">Sultanian &amp; van Beukering, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0170840612463325">Vine et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a practice-based perspective would benefit from a more detailed examination of research on international markets for environmental governance such as the ‘wars of position’ based upon ‘material’, ‘discursive’ and ‘organizational’ pillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Egan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840612463325">Levy &amp; Newell, 2002</xref>); ‘regimes’ as persistent and connected sets of rules and practices that prescribe behavioural roles and shape expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612463325">Keohane et al., 1993</xref>); and ‘clusters of norms, rules, principles and decision-making procedures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612463325">Krasner, 1983</xref>). Similarly, the examination of framing, overflowing and regulatory capture would benefit from incorporating another stream of research which examines how cognitive and behavioural biases affect political and economic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612463325">Bazerman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612463325">Hardie &amp; MacKenzie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612463325">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840612463325">Sunstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840612463325">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840612463325">1986</xref>).</p>
