<p>On first receiving this book for review I was under the delusion it would be interesting but not relevant; as a book exploring a Church of England Ministry would not cross over with a minister within the Church of Scotland. And, whilst on the surface this may be true, the reality is far from that. The process of selection and training may be different, but the need for careful, prayerful reflection and discernment is universal.</p>
<p>The book divides into three distinct parts: Understanding Reader Ministry; Exploring the Call and the Practise of being a Reader. Each section contains ideas and information that are specifically Anglican, however, underneath this lies a central core that works for any denominational tradition as it concerns the personal, spiritual journey; development and nurture of the call and the practical considerations of training and practise.</p>
<p>Rowling and Gooder make good use of their own experiences as a Reader and as a Reader Trainer; they also make good use of case studies, interviewing Readers-in-Training and seasoned practitioners about the practicalities of the training and how their ministry has grown and developed. This serves to reassure those who may feel called but feel ill-equipped either because they have little or no higher academic experience, or those who feel it has been too long since they were last in any formal education. There is a tangible sense of reassurance for those who are afraid they may be asked to things beyond their abilities or indeed outwith the comfort zone: many of those interviewed have done things way beyond their initial expectations, but all spoke of the sense of being led by the Spirit, and the rewards of taking the step in faith that moved them into new and exciting ministries.</p>
<p>On the flyleaf Robert Paterson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, describes the book as a treasure. For anyone within the Anglican Church who is considering the Readership, working with Readers or helping potential Readers to discern their call this is undoubtedly true. For a person embarking on the journey of discernment <italic>Chapter 7: Spirituality and Formation for Ministry</italic> is a universally valuable tool; it explores in depth the very deep and specific questions about what sort of ministry, defining the sense of call and the personal relationship with God; this is well presented, explaining terminology and suggesting a very practical and considered method for establishing a support group to ask the difficult questions, give feedback and aid the discernment process – that is indeed a treasure. For the rest of us, this book is a useful resource if we are considering new expressions of ministry, working with those who are in the process of discernment or curious about what the Reader in the Church of England does.</p>
