<abstract>
<p>The article addresses the issue of multi-national employers’ effects on employment practices and industrial relations through the findings of 12 case studies of multi-nationals in the Czech Republic, in the automotive and finance sectors. It is found that in the automotive sector, where product markets are international, there is more transnational organizational co-ordination, but companies avoid transferring their employee participation practices, preferring unilateral management and leading to vertical segmentation between Western and Eastern European sites. In finance, companies from liberal market economies transfer sophisticated direct participation practices, also for anti-union purposes, as firm-specific advantages. The industrial relations outcome shows enduring gaps with Western European practices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The EU enlargement of 2004 has been accompanied by an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and in concerns with the effects on industrial relations (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464417">Contrepois et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012464417">Jürgens and Krzywdzinski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012464417">Marginson and Meardi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012464417">Meardi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012464417">Tholen et al., 2007</xref>). These concerns are exacerbated by high-profile cases of concession bargaining in multi-national companies (MNCs), such as the plant agreements at Fiat in Pomigliano and Turin (Italy) during 2010, in which unions, to avoid relocations to Poland, made concessions not simply on employment conditions, but also on union rights. Yet between FDI and industrial relations there is the ‘black box’ of MNCs’ actual employment practices that needs examining.</p>
<p>This article highlights the hitherto insufficiently considered issue of sector variation in MNCs’ employment practices. While the influence of economic sectors on IR has been studied extensively in western economies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012464417">Katz and Darbishire, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012464417">Marginson and Sisson, 2004</xref>), it has not yet received due systematic attention in the new member states.</p>
<p>The argument points at three causal nexuses. First, sector effects determine very different FDI motivations. Second, different motivations interact with the better known country-of-origin effects to explain different degrees of management practice transfers towards foreign subsidiaries, in particular in the fields of human resource management (HRM) and IR. Finally, the resulting MNCs’ practices are powerful enough to affect subsidiary IR, and so far, in a way that hampers indirect participation.</p>
<p>By comparing service and manufacturing sectors, the link between the IR effects of MNCs and the investors’ motivation prevailing in each sector is investigated. In the manufacturing sector, international competition involves pressure on national employee representation institutions. In services, where competition is only national but labour is a more important production factor, FDI increases pressure on company-specific arrangements – which, in turn, vary depending on the country of origin of the MNC. The argument is based on research on local and transnational level employee participation in 12 MNCs operating in the Czech Republic, with headquarters in Austria, Germany, the UK and the USA, from the automotive and finance sectors.</p>
<p>To unpack the complex relationship between MNCs and IR, the focus is specifically on the example of employee participation, as a field showing wide variation of practices among companies and among countries and as a sensitive area for a possible ‘race to the bottom’ in IR induced by MNCs. In particular, FDI has been negatively associated with union strength by some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012464417">Cooke and Noble, 1998</xref>). A distinction is made between direct and indirect (representative) participation. Direct participation is more developed in liberal market economies (LMEs) such as the USA and the UK than in co-ordinated market economies (CMEs) such as Germany and Austria, where indirect participation prevails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012464417">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012464417">Lansbury and Wailes, 2008</xref>). The research design used here allows the sector effects to be evaluated distinctly according to the country of origin of MNCs, giving consideration to the differences between the approaches of companies from LMEs rather than from CMEs. The host country is by contrast kept constant, with a focus on the ‘best scenario’ for employee participation provided by the economically most advanced and geographically most western new EU member state from the old Soviet bloc, the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012464417">Pollert, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured in five parts. First, the argument of sector effects on the transfer of employee participation by MNCs into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) will be outlined. Second, the research design and sample of case studies are described. Two empirical sections will discuss the findings in terms of, respectively, managerial transfers in the area of employee participation and the resulting IR situation in the Czech subsidiaries. The discussion and conclusion will highlight the identified effects and draw lessons for the study of MNCs and IR in the enlarged EU.</p>

<title>Multi-nationals and employee participation: does the sector matter?</title>
<p>The enlarged EU is a privileged test for the study of MNCs and IR, as it combines very high economic integration, geographic proximity and wide differentials in social standards. Given trade union weakness and collective bargaining underdevelopment in CEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012464417">Bluhm, 2007</xref>), MNCs there dispose of a wide range of strategic options in IR. According to some literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012464417">Dowling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012464417">Kochan et al., 1986</xref>) management values concerning organized labour become a central factor for IR outcomes in international firms under weakly-organized IR systems.</p>
<p>Although a considerable amount of research has been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464417">Contrepois et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012464417">Jürgens and Krzywdzinski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012464417">Marginson and Meardi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012464417">Tholen et al., 2007</xref>), the variety of situations has precluded a general answer to the question of whether MNCs entail a race to the bottom or rather an upgrade in IR. Most research has focused on the country-of-origin effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>) or on sector effects for specific countries of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464417">Contrepois et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of countries of origin generally start from the premise that there are HRM and IR specificities of companies from LMEs such as the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012464417">Almond and Ferner, 2006</xref>) compared to counterparts from CMEs such as Germany (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012464417">Bluhm, 2007</xref>): the former being characterized by a stronger preference for numerical flexibility and direct employee participation, compared to the latter’s association with functional/working time flexibility and indirect participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012464417">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012464417">Lansbury and Wailes, 2008</xref>). While some studies have detected transfers of German models to CEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012464417">Jürgens and Krzywdzinski, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012464417">2010</xref>), others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012464417">Tholen, 2007</xref>) have shed some doubt on the enduring significance of the German specificity. A limit of this line of research is that it has tended to focus on one sector only. By contrast, studies that compare sectors of companies from a specific country, such as France for the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464417">Contrepois et al. (2011)</xref>, are unable to generalize their conclusions to other countries of origin.</p>
<p>This article proposes two ways to advance the understanding of MNCs and employment practices. The first is by using a qualitative approach able to distinguish between managerial approaches, organization processes and outcomes. By relating employee participation to MNCs’ management transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012464417">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012464417">Pudelko and Harzing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012464417">Rosenzweig and Nohria, 1994</xref>), the nature of the ‘multi-national effect’ can be better identified. In principle, it can be expected that MNCs’ headquarters strategies may only matter in those companies that demonstrate a general capacity and willingness to transfer their practices across borders. Second, the analysis focuses on the interaction between country-of-origin and sector effects, while keeping constant the host country. Unlike other new EU member states where employee representation in the private sector is nearly non-existent, the Czech Republic displays relatively influential trade unions and, already since 2001, statutory information and consultation rights through either unions or works councils. Therefore, the Czech Republic offers investors more possibilities to implement a ‘high road’ to employee participation – if they wish.</p>
<p>The research design captures possible sector effects on employment practices and IR by selecting the companies from both a manufacturing sector (i.e. the automotive sector) and a service sector (i.e. finance). Manufacturing and services differ in how FDI relates to national locations: the production of services is usually bound to the location of consumption, something which does not hold true for most manufacturing industries, whose products, in principle, are storable, transferable and tradable across countries.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom tends to downplay the importance of this difference by arguing that, even in manufacturing, considerations of access to national markets generally prevail over efficiency criteria when it comes to choosing a national location (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012464417">Bognanno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012464417">Hatem, 1997</xref>). This is because overcoming trade barriers is presumed to be the pre-eminent FDI motivation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012464417">Markusen and Maskus, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012464417">Shatz and Venables, 2000</xref>). Market access motivation tends to lead to a horizontal differentiation of national locations serving distinct national markets, so that competition among them for investment is almost absent. This contrasts with efficiency-driven FDI aimed at exploiting factor price differentials, which would lead to a vertical differentiation of the national locations insofar as each of them specializes in certain processes and products in line with given comparative advantages.</p>
<p>This conventional line of reasoning ignores the rise of transnationally integrated macro-markets such as the European single market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012464417">Brandl et al., 2010</xref>), within which national tariffs and non-tariff barriers are abolished. In macro-markets, market access loses its importance for decisions on national locations. Once a company has decided whether or not to make an investment in a certain macro-market, the choice of a national location concentrates on efficiency considerations. These locations will compete with each other and horizontal differentiation may rapidly turn into vertical differentiation. This competition does not simply take place over comparative advantage as assumed by classic economic theories, but, increasingly, over comparative efficiency and performance, including through decentralized concession bargaining, as already detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012464417">Mueller and Purcell (1992)</xref>.</p>
<p>However, the realization of macro-markets and in particular of the European single market is not uniform, as confirmed for instance by the recent Monti Report for the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012464417">Monti, 2010</xref>): it is much more advanced in manufacturing than in services. In the latter, market access can still be of primary importance. Because the relevance of macro-markets varies between manufacturing and services, a divergence between the two may occur, with important IR consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012464417">Bechter et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The automotive sector illustrates the importance of macro-market creation. FDI in CEE’s automotive sector in the early 1990s was dictated by access to those markets, still protected by tariffs, and certainly not by efficiency considerations: it focused on mere vehicle assembly for local sales. The opposite became true with EU integration, after which it started concentrating on component production for export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009b</xref>). But MNCs’ entry into the retail, transport or finance sectors of CEE is still dictated by market access.</p>
<p>In the comparison, FDI is therefore expected to be more subject to efficiency criteria in the automotive sector than in finance. As a result of transferability of production, automotive MNCs can consistently pursue a policy of vertical FDI, re-locating labour-intense activities to lower-wage countries provided labour at required skill levels is available there. In the case of Austrian and German companies in the Czech Republic, a country with comparatively skilled and cheap labour, geographic proximity magnifies this tendency towards vertical FDI.</p>
<p>This situation contrasts with finance. Investment in a certain country is still market-related. Competition between the national locations is moderate, though not completely absent: advanced telecommunication has enabled companies to outsource, off-shore and centralize certain back-office functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012464417">Marginson and Sisson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012464417">Regini et al., 1999</xref>). However, international site competition in the finance sector has reached significant levels only among countries that share the same language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012464417">Taylor and Bain, 2008</xref>). Benchmarking, ‘best practices’ and ‘coercive comparisons’ can be applied to the finance sector, but efficiency-driven competition among locations in different countries is limited because companies can pass country-dependent cost increases (e.g. stemming from national laws or collective agreements) on to their customers. In the automotive sector, fully exposed to international competition, companies do not enjoy comparable power to externalize cost increases and are under stronger efficiency pressures to avoid country-related costs.</p>
<p>As a result, the analytical tools required to understand MNCs’ employment practices vary according to the sector: in the automotive sector, where the competition is between national locations, comparative institutional analysis and economic geography are useful (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012464417">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012464417">Hollingsworth and Boyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012464417">Rosenzweig and Nohria, 1994</xref>); in finance, where each national market is largely insulated and competition is between different firms within it, firm-level factors such as resource-based views of the firm (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012464417">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>) are better suited. Recent research on the transfer of practices in MNCs has called for an integration of such different analytical tools into a ‘political economy’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012464417">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>): sensitivity to macro-markets and sector internationalization patterns allows more accuracy in determining which analytical tools are to be applied case by case and therefore with more theoretical precision.</p>
<p>IR, as exemplified by employee participation, should be affected by these differences in transferability of production: in the automotive sector, stronger international competition implies that employers are sensitive to country-specific advantages and disadvantages and will choose the Czech Republic to profit from its employment regime; in the service sector, stronger national-level competition on HR factors, due to the larger share of labour costs in production costs, implies that firm-specific advantages and disadvantages (which, in turn, vary depending on the country of origin) are crucial. Efficiency-driven competition between the distinct national locations is more intense in the automotive sector than in finance, but that among national firms is stronger in services.</p>
<p>Three hypotheses derive from this argument. The first (Hypothesis 1) expects more frequent and more elaborate transfers of management practices and more comparable practices and extensive benchmarking, in the internationalized automotive sector:</p>
<list id="list1-0950017012464417" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Hypothesis 1. Transfer of management practices and HR control by MNCs in the Czech Republic are more frequent in the automotive than in the finance sector.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, transfers are not expected to include country-specific arrangements that are perceived as costs rather than advantages, such as indirect participation practices. The intention not to transfer them and to prefer Czech practices would be stronger in the automotive sector than in the finance sector (Hypothesis 2) for two reasons: the finance sector is not under the same international efficiency scrutiny and national indirect participation systems (of home and host countries) tend to be more relevant (with their longer history, institutionalization and visibility) in manufacturing than in services:</p>
<list id="list2-0950017012464417" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Hypothesis 2. MNCs in the automotive sector transfer fewer participation practices than those in the finance sector.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, sector effects interact with country-of-origin effects. The institutional comparative advantages of CMEs in the automotive sector only make sense if combined with complementary institutions and in the long term. MNCs therefore have no incentive to try to transfer them to new locations. Conversely, LMEs’ comparative advantages in finance, visible in their stronger traditions and specialization, are largely company-specific and transferable. They are perceived as comparative company advantages for internal competition, all the more so in that labour is a more important production factor in services than in manufacturing. As a result, the difference between the logics of investors from the two countries will be more visible in finance than in the automotive sector (Hypothesis 3):</p>
<list id="list3-0950017012464417" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Hypothesis 3. MNCs from LMEs will transfer more direct participation practices than MNCs from CMEs, especially in finance.</p></list-item>

<title>Research design, method and sample description</title>
<p>The investigation was carried out in 2007–8 on MNCs with headquarters in Austria, Germany and Anglophone countries (the UK and the USA) and subsidiaries in the Czech Republic. Half the companies were banks or insurance companies representing the service sector and half were car component suppliers representing the manufacturing sector. The case studies in the finance sector came from different sub-sectors (banking, consumer finance, insurance), which varied greatly in terms of employment practices, but not in their transferability. Two companies per origin and sector were examined, which amounted to a total of 12 companies, each company being named by an acronym of country of origin and sector (car, insurance, consumer finance or bank).</p>
<p>Each case study was based on four to seven semi-structured confidential expert interviews with strategic management, HR management and employee representatives both at the headquarters and at the Czech subsidiary of each company (total number of interviews: 63). Additional sources were relevant company agreements, codes of conduct, corporate publications, company websites, press reports, press releases and trade union websites. Since information provided by the interview partners could only be partly verified, the conclusions should be drawn with caution. Interviews have well known limitations in terms of reliability, but the triangulation between different respondents allowed at least a multidimensional picture to be drawn; more importantly, the narrative and open-ended structure of the interviews allowed information on the process of transfer to be collected, more than a rigid questionnaire or document collection would have enabled. Some interviews were conducted with the help of a Czech interpreter, but measures were taken to avoid distortion: the interviewing researchers had a sufficient grasp of Czech to direct the communication and the interpreters had experience of social research.</p>
<p>The case study companies’ sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012464417">Table 1</xref>) ranged from 300 to 60,000 employees. Each sector was covered by small and large companies. The smallest Czech subsidiary employed around 150 employees (Dins1), while the largest affiliates engaged more than 1000 workers (Dcar1 and USban). The skill level among the employees at the subsidiaries was predominantly low at the Austrian and UK car component suppliers and generally high at the rest of the investigated companies. The level of internationalization in terms of the share of foreign employees in the total number of employees ranged from 45 per cent (Dcar2) to 90 per cent (UKcar) and was generally higher in the automotive companies than in the finance ones. The majority of the investigated subsidiaries were set up or acquired in the first half of the 1990s, some in the second half of the 1990s and one after 2000. The mode of entry varied, with a predominance of greenfield investors.</p>

<p>In the home countries some form of formal collective employee representation was present in every company. At the Czech subsidiaries trade unions were present at Dcar1, UKcar and UScar and there was an organizing attempt at the end of the research at USban. A European works council (EWC) was planned at Dcar1 and present at UKcar, Aban1, Dins1 and Dins2, but at Dins1 the Czech subsidiary was not represented. None of the existing EWCs had any particular influence on IR in the Czech sites.</p>
<p>The overall picture indicated that the financial sector differed from the manufacturing one in the broader scope of direct participation, less adversarial IR and rarer union presence.</p>

<title>Transferring employee participation practices?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012464417">Table 1</xref> summarizes employee participation practices for the 12 case studies, in connection with management practice transfer and standardization. The degree of transfers and standardization are considered in terms of co-ordination mechanisms and number and relative importance of practices transferred. To contextualize MNC’s employment practices, the research compared the area of employee participation (e.g. union recognition, collective bargaining, works councils, meetings, surveys) with HRM (e.g. recruitment, pay) and product-related transfers (e.g. training, job analysis and definition, health and safety).</p>
<p>The clearest finding was that all companies, regardless of sector and with the sole exception of Dins1, showed massive transfers from the headquarters to the Czech subsidiaries in most business areas related to the product, while the headquarters’ influence was lower in the area of HRM and lowest on participation, with the latter considered as a local matter by most managers. Propensity to transfer clearly declined when moving from product-related issues, through HRM, towards IR.</p>
<p>The contrast was more marked in the automotive sector, where product-related transfers from the parent company to the Czech subsidiaries were systematic, as market integration requires highly co-ordinated production processes. Manufacturing sector activity was a sufficient condition to expect strong transfers in this area. The fact that transfers were also strong in several finance sector companies, and notably in the banks and the private finance company, was possibly due to the specificity of the host country as a post-communist one. Banking and private finance – even more than automotive production – went through a radical overhaul with the transition towards capitalism, as they were underdeveloped in planned economies. The process of change was driven by foreign companies, who transferred their western practices not because of international competition and standardization requirements (as in the automotive sector) but for considerations of particularly intensive internal competition, within the host country, against other companies. By contrast, in insurance, where systemic change was less radical and national regulations were more influential, product-related transfers were more limited.</p>
<p>HRM co-ordination, whether directly through expatriate managers or frequent visits from headquarters, or organizationally through systematic reporting and benchmarking procedures, appeared to be stronger in manufacturing. The forms of co-ordination varied depending on the size of the company and the degree of its internationalization. Among the car companies, the degree of co-ordination was high in all companies but two: Acar2 and UScar. Acar2’s exception, however, was consistent with the proposed argument on vertical, as opposed to horizontal, FDI in manufacturing: Acar2 was not a global producer, but (like Acar1, where the same process was ongoing) a medium-size enterprise from the border region that had already completed a process of radical vertical division of labour between Austrian and Czech operations. A process of radical international restructuring had changed the profile of the Austrian workforce, where only clerical and high-skill functions remained. As a result, HRM co-ordination was now low only because the operations on the two sides of the border were no longer comparable: they included very different labour processes. In the remaining outlier, UScar, the low level of co-ordination was due to the variety of products and the complex company structure stemming from a series of international acquisitions. In manufacturing, as discussed, economic geography helps an understanding of relations between subsidiaries and of why proximity increases competition and vertical segmentation between them.</p>
<p>HRM transfers, by contrast, were being pursued only selectively, except for some finance companies implementing home country pay systems and direct communication tools. Participation transfers were even rarer: in seven of the 12 case studies participation transfers were intentionally avoided and even where they occurred they were limited or unenthusiastic. Smaller companies were particularly reluctant to transfer anything in this area.</p>
<p>The motivation for HRM and participation transfers, when they occurred, deserves then a closer look. Management at USban justified the adoption of American management practices (such as performance-related pay, informality and direct communication) not so much on the grounds of standardization (products were largely different), but for the advantages they produced within the Czech Republic in comparison to the allegedly more bureaucratic Western European competitors. At Aban1 and UKfin, HRM transfers were frequently related to product innovation for local competition, rather than to standardization needs. Additionally, some transfers (corporate culture at Dins1, diversity management at Dins2 and USban) were driven by specific home country or international corporate social responsibility commitments.</p>
<p>In automotive companies, management selectively prioritized the transfer of HRM practices that were directly related to aspects of the international standardization of production: working time (Dcar2), teamwork (UKcar), health and safety (Dcar1, Dcar2, UKcar). In addition, some specific HRM solutions were transferred when they were deemed to constitute company-specific advantages, such as in the case of appraisals and pay system at UScar.</p>
<p>Transfers of indirect participation were particularly limited, especially in the automotive sector where they were, at most, of minor importance. Once the details of the specific practices are considered, it is clear that automotive companies predominantly perceived their home country IR arrangements as costs, rather than advantages. Therefore, non-transfer, rather than transfer, was a symptom of the relevance of international competition. This was in particular the case of employee representation and collective bargaining. In the interviews most German and Austrian headquarters managers expressed appreciation for the benefits deriving from employee participation, even though some of them also criticized the IR systems in their countries and some firms showed decreasing commitment to sectoral collective agreements (Dcar) or works agreements (Aban1). The listed advantages included help to legitimize unpopular management decisions, increasing motivation and company loyalty, communication facilitation with employees, more feedback that contributed to improve product quality, higher retention rate and easier recruitment of new employees. However, crucially, the declared appreciation of participative decision-making among the German and Austrian managers did not translate into a commitment to transfer such models to the foreign affiliates. A large majority of the headquarters managers did not propose any transfers in the field, deeming IR a local matter.</p>
<p>By contrast, the two finance companies with greater degrees of transfers (USban and UKfin) were from LMEs and transferred exactly the opposite kinds of practices, i.e. anti-unionism and union-substituting forms of direct participation (surveys, meetings, employee interviews, suggestion schemes).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have a very proactive approach to employment relations. Instead of involving a 3rd party [unions], we prefer direct communication. Unions and collective bargaining exist in some places, depending on the size of the subsidiary and on the country. Overall, we are less likely to be unionized than a similar company in a given country. We are not actively anti-union, but we do look for better alternatives where possible. (Headquarters Personnel Manager, USban)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The union-replacing practices included one important case of indirect participation practice, the constitution of an employee forum at UKfin. This was actually a case of experimentation: the forum was created in the Czech Republic first, and only after its success was it introduced in the home operations, as a body meeting the new UK information and consultation regulations of 2004. The commitment to such a body proved rather short-term: at the time of the research the forum had stopped meeting for over a year, all the employee representatives had left the company and no new elections had been organized – an extreme case of ‘exit’ prevailing over ‘voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012464417">Meardi, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0950017012464417" sec-type="results">
<title>Resulting IR arrangements in the Czech subsidiaries</title>
<p>The previous section has shown that managers of manufacturing MNCs were more actively averse to indirect participation than managers at finance MNCs. But how far do headquarters’ approaches matter for the eventual IR outcomes in the subsidiaries? Do sector differences lead, ceteris paribus, to fewer employee participation opportunities in the Czech subsidiaries of automotive companies compared to the finance sector?</p>
<p>While headquarters management’s influence was minimal and indirect in most investigated companies, the local Czech or expatriate managers at the affiliates played a crucial role for the IR situation at the subsidiary. The German and Austrian expatriates from both sectors did not feel bound to the home country’s IR traditions and opposed independent collective employee representation at the Czech sites, although wide differences in personal opinion existed among managers of all sectors and countries of origin. Explicit reservations about (potential) collective employee representation at the Czech subsidiary were expressed by most local managers (Acar1, Acar2, UKcar, USban, Dins1, Aban1, Aban2). Some expatriates (Aban1, Aban2, Acar2) and Czech managers (Dins1, Aban1, Aban2, USban) explicitly considered the lack of employee representation as an advantage, also with paternalist overtones: ‘In fact, management is at the same time the works council for the Czech employees’ (Austrian HR manager, Aban2). An Austrian director (Acar2) and a Czech director (Dins1) even turned down employee attempts to get organized. The Czech subsidiary management at UKcar pragmatically accepted the existing trade union but considered its presence as a competitive disadvantage in comparison to local greenfield small and medium-sized factories, which were usually non-unionized. The local Czech management at Acar1 adopted a rather restrictive and authoritarian management style and did not believe that a company union could be beneficial.</p>
<p>A less adversarial approach was taken in a minority of companies, all large (UScar, UKfin, Dins2). Dins2’s local HR manager promoted a cooperative IR approach. Without her efforts no election of a EWC representative would have taken place, since the employees showed no interest. As mentioned in the previous section, UKfin created a consultation body (employee forum), but this was no longer operational at the time of the research. UScar accepted the trade union that was inherited from the acquired firm as a not entirely negative situation. A neutral or ambiguous attitude was taken by Dcar1 and Dcar2, reflecting a strictly conditional acceptance of trade unions: in both companies, the German plant managers claimed that they would accept a German-style, co-determination-oriented works council, but that they objected to non-German trade unions as detrimental because – they thought – they were divided and unrepresentative (even though Czech unions were actually as unitary as the German ones and Czech works councils had been possible since 2001).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am actually a friend of co-determination and this is always a feature of our company … we actually want co-determination, but already structured and representative of the majority of the workforce … Here, five people are enough to create a union and represent their group’s interest; and then yet another union can be built. Obviously, we try to avoid this. (German plant manager, Dcar2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some German and Austrian companies that did not transfer indirect participation opted for paternalist informality instead. At Dcar2, a bilingual personal assistant of the (German) plant manager played the role of mediator and ‘confidential’ representative of employee grievances. At Dins2, the plant HR department claimed to perform the function of a works council for Czech employees, promising to mediate with the plant’s or the headquarters management any issue that employees might raise.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012464417">Table 1</xref> summarizes the resulting IR arrangements in terms of direct and indirect participation. While there were no trade unions in any of the finance affiliates (with the partial exception of the brownfield part of Aban1), there were company unions present in three out of the six investigated car component suppliers, although at Dcar1 membership was very low and one of its four Czech plants was non-union. The mode-of-entry effect was very visible: in manufacturing, brownfield investment appeared to be a necessary and sufficient condition to meet a union; in finance, it appeared to be a necessary condition, but probably not a sufficient one (brownfield USban still had no union at the time of the research, even though an organizing attempt was taking place). All the trade unions recorded in this research had been inherited from the period before acquisition and generally in continuity from communist times, although all reps and convenors had been elected after 1989.</p>
<p>Several companies had so far rejected the establishment of works councils or company trade unions (Dins1, USban, Dcar2, Acar2). Where collective forms of employee representation existed in the subsidiaries, in most cases they were only tolerated. Trade unions were truly independent but not very strong and where they existed they were critical of the degree of information received.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It would have been sufficient if the new management team had organized a meeting to introduce themselves … Instead of negotiating, they order things … Management promised a meeting with the employees in March: we are in June and still no meeting. (Union rep, UKcar)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some companies, especially those from LMEs, tried to compensate for the shortage of indirect participation with direct participation practices and especially surveys and interviews to detect discontent. The most frequent motivation was retention, a problematic area in the tight Czech labour market (4.9% unemployment in 2007). At UScar, the union itself ran ‘exit interviews’ with leaving employees, to use the information in negotiations with the employer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the case studies do not indicate that market-seeking investments in CEE showed significantly more cooperative IR and more employee participation than efficiency-seeking investments. Finance sector companies did make more of an effort on developing direct, but not indirect, participation. When headquarters declared IR a local matter, this was not a neutral approach, because they knew that they were leaving it to overwhelmingly anti-union local management. Employee representative participation found little space in MNCs and still mostly derived from pre-existing institutions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results confirm Hypothesis 1 with regard to management transfers (e.g. technology, IT, quality controls, customer relations) and HR control from the headquarters: these were stronger in manufacturing than finance, although with exceptions that are explained by economic geography. The findings also confirm Hypothesis 2: participation (especially indirect) practices were rarest, in particular in manufacturing.</p>
<p>By contrast, the findings challenge Hypothesis 1 with regard to HRM transfers: they were similar between the two sectors and, if anything, more frequent in finance than in manufacturing. Previous research, however, has pointed to the fact that transfers vary depending on the specific practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012464417">Almond and Ferner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012464417">Rosenzweig and Nohria, 1994</xref>) and notably on whether a home country management practice constitutes a potential competitive advantage or not. MNCs <italic>do not</italic> want to transfer those home country practices that are perceived as disadvantages and additional costs and may prefer to benefit from the looser regulations of the Czech Republic. In finance, they will want to transfer those HRM practices (e.g. pay systems, direct communication) that are seen as specific firm-related (as against home country) competitive advantages, especially because labour costs and labour skills play a much more important part in competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012464417">Regini et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>This line of reasoning is even more pertinent in the case of participation transfers, on which findings confirm Hypotheses 2 and 3. It was in finance, rather than manufacturing, that the difference between investors from LMEs and CMEs was discernible on participation.</p>
<p>The sector effects, to summarize, operated in different directions depending on the management area. The greater degree of international competition and standardization in the automotive components produced a higher intensity of product-related transfers and a greater degree of international HR co-ordination, but a lower transfer of HRM and especially IR. Two partial exceptions confirmed the general rule. First, some smaller, rather than global, automotive producers from a neighbouring region (e.g. Austria) had completed the process of international restructuring and produced a radical vertical division of labour between locations and therefore a differentiation and inherent incomparability of production and HR. Second, those financial companies that acted as innovators in the host markets had transferred a large amount of product-related practices, seen as company-specific competitive advantages (e.g. UKfin, first mover in the Czech Republic and therefore unavoidably a practice innovator). Overall, such a process resulted in a very pragmatic, or even opportunistic, approach to employment relations in the host country, as suggested by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012464417">Bluhm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012464417">Geppert and Matten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012464417">Kahancová, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012464417">Kvinge and Ulrichsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012464417">Tholen, 2007</xref>) – but this pragmatism varied across sectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0950017012464417" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The broad picture from the case studies is quite clear: in both sectors, independent employee representation was weak in Czech sites, despite the Czech Republic being economically the most advanced and geographically the most western of the new post-Soviet bloc member states. A majority of multi-national investors, even when they declared an appreciation of indirect participation in the home country, actively tried to avoid it once in the permissive environment of CEE. If they developed direct participation, it was in management-led and conditional forms. This finding challenges the thesis of a ‘German work model’ transfer to CEE, advanced by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464417">Contrepois et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012464417">Jürgens and Krzywdzinski, 2009</xref>). Such a transfer is likely to occur only in a few cases under strong pressure from the German unions or works councils (e.g. Volkswagen).</p>
<p>This article sheds light on the sector effects on these processes. The difference between service (finance) and manufacturing (automotive) sectors operated in a largely contingent way depending on the country of origin of the MNC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0950017012464417">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Transfers of production concepts and co-ordination of HR were more frequent in manufacturing than in finance, but this was not true for transfers in the HRM area; and the opposite was true for employee participation practices. Smaller automotive companies from the border region transferred even less, as it was easy for them to separate labour-intensive practices in the East from knowledge-intensive ones in the West. Site competition tended to be stronger, for geographic reasons, for Central European companies than for more remote ones (from the UK and especially the USA).</p>
<p>In terms of country of origin, for investors from CMEs, there was no difference between sectors; for those from LMEs, there was more transfer in the finance sector. As a result, while there were few country-of-origin differences in manufacturing, finance companies from LMEs transferred some of their home practices, mostly in a union pre-emption function. This was due to the fact that some typical LME practices in the finance sector were considered to be firm-specific competitive advantages, which were important for competition against other firms within the Czech market; by contrast, most CME practices were country-specific and were perceived by management as competitive disadvantages. Overall, both transfer levels and home country effects were therefore contingent on the sector: in manufacturing there was little difference between different origins of the investment, while in services there were differences, with stronger transfers by MNCs from LMEs.</p>
<p>The findings may explain why previous research in this field, having largely focused on manufacturing, only detected minor differences between US and German investors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012464417">Meardi et al., 2009a</xref>): in manufacturing, competition pressure in a macro-market such as the EU has led to a degree of convergence in company strategies, practices and approaches to HRM and IR; and competition on IR is between countries, rather than between companies. In finance, by contrast, competition between different global players does not take place on a (limited) international market level, but only appears within the national borders of countries open to a variety of foreign investors, e.g. in CEE. Within this sector and these countries, investors from LMEs tend to draw from their firm-specific repertoire of direct participation and union-avoidance techniques.</p>
<p>These effects have implications for the prospects of transnational employee representation: in manufacturing, stronger international competition results in stronger calls for transnational union co-operation, e.g. through EWCs, but also in a stronger potential for inter-site rivalry and employer opposition. The identified sector differences in FDI may explain sector differences in transnational employee representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012464417">Anner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012464417">Arrowsmith and Marginson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, manufacturing MNCs, especially if from neighbouring countries, exert pressure on indirect employee participation because of international competition. Automotive investors from CMEs are no more open to indirect participation than their competitors from LMEs; and Austrian investors – due to geographic proximity and generally smaller size – are even more hostile to it. In finance, MNCs compete in developing company-specific direct participation mechanisms because of local competition; and those from LMEs take the lead. In both sectors, but for different reasons, MNCs have negative, rather than positive effects on IR.</p>
