<p>Bret’s story is autobiographical and portrays the life of a young man who triumphed over 15 years of communist imprisonment. The dedication is, in itself, a moving introduction – Bret remembers his parents, his oldest brother Joe, and the many thousands of other political prisoners who died during the Marxist communist dictatorships of 1948–1989. He also dedicates his book to his immediate family in return for their constant love and support. At 18 years of age, Bret Dofek was taken prisoner by the communist regime in his native Czechoslovakia.<sc> h</sc>e spent the next 15 years in the Jachymov and Pribram uranium mines – a slave in the harshest of communist camps<sc>. </sc>During this time, he used his imprisonment to develop an inner balance and harmony, transforming his suffering and turning experiences that could have destroyed him into love of humankind.</p>
<p>In the Foreword, written by Melanie Mulhall, the following questions are asked:<disp-quote>
<p>What makes us human and what does it mean to be human? As humans, is it our nature to stretch ourselves and grow<sc>? </sc>And is the capacity to love hardwired within us? What makes one human being mistreat another? Can we retain our humanity under the most dehumanising conditions imaginable? And if so, how? What is freedom and what does it mean to be free? Is freedom free or is there a price to pay for it<sc>? C</sc>an it be lost through apathy or inattention?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We all recognize these eternal questions and as we constantly receive news from around the world in 2012, we wonder how and why so many parts of our world are still enchained by injustice and prejudice.</p>
<p>Bret learned during those awful years of suffering that human beings hold within themselves the spiritual capacity to overcome whatever hardship they are forced to endure. His story is one of personal triumph, and of the endurance of human will and the <sc>‘</sc>unconquerable soul<sc>’.</sc>
</p>
<p>Bret comments on what he calls <sc>‘</sc>the most damaging beliefs held by most people today’. He reminds us that most people believe that freedom is free, that it comes without our doing anything to deserve it. Reflecting on our world, and his own experiences, he argues that within us all lies the potential to overcome extreme injustice by using the power of the spiritual and emotional strength that lies within us all. </p>
<p>Bret cautions parents and educators that if we fail to develop the emotional and spiritual strengths of our young people, then we are creating a world of young adults who are unable to fight against adversity in a positive and healing way:<disp-quote>
<p>Teaching what constitutes human nature should be a priority in [a child’s] learning process. Who are they and where do they belong in this natural process of life? What are their fundamental needs? How can they be fully prepared to deal with the complexities of their lives when so many things can go wrong? How can they retain their inner balance, stability and harmony and how can they retain the harmony of their relationships with others? (p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I recommend that all parents, teachers and young people read Bret Dofek’s book. They will find it very moving and inspirational. They will learn and reflect upon what makes them a worthwhile human being capable of loving others, and capable of surmounting extreme suffering. </p>
