<abstract>
<p>Although much is understood about barriers to healthy food consumption in low-income, urban communities, knowledge regarding the crucial next step of building feasible, community-supported approaches to address those barriers remains limited. This qualitative study used in-depth interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 20), focus groups (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and participant observations (<italic>n</italic> = 3) to identify strategies to promote locally grown produce from an urban food security project, Produce From the Park (PFP), an urban farm. Informants included community organization representatives and residents from low-income neighborhoods in a mid-Atlantic city. Informants identified structural and cultural barriers to purchasing healthy food, including price, location, food culture, and lack of interest. Participants proposed a number of strategies, such as distribution through mobile food carts and farm stands, marketing new foods through taste tests and cooking demonstrations, and youth mentorship. Informants also described their perceptions of the local urban farm and suggested ways to increase community buy-in. Strategies mentioned were inexpensive and incorporated cultural norms and local assets. These community perspectives can provide insights for those promoting healthy eating in urban African American communities through urban food security projects.</p>

<p>In recent decades, low-income, primarily African American urban neighborhoods have experienced the flight of grocery stores into wealthier suburbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405849">Neff, Palmer, McKenzie, &amp; Lawrence, 2009</xref>). In these “food deserts,” corner stores sell little, if any, produce. Residents consistently identify food prices, availability, transportation, and convenience as barriers to healthy eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405849">Gittelsohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405849">Lucan, Barg, &amp; Long, 2010</xref>). In turn, these barriers promote dietary habits that contribute to epidemics of chronic disease and obesity in African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911405849">Morland &amp; Evenson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405849">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much is understood about barriers to healthy food consumption in low-income, urban communities, knowledge regarding the crucial next step of building feasible, community-supported solutions remains limited. For example, urban food security (UFS) projects, such as farmers’ markets and urban agriculture, attempt to promote healthy eating by selling produce. However, many projects often struggle because they assume that access and lower prices will automatically facilitate demand and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405849">Guthman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405849">Macias, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead, studies focused on African Americans show that food choices, and thus receptivity toward UFS projects, are affected by two types of perceived cultural affiliation: the food promoted and the food source. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405849">Zoellner, Bounds, Connell, Yadrick, and Crook’s (2010)</xref> research indicates that food culture and preferences, rather than cost and availability, explain African Americans’ limited responses to messages encouraging healthy eating. For example, Zoellner et al.’s informants explained that their preferences, such as fatty meats and fried foods, are rooted in tradition. Similarly, African American focus group participants said that choosing healthier options over traditional foods is sometimes seen as giving up African American culture for mainstream White culture. As one participant said, “The Food Guide Pyramid doesn’t show the types of food we (African-Americans) usually eat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405849">James, 2004</xref>). In addition to this reluctance to adopt “White” foods and food preparation methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405849">Guthman’s (2008)</xref> observations reveal negative associations between alternative food sources and “White America.” Guthman explains that common messages that encourage engagement with UFS projects, such as calling for African Americans to “get their hands dirty,” evoke images of White land ownership and slave labor. Despite differing views on the nature of cultural affiliation, it is clear that if UFS projects want to succeed in low-income African American communities, they must develop strategies addressing various cultural factors.</p>
<p>Produce From the Park (PFP, pseudonym), a community-based nonprofit, broke ground in 2009 on 6 acres of urban parkland. PFP’s mission is to improve community access to produce, promote localized food consumption, provide experience-based learning opportunities for students, and establish urban farming as a source of community development. PFP approached investigators at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to perform an assessment of the park’s surrounding neighborhoods to generate programmatic recommendations. A socioecological perspective was used to identify multiple levels of influence affecting health behavior and health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405849">McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, &amp; Glanz, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The qualitative research study explored the following questions:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How does the cultural and structural food environment influence community members’ access to and demand for healthy foods?</p></list-item>

</list>
<sec id="section1-1524839911405849" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Researchers used ethnographic methods to develop rich contextual understandings of consumer and communication behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405849">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Data collection was conducted during February 2010 to July 2010 with approval from the institutional review board at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and oral consent from each informant.</p>
<p>Investigators first approached community organization representatives (CORs) to gain credibility in the community and identify important themes and terms. One or two 60-minute in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with eight CORs identified from PFP referrals (<italic>n</italic> = 13), three of whom were African American. Five were 30 to 49 years old, and three were older than 50 years.</p>
<p>Building on emergent themes from COR interviews, investigators elicited the perspectives of community residents (CRs) through two 90-minute focus group discussions (FGDs; <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>n</italic> = 11). FGDs allowed residents to build on each other’s perspectives, generating salient information about social norms (Morgan, 1997). Sixty-minute IDIs were then conducted with CRs (<italic>n</italic> = 7) who were recruited at PFP weekly farm stands to expand on FGD themes and explore factors that drew residents to the market. Six were African Americans, one was 30 to 49 years old, and five were older than 50 years old. The study team attended community events and conducted three 2-hour participant observations at PFP’s markets in winter, spring, and summer to observe community characteristics and consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Interviews and discussions were recorded and transcribed, except for three individuals who preferred handwritten notes. Transcripts and field notes were coded using ATLAS.ti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911405849">Scientific Software Development, 2008</xref>) to identify emerging themes based on research questions and ethnographic methodology. The team then created matrices of themes and subthemes from transcripts.</p>

<title>Sociocultural Food Environment</title>
<sec id="section4-1524839911405849">
<title>“The old school.”</title>
<p>Tradition, or “the old school,” was often invoked as a barrier to promoting healthy eating. Informants referred to Southern food traditions, where, “everythin’ is either overcooked or fried.” Although cultural food norms involve greens, traditional preparation methods “diminished the nutritional content.” Yet “the old school” was also described nostalgically as part of a healthier past giving way to a “hustle and bustle” world dominated by economic difficulties, advertising, and convenience. An older CR describes this change regarding her adult children:
<disp-quote>
<p>McDonald’s was a treat for them, not a meal . . . They should have fresh vegetables . . . sit down and have a meal with [their] children. (CR 5, African American woman, 60-70s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This movement away from “the old school” was reflected in generational differences. Older residents were described as a stable market for produce, whereas younger members were seen as too burdened “to have the time to prepare food, healthy or not” or too divorced from “where food comes from.” One resident told a story about her volunteer work: “I had one kid . . . I said ‘C’mon, let’s make some pancakes.’ He said, ‘You don’t have a box.’”</p>
<p>This increasing detachment from food preparation is compounded by disinformation around “what healthy food actually is.” Advertising was said to exacerbate a growing reliance on fast or processed food. One informant said parents were misled by commercials and so-called health messages in packaging of sugary cereals, thinking, “Oh! Three grams of fiber [in Fruit Loops], that must be a good thing.”</p>
<p>However, some participants remarked that young people may be more receptive to terms such as <italic>organic</italic>, and two FGD participants from the “younger generation” spoke of an interest in buying “real food” from “real farmers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911405849">
<title>“Used to eatin’ one way.”</title>
<p>A lack of interest in trying healthy foods and changing current behaviors were seen as additional barriers related to issues of tradition and awareness. When one COR tried to incorporate healthier preparation methods, her nephew said, “Why do you cook like a White person?” Another COR reported difficulties promoting healthy food at block parties: “There is the expectation of pit beef and we don’t want to give them just carrots.” When asked about community members’ attitudes toward “healthy eating,” another representative replied, they think “healthy food . . . tastes nasty . . . even if they sample healthy foods, they don’t like it, ‘cause they’re used to eatin’ one way.”</p>

<sec id="section6-1524839911405849">
<title>Competing Priorities</title>
<sec id="section7-1524839911405849">
<title>“A distant concern.”</title>
<p>Informants emphasized that matters of health and healthy foods must be weighed against other pressing issues, enumerated by one COR as “trash, rats, drug dealers, losing your house, your kids’ welfare.” Since most families struggle to “have a job, keeping their roof over their head, fast food preparation is a convenient way to get food.” Informants did state that obesity and diabetes, if not always recognized or discussed, were important; as one health-conscious respondent declared, “I am tired of seeing my friends dying of bad food choices.” However, many “don’t see [these diseases] as food related.”</p>

<sec id="section8-1524839911405849">
<title>Structural Food Environment</title>
<sec id="section9-1524839911405849">
<title>“Hamburger helper is just easier and cheaper.”</title>
<p>The demographic profile of residents and structural barriers described by participants were consistent with that of a “food desert.” One organizer explained, “The economics of many of the residents is challenged.” Informants identified price and convenience as major factors in food purchases. As one participant stated, “Hamburger Helper is just easier and cheaper.”</p>
<p>Food choices were also dictated by options at corner stores and carryouts, the most accessible food sources. Informants noted that corner stores either have no fresh produce or “may just have one onion and some potatoes.” Even these options were expensive, forcing them to choose prepackaged foods. As for the alternative, carryouts and fast food, one CR called them “greasy spoon places.”</p>

<sec id="section10-1524839911405849">
<title>Strategies for Changing Perceptions About Healthy Foods</title>
<sec id="section11-1524839911405849">
<title>“If somebody see and taste something.”</title>
<p>An often-repeated point was the importance of firsthand exposure to delicious, healthy food. Such experience can boost interest:
<disp-quote>
<p>We were testing vegetarian sausage in the schools . . . the feedback we got is “oh this is good” and “we want to see this on the menu.” (CR 4, African American man, 30-40s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Distributing samples, hosting cooking demonstrations, and issuing “5-minute recipe” cards with nutrition information were mentioned as strategies for providing these experiences and demonstrating that preparation could be fast and feasible. Others said that substituting healthier ingredients in traditional dishes could entice reluctant consumers.</p>
<p>Informants emphasized targeting youth to improve their health, generate a long-term customer base, and create a “distribution force” for promoting healthy food at home. One COR said, “If we didn’t include kids in our plan for the future, we didn’t have a plan for the future.” Informants also recommended creating opportunities for young and old to interact. For example, one organizer used to have her nephew watch her make salads, “so that he knows how to make it himself.” Mentoring allows adults to model behaviors that might not be otherwise visible to youth. Other informants suggested PFP partner with educational institutions to show students how food is grown, cooked, and preserved, as well as teach them how to apply these skills in business. Such ventures would create early firsthand experience and build self-efficacy with vegetable preparation and consumption.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-1524839911405849">
<title>Strategies for Navigating Structural Constraints</title>
<sec id="section13-1524839911405849">
<title>“A dollar a bag,” at a regular “vegetable marketplace.”</title>
<p>Addressing issues of setting and mobility emerged as a way to navigate constraints. Instead of brick-and-mortar distribution points, informants spoke of temporary, consistently placed farm stands at high-traffic corners and schools.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One concept that has worked for some time is the [farmers’] markets and the weekend fresh vegetable spots . . . [PFP could] create that kind of vegetable marketplace. (COR 2, African American man, 60-70s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked in an FGD whether residents would be interested in farm stands, one African American male participant stated, “Just about everybody here would be . . . the thing is you have to be consistent.”</p>
<p>Others spoke of mobile distribution options, such as food carts. Several recalled the horse-drawn produce carts and roadside stands that they frequented in the past, revealing a precedent for these options.</p>
<p>Participants emphasized the importance of knowing in advance that produce would be available at particular locations at affordable prices, and many rely on circulars for this purpose. Some patronized farmers’ markets because farmers were present weekly and “because of the social element.” Anticipation builds when a distributor demonstrates dependability in affordable pricing, location, and frequency:
<disp-quote>
<p>Once they know the church is going to have food on certain Saturdays, they start waitin’ for it! And this is a dollar a bag—you put everythin’ in a bag and it’s only a dollar. (COR 5, African American woman, 50-60s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section14-1524839911405849">
<title>Strategies for Promoting UFS Projects</title>
<sec id="section15-1524839911405849">
<title>“I think they grow something over there.”</title>
<p>Participants felt that most of the community had low awareness of PFP. Most FGD participants did not know PFP existed. Observations at fall and spring farm stands also showed that most customers were Caucasian and nonresidents of the area. Participants emphasized creating buy-in through joining community meetings and engaging community leaders. Others warned against being a project that “gets started and then fizzles out.” One resident explained, “Stability, it’s what people are looking for. Who is going to stay around and who can I trust.” However, most CORs noted that PFP can become a source of community pride:
<disp-quote>
<p>When people know that this food is being grown in their backyard park, it should serve as a source of pride that we have an entity that produces organic and nutritious foods that we can buy in our neighborhood. It’s not the old business model that a lot of African Americans think of “oh [they] come in they open the market and they take the market back out of the community.” (COR 1, African American man, 30-40s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All informants expressed the need to “get the word out” about PFP. They agreed that the old way was best: “word of mouth, fliers, community newsletters, and going door to door.” PFP promotion at community meetings would inform people who will “take it back to their block.” Several organizers also offered to feature PFP’s produce at community events. Observations of farm stands confirmed greater attendance and engagement from community members during the summer season, for which PFP implemented a community marketing campaign using the above channels.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1524839911405849">
<title>PFP Farm Stands: “Fresh” and Convenient</title>
<p>Residents who patronize PFP’s weekly farm stands value healthy eating. Some frequent farmer’s markets or have experience growing food. All were drawn to PFP’s “fresh” or “homegrown” produce that was “picked yesterday” and not “shipped a long ways,” compared with supermarkets where lettuce is “half dead.” Affordability was still an issue since some felt prices were higher at PFP; however, informants praised their convenient locations. Finally, based on observations and interviews, customers desired more variety, such as greens, fruits, and nonproduce items available at other farmer’s markets.</p>

<sec id="section17-1524839911405849" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is one of the first qualitative studies to examine barriers and strategies to produce consumption in a low-income, urban “food desert” populated primarily by African Americans.</p>
<p>Barriers and strategies mentioned by participants paralleled much of the literature on food deserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405849">Lucan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405849">Robinson, 2008</xref>). Price, convenience, tradition, perceived poor taste, and local shortages mirror barriers found in similar communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405849">Zoellner et al., 2010</xref>). Strategies such as creating mentoring opportunities, food demonstrations, and modifying traditional foods appear in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405849">Ahye, Devine, &amp; Odoms-Young, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405849">Robinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405849">Zoellner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study goes beyond previous research by highlighting new, relatively accessible strategies, imparted by community participants themselves, to advance health promotion practice. Although many interventions have focused on increasing the quality and quantity of produce at local retailers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911405849">Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O’Brien, &amp; Glanz, 2008</xref>), these strategies often involve for-profit brick-and-mortar institutions that may prioritize financial sustainability above innovation for health and equity. In contrast, participants mentioned food carts and farm stands, which may have lower capital costs and are more adaptable to evolving preferences. Informants also suggested strategies unrelated to cost that leverage community assets, such as involving community organizations, creating social environments at markets, demonstrating consistency, and initiating word-of-mouth promotion using preexisting diffusers such as block leaders. Furthermore, these strategies reflect how local history can be a resource for salient, innovative approaches.</p>
<p>This study also shows the importance of understanding community perceptions of UFS projects. Compared with community leaders, CRs were much less aware of the project’s existence, pinpointing the need to promote the project beyond organizational partnerships. Residents’ distrust of “outsiders” highlights the need for securing buy-in by advertising their community-focused mission and demonstrating longevity.</p>
<p>Regarding cultural affiliation, participants identified sit-down meals and cooking greens as belonging to their food traditions. At the same time, eating salads and carrots is considered by some as “White,” deterring well-meaning organizers from incorporating them into community events. On the other hand, sugary cereals accrue no such accusations. These findings echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405849">Roy’s (2005)</xref> argument that health promotion efforts should account for the selective permeability of foods into cultural fare, which is often imbued with political meaning, such as solidarity and identity, and influenced by ethnohistory and local economy. If PFP realizes its promise as a source of community pride, residents may someday consider locally grown “White” food as “our” food.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. Because of the recruitment strategy, there was less input from people facing the greatest barriers to access. Future studies should seek to understand how vulnerable subgroups, such as those on entitlements, negotiate access to locally grown produce. Involving CRs as data collectors and analysts could help access these groups and address their concerns.</p>
<p>The present study exhibits several strengths. Multiple methods and populations were included to triangulate findings. By eliciting “thick descriptions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911405849">Geertz, 1973</xref>) in FGDs and IDIs, researchers gathered detailed information to assess the applicability and transferability of findings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Health promotion efforts must use diverse strategies, such as simultaneously focusing on supply and demand of healthy foods, to target the multilevel factors influencing food habits. Farming in low-income urban settings creates an opportunity to explore sustainable and healthy food systems that are equitable and respectful of local culture. This study facilitates these goals through qualitative research methods exploring influences on demand for fresh produce from an UFS project. The community-derived approach outlined above shows how local traditions can be a source of creative, constructive strategies. Further research is needed to clarify issues of access for the most vulnerable community members.</p>
