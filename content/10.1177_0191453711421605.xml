<abstract>
<p>In recent years a growing number of democratic theorists have proposed ways to increase citizen engagement, while channeling those democratic energies in positive directions and away from systematic marginalization, exclusion and intolerance. One novel answer is provided by a strain of democratic theory known as agonistic pluralism, which valorizes adversarial engagement and recognizes the marginalizing tendencies implicit in drives to consensus and stability. However, the divergences between competing variants of agonistic pluralism remain largely underdeveloped or unrecognized. In this article, I address this shortcoming, examining these strains of agonism around the constraints placed upon democratic discourse. I argue that the ‘associative agonism’ of theorists such as Bonnie Honig and William Connolly offers the best means for cultivating virtues necessary to revitalize a contentious democratic politics which also fosters receptivity to pluralism and difference.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Recent democratic theory has devoted significant attention to the question of how to revitalize citizen engagement and reshape citizen involvement within the process of collective political decision-making and self-government. Yet these theorists do so with the sober recognition that more robust democratic engagement may provide new means for domination, exploitation, intensification of disagreement, or even the introduction of fanaticism into our public debates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453711421605">1</xref>
</sup> Thus, numerous proposals have attempted to define the acceptable boundaries of our day-to-day democratic discourse and establish regulative ideals whereby we restrict the types of justifications that can be employed in democratic argumentation. This subtle form of exclusion delineates which forms of democratic discourse are deemed to be <italic>legitimate</italic> – worthy of consideration in the larger democratic community, and morally justifiable as a basis for policy. As an outgrowth of these concerns, this newfound emphasis on political legitimacy has provoked a flurry of scholarly analysis and debate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453711421605">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Different theorists promote divergent conceptions of what ought to count as acceptable and legitimate forms of democratic engagement, and promote more or less stringent normative conceptions of the grounds for exclusion and de-legitimization. One of the most novel approaches to this question is offered by agonistic pluralism, a strain of democratic theory advanced by political theorists such as William Connolly, Bonnie Honig, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe and James Tully. Agonistic pluralism, or simply agonism, is a theory of democracy rooted in the ancient Greek notion of the <italic>agon</italic>, a public struggle or contest between adversaries. While recognizing the necessity of placing restrictions upon democratic discourse, agonistic pluralists also call upon us to guard against the naturalization of such exclusion and the coercive act of power which it implies. Rather, we must treat these actions as contingent, subject to further scrutiny, critique and rearticulation in contentious and widely inclusive democratic spaces.</p>
<p>In so doing, agonistic pluralism offers us a novel means of approaching democratic discourse, receptive to the claims of new actors and identities while also recognizing that there must be some, albeit minimal, restrictions placed on the form that such democratic engagement takes. In short, the goal of agonists is not to ‘eradicate the use of power in social relations but to acknowledge its ineradicable nature and attempt to modify power in ways that are compatible with democratic values’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453711421605">3</xref>
</sup> This is democracy absent the ‘final guarantee’ or the ‘definitive legitimation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453711421605">4</xref>
</sup> As one recent commentator succinctly put it, agonistic pluralism forces democratic actors to ‘relinquish all claims to finality, to happy endings’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453711421605">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet while agonistic pluralism offers valuable insights regarding how we might reshape and revitalize the character of our democratic communities, it is a much more diverse intellectual project than is commonly acknowledged. There are no doubt continuities among these thinkers, yet those engaged in agonistic pluralism ultimately operate with divergent fundamental assumptions, see different processes at work in contemporary democratic politics and aspire towards unique political end-goals. To the extent that we do not recognize these different variants, we risk failing to adequately consider proposals that could positively alter the character of our democratic engagement, enabling us to reframe contemporary pluralism as a positive avenue for social change and inclusion rather than a crisis to be contained.</p>
<p>This article begins by outlining agonistic pluralism’s place within the larger theoretical project of revitalizing democratic practice, centered on the theme of what constitutes ‘legitimate’ democratic discourse. Specifically, I focus on agonism’s place in relation to ‘participatory’ and ‘deliberative’ strains of democratic theory. I then highlight the under-examined diversity of those theorists commonly captured under the heading of agonistic pluralism, drawing upon Chantal Mouffe’s recent distinction between ‘dissociative’ and ‘associative’ agonism. However, I depart from her assertion that ‘associative agonists’ such as Bonnie Honig and William Connolly offer us no means by which to engage in the ‘negative determination of frontiers’ of our political spaces. Contra Mouffe, I defend these theorists as offering the most valuable formulation of agonism, due to their articulation of the civic virtues and democratic (re-)education needed to foster greater inclusivity and openness, while retaining the recognition that democratic discourse must operate with limits and frontiers.</p>

<sec id="section3-0191453711421605">
<title>1 Revitalizing engagement and the legitimacy of democratic claim-making</title>
<p>As was noted at the outset of this article, recent democratic theory has extensively focused on the question of how to restore active citizen participation in political decision-making while both increasing the frequency and changing the character of political engagement. As Bohman and Rehg note, this trend emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by widely held beliefs that government was increasingly beyond the control of citizens and leftist political activism which had generated new interest in participatory models of self-government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453711421605">6</xref>
</sup> Early efforts at revitalizing citizen engagement took the form of broad-based proposals for participatory models of citizen engagement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453711421605">7</xref>
</sup> Participatory democracy seeks political engagement modeled less on pursuit of self-interest and more on face-to-face interaction which seeks commonality, shared interests and consensus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453711421605">8</xref>
</sup> Participatory theorists such as Jane Mansbridge argued against the pervasive trend in western political systems to view conflicting interests as an inevitable fact, blocking potential avenues for non-adversarial political engagement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453711421605">9</xref>
</sup> For participatory democrats, notions of community and shared values lie latent within our political systems, obscured beneath political institutions encouraging only aggregation of individual demands or self-interested trade-offs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453711421605">10</xref>
</sup> If the spaces of politics could be opened to facilitate greater citizen interaction, these long-dormant trends of empathizing with one’s fellows and enlarging one’s perspectives could be recovered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453711421605">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As a result, many participatory democrats stress the creation of institutions allowing greater citizen involvement and control of key institutions within society – most notably the workplace, community governance, or national schemes of public service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453711421605">12</xref>
</sup> In the context of these institutions, participatory democrats promote a popular discourse rooted in a radical form of equality while also grounded in a commitment to the search for commonality and consensus. Furthermore, Barber argues that political discourse in a participatory democracy consists not only of speaking but <italic>listening</italic>. In this context, Barber notes that<disp-quote>
<p>‘I will listen’ means to the strong democrat not that I will scan my adversary’s position for weaknesses and potential trade-offs, nor even … that I will tolerantly permit him to say whatever he chooses. It means rather, ‘I will put myself in his place, I will strain to hear what makes us alike, I will listen for a common rhetoric evocative of a common purpose or a common good.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453711421605">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Thus, discourse in participatory conceptions of democracy is guided by a neo-Rousseauvian ideal of popular sovereignty rooted in the fundamental equality of citizens. Yet in our political discourse (both speaking and listening), the goal is to foster democratic discourse which uncovers commonality – that which unites members of political community, all too often lost within the non-participatory milieu of contemporary large-scale representative democracies.</p>
<p>It is this search for latent unity that is the most significant marker separating participatory democrats from those who deem themselves ‘deliberative democrats’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453711421605">14</xref>
</sup> Deliberative democratic theorists share their fears regarding the impoverished state of modern democratic decision-making and the character of the modern citizen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453711421605">15</xref>
</sup> In keeping with participatory democracy, deliberative theorists often accompany their accounts of modern democratic shortcomings with proposals designed to redistribute society’s resources so as to expand civic education.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0191453711421605">16</xref>
</sup> On one level then, deliberative democratic theory simply argues that we need to closely scrutinize and refine the processes and procedures by which citizens exchange politically relevant information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453711421605">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet deliberative democrats strikingly diverge from participatory democrats in their concern with the moral disagreement and intense pluralism that characterize modern societies. Contrary to participatory democrats, deliberative democrats argue that these deep fault-lines are <italic>not</italic> simply due to a lack of institutions designed to foster a shared moral sense or conception of the good. Rather as John Rawls states, ‘the diversity of reasonable comprehensive religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines found in modern democratic societies is not a mere historical condition that may soon pass away’, but a ‘permanent feature of the public culture of democracy’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453711421605">18</xref>
</sup> In light of this, Gutmann and Thompson write: ‘[A] fundamental problem confronting all democratic theorists is to find a morally justifiable way of making binding collective decisions in the face of continuing moral conflict.’ <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0191453711421605">19</xref>
</sup> For many deliberative theorists, this becomes a question of what types of discourse and justification can possibly legitimate democratic decision-making amid such deep pluralism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453711421605">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In order to understand deliberative democracy’s approach to reshaping democratic engagement in contemporary societies, we must first turn to John Rawls’ work on public reason, emerging from his theory of political liberalism. As James Bohman has noted, in ‘whatever form [deliberative democracy] takes, it must refer to the ideal of public reason’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453711421605">21</xref>
</sup> For Rawls, political legitimacy, at least in dealing with questions of basic justice and constitutional essentials, must be justifiable ‘in ways that all citizens can publicly endorse in light of their own reason’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453711421605">22</xref>
</sup> Recognizing that democratic arguments are ultimately attempts to marshal the power of the state, Rawls claims that anything short of a universal rational justification for such coercion will be an act of oppression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453711421605">23</xref>
</sup> Thus, he argues that democratic arguments must adhere to the ‘criterion of reciprocity’, where ‘our exercise of political power is proper only when we sincerely believe that the reasons we offer for our political action may reasonably be accepted by other citizens as a justification of those actions’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453711421605">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The content of such justifications is what Rawls refers to as ‘public reason’, where citizens deliberate ‘within a framework of what they believe to be the most reasonable conception of justice, a conception that expresses political values that others, as free and equal citizens, might also reasonably be expected to endorse’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453711421605">25</xref>
</sup> Citizens exercise public reason in the limited sense that they fulfill a ‘duty of civility’, holding their decision-makers to these standards of political justification while rejecting those who do not adhere to public reason.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453711421605">26</xref>
</sup> For Rawls then, the boundaries of legitimate democratic discourse and engagement are shaped by the extent to which we believe that our justifications could be reasonably accepted by other citizens.</p>
<p>Similarly to Rawls, Jürgen Habermas assumes that modern democratic societies lack an over-arching metaphysical framework by which to legitimate political power and provide the basic structure for our political discourse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453711421605">27</xref>
</sup> Habermas writes that his theory of discourse ethics is rooted in the principle of universalization, in which<disp-quote>
<p>… everyone is required to take the perspective of everyone else, and thus project herself into the understanding of self and world of all others; from this interlocking of perspectives there emerges an ideally extended we-perspective from which all can test in common whether they wish to make a controversial norm the basis of their shared practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0191453711421605">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Thus, Habermas’ democratic theory, rooted in discourse ethics, ‘shifts the frame of reference from Kant’s solitary, reflecting moral consciousness to the community of moral subjects in dialogue’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0191453711421605">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Unlike Rawls’, Habermas’ approach to the radical pluralism of modern democratic societies focuses ‘exclusively on the procedural aspects of the public use of reason … leav[ing] more questions open because it entrusts more to the <italic>process</italic> of rational opinion and will formation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0191453711421605">30</xref>
</sup> Habermas also shifts the focus from Rawls’ criterion of reciprocity, where <italic>individuals</italic> frame their exercises of political power on the basis of reasons that they sincerely believe others could reasonably accept, to a communicative process of <italic>mutual</italic> dialogical perspective-taking. For Habermas, the validity of the norms and rules which frame our social world cannot be established privately, but is rooted in the communicative process by which we offer claims to others and evaluate, from the ‘extended we-perspective’, the moral, ethical and practical implications of the norms such claims would instantiate. Contra Rawls, Habermas argues against bracketing the <italic>substantive content</italic> of our public political justifications; the level of convergence among competing views stems from the rules governing the underlying discursive <italic>procedure.</italic> This is due to the fact that, for Habermas, ‘rationality is … a question, not of the possession of knowledge, but of the way in which language is used; rationality is procedural’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0191453711421605">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Habermas’ procedural understanding of rationality also problematizes the Rawlsian conception of public and non-public uses of reason. Such a distinction is problematic on at least two levels for Habermas. First, Rawls’ restrictive distinction between public and private constrains civil society in its ability to ‘steer’ formal political institutions towards more legitimate democratic decisions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0191453711421605">32</xref>
</sup> Second, Habermas notes that this is a difficult dichotomy as the public and private domains have always had a historically ‘shifting boundary’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0191453711421605">33</xref>
</sup> Rawls assigns non-public reasons to civil society or ‘background culture’. In these settings, the stringent criterion of reciprocity is relaxed, owing to the venues of which civil society is comprised (churches, universities and other private associations) allowing free exit and entry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0191453711421605">34</xref>
</sup> Rawls argues that such freedom of entry and exit does not characterize one’s membership in the state and here there is a sense in which we cannot escape the state’s coercive political power. Yet for Habermas, in so doing, Rawls has delimited civil society as ‘a prepolitical domain … which is withdrawn from the reach of democratic self-legislation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0191453711421605">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Other thinkers extend upon the intellectual framework provided by Rawls and Habermas to advance alternative conceptions of legitimate democratic discourse. For instance, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson put forth an account of deliberation under ‘non-ideal’ conditions to illuminate how we deal with deep and persistent moral disagreement, even after all deliberative avenues have been exhausted – which they call ‘deliberative disagreement’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0191453711421605">36</xref>
</sup> Rather than seeking agreement, Gutmann and Thompson argue the democratic discourse ought to be geared towards <italic>accommodation</italic> under conditions of ‘civic integrity’ (avoiding the strategic use of speech) and ‘civic magnanimity’ (remaining open-minded and cognizant of the gravity of the issue at stake for all parties).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0191453711421605">37</xref>
</sup> While this may not produce consensus on the most divisive issues which pluralistic societies face, Gutmann and Thompson nevertheless retain the faith that principles of accommodation and a sense of reciprocity will ultimately enable citizens to ‘work together [despite their moral disagreement] in a mode of mutual respect’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0191453711421605">38</xref>
</sup> While shifting the goal from consensus to mutual accommodation, Gutmann and Thompson nevertheless retain the hope that we can ‘agree to disagree’ on those issues which produce the greatest societal discord.</p>
<p>James Bohman feels that Rawls’ use of public reason as a regulative ideal on our democratic engagement ultimately leaves us with very little basis for robust democratic practice. The solution, as he sees it, lies in ‘pluralizing’ public reason and denying that a single ‘public standpoint’ exists by which to negotiate deep conflicts in pluralist democracies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0191453711421605">39</xref>
</sup> While Rawls argues that the limits of public reason may force us to remove certain debates and questions from the public setting at the outset, Bohman argues that Rawls’ ‘method of avoidance’ neither resolves the underlying issues nor opens up the democratic space for such debates to occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0191453711421605">40</xref>
</sup> Echoing Habermas, Bohman notes that in many historical instances, those protesting social injustice did so publicly by rendering problematic the prevailing conceptions of what sort of debates could take place within the public sphere – in short, ‘the character of political life itself’, and ‘the meaning and scope of accepted political values’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0191453711421605">41</xref>
</sup> Thus, in Bohman’s account, ‘convergence’ is rejected and democratic legitimacy is tied to the extent to which institutions leave open the possibility for negotiation by political equals as to what our political values and public reasons ought to be.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0191453711421605">42</xref>
</sup> This requires a willingness to allow divergent viewpoints with regard to our public reasons, as well as a sustained commitment to the process by which they are determined. In addition it requires a willingness on the part of individual citizens to amend their ideas of legitimate constraints upon democratic discourse in light of their democratic engagement and interaction with others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0191453711421605">43</xref>
</sup> Thus, Bohman’s conception of democratic legitimacy is rooted in the idea that reasons given by citizens ‘are convincing enough to motivate each citizen, even a dissenter, to continue to cooperate in deliberation even after the decision has been made’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0191453711421605">44</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>John Dryzek asserts that democratic legitimacy can be maintained by determining whether a given policy represents the provisional ‘constellation of discourses’ operative within a Habermasian conception of the public sphere.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0191453711421605">45</xref>
</sup> Thus, deliberation can occur at a distance from the <italic>locus</italic> of collective decision-making, provided that the eventual policy outcome reflects the relative weights of various discourses to be found within a broader conception of the public sphere. Dryzek also warns that when deliberation in deeply divided societies is situated too closely to the decision-making apparatus, it risks becoming a contest for sovereign authority, where conflicting identities are ‘frozen’ into institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0191453711421605">46</xref>
</sup> Dryzek situates our democratic interaction here because it is most likely to ‘induce reflection upon preferences in [a] non-coercive fashion’, his condition for legitimacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0191453711421605">47</xref>
</sup> Dryzek’s notion of deliberation is dispersed and decentralized, and in his own view <italic>needs</italic> to be so, as accepting the confinement of ‘formal institutions of state or the constitutional surface of political life … means accepting a needlessly thin conception of democracy and a needlessly tenuous account of deliberative legitimacy’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0191453711421605">48</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While deliberative democratic theory is a diverse and variegated approach to political engagement, the prominent accounts addressed above share a desire to justify the collectively binding political decisions under which we are expected to live together and construct a discourse by which we legitimate them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0191453711421605">49</xref>
</sup> Modern societies are characterized by deep disagreement on a multidimensional range of issues, stemming from ‘diversity in the domains of creed, sensual disposition, gender practice, household organization, ethnic identification, first language, and fundamental existential orientations’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0191453711421605">50</xref>
</sup> These are divisive issues precisely because, for partisans involved in these debates, there is often very little room to ‘split the difference’ – any deviation from their desired policy outcome is viewed as a complete repudiation of not only their interests, but their identity and consequential, personally held conceptions of the good. The nightmare scenario that threatens us, according to deliberative democrats, is one of ‘endless conflict of competing transcendent visions of the good’ and where democratic decision-making is rooted solely in coercion, giving us only the thinnest sense of legitimacy.<sup>

<title>2 Agonism’s critical response to participatory and deliberative democracy</title>
<p>Before examining how agonistic pluralism responds to these reconceptualizations of democratic engagement, let us first examine the characteristics agonistic pluralist thinkers share. First, agonistic thinkers are hesitant to place any aspect of our shared political lives beyond the contentious terrain of a radically democratic politics, and are equally wary of the invocation of under-scrutinized notions of ‘public interest’ and the ‘common good’. Like interest group pluralists before them, agonists seek to harness the discord and tumult of social and political life. Agonism calls upon us to resist, ‘confin[ing] politics (conceptually and territorially) to the juridical, administrative, or regulative tasks of stabilizing moral and political subjects, building consensus, maintaining agreements, or consolidating communities and identities’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0191453711421605">52</xref>
</sup> Similarly, nearly all agonists advance ‘the recovery of a strong participatory idea of citizenship’, albeit one that does not abandon the liberal emphasis on individual liberty, as the antidote to citizenship’s reduction to a stable, fixed and uncontested status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0191453711421605">53</xref>
</sup> This view is based upon an understanding of politics that recognizes the constructive role of contentious democratic engagement while remaining acutely attentive to the social and cultural interdependence of identities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0191453711421605">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>From an agonistic perspective, much within the attempts to revitalize democratic engagement examined is incomplete or deficient. As was noted, participatory democratic projects seek to uncover latent sources of unity and commonality, yet an agonistic lens reveals this as a subtly hegemonic undertaking which seeks the <italic>taming</italic> of democratic energies rather than the re-vitalization of democracy. A post-conflictual politics of the community constitutes an illusion, rooted in the idea that a universally shared conception of the good exists, carrying the desire for a ‘reconciled society where pluralism would have been superceded’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0191453711421605">55</xref>
</sup> Such unity blunts the diversity necessary to sustain a vibrant and contentious democratic community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0191453711421605">56</xref>
</sup> Thus, the founding moment of such a democracy would also be the moment of its disintegration. The participatory conceptions of democracy insofar as they promote allegedly shared characteristics of community, actually negate the possibility of a politics receptive to modern pluralism – responsive to the claims of hitherto unrecognized and marginalized identities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the standpoint of agonistic pluralism, our contemporary condition of deep pluralism is not simply a problem to be ‘dealt with’ or ‘overcome’ via the proper deliberative or discursive set of procedures. This stands in stark opposition to the overriding concern which animates many deliberative democratic theories. Agonism views difference as an axiological principle of our collective lives without which we could not speak of ‘the political’ – defined by Mouffe as an inherently conflictual confrontation between a ‘we’ and a ‘they’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0191453711421605">57</xref>
</sup> Agonism shifts the focus, from arriving at a concrete decision, to ‘allow[ing] participants to express their own terms, albeit within the boundaries of civility’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0191453711421605">58</xref>
</sup> Within such a setting, democratic compromise remains possible, yet this should be viewed as a temporary respite in an ongoing confrontation, rather than a post-conflictual consensus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0191453711421605">59</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Agonists generally agree that the goal of democratic spaces should not be the reduction of our democratic discourse to that upon which we could all agree, or, in less restrictive deliberative variants, to that which is accorded universal respect. Rather, the political is conceived of in terms of performative spaces in which potentially threatening confrontations between conflicting parties persist, yet are channeled in accordance with liberal democratic values of equality and liberty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0191453711421605">60</xref>
</sup> In light of this, agonism ‘allows dissent to remain open by reconfirming the provisionality of all political decisions and judgments … thereby implicating diverse adversaries in an ongoing need to pay attention to each other and the world they have in common’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0191453711421605">61</xref>
</sup> The task becomes to embrace and welcome the contemporary eruption of difference, and to expand the register by which claims on behalf of difference can be voiced.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0191453711421605">62</xref>
</sup> In an agonistic conception of democratic engagement, Goi notes that<disp-quote>
<p>… by appearing before one another on their own terms – using self-description and modes of expression that are not limited by the bounds of public reason, actors can be heard and seen and therefore can feel that they are recognized in the specificity of their identity as members of the polity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0191453711421605">63</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Thus, from an agonistic perspective there are reasons to be wary of deliberative democracy’s tendency to view deep pluralism as ‘problematic’, as well as the goal of designing deliberative institutions, and placing restrictions on democratic discourse which, ‘to the extent that they were successful, [would] make any further political struggle, contestation or engagement unnecessary’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0191453711421605">64</xref>
</sup> Agonism, to the extent that it represents a unified endeavor, is an attempt to ‘pluralize’ modern pluralism, and bring such difference to the forefront of a radically engaged and contentious democratic discourse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0191453711421605">65</xref>
</sup> Approaches designed to revitalize democratic engagement such as those discussed above are said to ‘[remain] too stingy, cramped, and defensive for the world we now inhabit’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0191453711421605">66</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Agonistic pluralism has generated a great deal of interest among democratic theorists, in no small part due to its emphasis on the need for ongoing contestation and its attempts to ‘augment rather than oppose liberal democratic projects of consensus building and administration’, simultaneously utilizing postmodern intellectual resources, while keeping one foot firmly in the traditional liberal terrain of equality and liberty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0191453711421605">67</xref>
</sup> While one should hesitate to consider agonism as a ‘corrective’ to liberal democracy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0191453711421605">68</xref>
</sup> it does speak directly to many now well-established critiques of liberal democratic theory’s hostility to difference and provide us with a theoretical means by which to address them. Furthermore, agonism opens up possibilities for a democratic discourse informed by principles of fallibility and contestability, which the deliberative democratic projects addressed above either explicitly or implicitly tend to undermine. However, agonists’ shared concern with preserving space for a contentious, inclusive and open-ended political discourse ought not to obscure their internal theoretical divergences and debates. Understanding the potential value of agonistic pluralism in reshaping democratic engagement is contingent upon recognizing its internal diversity, an issue I take up below.</p>

<title>III The false unity of agonistic pluralism</title>
<p>While agonistic pluralism may possess certain shared underlying themes, particularly when juxtaposed with deliberative and participatory conceptions of democracy, it is nevertheless a complex, tentaculate approach to the political. Existing critiques of agonism often exhibit one of two tendencies – (1) attributing a false unity to agonistic pluralism treating it as a singular entity, or (2) selecting a single thinker from within the tradition to make representative of agonism as a whole.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0191453711421605">69</xref>
</sup> Agonistic pluralism does not constitute a theoretical unity, nor does it adhere to a single project, a shared set of goals, or operate with a set of widely held internal assumptions about the nature of the political. Yet in order for agonistic principles to fashion a contentious politics which remains receptive to new articulations of difference, we must first understand the complexity of this theoretical terrain as well as which strains of agonistic theory hold the most promise in relation to this larger goal.</p>
<p>Thus, let us turn to Chantal Mouffe’s recent account of the different variants of agonistic pluralism to begin to make sense of this diversity within agonism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0191453711421605">70</xref>
</sup> As mentioned at the outset of this article, Mouffe makes a distinction between <italic>associative</italic> agonistic pluralism, where she places thinkers such as Hannah Arendt, William Connolly and Bonnie Honig, and <italic>dissociative</italic> agonistic pluralism, of which she considers herself an exemplar. Mouffe characterizes associative agonism as a strain of democratic pluralism committed to public deliberation and radical freedom, viewing the political as a realm in which the struggle to destabilize and de-center our settled conceptions of identity takes place. Associative agonism shares its ‘family resemblance’ to Mouffe’s agonism in that it seeks to move politics beyond a space in which institutions merely aggregate pre-political interests. In addition, both strains seek to move beyond a deliberative politics which appeals to notions of communicative consensus, public reason, or reciprocity in order to soften deep moral disagreement. Associative agonists join Mouffe in calling for the principles which inform the prevailing political order to be made ‘contestable, changeable, accountable’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0191453711421605">71</xref>
</sup> They share Mouffe’s dismissal that questions related to mediation between competing democratic claims could eventually be placed on some higher, unchallenged plane beyond the ebb and flow of a contentious and contingent realm of <italic>political</italic> articulation.</p>
<p>However, Mouffe critiques the associative conception in a number of different respects, ultimately claiming that it is insufficient to radicalize contemporary democratic politics. Mouffe claims that associative agonists, particularly Bonnie Honig, devote great attention to preventing the closure of debate and keeping identities, institutions and practices open to challenge and disruption. However, for Mouffe, not nearly enough time is devoted to articulating a positive programmatic alternative, avoiding the larger and more thorny issue of ‘what is to be done’ within the context of that freedom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0191453711421605">72</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Equally problematic for Mouffe is the tendency she sees within William Connolly’s work to evade determining what is deemed legitimate and worthy of respect in the context of agonistic struggle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0191453711421605">73</xref>
</sup> Connolly’s idealized vision of political engagement is an agonistic and contentious relation in which ‘each also appreciates the comparative contestability of its own fundaments to others’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0191453711421605">74</xref>
</sup> Like Wenman<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0191453711421605">75</xref>
</sup> before her, Mouffe argues that Connolly provides us no guidance with regard to what democratic demands are to be legitimately excluded within an agonistic political framework nor does he explain how we are to confront those who simply refuse to exhibit the virtues of forbearance and reflexivity associated with agonistic respect.</p>
<p>For Mouffe, politics is always characterized by the need for the negative determination of frontiers, those decisionistic political moments which determine the ‘we’ and the ‘they’ of politics. However, by Mouffe’s reading, at no point within Connolly’s body of work, or the associative framework more generally, do we find an acknowledgement of the need for such a moment of exclusion. This is a failing which dooms the associative agonistic approach in her eyes. The hegemonic space periodically disturbed by agonism’s valorization of multiplicity and contestability must eventually be filled by <italic>something</italic>. Associative agonism, by Mouffe’s reading, seems unwilling or unable to tell us what that something might be – a framework completely incapable of setting limits to democratic discourse and establishing standards for legitimacy. Associative agonists are said to have faith in a political world which resides permanently in flux, and in which individuals paradoxically straddle fundamentally competing worldviews, and revel in the incomprehensible multiplicity of it all. She argues: ‘[T]he incapacity to accept and acknowledge the moment of decision is the necessary consequence of the associative paradigm.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0191453711421605">76</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Against the associative agonistic conception of the political, Mouffe articulates her <italic>dissociative</italic> vision. Through Mouffe’s eyes, the goal of an agonistic politics is to radicalize the prevailing liberal democratic paradigm, an achievement which cannot depend on destabilization and disturbances alone. The crucial element lacking in associative agonism is the creation of a ‘chain of equivalence’ whereby variegated democratic demands that challenge the existing order congeal into a common cause, rearticulate the spaces of politics, and struggle for hegemony through vibrant and contentious agonistic exchange.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0191453711421605">77</xref>
</sup> It is in this context that Mouffe establishes her own positive vision of embracing the ineradicably conflictual character of contemporary politics while resisting attempts to deny or smooth over that conflict, such as the ‘Third Way’ or cosmopolitan conceptions of a harmonious global order, while retaining a thin notion of commonality which enables a politics of ‘adversaries’ rather than ‘enemies’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0191453711421605">78</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While Mouffe’s dissociative-associative framework offers considerable promise for making sense of divisions within agonistic democratic theory, her treatment of associative agonism is superficial and risks overlooking the associative agonism’s significant potential for fostering radical democratic engagement, receptive to new articulations of identity and difference. Furthermore, her argument that associative agonism gives us little guidance in how to instantiate an agonistic ethos within an institutional political framework is hardly a shortcoming of associative agonism alone. This is a critique that has been leveled against nearly <italic>all</italic> existing articulations of agonism,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0191453711421605">79</xref>
</sup> and perhaps all theories that place their emphasis on the <italic>process</italic> of politics, rather than its eventual outcomes or the proper institutional framework by which to achieve such outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0191453711421605">80</xref>
</sup> In the section that follows, I examine associative agonism’s attempts to structure discordant pluralism in positive directions, arguing that it does not lead us to the dismissive set of conclusions which Mouffe ultimately draws. In the conclusion, I offer my thoughts on the potential of associative agonism to form the basis of a practical project designed to reshape a citizen’s political engagement.</p>

<title>1 ‘Associative agonism’ and democratic engagement</title>
<p>While dissociative agonism tends to focus on the ineradicability of power relations in democratic life as well as the enduring presence of hegemony within the political, associative agonism subtly shifts the emphasis. Contra Mouffe and others, associative agonism <italic>does</italic> accept that there will be limits to pluralism – i.e. there will be identities, practices and democratic discourse which will have to be excluded from politics – yet they ‘<italic>insist that we often do not know with assurance what those limits will be</italic>’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0191453711421605">81</xref>
</sup> Thus, the focus shifts from the ineradicability of limits to a focus on how we negotiate difference, multiplicity and plurality. Due to this, associative agonists tend to advance a much more demanding set of agonistic virtues than the dissociative agonists. Through these virtues, we are to address the paradoxical fact that, though radical difference is unsettling and may provoke resentment, it is the very means through which we constitute our own identity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while recognizing that the ‘identities and identifications’ we bring to political life ‘are not stable’, associative agonism recognizes that ‘in the absence of resistance to them, they could be stabilized’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0191453711421605">82</xref>
</sup> The task becomes to create agonistic spaces in which <italic>we</italic> define our own identity, <italic>we</italic> craft our own subjectivity. Associative agonists recognize that such an untethered and performative political arena involves a certain trust that contentious negotiation of difference does not devolve into chaos, violence and conflict. Above all, the associative agonistic conception seeks to imbue in agonistic citizens an ‘openness to listen to those who appear to us to be unreasonable’ while retaining a ‘willingness to question what counts as reasonable speech’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0191453711421605">83</xref>
</sup> The means by which this can be accomplished in our current political, cultural and social milieu is the defining focus of associative agonistic theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0191453711421605">
<title>2 Associative agonism: William E. Connolly and the ethos of pluralization</title>
<p>Turning first to the agonism of William Connolly, his starting point is the proposition that ‘nature contains diverse energies and forces that exceed attempts to organize it’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0191453711421605">84</xref>
</sup> That is to say, the superabundance of life will always exceed our attempts to subdue its vast difference and variety in the form of stable and enduring identities. As Wenman notes, for Connolly, ‘pluralism never simply <italic>is</italic>, because in the multifarious struggles for self-making, new forms of social and cultural identity are always coming into being’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0191453711421605">85</xref>
</sup> The problem he finds with many existing approaches to democracy is that pluralism is frequently ‘presented as an achievement to be protected, while the eruption of new drives to <italic>pluralization</italic> are often presented as perils to this achievement’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0191453711421605">86</xref>
</sup> Pluralization entails ‘a respect for the persistent diversity of the human condition’, what Connolly calls a ‘bicameral orientation’ towards <italic>new</italic> articulations of difference, manifested in a willingness to engage diverse others as they advance that articulation in the public realm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0191453711421605">87</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this vein, Connolly sees the goal of political engagement as securing a positive ‘ethos of engagement’ in relation to popular movements which alter existing assumptions, that is, a positive attitude towards attempts at pluralization. Connolly suggests we do so through the cultivation of two essential virtues: agonistic respect and critical responsiveness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0191453711421605">88</xref>
</sup> Agonistic respect is defined as a situation whereby each political actor arrives at an appreciation for the fact that his or her own self-definition is bound with that of others, as well as recognition of the degree to which each of these projections is profoundly contestable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0191453711421605">89</xref>
</sup> While Connolly notes that agonistic respect is a ‘kissing cousin’ of liberal tolerance, he distinguishes it by saying that the latter typically carries ‘the onus of being at the mercy of a putative majority that often construes its own position to be beyond question’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0191453711421605">90</xref>
</sup> Thus, agonistic respect is a reciprocal democratic virtue meant to operate across relations of difference, and Connolly deploys it as a regulative ideal for the creation of agonistic democratic spaces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0191453711421605">91</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In a somewhat related way, the virtue of ‘critical responsiveness’ also attempts to move beyond liberal tolerance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0191453711421605">92</xref>
</sup> Critical responsiveness entails ‘<italic>careful listening</italic> and <italic>presumptive generosity</italic> to constituencies struggling to move from an obscure or degraded subsistence below the field of recognition, justice, obligation, rights, or legitimacy to a place on one or more of those registers’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0191453711421605">93</xref>
</sup> Critical responsiveness is <italic>not</italic> pity, charity, or paternalism but implies an enhanced degree of concern for others, driven by the cultivation of reciprocal empathic concern for that which you are not.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0191453711421605">94</xref>
</sup> This attitude cannot be developed in an abstract relation to these new and existing forms of radical cultural, political, religious and philosophical difference. Critical responsiveness above all requires that one ‘get[s] a whiff of experiences heretofore alien to [us]’, recognizing that while this may be unsettling or cause discomfort, direct engagement is the means by which you ‘work tactically on yourself and others to overcome existential resentment of this persistent condition of human being’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0191453711421605">95</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Critics of Connolly charge that he offers a mode of political discourse without frontiers, devoting inadequate attention to issues of <italic>exclusion</italic> and the <italic>limits</italic> of pluralism and offering no mechanism to deal with those who reject an invitation to engage in the empathic, reciprocal presumptive generosity which he promotes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0191453711421605">96</xref>
</sup> Thiele goes so far as to accuse Connolly of ‘flee[ing] the human condition and the hard choices of politics by means of literary fabrication coupled with a flippant iconoclasm and rootlessness’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0191453711421605">97</xref>
</sup> While Connolly has not been completely silent, he does suggest that a commitment to the radical democratic engagement within the pluralistic political community can emerge organically. He notes that it generally takes massive campaigns to turn people against pluralism and to enforce a monistic conception of identity and the political community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0191453711421605">98</xref>
</sup> Connolly acknowledges that cultivating an ethos of pluralization will be a challenge, yet he is reluctant to posit that this ought to be achieved via a ‘top-down’ model of ‘instruction’. The formation of this type of commitment will occur through ‘multiple links of partial <italic>connection</italic>, issuing in something closer to a network than a vanguard party’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0191453711421605">99</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, Connolly argues that individuals will over time develop an attraction to the agenda of pluralization as it ‘gives expression to a fugitive element of care … secures specific faiths against persecution … [and] offers the best opportunity to coexist without violence while supporting the civic conditions of common governance’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0191453711421605">100</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Contrary to his critics, Connolly does not promote a postmodern politics of permanent disruption and destabilization. Nor does he urge us to celebrate a political realm devoid of any stable meaning or purpose. He states this explicitly saying: ‘I do not think … that in a culture of robust pluralism everyone must accept the fundamental “contingency” of things … the appreciation of contestability, not universal acceptance of contingency, sets a key condition of pluralism and pluralization.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0191453711421605">101</xref>
</sup> Thus, Connolly’s agonistic theory ultimately does not force us to reject the possibility of enduring meaning and points of stabilization as such, but only to hold on to the suspicion that <italic>our</italic> meaning, the way <italic>we</italic> make sense of the world, may be incomplete or subject to revision. Even in his earliest articulations of agonistic pluralism, Connolly acknowledged that its most expansive articulations still must retain boundaries and exclusions which, while remaining willing to accept ‘fundamentalisms that insist what they are is true, intrinsic, and self-sufficient’, would not allow them ‘to impose themselves too actively upon other segments of the order’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0191453711421605">102</xref>
</sup> In more recent work, Connolly has argued that such imposition at some point requires a ‘militant assemblage of pluralists’ which ‘coalesces’ to resist an anti-pluralist onslaught.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0191453711421605">103</xref>
</sup> Thus, Connolly retains the notion of frontiers, limits and boundaries to our democratic discourse, even within a theory which recognizes the need to continuously interrogate these restrictions.</p>

<sec id="section9-0191453711421605">
<title>3 Associative agonism: Bonnie Honig and the politics of the ‘remainder’</title>
<p>Much like Connolly’s, Bonnie Honig’s agonistic theory devotes special attention to those moments in which ‘new identities may be allowed or ushered onto the threshold of justice’, and calls upon us to remain attentive to their emergent democratic demands and rights-claims, though we may experience them in the moment as ‘fragile, contingent, and paradoxical’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0191453711421605">104</xref>
</sup> Honig is critical of the tendency within political theory to be ‘hostile to the disruptions of politics’ and to ‘converge in the assumption that success lies in the elimination from a regime of dissonance’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0191453711421605">105</xref>
</sup> For Honig, the political must not privilege a single type of experience – that is, we should not focus on settlement <italic>at the expense of</italic> unsettlement. Honig writes, such tendencies tend ‘to displace politics, to deny the effects of power in some of life’s arenas for the sake of the perceived goods that power stabilizes under the guise of knowledge, respect, rationality, cognition, nature, or the public–private distinction itself’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0191453711421605">106</xref>
</sup> Honig labels this theoretical desire for foundations and closure, ‘virtue theories’ of politics, and associates its use with Kant, Rawls and Michael Sandel. She argues that ‘virtue theorists of politics’</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… assume that the world and the self are not resistant to, but only enabled and completed by, their favored conceptions of order and subjectivity. This assumption undergirds their belief that modern disenchantment, alienation, pain, and cruelty would be diminished if only we adopted their principles of right, established just institutions whose fairness is ascertainable from a particular (rational) perspective, or yielded to the truth of membership in a wider community of meaning and value.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0191453711421605">107</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>In contrast, ‘virtù theorists’ adopt an ethical perspective that calls attention to the ‘remainders’ of such a system, ‘to the insistences, cruelties, deceits, [and] inconsistencies of virtue as a system of value’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0191453711421605">108</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, Honig is careful to point out that her agonistic theory is not simply an argument for virtù theory. Rather the task is to move <italic>beyond</italic> the virtù/virtue opposition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0191453711421605">109</xref>
</sup> While Honig at times faces the charge that her theory merely advances a politics of constant decentering, most notably from Mouffe, she, like Connolly, accepts that political discourse requires points of stabilization. However, she argues that we stabilize while remaining sensitive to the ways in which the crystallization of what is deemed legitimate engenders ‘remainders’, even while consolidating the fragile gains of marginalized identities that ‘presuppose and claim already to inhabit a world not yet built’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0191453711421605">110</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Towards this end, her agonistic conception of politics suggests that nothing should be treated as being beyond the realm of critical scrutiny; nothing remains outside the realm of democratic renegotiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0191453711421605">111</xref>
</sup> For it is in the absence of critical examination of these remainders, that we risk misinterpreting the ambiguity and contingency in which the principles of our political engagement reside. In short, we risk removing from our laws, institutions and practices ‘all doubts and reservations, all ambivalences, all remnants of power and arbitrariness’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0191453711421605">112</xref>
</sup> We fictively construct political lives which are ‘neat and easy’, driven by the inertial propulsion of an unquestioned and unquestionable moment of founding. The goal of democratic engagement, in her view, is to<disp-quote>
<p>… investigate constitutional democracies’ tendency to paper over moments of alienation they might otherwise engage and to translate the emergence of new world-building powers and agencies into rights claims that can be adjudicated positively or negatively within an existing economy of rights and liberties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0191453711421605">113</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Moving beyond the virtù/virtue divide need not entail abandoning political foundations, but investigating how those foundations are always already inhabited by a capacity to marginalize.</p>
<p>In this way, Honig departs slightly from the associative agonistic approach offered by Connolly. While Connolly’s call for agonistic respect and critical responsiveness translates into a critical and reflexive self-examination, Honig makes a somewhat different appeal. Her theory no doubt entails self-examination of the ways in which one confronts the Other, yet the primary focus seems much more on interrogating the fundaments of the existing political order. Honig calls upon us to engage ‘disruptions’ and ‘remainders’ not through the lens of a ‘problem to be solved’, but rather by asking what problems these disruptions solve for the existing order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0191453711421605">114</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Thus, Honig roots the legitimacy of democratic discourse in the extent to which it engages the political imagination. We garner allegiance to the political community and reinvigorate engagement by altering the manner in which we ‘read’ the narratives of our political lives. Honig is arguing against the prevalent trend to situate our conceptions of democracy in relation to existing realities. Within these theories, the ‘problem of democratic theory is how to find the right match between a people and its law, a state and its institutions. Obstacles are met and overcome, eventually the right match is made and the newlywed couple is sent on its way to try and live happily ever after.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0191453711421605">115</xref>
</sup> While this contemporary understanding of our role as democratic citizens superficially constructs a notion of legitimacy, Honig calls upon us to recognize that it is not without its shortcomings. This is due to the fact that it can render ‘(in)visible the organization of pervasive, indeterminate social crises into particular, concrete, positive and negative engagements between an “us” and a “them”’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0191453711421605">116</xref>
</sup> Honig’s associative agonistic conception thus directly undermines and problematizes the concrete oppositional character of the dissociative conception advanced by Mouffe or Ernesto Laclau.<sup>

</sup> For it is by such a reading, Honig claims, that we too easily project the indeterminacy and tragedy of modern political life outwards onto an externalized ‘other’.</p>
<p>An alternative mode of ‘reading’ the political, and one more suited to fostering a broad commitment to a contentious politics of agonism, would be to consider the externalized other’s role in consolidating the existing order. Honig argues that it is through these types of reinterpretation that we can dampen the ‘refusal of ambivalence’ which renders new identities and new democratic demands so problematic for the existing democratic order. Legitimating democratic engagement in a deeply pluralistic democratic society involves the recognition that passionate attachment can exist alongside a deep and justifiable fear of those who destabilize the object of attachment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0191453711421605">118</xref>
</sup> It is only when we broaden our reading of the contemporary condition that we can ‘rescript’ the relation between our political foundations and those who challenge them. Furthermore, while Honig recognizes that this alternative framework will require the ‘arts of the self’ and ‘ethico-political virtues of respect and generosity’ which Connolly outlines in his work, the primary emphasis in her work seems to be the effect of such disturbances on our political foundations. Honig’s work investigates how ‘each new emergent claim can be experienced as an emergency by the existing order’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0191453711421605">119</xref>
</sup> However, contra Connolly, a condition of respect towards difference is said to emerge only <italic>after</italic> we revise the means by which we read and interpret our political foundations. The more promising avenue is to approach difference and identity as an affirmation of ‘the inescapability of conflict and the ineradicability of resistance to the political and moral projects of ordering subjects, institutions, and values’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0191453711421605">120</xref>
</sup> Contemporary pluralism upsets the liberal democratic hope of a diverse order which remains governable, ‘dreams of home’, as Honig eloquently puts it. Yet in so doing, pluralism and difference inject static political systems with the disruptions necessary to be receptive to new articulations of difference, democratic demands and modes of agency.</p>

<title>V Conclusion: the promise of associative agonism</title>
<p>The strains of agonistic pluralism examined above offer the philosophical basis for a more contentious and diverse form of democratic engagement than previous articulations of participatory or deliberative democracy. Agonism offers us a politics unbound by finality, elusive notions of unity, as well as excessive constraints placed upon legitimate democratic discourse in their predecessors. Mouffe claims that associative agonists seek a politics of permanent disruption and decentering while saying nothing regarding the necessity of ‘frontiers’ in politics, i.e. who ought to be excluded from the political, and on what basis. Because of its alleged inability to exclude or place limits on its radical pluralism, Mouffe then concludes that associative agonism is unable to put forth a positive conception of what the political <italic>ought</italic> to be. However, as is made clear in the discussions of Connolly’s and Honig’s respective political projects above, these charges do not withstand sustained scrutiny. Mouffe’s attempt to present associative agonism as a postmodern politics of free play, absent any points of stabilization, is a flawed interpretation, and one that cannot be borne out in looking at these theorists’ clearest articulations of their agonistic theory.</p>
<p>Both Connolly and Honig accept the exclusion of some dimensions of plurality as inevitable, a form of structural violence which cannot be eradicated and must instead be matched or limited by democratic energies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0191453711421605">121</xref>
</sup> Connolly’s and Honig’s emphasis on the importance of continuing contestation actually arises out of the necessity of exclusion and the systematic production of remainders by any political system. The promise of associative agonism lies in its ability to articulate the attitudes, virtues and values necessary to retain a receptivity to difference within conditions of deep pluralism. Associative agonism provides us with a broad outline of the virtues and qualities we must develop within citizens, if this mode of democracy is to emerge and endure. A demanding set of civic virtues, along the lines of what Connolly or Honig suggest, is necessary if we are to sustain broad-based commitment to an agonistic political order. Dissociative agonism’s emphasis on the operative functioning of power within the field of social relations often precludes the development of these lines of thought. The sympathetic reader is frequently left wondering how the commitment to liberal and egalitarian ‘rules of the game’ advanced by Mouffe to be the backdrop of agonistic political spaces, is to emerge and endure. The concomitant set of values necessary to support agonistic politics is largely assumed.</p>
<p>Asociative agonism advances its understanding of democracy with the recognition that such pluralism may well provoke anxiety, uneasiness, or hostility among those forced to reside within it as well as the recognition that all forms of plurality cannot possibly be accommodated or thrust onto the register of legitimacy. Yet it provides a set of political virtues which help us to deal with these potential problems. Thus, associative agonism provides a powerful, yet demanding, ideal towards which contemporary societies can strive. In particular, issues of how to democratically legitimate boundaries of the political community attain a novel character when viewed through this lens.</p>
<p>While associative agonism offers great promise in terms of reshaping democratic engagement and securing legitimacy in complex and diverse societies, there are risks in both Connolly’s and Honig’s poorly specified articulation of how we actually foster such values and commitments among democratic citizens. Connolly’s hope that a commitment to an ethos of pluralization can emerge organically, rooted in the fear of persecution on the basis of one’s faith, remains underspecified. The problem of how to translate fear of persecution into presumptive generosity towards difference, instead of simply a will to dominate the Other, is <italic>the</italic> perennial problem of difference. To claim that receptivity will emerge out of fear without carefully specifying the means by which to achieve this transformation is an extremely risky assertion. Connolly admits that his vision resides within the realm of the ‘perhaps’ and is justifiably hesitant to specify such details in part due to his faith in radical democratic processes. Yet the sympathetic reader is ultimately left wanting a clearer definition of how to approach these lofty heights in terms of economic and societal transformations, institutional modifications, reforms in education, and the like.</p>
<p>In the same way, Bonnie Honig’s call for us to shift the way in which we ‘read’ and relate to contemporary difference and pluralism risks leaving the societal-level mechanisms by which this transformation could occur underspecified. While Honig argues that pluralism’s greatest promise lies in its threat of ungovernability and the disruptions this can introduce into torpid and unreceptive democratic systems, there is of course the danger that this threat is not embraced for its reinvigorating democratic potential but <italic>reacted against</italic>, violently and heavy-handedly. The methods by which we draw emergent democratic demands into the register of legitimacy at the level of the citizenry, rather than erudite political theorists, remain somewhat opaque. Contra Mouffe’s claims, the shortcoming of associative agonism is not that it conceptualizes the political without frontiers, but rather that it remains too abstract in how we might render such democratic frontiers subject to countervailing democratic energies. Yet these are lacunae which subsequent thinkers devoted to articulating the societal mechanisms of realizing associative agonistic democracy can begin to fill.<sup>

<p>Although not all deliberative democrats see the purpose of deliberation as securing legitimacy. While the deliberative democrats I focus on here <italic>do</italic> tend to see deliberation in this light, theorists such as Ackerman, Fishkin and Bessette adopt a more pragmatic view. They employ deliberation to ensure that policy-making is more informed, more reflective and driven by understanding of the issues. See Joseph M.

<p>In this sense, agonism’s position in relation to deliberative democracy possesses many parallels with theorists of difference such as Iris Marion Young or Lynn Sanders who argue that deliberative democrats’ emphasis on creating respectful, reserved discussion of controversial issues already risks disenfranchising marginalized groups not well-poised to take advantage of this democratic style. See Iris Marion Young, ‘Communication and the Other: Beyond Deliberative Democracy’, in Seyla Benhabib (ed.) <italic>Democracy and Difference: Contesting the Boundaries of the Political</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 120–35; Iris Marion Young, <italic>Inclusion and Democracy</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002); Lynn Sanders, ‘Against Deliberation’, <italic>Political Theory</italic> 25(3) (1997): 347–76.</p>

<p>Note that I am addressing here only the <italic>contemporary</italic> variants of agonism while largely avoiding intellectual predecessors such as Nietzsche or Arendt. I do so in order to delimit the focus to the ongoing articulation of a politics of agonism within contemporary democratic theory. To extend the framework advanced here to include prior agonists such as these would risk making it too broad and of limited use in understanding the contemporary framework of agonistic pluralism situated within democratic theory. Those seeking analysis of these earlier agonistic visions should consult: Dana Villa, ‘Beyond Good and Evil: Arendt, Nietzsche, and the Aestheticization of Political Action’, <italic>Political Theory</italic> 20(2) (1992): 274–308; David Owen, ‘Equality, Democracy, and Self-Respect: Reflections on Nietzsche’s Agonal Perfectionism’, <italic>Journal of Nietzsche Studies</italic> 24(1) (2002): 113–30; Andrew Schaap, ‘Political Theory and the Agony of Politics’, <italic>Political Studies Review</italic> 5(1) (2007): 56–74.

<p>Both of these represent pervasive tendencies in scholarly work on the potential of agonism. For instances of the former tendency to treat agonism as a unified theoretical endeavor, see: Seyla Benhabib, ‘Introduction: The Democratic Moment and the Problem of Difference’, in Seyla Benhabib (ed.) <italic>Democracy and Difference: Contesting the Boundaries of the Political</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996), p. 8, note 35; Sheldon S.
