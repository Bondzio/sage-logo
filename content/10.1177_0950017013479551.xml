<p>The 1980s were a time of tremendous change and uncertainty as the crisis of the Keynesian welfare state of the 1970s began to evolve into a deeper shift in the character of capitalism. The failure of social democracy to renew itself in progressive terms within various national contexts (such as those of the UK, France and Spain) and in the face of a new market-oriented shift (driven by an emergent neo-liberal order and discourse) created a new set of literature within the social sciences. This literature tried to grasp the nature of these structural changes and political discourses. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017013479551">Claus Offe (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017013479551">1985</xref>) was an attempt to come to terms with the pressures posed by the post-war settlement and system of state regulation within a mixed economy, looking at the inherent contradictions and tensions brought forth in a new age of state and social welfare. Offe suggested the use of the concept of <italic>disorganized</italic> capitalism to understand the process of fragmentation taking place if academic narratives were going to be able to capture the complexity of change. This broad, sweeping approach mapped the thematic dimensions of the new system of capitalism emerging.</p>
<p>However, the publication of <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017013479551">1987</xref>) by Scott Lash and John Urry brought an attempt to locate this discussion in a deeper comparative understanding of change. The book became an important reference point that predates much of the current interest in <italic>Varieties of Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017013479551">Halls and Soskice, 2001</xref>) and is one of the first serious attempts to locate change in terms of two critical dimensions.</p>
<p>The <italic>first</italic> dimension studied is change in terms of five countries: Germany, the UK, France, Sweden and the USA. Through the use of a comparative logic, the book attempts to locate the shift from a hierarchical, interventionist and collective system of capitalism to a more market-oriented, flexible and unstable context. By using this comparative method, discussion is located in terms of spatial, service sector, work-related and culturally related dimensions. This subsequently became a feature of other works, especially David Harvey’s <italic>The Condition of Postmodernity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017013479551">1990</xref>), with its broad fusion of post-Fordist, post-industrialist and post-modern insights: a book that is an important parallel to Lash and Urry’s mapping of developments from Japanese production to the sci-fi film <italic>Blade Runner</italic>.</p>
<p>Yet, in the case of Lash and Urry there was a <italic>second</italic> feature that allows their work to stand out as robust and significant. Their use of a comparative method was based on a systematic concern with a historical framework. In Lash and Urry, the text does not make a fetish of change; rather, it locates the shift to a disorganized capitalism in relation to the nature and manner of organization within the various national contexts. It is for this reason that anyone reading Hall and Soskice, the current vogue in comparative political economy and employment relations, must start with this set of literature – and with Lash and Urry, in particular.</p>
<p>The argument and the evidence they presented was premised on the opinion that the new disorganized capitalism would vary, or could only make sense, if viewed in relation to how those national systems had initially been organized in terms, for example, of the structure of capital, the role of the state and regulation and the nature of management systems in relation to work. The character of organization would be significant to the nature of disorganization, what its driver would be and how it would be moulded. Hence, the character of change in Germany and Sweden would be different from that of the UK or the USA. In some instances, capital would oversee the process; in other contexts, perhaps the state or even labour would oversee the process. One can quibble about whether this has been the case – although, to a large extent, certain trends have been maintained within these countries; however, the fundamental contribution was a call to fuse political economy and the sociological study of organizations in a dynamic and historically sensitive approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lash and Urry’s chapter on trade unions sees a more open set of possibilities for them, depending on their strategic responses and resources. They called for unions to lead and shape changes in terms of work organization, quality, participation and so forth. Hence, dualism and sectionalism within labour markets and employment relations were not really an inevitable outcome of disorganization. In fact, some prophetically took the concept of disorganization to be a new logic that had the potential to mobilize a new open form of socialism and labour identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017013479551">Daly, 1991</xref>). Current forms of social mobilization in our ‘disorganized world’ suggest that this notion of disorganization has had even more uses than those imagined by Lash and Urry.</p>
<p>Giddens’s work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017013479551">Giddens, 1990</xref>) offered broad meta-theoretical templates regarding the increasingly disembedded features of the social and economic system in both spatial and temporal terms. At a time when this has become the basis of much sociological analysis regarding globalization and social change, <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic> remains an attempt to seek the fissures, ironies and openings of such change. It locates these in a concrete analysis of systems, traditions and history.</p>
<p>The follow-up text by Lash and Urry, <italic>Economies of Signs and Space</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479551">1994</xref>), attempted to look more closely at the new economies and the question of consumption. However, <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic> is a text that, on re-reading, reminds us of the potentially open nature of change and the diversity of developments that can emerge. It also reminds us that to undertake this kind of sociological study requires working at various levels and retracing steps in order to move forwards.</p>
