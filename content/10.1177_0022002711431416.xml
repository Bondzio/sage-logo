<abstract>
<p>In this article, the authors bring together research on horizontal inequality, geographic dispersion of ethnic groups and crosscutting cleavages to present a more holistic theory of ethnic structure and civil war onset. The authors argue that rebel leaders are thwarted in their mobilization efforts in highly crosscutting societies due to a lower probability of potential combatants identifying with nationalist goals, decreased ability to exert social control, and diminished in-group communication. Using cross-national data from over 100 countries, the authors provide evidence that civil war onset is an average of nearly <italic>twelve times</italic> less probable in societies where ethnicity is crosscut by socioeconomic class, geographic region, and religion.</p>

<title>The Puzzle</title>
<p>What factors contribute to the onset of civil war? Recent research suggests that ethnicity<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002711431416">1</xref>
</sup> plays a defining role in one of the world’s most pressing problems. Indeed, “ethnic civil wars”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002711431416">2</xref>
</sup> comprise the majority of all civil wars since 1945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002711431416">Sambanis 2001</xref>), with the death toll totaling five times the interstate number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002711431416">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>). And yet the role of ethnicity in civil war onset remains up for debate. Adding to the plethora of studies on the role of ethnicity in civil war onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002711431416">Elbadawi and Sambanis 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002711431416">Sambanis 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002711431416">Collier and Hoeffler 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711431416">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002711431416">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002711431416">Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002711431416">Reynal-Querol 2002</xref>), we analyze a characteristic of ethnicity known most commonly in the literature as <italic>crosscutting cleavages</italic>. Building on existing theory that highlights the role of ethnicity in increasing grievances and mobilizing insurgents, and on previous research on the social impact of crosscutting cleavages, we argue that when ethnolinguistic identity is crosscut by other salient social cleavages, such as religion, socioeconomic class, and region of residence, rebel leaders have a harder time recruiting and maintaining the loyalty of combatants. This creates a context unfavorable to civil war onset, decreasing its likelihood even in states with other conditions favorable to onset. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711431416">Horowitz (1985</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002711431416">Lipset 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002711431416">Rae and Taylor 1970</xref>) have theorized about this in the past, we use new cross-national data on crosscutting cleavages to present the first quantitative support for this argument.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002711431416">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Empirically, we build on recent work relating the geographic dispersion of ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022002711431416">Toft 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002711431416">Matuszeski and Schneider 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002711431416">Cederman, Rød, and Weidmann 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022002711431416">Buhaug, Cederman, and Rod 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002711431416">Weidmann 2009</xref>) and horizontal inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711431416">Østby 2008</xref>) to civil war onset. We interpret these findings as supporting the link between two types of crosscutting cleavages, ethnogeographic and ethno-income, and civil war. In terms of the geographic cleavage, although the worldwide coverage of our data set is smaller than previous studies, we importantly report similar findings using a different measure of geographic segregation. Horizontal inequality, on the other hand, has been much less addressed in the literature, no doubt owing to the scarcity of data with which to test the concept.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002711431416">4</xref>
</sup> Here, our study is more extensive in its coverage than are previous studies, with about twice the number of countries than Østby’s (2008), the only other cross-country quantitative study to the authors’ knowledge. Our results corroborate those of Østby’s, however, and give strong support to theories of horizontal inequality and civil war onset. Finally, we analyze a unique measure of ethnoreligious crosscuttingness (ERC).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: first, we provide a brief overview of research, both theoretical and empirical, on the role of ethnicity in civil war onset. Then, we develop our theory of how crosscutting cleavages affect ethnicity’s rebel mobilization role. We continue with a discussion on measurements of ethnicity before presenting our measure of crosscuttingness and discussing data issues such as representativeness and coverage. Finally, we present our results and discuss the policy implications of our findings.</p>

<title>Ethnicity and Civil War</title>
<p>Borrowing from Political Instability Task Force (PITF), we define civil wars as episodes of violent conflict between governments and either politically organized groups (revolutionary wars) or national, ethnic, religious, or other communal minorities (ethnic wars). The groups seek either to overthrow the central government, to replace its leaders or seize power in one region (revolutionary wars), or they seek major changes in their status (ethnic wars). Conflicts must include substantial use of violence by one or both parties to qualify as “wars.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002711431416">6</xref>
</sup> The role of ethnicity in civil war onset has been an area of heavy focus since the introduction of “large-<italic>n</italic>,” quantitative analyses of the topic in the early 1990s. Almost all early studies operationalized ethnicity using single-dimensional measures, such as fractionalization, bipolarization, size of the largest ethnic group, and so on. Results were mixed, however, even for studies that used similar measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002711431416">Collier and Hoeffler 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002711431416">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711431416">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002711431416">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002711431416">Reynal-Querol 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002711431416">Posner 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002711431416">Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002711431416">Kalyvas 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002711431416">Fearon, Kasara, and Laitin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002711431416">Wimmer, Cederman, and Min 2009</xref>). And while these various studies employed important differences in such things as definition of civil war, control variables, and so on, whether and how ethnicity affected civil war remained a puzzle.</p>
<p>Stronger consensus has emerged more recently, as the literature has moved away from these unidimensional measures of ethnicity. These developments fall generally within two camps, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711431416">Chandra and Wilkinson (2008</xref>) refer to as “ethnic practice” and “ethnic structure.” The first camp includes work such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002711431416">Cederman and Girardin’s (2007)</xref> <italic>N* </italic>index, which quantifies the patterns of interactions between ethnic groups in power and marginalized ethnic groups; Fearon, Kasara, and Laitin’s (2007) study on ethnic minority groups holding power; and Wimmer, Cederman, and Min’s (2009) “Ethnic Power Relations” data set. These three studies highlight the role ethnicity plays at the macro level to create power structures that generate ethnic grievances, which then serve as the motivation behind the onset of civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002711431416">Wimmer, Cederman, and Min 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second camp continues the focus of earlier work regarding the structure of ethnicity in engendering grievances, but now reaches down to the micro level in discussing the facilitation of rebel group mobilization. Overlap between ethnicity and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002711431416">Seul 1999</xref>), geographic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002711431416">Cederman, Rød, and Weidmann 2007</xref>), and socioeconomic class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002711431416">Stewart 2000</xref>) have all been linked to higher grievances that can fuel civil war. In addition, these accounts point to the enhanced mobilization capacities in countries where ethnic groups are regionally clustered (Matuseski and Synder 2006) and horizontally unequal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711431416">Østby 2008</xref>). We continue in the same vein as this recent ethnic structure literature by providing context conditionality to the standard ethnicity-mobilization theory in much of the literature. We turn now to this standard account.</p>
<p>Our definition of civil war involves two groups: the government and an organized political group. This organized political group seeks one of three goals: overthrow the central government, replace its leaders, or to seize power in one region. In order to achieve these goals, the organized political group must mobilize a sufficient number of combatants loyal to its cause.</p>
<p>All societies contain potential combatants: people with varied grievances resulting from the status quo. What affects these leaders’ ability to mobilize these grievances? Two frequently cited factors in the literature are a state’s ability to put down challengers to its authority (state strength) and the geographic favorability of conditions for insurgency,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002711431416">7</xref>
</sup> such as mountains, forests, and noncontiguous regions of a state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002711431416">Collier and Hoeffler 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711431416">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002711431416">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002711431416">Fearon 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Past literature argues that ethnicity also plays a central role in mobilizing these grievances. It highlights several ways in which ethnicity facilitates mobilization; here, we discuss three:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Identification with nationalist goals</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Facilitation of social control</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Enhanced in-group communication</p>
</list-item>
</list> In these accounts, ethnicity plays at least one of these three roles, in some cases more. In what follows, we describe the mechanisms relating each of these to civil war onset. Traditional literature argues (either explicitly or implicitly) that the existence of different ethnic groups in a country is sufficient for these processes to occur. However, as we later show, ethnicity’s ability to play any of these roles is strictly conditional on the way in which ethnicity is structured in relation to other socially salient cleavages.</p>
<p>One way to mobilize potential combatants—those with grievances—is to spur them to identify with a nationalist cause.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002711431416">8</xref>
</sup> Though there are clear examples of nonethnic nationalism (Switzerland, the United States), and clear difficulties in the mobilization process from ethnic group to nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002711431416">Hroch 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002711431416">Brubaker 2004</xref>), ethnicity provides a strong justification for the creation of a national group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022002711431416">Smith 1986</xref>). We do not wish to overstate the relationship between ethnicity and nationalism. The literature clearly distinguishes between the two concepts. However, they do share some characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002711431416">Anderson 1991</xref>), which explains why we frequently observe ethnic civil wars fought over national issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022002711431416">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Consider the costs of mobilizing a combatant force for two rebel leaders who are seeking nationalist goals. The first rebel leader is able to appeal to an ethnic group as comprising this potential nation; he need not fabricate a sense of shared history, nor does he face a collective action problem in convincing a set of individuals that they constitute a group; their self-identification with the ethnic group solves both these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002711431416">Hardin 1997</xref>). Rather, the first rebel leader needs only to convince his potential followers that a politically shared future (under his leadership, of course) is a better future. The second rebel leader appeals to some other cleavage, say class. Both the shared history and political future mechanisms are much harder to achieve for this second rebel leader because group consciousness is not as strong and there is greater mobility among socioeconomic classes. Ethnicity, on the other hand, is an ascriptive identity over which individuals have limited choice. In short, ethnicity decreases the costs of group mobilization by providing an easier means with which to identify with nationalist goals.</p>
<p>The ascriptive nature of ethnicity also increases the ease with which a rebel leader can control or neutralize potential opponents. Ethnicity’s ascriptive nature sets it apart from other social cleavages: membership in an ethnic group is often marked by skin color, language, familial ties, or cultural heritage. These characteristics are not easily changed or hidden. Thus, movement in and out of an ethnic group is often much more difficult than movement between groups along other social cleavages. Indeed, of all the social cleavages, ethnicity is perhaps the stickiest: individuals rarely choose membership in the first place, and exit from the group is often infeasible (one cannot easily change skin color, language, familial roots, or cultural heritage). This benefits ethnic rebel leaders in a few ways. Perhaps most importantly, it enhances their ability to control coethnics who would dissent from or actively oppose the cause by greatly complicating their ability to exercise the “exit” option from the group. In other words, it increases a rebel leader’s “social control” capabilities.</p>
<p>Social control is the process through which individuals are “influenced by the presence, opinion, expectations, and behavior of friends, neighbors, colleagues, and relevant others, when they decide to participate [or not participate] in collective action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022002711431416">Takacs 2007</xref>, 59). Its role in facilitating civil war onset is well documented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002711431416">Humphreys and Weinstein (2008</xref>) note the power of social control in their recent study on the civil war in Sierra Leone, writing that social control facilitated mobilization as “social pressures . . . change[d] how individuals evaluate[d] the costs and benefits of joining [the] movement” (p. 439). Some who would not have joined the movement joined; others who would have acted against the movement remained silent. Social control also features prominently as a facilitator of civil war in Kalyvas’s (2006) work on this subject. Kalyvas provides a detailed account of how entire communities would be controlled by one side in a civil war—often housing combatants they did not really support—simply through the use of the dense networks that characterize ethnic groups. Citing what Filipino insurgents fighting American soldiers in 1900 described as the “chameleon act,” he states that “Either the people do not know who is really an insurgent . . . or more commonly, they refrain from identifying the insurgent combatants who hide among them—out of diverse motivations, including sympathy and fear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002711431416">Kalyvas 2006</xref>, 91).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022002711431416">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, ethnicity facilitates high levels of in-group communication, a necessary precursor to the coordination necessary for group mobilization. Part of this unique ability comes from the dense social networks that characterize most ethnic groups. Members of these networks share not only a common language, which greatly facilitates communication and is not characteristic of other social cleavages (like social class), but also a common set of norms and expectations (culture) that facilitate understanding when communication takes place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002711431416">Hardin (1997</xref>) describes in detail how these shared norms provide what he calls the “epistemological comforts of home” and allow for communication and coordination at a high level within each group.</p>
<p>It is little wonder, therefore, that ethnic civil wars dominate the list of civil wars that occurred in the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002711431416">Sambanis 2001</xref>). A careful review of the qualitative literature suggests that in many of these cases, ethnicity played a mobilization role, easing a leader’s task of mobilizing followers and controlling large segments of the population. However, this is only part of the story, since many ethnically diverse countries do not experience civil wars. We thus turn to an account of how crosscutting cleavages affect the role of ethnicity in rebel mobilization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022002711431416">
<title>Crosscutting Cleavages and Civil War</title>
<p>Crosscutting theory and its relation to social stability enjoyed widespread scholarly popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, focusing mainly on voting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002711431416">Dahl 1956</xref>), political organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022002711431416">Tingsten 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002711431416">Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002711431416">Lane 1959</xref>; Alford 1963; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002711431416">Allardt and Littunen 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002711431416">Lipset and Rokkan 1967</xref>), class conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002711431416">Dahrendorf 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002711431416">Rokkan 1967</xref>), and democratic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022002711431416">Truman 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002711431416">Lipset 1960</xref>).</p>
<p>Analyzing the same three mechanisms—identification with nationalist goals, social control, and in-group communication—we articulate how crosscutting cleavages can reduce the ability of rebel leaders in mobilizing ethnic populations. Consider again two rebel leaders trying to mobilize combatants, only this time both leaders are able to appeal to ethnic groups. The ethnic group of the first rebel leader is concentrated in some border region of the state, affiliates with a religion different from any other ethnic group in the country, and is markedly poorer than any other ethnic group. In this first scenario, ethnic identity is reinforced by other salient social cleavages. The ethnic group of the second rebel leader, in contrast, is dispersed throughout the country living in close proximity to other ethnic groups. Moreover, the second leader’s ethnic group practices the same religion as other ethnic groups and is not noticeably poorer. In this second scenario, ethnicity is crosscut by other cleavages. Which leader is more likely to be successful in his mobilization efforts?</p>
<p>In terms of convincing his ethnic group to identify with nationalist goals, the first rebel leader is more likely to be successful. The first ethnic group has a specific territory that might facilitate claims to a separate nation. Narratives of shared history might also be enhanced by religious stories and/or beliefs. Finally, the income disparity will likewise add to accounts of a shared history of grievance. In contrast, the second rebel leader’s efforts might be stymied by competing loyalties to other identities, competing shared histories from a broader religious affiliation. In addition, there would be no economic grievances to enhance claims to political exclusion and repression.</p>
<p>These crosscutting cleavages also decrease the second rebel leader’s ability to exert social control. Individuals in his society can more readily exercise the option of exit from the group by switching to memberships in groups on other social cleavages, such as class or religion. Although they may still be readily identified, and thus not able to escape punishments involving physical force, they can escape more easily from ostracization than those in the first rebel leader’s society by simply associating with individuals on another dimension of identity. Social pressures in general will likely be less, as all members of the group experience conflicting loyalties from their memberships in other groups on other cleavages. Crosscutting cleavages can facilitate the phenomenon of intra-ethnic conflict that we observe in many circumstances of war.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022002711431416">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Crosscutting cleavages also lower the degree of in-group communication and enhance communication with members of out-groups. The decreased in-group communication might result from actual linguistic mechanisms, whereby members adopt manners and cues of expression as well as different vocabularies from their other memberships, or it might stem from competing goals, opinions, beliefs, and worldviews that members obtain from their other memberships. Simultaneously, communication with members of out-groups might make appeals solely along ethnic lines less understandable and less attractive.</p>
<p>As such, crosscutting cleavages make mobilization and social control much more difficult. This only happens, however, when the cleavages that crosscut are socially salient. In this analysis, we focus on three social cleavages that are salient in most societies over time and space: <italic>geography, socioeconomic status, <italic>and</italic> religion.</italic> It should be of little surprise the each of these cleavages has been identified by previous research as affecting civil war onset.</p>
<p>Most geographic arguments on civil war relate to the favorability of terrain to insurgency, a major form of civil war. However, Matuseski and Snyder (2006) argue that it also makes a safe “home base” for rebel activists as it is easier to hide and raise resources within a densely populated ethnic region. Matuseski and Snyder also concur that when ethnic groups are geographically concentrated, social control is easier. We add that geographic concentration boosts identification with nationalist causes by providing a potential ethnic homeland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711431416">Horowitz 1985</xref>) and that communication is also enhanced when members of a group are spatially proximate.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status is also commonly identified in quantitative studies as individual motivation for participation in civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711431416">Collier and Hoeffler 2004</xref>). Even wealthy individuals will support a cause if they perceive their group to be of lower economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002711431416">Humphreys and Weinstein 2008</xref>). As noted earlier, ethno-income crosscuttingness (EIC) is elsewhere referred to in the literature as <italic>horizontal inequality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002711431416">Stewart 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002711431416">Bredel 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002711431416">Murshed and Gates 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711431416">Østby 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002711431416">Macours 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002711431416">Regan 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002711431416">Stewart (2000</xref>) argues that horizontal inequalities make group mobilization more likely by increasing intergroup animosity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711431416">Østby (2008</xref>) argues that when socioeconomic status reinforces ethnicity, group cohesion is amplified. Such group cohesion enhances identification with a nationalist cause, makes social control easier, and increases communication as opinions, goals, and worldviews accord.</p>
<p>Finally, religion is often subsumed in the definition of ethnicity, and in many parts of the world acts like an ascriptive cleavage. Religion takes on this ethnic form, however, most strongly when it is reinforced by a racial or linguistic identity. Religion can provide justifications for ethnic homelands and economic superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002711431416">Seul 1999</xref>). Religious beliefs can also enhance rebel leader social control by appealing to spiritual consequences of an individual’s choice. Finally, a religion’s unique terminology and worldviews can also increase in-group communication.</p>
<p>When these cleavages reinforce ethnicity (i.e., ethnic crosscuttingness is low), they create a social context unfavorable to civil war onset. Moreover, we should expect that the relationship between these three forms of ethnic crosscuttingness is additive: rebel leaders will have an easier time mobilizing potential combatants in a society where ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geography, and religion all reinforce each other. We thus test four hypotheses in this article<sup>

<p>Though we are adamant that the proxies used for ethnic diversity (ethnic and religious fractionalization or polarization) in previous studies are inadequate, to better connect with the existing literature, we include them as controls in some of the models estimated in this article. Nor does our theory suggest interactions between ethnic fractionalization (polarization) and crosscuttingness. Sensitive to some of these alternative models (and by implication theories), we include them in the supplementary appendix, but note here that, as in previous studies, none of them are significant. This is the case at low levels of crosscuttingness, which is the largest justification for such a multiplicative specification.</p>

<title>Crosscutting Cleavages</title>
<p>In the past, scholars have loosely referred to the concept of how two cleavages relate to each other as crosscutting cleavages. We use the term <italic>crosscuttingness </italic>to reflect a scaled variable that varies from zero to one, which we now describe. We begin with a simple scenario: if ethnic groups in a given society each belong to their own unique religion, then there is no <italic>crosscuttingness</italic>, or rather there is complete <italic>reinforcingness</italic> of social cleavages along those ethnoreligious lines. Formally, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002711431416">Selway (2011</xref>) we define crosscuttingness as the degree group <italic>I </italic>on cleavage <italic>X </italic>is identically distributed among groups on cleavage <italic>Y</italic> with all other groups on cleavage <italic>X.</italic> Put differently, crosscuttingness is basically the concept of statistical independence, which tells us whether knowing to what group an individual belongs on <italic>X</italic> tells us anything about which group he or she belongs to on <italic>Y.</italic> If knowing what group on <italic>X </italic>an individual belongs to tells us nothing what group on <italic>Y </italic>the person belongs to, then we have perfect crosscuttingness. In the language of probability, statistical independence means <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0022002711431416">

<p>To provide some intuition for what crosscutting societies look like, consider the three hypothetical societies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002711431416">Figure 1</xref>. In each society, there are two cleavages: ethnicity and religion. On the ethnicity cleavage, there are two groups: black and white. On the religious cleavage, the two societies at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002711431416">Figure 1</xref> have two groups—Muslim and Christian—while the third has an additional group: Hindus. The bottom row in each table gives the proportion of society in each subgroup, for example, black Muslims. Despite the differences in relative group size and number of groups, each society has the same crosscuttingness score, 1.0, or perfect crosscuttingness. In each society, it is impossible to guess an individual’s religious affiliation, <italic>given </italic>that we know his or her ethnicity. In other words, ethnic groups are distributed identically among religious groups, and vice versa.</p>

<p>where <italic>n</italic> is the sample size and <italic>m</italic> is the smaller of either the number of columns minus one or the number of rows minus one. Cramer’s normalization is the appropriate chi-square measure where at least one of the variables is nominal in nature, and the other is either nominal or ordinal. We use <italic>C</italic> for all three of our two-dimensional characteristics of ethnic structure since the data used to compile the indices rely on nominal or ordinal (in the case of income groups) group categories.</p>
<p>To create our measures of ethnic social structure (ERC, EIC, and EGC), we use Selway’s (2011) new cross-national data set that contains crosscuttingness measures for each of the three pairs of cleavages: EGC, EIC, and ERC. The information for this data set comes from several nationally representative surveys: the world values survey, the Eurobarometer, the Afrobarometer, the Latin American Public Opinion Project, the Asian Barometer, the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and a survey conducted by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The surveys allow individuals to identify themselves as belonging to an ethnic, linguistic, racial, or religious group, as living in a certain region, and as having a certain income.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022002711431416">13</xref>
</sup> We are then able to generate cross-tabulations for each country, exactly what is needed to generate chi-square values that form the basis of our crosscuttingness measure. These cross-tabulations provide such information as how many individuals of a certain ethnic group live in a certain region, or how many individuals from a certain religious group have such and such an income, and the like.</p>
<p>Most countries’ final score is composed of an average of crosscutting scores from two or more surveys. A few are drawn from a single survey. These surveys were rigorously analyzed for issues of representation, and any surveys that seriously compromised representation on any one cleavage were left out of the final averaged score. In creating these measures, Selway did not undertake extensive coding or transformation of the data, using the ethnic and religious group categories either chosen for inclusion by the survey designers, or as self-identified by respondents. To enhance comparability, surveys were only included in the final averaged score if the income categories were given as deciles. This was not always possible, however, since some countries had only one survey. To ensure that entire ethnic groups in geographically concentrated countries were not omitted by the random sampling methods used in a particular survey, the group sizes were compared to existing sources such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002711431416">Alesina et al. (2003</xref>). Fractionalization scores were also calculated using the survey data and correlated with fractionalization scores from existing data sets. Selway’s fractionalization scores correlate highly (average 0.727) with Reynal-Querol’s (2002) racial-linguistic index, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002711431416">Fearon’s (2003)</xref> ethnolinguistic fractionalization index, and Alesina et al.’s (2003) language, race, and religion indices. Both the detailed comparison of included ethnic and religious groups and these correlations give us a high degree of confidence that the crosscutting measures are representative of the populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022002711431416">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Of the 168 countries with populations over 400,000 (IMF 2007), Selway compiles scores for between 91 and 102 current countries (depending on the index), or 54 to 61 percent of all countries, plus an additional fifteen “extinct” countries. In general, the indices have good regional coverage. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East/North Africa are notably underrepresented, with only 40 percent and 45 percent of countries included in the sample, respectively. The Asia-Pacific has 71 percent coverage, Latin America 84 percent, East Europe/Former Soviet 85 percent, and Western Europe/North America 92 percent. Countries missing from the indices, however, are not notably poorer than countries in Selway’s data set, except in Asia-Pacific. While the difference in per capita income between in- and out-sample countries is almost $5,000 overall, this disparity is not seriously pronounced in the regions most underrepresented in the indices. Indeed, in the Middle East and West Africa, out-sample countries actually have a higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, the GDP per capita of out-sample countries is only $500 higher on average. The biggest difference between in- and out-sample countries occurs in the Asia-Pacific region with an approximately $7,400 difference in per capita GDP. These differences in both regional coverage and average GDP per capita should be accounted for when evaluating results used with these indices.</p>
<p>For ERC, the lowest score is for Israel, which gets 0.054—nearly all ethnic Jews identify with Judaism and nearly all Palestinians identify with Islam. Bosnia and Iraq also score low on this index. Latin American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay) and Islamic-dominant countries (Egypt, Pakistan) tend to have the highest ERC scores because most ethnic groups within their borders identify with the Catholic and Islamic religions, respectively. On the EGC index, Israel is again the lowest joint with Switzerland. Bosnia, Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, and Ukraine also score low, whereas the United States, Canada, and Brazil are at the high end of the EGC index. Finally, South Africa scores by far the lowest on the EIC index. Israel is also low at 0.736, since the mean of EIC is higher and the standard deviation is much smaller than the other two crosscuttingness indices. Bosnia, India, Iraq, and Mexico are also on the lower end of the scale, while Canada, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Russia are all on the high end. In general, more advanced industrial countries score high on the EIC index.</p>
<p>How different are our crosscutting measures from other measures of diversity, specifically the traditional single-dimension fractionalization measures like ethnolinguistic fractionalization? In the online appendix, we present scatter plots between each of the crosscutting measures and ethnic fractionalization. In general, only slight patterns emerge. More ethnically fractionalized societies tend to be slightly more geographically concentrated and slightly more horizontally unequal, though not more ethnoreligiously crosscutting (the regression line is virtually flat). There may be a reasonable explanation behind these patterns, though we do not dedicate any space to that discussion here. Instead, in the regression analysis, we control for ethnic and religious fractionalization to see if our measure is capturing something unique from traditional fractionalization measures.</p>
<p>The ethnic structure variables are constructed using data from the late 1990s or early 2000s. Thus, we have a single measure for each country, regardless of the year. This raises two potential problems (common to all other studies of this type: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002711431416">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711431416">Collier and Hoeffler 2004</xref> etc.) when conducting longitudinal analysis. The first is the possibility that there have been significant changes in crosscuttingness in some of the countries in our data set during the last fifty years. This would make our use of a constant value over this time period incorrect, and our results possibly invalid. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002711431416">Laitin and Posner (2001</xref>)  cite Somalia and Yugoslavia as cases where ethnic groups have changed significantly over time. However, in most countries, ethnicity is more resilient to change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002711431416">Fedderke, Luiz, and de Kadt (2008</xref>)  conducted a detailed study of ethnicity in South Africa from 1936 to the present, finding that <italic>aggregate</italic> measures of social structure, such as ethnic fractionalization, remain fairly stationary over time despite changes at the micro level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002711431416">Inglehart and Welzel (2005</xref>) lend more systematic support for the slow rate of change in social structure generally experienced by countries around the world. Moreover, studies that include multiple indices of social structure for robustness often find no significant difference in findings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022002711431416">Stoll (2008</xref>) looked at seven different proxies for ethnic fractionalization in her study on the number of political parties. These proxies ranged in time from the 1960s (ELF and Roeder) to the 1980s (Roeder) to the late 1990s/early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002711431416">Alesina et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022002711431416">Annett 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002711431416">Fearon 2003</xref>). The effect of ethnic fractionalization on the number of parties (as modified by mean district magnitude) did not differ significantly among these seven measures. As such, we feel confident that this is not a problem for our analysis.</p>
<p>The second potential problem with our social structure variables has to do with endogeneity. What if the values of crosscuttingness that we ascribe as facilitating conditions for civil war are actually the effects of civil war, that is, a civil war erupts, and large population or wealth transfers between ethnic groups occur? To explore this possibility, we undertook a careful reading of all the cases of civil war onset in our data set looking for changes in religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, and geographic concentration of ethnic groups as a result of the civil war. We found just one case among the sixty-six in which this happened—Azerbaijan, from which the ethnically Armenian territory of Nagorno-Karabakh actually seceded and became part of Armenia—and removed it from the data set. In addition, we deleted several years from Pakistan prior to the breaking away of East Pakistan and the formation of an independent nation (Bangladesh). We do not have measures for Cyprus prior to 1974, so the scores for Greek Cyprus and Turkish Cyprus are not problematic from this respect.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022002711431416">
<title>Civil War Onset</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses using three different sources of civil war onset data: PITF State Failure Problem Set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002711431416">Bates et al. 2003</xref>), Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)/ Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) Armed Conflict Data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002711431416">Gleditsch et al. 2002</xref>), and Major Episodes of Political Violence (MEPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002711431416">Marshall 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022002711431416">15</xref>
</sup> These three data sets differ primarily in the threshold of <italic>intensity</italic> that qualifies conflicts for inclusion as a civil war. PITF’s thresholds are at least 1,000 direct conflict-related deaths over the full course of the armed conflict and at least one year when the annual conflict-related death toll exceeds 100 fatalities. PITF imposes no other yearly minimum, and hence has the most episodes of civil war in its data set. For the UCDP/PRIO data, we follow Urdal’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002711431416">2006</xref>) coding, which defines a civil war as a violent episode that results in at least twenty-five annual deaths and a minimum of 1,000 conflict-related deaths during the course of the civil war. MEPV has the lowest overall minimum of at least 500 directly related deaths over the course of the episode with no yearly minimum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022002711431416">16</xref>

</p>
<p>Due to the geographic coverage of Selway’s crosscuttingness variables, our test of Hypothesis 4, wherein all three crosscutting measures must be present, focuses on just 80 of the 159 countries in the full PITF data set, approximately 50 percent. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711431416">Table 1</xref> illustrates, however, these eighty countries provide a fairly representative sample of the 159 countries in terms of the dependent variable, with similar means and standard deviations. Our sample contains approximately 54 percent (59) of the total number of PITF civil wars (110), in 55 percent of the countries experiencing civil war. The other two data sets we use contain slightly lower percentages on these two criteria, but again means and standard deviations are similar.

<p>Because our sample is missing many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, we are arguably missing out on a region of the world not only where civil war is most rampant but also where ethnic diversity is the highest. We recognize this limitation of our sample, but try to assuage some fears by presenting mean scores of ethnic and religion fractionalization scores for our sample and the full sample. Mean fractionalization scores are similar for all three dependent variables in the full data set, at 0.42 for ethnic fractionalization and 0.46 for religious fractionalization. Not surprisingly, our sample is less diverse by these traditional measures, only slightly so for religious fractionalization, but more so for ethnic fractionalization. All these data limitations should be taken into consideration when assessing our results.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>Building on past research on this subject, we include the following control variables in models testing our hypotheses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022002711431416">17</xref>
</sup> First, we include three variables traditionally used to capture state strength: the log of per capita income lagged one year (<italic>Income</italic>), which proxies for police and counterinsurgent strength; a dummy variable (<italic>Oil</italic>) indicating whether state revenues are derived primarily from oil exports, proxying for the less structured bureaucratic systems oil-producing states usually possess; and the log of a country’s population size (<italic>Population</italic>). Next, we include the log of the proportion of the country that is mountainous (<italic>Mountains</italic>) to capture the degree to which geographic conditions are favorable to insurgency. Finally, we include an additional measure of state strength: a measure of political instability measured by whether the country had a three or greater change on the Polity IV regime index in any of the three years prior to the country-year in question (<italic>Instability</italic>). We present the summary statistics for these variables as well as our ethnic social structure variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002711431416">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022002711431416">18</xref>
</sup> As suggested by Beck et al. (1998), we model temporal interdependence by controlling for peace spells and using natural splines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022002711431416">19</xref>

</sec>

<sec id="section10-0022002711431416">
<title>Results and Analysis</title>
<p>Before we turn to the statistical analysis, we begin the presentation of our findings with a simple 2 × 2 × 2 table. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref>, we divide each of the three ethnic crosscutting variables at the mean into high and low, producing eight cells into which we place all the countries from the PITF data set. Countries that have experienced a civil war are underscored, with the total number of civil wars in parenthesis following the country’s name. This table clearly elucidates several patterns in the data that support our hypotheses before conducting any regression analysis. First, note that only thirteen of the thirty-five countries that experienced civil war appear in the top half of the graph where EGC is high. The remaining twenty-two countries that experienced civil war are all in the bottom half of the table where EGC is low. The table presents a similar pattern for EIC: only thirteen countries that experienced civil war have high EIC. As our theory would suggest, the majority of the countries that experienced civil war (twenty-two out of thirty-five) had low EIC. The table also suggests an interaction between EGC and EIC: 54 percent of all countries that experienced civil wars during this time period fall in the bottom-right two cells, where both EIC and EGC are low. This provides strong initial support for the role of EIC and EGC in civil war onset hypothesized by our theory.</p>
<p>The results are less clear regarding the role of ERC in civil war onset. As our theory would suggest, of the nineteen countries just referenced (in the bottom-right two cells of the table), twelve (64 percent) fall in the cell where ERC is low. However, a close look at the entire table shows that the number of countries that experienced civil war with low ERC (seventeen) does not differ from the number of countries that experienced civil war with high ERC (eighteen). These mixed results are explored later using regression analysis.</p>
<p>The results are stronger when one realizes that of the ten countries that seem to contradict our theory (i.e., those in the upper left-hand side of the table), five are coded by PITF and verified by the authors as nonethnic civil wars—that is, wars in which ethnic grievances and mobilization did not play a role. We italicize these in the table. As such, just <italic>five of the thirty-five countries that experienced civil war</italic> in this data set fall clearly outside the pattern our theory suggests, with the remainder largely falling in line. Moreover, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref> does not control for the other relevant variables suggested by previous research as predictors of civil war onset (e.g., state strength and insurgency favorability). To be clear, these other factors also play a role in civil war onset, especially in countries that do not have the types of social structures that we emphasize in this article. However, it is striking that so many cases of civil war fall into the pattern predicted by our theory. In addition, since our data set ends in 1999, this analysis fails to capture the civil war that broke out in 2004 in Pakistan, where the government was fighting against Pashtuns in Federally Administered Tribal Areas; the 2005 civil war in the Central African Republic; and some other conflicts that could possibly be categorized as civil wars in the near future all of which fall in the bottom-right quadrant. We now turn to regression analysis to provide a more complete test of our theory.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022002711431416">Table 4</xref> displays the results of regression analysis to test our hypotheses. As in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref>, we use PITF civil war data for the main analysis. However, we show here that these findings are robust to the use of UCDP/PRIO and MEPV data as well (models 8 and 9). We begin by noting that in all models the coefficients for <italic>Income</italic> and <italic>Oil </italic>take on the expected sign and are highly significant (as in most past studies on civil war), except for <italic>Income</italic> in the MEPV estimation. The coefficients on <italic>Instability </italic>and <italic>Mountains</italic> also take on the expected sign in all our models, though they are not always statistically significant. In models 1 through 3, we enter EIC, ERC, and EGC into the model separately. In all three models, EIC, EGC, and ERC take on a negative sign, as expected. EIC and EGC are highly statistically significant predictors of civil war onset, while ERC falls just outside the boundaries of traditional significance (<italic>p</italic> value = .11), a finding not too surprising given the patterns highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022002711431416">20</xref>
</sup> To illustrate the magnitude of the effects of these variables on civil war onset—for example, their substantive significance—we calculate risk ratios for each of EIC, EGC, and ERC (which are more easily interpretable than first differences or odds ratios). A risk ratio is calculated as <table-wrap id="table4-0022002711431416" position="float">

</p>
<p>The ratio quantifies the difference in the probability of civil war onset (<italic>Y</italic> = 1) as a result of a defined change (<italic>X</italic>
<sub>1</sub> − <italic>X</italic>) in the variable of interest (in our case, ethnic social structure), holding all other variables at their means. For each of EIC, EGC, and ERC, we assign <italic>X</italic>
<sub>1</sub> to be the maximum observed value of the variable in our data set and <italic>X</italic> to be the minimum observed value (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002711431416">Table 2</xref> for a list of these values). We then employ the simulation method developed by Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Olivia Lau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002711431416">2009</xref>), running 1,000 simulations to obtain the mean <italic>P</italic>(<italic>Y</italic> = 1) for each of<italic> X </italic>and <italic>X</italic>
<sub>1</sub> as well as 95 percent confidence intervals. Finally, we divide the two quantities as described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0022002711431416">equation 2</xref> (8).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022002711431416">21</xref>
</sup> The picture these risk ratios paint of the <italic>substantive effect</italic> of these variables on civil war onset is striking. In our simulations, EIC has a mean risk ratio of 6.48, meaning that civil war onset in countries with the minimum level of EIC in our data set (i.e., low EIC) is <italic>on average over six times more probable</italic> than in countries with maximum EIC. The magnitude of the effects of EGC and ERC is significant as well: EGC has a mean risk ratio of 2.33; ERC’s mean risk ratio is 1.71. These results provide strong evidence that ethnicsocial structure is both a statistically and a substantively important predictor of civil war onset.</p>
<p>Next, we briefly address which of these three variables have the biggest effect. This can be somewhat observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref> by simply comparing difference in the numbers of civil wars between high- and low-scoring countries on each crosscutting variable. This simple method would lead us to conclude that EGC and EIC matter the most, and perhaps that ERC does not matter so much. A second method would be to include all three in a regression together, allowing us to control for the other crosscuttingness variables as well as other variables common in civil war analyses. These results are given in the supplementary appendix, but indicate that EGC is the only significant variable. Even so, it would be premature to simply discard the other two crosscutting variables, especially since there is a moderate-to-high correlation among them.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) allows us to extract some underlying essence common to these three variables. This common essence, or principal component, is what we refer to as crosscuttingness. What PCA does is essentially eliminate any extraneous information not related to crosscuttingness. The analysis indicates that there is just one common component to all three (Eigenfactor &gt; 1) and that all three variables have a high factor loading with this component. These high factor loadings are easily interpreted (in the case of a single component) as correlations between the original variables and the newly generated crosscuttingness component. As expected, both EGC and EIC exhibit high correlation (by traditional PCA standards) with this component (0.61). Importantly, ERC also exhibits high correlation with the crosscuttingness component (0.50). If the crosscuttingness component is now a significant predictor of civil war onset when included in our regression, we can conclude that all three crosscutting variables are significant. To do this, we generate a factor score for this component, which we refer to as <italic>crosscuttingness</italic>. Estimating our model with this as the main measure of ethnic diversity shows that crosscuttingness significantly reduces the likelihood of civil war onset. Not only does this provide strong support for including all three crosscutting variables in our analysis, but also this is a strong support for Hypothesis 4. These results are given in the supplementary appendix in greater detail.</p>
<p>Here, however, we offer a more simple test of Hypothesis 4 by collapsing the three crosscuttingness indices into a single measure, <italic>ComboCC</italic>, and estimating models 4 through 9.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022002711431416">22</xref>
</sup> <italic>ComboCC </italic>and the principal component generated by the PCA method are highly correlated at about 0.89, so we are confident that this is an equivalent and appropriate test. In models 4 and 8, with PITF and UCDP/PRIO as the dependent variable, <italic>ComboCC </italic>is both negative and statistically significant as our theory suggests. Using the MEPV data set in model 9, we again obtain a negative coefficient, although it is not quite significant at traditional levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022002711431416">23</xref>
</sup> In model 5, we control for ethnic fractionalization, and <italic>ComboCC </italic>is again significant. Ethnic fractionalization, however, is not significant and even takes on the wrong (positive) sign. The same is true for religious fractionalization in model 6, and in model 7 we control for both simultaneously with similar results. For robustness, we substituted fractionalization measures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002711431416">Fearon (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002711431416">Reynal-Querol (2002</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002711431416">Alesina et al. (2003</xref>). In all nine alternative models, <italic>ComboCC </italic>took on a similar coefficient in terms of direction, significance, and magnitude. In contrast, none of the Alesina et al. fractionalization measures were significant nor the Reynal-Querol ethnic measure. The Reynal-Querol religious measure, however, was significant, as was Fearon’s fractionalization measure, which also includes religion in its definition of ethnicity. We also run an additional twelve models substituting measures of ethnic and religious polarization. Again, <italic>ComboCC </italic>is significant in all models, while only Reynal-Querol’s religious polarization was significant, taking on a positive sign as per the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002711431416">Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022002711431416">24</xref>
</sup> In short, <italic>ComboCC </italic>is a robust factor in reducing the likelihood of civil war onset.</p>
<p>
<italic>ComboCC</italic> is also substantively significant: using the same method described earlier, but this time for <italic>ComboCC</italic> using the PITF data, we obtain a risk ratio of 11.64, suggesting that civil war onset is on average <italic>nearly twelve times more probable</italic> in countries with the lowest combined levels of crosscuttingness than in countries with the highest. This result should not be surprising after viewing <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002711431416">Table 3</xref> (our simple 2 × 2 × 2), where 46 percent of all civil wars in the sample fall in countries where religion, socioeconomic class (income group), and geographic region reinforce ethnicity, however it lends additional support to our theory.</p>
<p>Importantly, risk ratios also highlight that the mean substantive effect of crosscuttingness, as measured by <italic>ComboCC</italic> using PITF data (model 4), on the probability of civil onset is larger than the effect of <italic>any</italic> of the traditional state strength and insurgency favorability measures in our model, with the exception of <italic>Income</italic>. We calculate mean risk ratios for each of these variables using the min and max values listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002711431416">Table 2</xref> and present these risk ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022002711431416">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<p>To conclude this section, we remind the readers of the preliminary nature of these findings. The results rest on only slightly more than half of the countries in the civil war data sets and exclude many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa due to absent survey data. Although this does not bias the number of civil wars in our sample, since most civil wars in Africa are of an ethnic nature we may be missing an important part of the relationship between ethnicity, crosscutting cleavages, and civil war. As the number of countries in the crosscutting cleavages data set expands, we look forward to a reevaluation of these results as well as a fruitful theoretical discourse on the impact of social cleavage structures on civil unrest more generally.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fifty years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002711431416">Lipset (1960</xref>) and a host of other scholars discussed the dangers of reinforcing cleavages for general social stability. They argued that in crosscutting societies, individuals would be pulled among their various memberships such that loyalty to any one group would be minimized. We argue that this same dynamic has a direct effect on the costs of rebel mobilization, and thus on civil war. Ethnicity, when it is reinforced by other salient social cleavages, can make it easier for rebel leaders to mobilize. Not only can they appeal to economic and other grievances, but they can also make a clearer justification for their nationalistic goals. In-group communication is enhanced and leaders can also exert greater social control if necessary. In sum, when ethnicity is reinforced by religion, socioeconomic class, and geographic region, rebel leaders have the highest likelihood of being successful in their mobilization efforts.</p>
<p>Using cross-national indices that capture the degree of crosscutting cleavages, we provide strong evidence for this argument. Clearly, civil war onset is as much a function of a state’s social terrain as its physical terrain. Indeed, in our data set the probability of civil war onset is an average of <italic>nearly twelve times greater</italic> in societies with low ethnic crosscuttingness than in societies with high ethnic crosscuttingness, even when accounting for the impact of other common factors linked to civil war.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we note that these results stem from analysis conducted on just slightly more than half of the countries in the current civil war data sets, excluding many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa due to absent survey data. As such, we may be missing an important part of the relationship between ethnicity, crosscutting cleavages, and civil war. As the number of countries in the crosscutting cleavages data set expands, we look forward to a reevaluation of these results as well as to a fruitful theoretical discourse on the impact of social cleavage structures on civil unrest more generally.</p>

<p>For clarity, in this article we use the term ethnicity in its narrower sense, to refer to racial or linguistic groups. This is not to ignore the increasingly prevalent broader definition of ethnicity in the literature, which encompasses any sense of collective belonging, based on common descent, language, history, culture, race, or religion (or some combination of these; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711431416">Horowitz 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002711431416">Varshney 2007</xref>). However, our focus on crosscutting cleavages requires us to distinguish between dimensions of identity. We could just as well use the term ethnolinguistic identity to be precise.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002711431416">Sambanis (2001</xref>, 261) defines “ethnic civil war” as “war among communities (ethnicities) that are in conflict over the power relationship that exists between those communities and the state.” </p>

Horowitz’s (1985) insights on ranked and unranked ethnic systems, and what he refers to as “cumulative cleavages,” more closely address civil war.</p>

<p>Borrowing from PITF, we define civil wars as episodes of violent conflict between governments and either politically organized groups (revolutionary wars) or national, ethnic, religious, or other communal minorities (ethnic wars) that seek either to overthrow the central government, to replace its leaders, or to seize power in one region (revolutionary wars) and/or major changes in their status (ethnic wars). Conflicts must include substantial use of violence by one or both parties to qualify as “wars.” See PITF, Codebook for Data Set of Internal Wars and Failures of Governance, 1955–2008 (accessed online at http://globalpolicy.gmu.edu/pitf/pitfcode.htm).</p>

<p>The most extreme form of this argument is that the only distinction between an “ethnic group” and a “nation” is that an ethnic group has yet to demand a “political roof over its head” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002711431416">Berlin 2001</xref>).

<p>The results using a rare events logit or time-series logit model do not substantively alter the results of the article.

<p>MEPV differs from the other two data sets in the size of event it counts as an “incident,” being much smaller than the others in its death count minimum (500 individuals rather than 1,000). As our theory is about rebel mobilization, it should not be surprising that it does not explain smaller events as well as the larger events that comprise PITF and UCDP/PRIO.</p>
