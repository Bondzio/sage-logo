<abstract>
<p>We offer a complex adaptive systems (CAS) lens as a potentially fruitful cross-disciplinary perspective for mentoring. Understanding mentoring relationships as CAS will invigorate the field and assist it to be responsive and relevant given our increasingly complex and turbulent environment. We begin by exploring the key properties of CAS. We then review the current mentoring literature’s connection to the systems and complexity theories that underpin CAS, demonstrating CAS’s relevance. We further examine four specific benefits that such a lens could bring, including attention to process, the reconceptualization of context, the adoption of new methodologies, and the fostering of interdisciplinary conversation. Research questions the CAS lens might stimulate for mentoring are then considered and difficulties with the CAS approach explored. We conclude by suggesting how CAS-informed research might shape mentoring knowledge and practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Academic interest in mentoring has flourished since seminal works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711430556">Kanter (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711430556">Kram (1985)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711430556">Levinson et al. (1978)</xref> inspired a diverse and extensive body of research.</p>
<p>Yet, a number of scholars continue to identify significant research gaps, such as research on the mentor’s perspective and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711430556">Allen, 2007</xref>); the social capital functions of mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711430556">Feeney and Bozeman, 2008</xref>); and the experience of mentoring over its lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen, 2008</xref>), among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Addressing the continued gaps in mentoring knowledge, several publications have considered where the field might go in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711430556">Allen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711430556">Haggard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711430556">Zellers et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> specifically note that recent social and organizational changes ‘necessitate the extension, broadening, and development of new theoretical perspectives on mentoring relationships’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>Mentoring is not the only field in which self-contemplation has been the response to significant social transformation. The general management literature has also been preoccupied with how management might be reconsidered to cope with the rapidly changing, contemporary environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711430556">Denning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711430556">Hamel and Breen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711430556">Stacey, 1996</xref>). Complexity theory, which looks at how ‘order, structure, pattern, and novelty arise from extremely complicated, apparently chaotic, systems and conversely, how complex behavior and structure emerges from simple underlying rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711430556">Cooke-Davies et al., 2007</xref>: 52), has emerged as a rich theoretical lens. A feature of complexity theory has been to understand organizations and groups as complex adaptive systems (CAS).</p>
<p>We propose understanding the mentoring relationship as a CAS enriches current perspectives in mentoring research. We begin by defining CAS and exploring their grounding in both systems theories and complexity science. We show why and how CAS theory is an appropriate lens for mentoring before going on to identify several specific advantages that CAS offer mentoring theory. In doing so, we respond to the call for greater interdisciplinary sharing of knowledge and conversation that this journal advocates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711430556">Khapova and Arthur, 2011</xref>). After considering particular research questions that the CAS lens may generate for mentoring research, we explore some of the difficulties adopting that lens poses.</p>

<sec id="section2-0018726711430556">
<title>Defining CAS</title>
<p>A CAS can be defined as ‘a set of interdependent agents forming an integrated whole, where an agent may be a person or an organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>: 484). The term was first developed to describe physical, often called natural, systems. However, social systems characterized by diversity and emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711430556">Sawyer, 2008</xref>) – and where the interacting agents that make up the system and the system as a whole are adaptive – are commonly now considered CAS.</p>
<p>It is foundational to the idea of social arrangements being CAS that such systems are dynamic and in a constant state of flux. The interacting, interdependent agents ‘are bonded in a collective dynamic by a common need’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2009</xref>: 631). The changing, adaptive nature of these systems means they cannot be fully explained by the study of the individual components alone. Furthermore, the changing, adaptive nature of CAS ensures that interactions between their components are likely to be unpredictable and unplanned. Every CAS is unique, consisting of unique agents who respond uniquely to their unique contextual inputs. Despite this, CAS have a number of defining features, though scholars vary on the terminology used to describe these (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711430556">Fryer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>). For the purpose of clarity, here we draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion’s (2009)</xref> recent work on CAS in leadership that distinguishes between ‘complexity dynamics’ and ‘enabling conditions’ (p. 639). These two terms usefully cluster the main precepts of CAS.</p>
<sec id="section3-0018726711430556">
<title>Complexity dynamics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion (2009)</xref> see complexity dynamics as being ‘the emergent processes through which CAS form and operate’ (p. 639). Key processes include self-organization, emergence, and bonding. Self-organization occurs because CAS have no inherent hierarchy of command and control but rather constantly reorganize to best fit with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711430556">Fryer, 2010</xref>). Consequently, traditional command-and-control type planning and managing of these systems is futile. Emergence refers to the patterns that arise from apparently random interactions between agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711430556">Sawyer, 2008</xref>). Bonding, or connectivity, refers to the relationships between the agents. In CAS, the ways in which agents bond and relate establishes the patterns of the system. Accordingly, the relationships between agents are just as, if not more, important than the agents themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711430556">Fryer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These processes are possible because of the properties of CAS that contribute to complexity dynamics. First, non-linearity is the notion that ‘a change in a causal agent does not necessarily elicit a proportional change in another agent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2009</xref>: 639). Instead, a change within an agent in the system may have no effect, a dramatic effect, or an entirely unpredictable effect. The rich interconnections within the CAS mean feedback is often variable; however, it is also possible for such systems to be historically contingent as path dependencies develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>). Second, CAS contain attractors. Within social systems, attractors are interpreted as change agents (where they pull the system towards new behaviors) or as change inhibitors (where agents within the system resist change because of strong ties to an attractor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Enabling conditions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion (2009)</xref> regard enabling conditions as the necessary conditions under which complex behavior will occur. Enabling conditions include the presence of dynamic interaction, interdependence between agents, heterogeneity in the system, and tension. Dynamic interaction means that the agents within a CAS interact in ways that are not fixed, but are emergent and responsive, and thus unpredictable and non-linear. Furthermore, dynamic interactions within a CAS begin at the local level. Agents interact with the other agents they are connected to and are driven by their own needs rather than the overall needs of the system. However, because the agents are interdependent, agents will have to cooperate and compromise to achieve their independent goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2009</xref>). Heterogeneity or requisite variety in a CAS ensures strength within the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711430556">Bokeno, 2007</xref>). Differences between agents feed dynamic interaction and mean the system is forced to adapt to maintain strong ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2009</xref>). Where traditional systems theory seeks to homogenize and stabilize, CAS argues for variety that creates tension and instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>). Adaptive tension within a CAS is important because it provides the pressure on the system to adjust to its environment and to be innovative and creative.</p>

<title>The relevance of CAS to mentoring</title>
<p>Having defined CAS, we now turn to exploring why importing CAS theory makes sense for mentoring research. We do this by examining the two major theories that underpin the concept of CAS: systems theory and complexity science. The following sections discuss each theoretical underpinning in turn, while making connections between CAS and the existing mentoring literature.</p>
<sec id="section6-0018726711430556">
<title>Systems and CAS</title>
<p>Systems perspectives are based on the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. They assume that all kinds of systems, be they natural, man-made, physical or social, share characteristics regardless of their components. Systems science is a meta-discipline with content capable of being transferred from discipline to discipline, its goal to ‘address problems beyond conventional reductionist boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711430556">Skyttner, 2008</xref>: 497). Where a reductionist tries to understand the world by breaking it into ever smaller parts, the systems scientist tries to look at the complex whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711430556">Weeks, 2001</xref>). Thus systems theory stresses the interdependent and interactional nature of the relationships that exist among all components of a system, and studies the whole in its entirety.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that systems theory in general is not new to mentoring (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711430556">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711430556">Caruso, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711430556">Keller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711430556">Spencer and Rhodes, 2005</xref>). However, previous recognition of mentoring as a systemic phenomenon tends to center on systems theory rooted in traditional science rather than in complexity science, which underpins CAS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711430556">Keller (2005)</xref>, for example, uses a systemic conceptual model to analyse youth mentoring, exploring the complex feedback loops between children, mentors, parents and case workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711430556">Keller (2005)</xref> argues that by teasing out the ‘multiple pathways of influence’ and paying attention to ‘factors that contribute to the overall functioning of a system’ (p. 183) mentoring may be more fully understood. We agree, but where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711430556">Keller (2005)</xref> draws on open systems theory, we argue that the mentoring relationship is better described as a CAS because it puts greater emphasis on emergence and relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711430556">Bokeno (2007)</xref>, on the other hand, argues that developing practice in mentoring is ‘indicative of a more broad and systemic outlook’ (p. 19) and favours an emergent, non-linear view of mentoring over more traditional systems approaches. We develop the connection he sees between mentoring and CAS more fully here.</p>
<p>A CAS lens is particularly relevant to the modern world because unlike reductionist viewpoints that struggle to handle complexity and a rapid pace of change, it looks for the connections between components and understands small interventions can have enormous consequences. Envisioning mentoring as a systemic relationship embedded within systems, we believe will provide a fresh and exciting theoretical lens to the field. However, before we turn to the multiple systems that construct mentoring, we want to highlight that even the mentoring dyad itself can be considered as a CAS. For example, infant research explicitly uses the systems concept to account for the interpersonal world of the infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711430556">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>), and Systems Intelligence theorists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711430556">Saarinen and Hämäläinen (2010)</xref> propose the ‘dyadic system as a basic unit’ (p. 13). For the latter, as for us, a dyad can be a co-created system because it influences both participants individually and the relationship as a whole.</p>
<p>Additionally, the mentoring relationship ‘has features not detectable by the inspection’ of the mentor and the protégée ‘separately as isolated individuals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711430556">Saarinen and Hämäläinen, 2010</xref>: 13). That is, to know about the mentoring relationship requires more than just knowledge of the individual participants. Despite this, a feature of the research on mentoring has been an intensive focus on the attributes of the participants. A number of studies have explored the effects of personality, developmental stages, gender, race, and communication competency on mentoring. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen (2008)</xref> put it, ‘most research examines mentoring . . . at the individual level of analysis’ (p. 2). To understand CAS we need knowledge of the system and its relationships, and its wider contextual setting, not just knowledge of the individual agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the mentoring dyad is a system nested within other systems (such as the organization and wider community) the mentor and protégé and the system they form co-evolve with those other systems. The acknowledgement that forces both beyond and part of the mentoring dyad affect the mentoring process is congruent with a CAS lens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726711430556">Figure 1</xref> suggests how the mentoring relationship might be configured, though there will be variations depending on how many overlapping systems the mentor and protégée share. Essentially, it shows the mentor and protégé coming together as agents to form a system, within the context of another CAS – the organization. The organization itself is further nested within a wider social context, labelled here culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726711430556">Figure 1</xref> shows the mentor and protégé as coming from different cultural backgrounds, but belonging to the same organization. Using a CAS lens allows the researcher to adjust the model according to the unique circumstances of each mentoring relationship, thus acknowledging differences while at the same time drawing attention to the features that systemic relationships share.</p>

<sec id="section7-0018726711430556">
<title>Complexity and CAS</title>
<p>Having examined the relevance of CAS to mentoring drawing on the terminology of systems theory, we now turn to complexity science as the other theoretical basis of CAS. Complexity is essentially about limits to knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>). While we can examine the individual components of a complex system and see how they are interconnected we often have to just ‘sit back and watch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>: 15) to see how the system will behave overall. However, complex systems most often demonstrate unpredictable but patterned behaviors. Approaching mentoring through the science of complexity may help us to better understand the micro-macro interplay of the mentoring relationship as a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711430556">Goldspink, 2010</xref>). Yet current mentoring research still relies heavily on reductionist approaches that focus in on the particulars of mentoring relationships and, in doing so, tend to lose the overall picture. Researchers have also struggled with how to account for contextual influence, how to deal with the dynamic nature of the mentoring relationship, and how to model that relationship.</p>
<p>Though the mentoring literature to date contains very few references to complexity science, our reading of the literature indicates enormous potential for the mentoring relationship to be analysed as being complex. Historically, mentoring has been characterized by linearity, hierarchy, and the relatively straightforward transfer of information from mentor to protégé. Yet, dissatisfaction with the ability of a closed dyadic relationship that progresses through predetermined phases to accurately reflect the messiness of human experience has led some researchers to explore alternative models. For example, reverse mentoring turns the direction of traditional mentoring on its end, with the young and technologically adept mentoring older, more senior colleagues – though both are believed to benefit from the relationship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711430556">Gonzales and Thompson, 1998</xref>). This has emerged as a relevant model given the rapidly-changing and technologically-advancing social context. Other hybrid forms, such as peer mentoring, have also gained traction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711430556">Bryant and Terborg (2008)</xref> argue that lateral mentoring in organizations is ‘qualitatively different from traditional mentoring’ and likely offers ‘unique advantages over traditional mentoring relationships’ (p. 12). New theoretical models are needed to reflect and explain emergent practice, hence the applicability of drawing on the complexity-informed CAS lens.</p>
<p>This lens rejects mentoring being associated with the ideas of linearity and clear, distinguishable phases in favour of chaotic and irregular movement. This seems to us the direction the mentoring literature is heading, particularly given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711430556">Higgins and Kram’s (2001)</xref> influential conceptualization of mentoring through the developmental network model. Their work has its roots in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711430556">Kram’s (1985)</xref> early description of ‘constellations of relationships’ and can also be compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711430556">Dansky’s (1996)</xref> exploration of group mentoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711430556">Higgins and Kram (2001)</xref> proposed that the dyad was not necessarily the appropriate unit of study for mentoring, particularly given the new career and employment context that is increasingly diverse, technological, global, and flatter in structure. Drawing on social networking research, they proposed individuals sought developmental assistance from a set of people rather than just one person, and offered four typical developmental network configurations (receptive, traditional, opportunistic, and entrepreneurial). The range of mentoring models currently evident in the literature and in practice has led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> to claim there has been a paradigmatic shift that acknowledges ‘that mentoring occurs within the context of developmental networks’ (p. 660). Tellingly, the emphasis on developmental networks as constellations of relationships is echoed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien et al.’s (2007)</xref> description of CAS as temporary constellations of people.</p>
<p>Certainly, interactions within these constellations must be considered complex. For example, scholars have long recognized that career-outcome and psychosocial benefits of the mentoring relationship are reciprocal. In CAS terms, the heterogeneity of the interdependent agents in the mentoring system leads to non-linear outcomes in the sense that while the intended beneficiary of the relationship is the protégé, in practice the mentor, too, benefits. Recognition of the mutually beneficial nature of the relationship has also affected the perception of other aspects of mentoring, such as the power dynamics and the co-construction of meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711430556">Harris et al. (2009)</xref> describe their use of ‘cogenerative dialogue’ in a triad of two doctoral students and a supervisor as ‘a highly democratic form of collaborative learning that depends upon mutual respect, rapport, inclusion of all stakeholders (regardless of differing expertise) and a multiplicity of participation opportunities for all’ (p. 26). The highly interactive and co-created nature of the relationship reflects the CAS features of dynamic interaction and bonding. Furthermore, the importance of an emotional connection between mentor and protégé has received attention in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711430556">Langer (2010)</xref> goes so far as to claim the benefits of mentoring ‘depend mostly on the creation of emotional connection’ (p. 24). This aspect of the mentoring relationship lends itself to analysis of complexity dynamics and enabling conditions.</p>
<p>We have presented why we think mentoring suits a CAS interpretation in terms of both its systemic and complex qualities. In doing so, we have made general observations about trends and findings in the mentoring literature that motivate this connection. In the following section we now discuss particular advantages we think the CAS lens might bring to mentoring research.</p>

<title>Specific advantages of a CAS view of mentoring</title>
<p>The adoption of a CAS perspective of the mentoring relationship has the potential to bring a number of specific developments to mentoring research. We explore four here: attention to process, reconceptualization of context, adoption of fresh methodology, and the fostering of interdisciplinarity.</p>
<sec id="section9-0018726711430556">
<title>Attention to process</title>
<p>One of the most important advantages a CAS lens offers mentoring is a greater emphasis on the process of mentoring rather than the characteristics of the individuals involved. The primary focus of much mentoring research has been the attributes of participants, the functions of mentoring, and the outcomes of the process. We believe that researchers have been so absorbed in identifying the individual variables that might affect the mentoring relationship that they have occasionally lost sight of the process itself. As a result, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> astutely observe, ‘while we have focused on mentoring behaviors and protégé outcomes, we have not explored the dynamic and interactive processes underlying mentoring relationships’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>That is not to say that no work has been done on the relationship itself. Certainly, some researchers are exploring the quality of mentoring relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711430556">Chandler and Eby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711430556">Eby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711430556">Kalbfleisch, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, a recent buzzword has been mentoring ‘episodes’ or ‘short-term developmental interactions that occur at a specific point in time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram, 2007</xref>: 662). A series of such episodes will constitute a mentoring relationship, but mentoring episodes can also occur outside of a long-term mentoring connection. Communication theory is also being imported into mentoring research to illuminate how relationships unfold over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711430556">Kalbfleisch, 2007</xref>). Relational Cultural theory, which extends the traditional view of mentoring, is a significant shift towards an emphasis on process that also attends to systemic issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711430556">Fletcher and Ragins, 2007</xref>). For example, this theory situates the microprocesses of mentoring within societal-level systemic forces such as gender and power dynamics.</p>
<p>Like Relational Cultural theory, CAS theory offers a flexible and appropriate theoretical approach to mentoring, one capable of focusing attention on the iterative processes that constitute the mentoring relationship; that capability exists because in CAS the relationships between the elements of the systems are fundamental to the system itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711430556">Weeks, 2001</xref>). In other words, as much attention is given to the connection between components of the system as to the individual parts. Furthermore, systems and CAS theories show that not only do people’s actions and their relationships collectively define the system, the system in return shapes individual behavior and embedded relationships. Thus, understanding the way the mentor and the protégé relate to one another, as well as understanding the reciprocal impacts of this dyadic system (and the external, overlapping systems it is related to) on these individuals, is crucial to understanding mentoring as a CAS.</p>
<p>As we identified earlier, key properties of CAS are complexity, emergence, and dynamism, and we see these properties as equally important, but somewhat neglected, in mentoring. While these properties are acknowledged in the mentoring literature the opportunity to analyse them using the theoretically coherent lens of CAS is often missed because scholars are not consciously or consistently applying a systems lens. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711430556">Chandler and Eby (2010)</xref> give advice on how to avoid the mentoring relationship going awry, for example, they suggest that people who volunteer for mentoring are more likely to fulfil one another’s expectations and stress the importance of being alert to ‘patterns of behavior’ (p. 5) that might cause trouble. Within a CAS framework, in effect they are advocating a self-organizing aspect to the mentoring dyad and highlighting the chaotic, emergent but attractor-driven nature of the mentoring relationship. That is, their description of the mentoring experience could be explicated in CAS terms.</p>
<p>Similarly, where mentoring is recognized in the mentoring literature as complex, it is in the sense that mentoring is difficult to fully grasp and understand. This in itself makes it a suitable topic for a systems lens, as systems theory is useful for tackling complex problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711430556">Skyttner, 2008</xref>). However, we argue that mentoring is also complex in the specific sense that complexity theory and CAS use the term. CAS are complex because they are diverse and are made up of multiple interconnected elements. They also tend toward chaos in that they are non-linear, though with defined characteristics. Chaos should not be confused with randomness, which implies disorder, as while chaos is non-linear, over time patterns emerge – there are boundaries to the randomness. In a sense, it is a framework that highlights that there are limitations to what we can know, and, subsequently, limitations to what we can plan for and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>). This idea seems applicable to mentoring in that while the individual interactions between mentor and protégée are highly unpredictable in many ways, they tend to eventually form patterns – stage models of the mentoring relationship, for example, generically describe the patterns that emerge from what is effectively a unique process (at the level of individual interactions that make up the relationship).</p>
<p>The concept of emergence in CAS refers to the system’s ability to self-organize, evolve over time, and produce unpredictable outcomes. Acknowledging the property of emergence in the mentoring relationship acknowledges that there is no grand plan at work. The mentoring process cannot be planned or controlled – it emerges from interaction patterns that inform the behavior of the participants within the systems, and the system itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711430556">Fryer, 2010</xref>). Changes occur both within and without the system that have a significant impact on its operation. Furthermore, all CAS have inputs and outputs as well as processes to convert one to the other. Much mentoring research has looked at inputs and outputs, though without applying the specific systems concepts. For example, many scholars have investigated the ‘antecedents’ that affect the mentoring process (a component of inputs and context) and the ‘outcomes’ or outputs of mentoring (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711430556">Chao, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711430556">Rose, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711430556">Turban and Dougherty, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711430556">Underhill, 2006</xref>). What they do less often is emphasize the dynamic nature of both these and the processes of mentoring.</p>
<p>Where the mentoring literature does refer to dynamic aspects of mentoring it invariably adopts a linear frame for the dynamism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen (2008)</xref> note that the ‘processes and outcomes associated with mentoring change over time’ (p. 160). For us, the concept of dynamism is inherent in the very nature of the system and is constant. CAS are inescapably, continually dynamic. They are constructed by the constant interaction between local agents and between those agents and their environment. Feedback is an essential component of a CAS and highlights the interdependencies of the agents, just as feedback is and does in mentoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711430556">Bokeno (2007)</xref> describes the difference between a CAS view of mentoring and a traditional view by focusing on the dialogic (not monologic) communication of the CAS lens. He argues that both the mentor and the protégé have the capacity to learn as they communicate by questioning and talking about learning. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711430556">Harris et al. (2009)</xref> see cogenerative mentoring as involving balancing the tension both within the protégé and mentor and between them. This dovetails with systems theory because the ways in which the agents in a system connect and relate to one another are generally more important than the agents themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711430556">Fryer, 2010</xref>). Thus a CAS approach may refocus attention in mentoring from the attributes of the individual to the processes of connection between them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726711430556">
<title>Reconceptualization of context</title>
<p>A further significant development that CAS offers mentoring research is its attention to the nested system aspect of the mentoring relationship. While the primary mentoring relationship between mentor and protégé forms a CAS, that CAS exists in a complex relationship with the wider (multi) systemic context. In other words, the mentoring relationship does not exist in isolation, and, we argue, consequently should not be studied in isolation. Mentoring relationships need to operate effectively within a dynamic and emergent context, while balancing the predictable and unpredictable, the stable and the unstable. In other words, the mentoring relationship is never fixed – it is always responding and adapting to its own inputs as well as the inputs of the wider environment. Incorporating a focus on the wider environment, or context, is crucial for future work on mentoring. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> note inconsistent results appear in research on individual attributes, such as gender, and they attribute ‘these mixed findings to contextual factors that can be accounted for only by considering gender as a systemic factor nested within social and organizational contexts’ (p. 667). A CAS approach draws attention to the structural, but flexible, properties of dynamic organization while attending to context.</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> stress the role of context, they specifically say that ‘context involves not only the system within which the mentoring relationships are embedded but also the structure and medium by which mentoring relationships are enacted within and outside organizations’ (p. 675). To this we would add the multiple (perhaps competing, perhaps overlapping) systems to which the participants in the relationship belong. Interestingly, when we look at existing mentoring studies that refer to context, a number of them use systems concepts without ever drawing explicitly on systems theory. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711430556">McCauley and Guthrie (2007)</xref> unequivocally call for research on how organizational systems and cultures affect mentoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> specifically note that scholars also need to ‘think beyond organizational context to the impact of societal-level systemic forces’ (p. 678). Such forces include cultural values, power relationships, race, gender and ethnicity. The emergence of e-mentoring and the influence of technology on more traditional forms of mentoring have also drawn attention to the contextual elements of structure and medium.</p>
<p>Historically, however, so rarely has context been attended to in mentoring research that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711430556">Allen (2007)</xref> bemoaned the fact that much of it ‘has been conducted as though mentoring relationships in organizations exist in a vacuum’ (p. 141). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711430556">Zellers et al. (2008)</xref> remark that ‘although mentoring is recognized to be contextual, only recently have investigators considered the impact of organizational culture on the effectiveness of corporate mentoring programs’ (p. 552). They stress that mentoring relationships must be defined and discussed within the organizational or cultural contexts in which they occur. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711430556">Haggard et al. (2011)</xref> encourage future research on contextual factors. Accordingly, 20 years after Kram’s initial remarks, she and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins (2007)</xref> needed to reiterate that ‘contextual factors illuminate the embedded nature of mentoring and offer important new insights for future research and practice’ (p. 675). Specifically, they highlight five paths of inquiry that will likely shed light on the mentoring context – (1) the role of the organization in initiating and fostering mentoring; (2) the effect of organizational diversity, climate, and norms; (3) the impact of leadership; (4) the effects of technology; and (5) the role of the culture of the society beyond the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> outline a path for future study of context, when they diagrammatically conceptualize the mentoring landscape context it is presented as but one of a number of factors that affect the mentoring process. A CAS approach demands context be an integral part of the mentoring relationship because context concerns both the environment in which the relationship occurs and is part of that relationship. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien et al. (2007)</xref> note, ‘context in complex adaptive systems is not an antecedent, mediator, or moderator variable’ (p. 299); rather it is the dynamic ambiance of the relationships between agents, organizations and environments: ‘CAS . . . are socially constructed in and from this context’ (p. 299). Furthermore, adopting a CAS lens necessitates that both the relationship and its context are regarded as being in a state of flux. Our reading of much of the early work on mentoring sees scholars often treating the primary mentoring relationship as dynamic (moving through phases, for example) but treating context as static, as a fixed environment in which the primary relationship occurs. In contrast, CAS theory allows for a rich exploration of context because it sees the environment as a dynamic influence on the system rather than a static entity that can be described and measured.</p>
<p>CAS are open systems ‘that interact with their environment in a transformation process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>: 356). Accordingly, CAS theory pays particular attention to the immediate context, seeing the agents that make up the system (the mentor and protégé) as primarily influencing one another locally. However, the agents also act on and are influenced by their local environment. That environment consists not only of the system that the individuals make up together, but all the overlapping, nested systems to which they belong, such as the work department, the organization, the community, and so on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg (2009)</xref> argues that ‘a CAS can only be understood in the context of its environment’ (p. 485), because such a system evolves as agents act and react in cooperation and competition with other agents in their context. Further, a CAS ‘acquires information about its environment and its own interaction with that environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711430556">Gell-Mann, 1995</xref>: 17). In other words, the relationship of the mentor and protégé to context is dynamic. Furthermore, for us, it only makes sense to visualize the mentoring relationship in its context, as the mentor and protégé are never isolated from relationships to others external to their dyad.</p>

<sec id="section11-0018726711430556">
<title>Adoption of fresh methodology</title>
<p>A third benefit of applying a CAS lens to mentoring is that complexity theories, with their non-traditional ontology, demand fresh methodological approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers (2006)</xref> argue that complexity theory is an evolutionary development of systems theory that is revolutionary in effect. In other words, though CAS are another type of system, the way in which these systems work challenges long held notions of science. Accordingly, a CAS perspective requires a quite different ontological approach than traditional systems theory. It is a ‘profoundly different way of understanding the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>: 25) than the traditional scientific approach, but one that allows scholars to accept that they can never know or model everything. That is because a complexity science perspective understands that the best representation of a complex system is the system itself – any attempt to model a system will fall short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>). Consequently, the complexity based researcher will be comfortable with fluidity, ambiguity, and pluralism rather than pursuant of stasis, certainty, and single truths. Thus a CAS lens invites the acceptance of theoretically diverse and methodologically varied approaches.</p>
<p>This is timely for the mentoring field as a number of scholars have critically assessed research methods associated with mentoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711430556">Allen et al. (2008)</xref>, for example, conducted a qualitative review of the research methods used to study mentoring and found an over reliance on particular study designs (cross sectional and self-reporting data), a tendency to conflate different forms of mentoring (such as informal and formal) and a lack of experimental research. They recommended the field begin to undertake more complex research drawing on multiple data sources and incorporating longitudinal design, a point also made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, in their quantitative study of the mentoring literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711430556">Kammeyer-Mueller and Judge (2008)</xref> call for studies that obtain measures from both subjective and objective sources rather than a single source. They further suggest that ‘because mentoring is a dynamic process that unfolds in time . . . growth curve modelling studies would be especially instructive’ (p. 278). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz (2009)</xref> have also complained that mentoring ‘is lacking in terms of rigorous quantitative research designs’ (p. 526) and called for studies to be more methodologically thorough. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711430556">Zellers et al. (2008)</xref> favour more qualitative and observational research. What mentoring scholars do agree on is that traditional methods ‘capture a limited snapshot’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram, 2007</xref>: 684) and new measures are required.</p>
<p>CAS can help address the methodological concerns because its fresh ontological perspective calls for new methodologies. The influence of complexity and related systems theories on researchers, sometimes referred to as the ‘new science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711430556">Wheatley, 1999</xref>), has resulted in a methodological movement entitled the ‘third scientific discipline’ – where the first discipline is experimentation and the second regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>). Pioneers of this movement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711430556">Ilgen and Hulin (2000)</xref> argue that existing ‘methods and theories remain far better suited for the deterministic and linear corners of [organization science] than for the well populated chaotic regions of it’ (p. xv). Thus, the third discipline seeks to find better ways of understanding social groups as CAS, and crosses a number of disciplines in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Important features of the third discipline are its focus on longitudinal studies to best study the effects of processes and its integration of a range of perspectives and methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711430556">Hunt and Ropo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>) – exactly what mentoring scholars have argued the field needs. Furthermore, in their recent criticisms of current mentoring research methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711430556">Kammeyer-Mueller and Judge (2008)</xref> make two crucial observations. First, they note that mentoring is a dynamic process, and as such is inadequately researched by typical methods. Second, they suggest that researchers ‘may increasingly have to turn away from mentor functions and scales and towards a more detailed understanding of the mentor process as organizationally embedded’ (p. 279). A CAS approach both accepts mentoring as a dynamic process and as nested within systems, and so lends itself to this type of research.</p>
<p>In fact, complexity-theory informed perspectives like CAS demand new non-linear research methodologies that better reflect the phenomenon that they attempt to study. Contemplating the application of CAS theory to leadership, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers (2006)</xref> propose dynamic systems simulation and artificial neural networks as valuable methods. Dynamic systems simulation involves researchers creating a virtual representation of the social world to help study the dynamics of emergence. Using techniques such as agent-based modelling, the simulation ‘creates rather than tests theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>: 361) and allows researchers to ‘confront the logic of their theories before time-consuming and costly data collection occurs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711430556">Ilgen and Hulen, 2000</xref>, blurb). Such techniques create artificial agents, which act and react based on specified rules governing their behaviors, their interactions between each other, and with the environment to produce emergent systemic patterns. This then forms the theoretical basis for the possible long run behavior of mentoring relationships based on varying contexts. Artificial neural networks, in contrast, test theory using pattern recognition algorithms to uncover patterns in complex data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711430556">Schneider and Somers, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These third discipline methods are not intended to simply replace more traditional approaches, but to be used alongside other, for example, qualitative, data to gain a richer understanding of complex and dynamic system experiences like mentoring. Thus, traditional mentoring research methods tend to concentrate on the individuals and their interactive micro-behaviors in mentoring relationships, while third discipline methods can explore the long range macro-behaviors of mentoring endeavours more systemically, taking into account a wide range of social dynamic interactions.</p>

<sec id="section12-0018726711430556">
<title>The fostering of interdisciplinarity</title>
<p>Described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> as an ‘explosion of research that crosses disciplines, professions and continents’ (p. 4), the mentoring literature extends to many fields. Indeed, mentoring has penetrated a number of disciplines and been richly explored from both a theoretical and applied standpoint. Areas as diverse as health studies, knowledge management, human resource management, education, and psychology have all paid attention to mentoring as a tool for learning and knowledge sharing. However, this multidisciplinary interest, along with rapid social, technological and organizational change, has had the unintended consequence of producing a somewhat bewildering range of perspectives on mentoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen (2008)</xref> confirm this view, noting that the multidisciplinary nature of mentoring research means there is ‘limited integration’ (p. 159) between disciplines. The CAS lens has its basis in systems theory as well as complexity theory. Both these theories are highly interdisciplinary frameworks that encompass multiple principles but which all seek to explore how living, adaptable, changeable systems function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711430556">CASgroup, 2010</xref>). The cross-disciplinary nature of the theories that form the basis of CAS make it an appropriate lens to apply to a multi-disciplinary field such as mentoring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one consequence of having a range of disciplines contributing to the mentoring literature is a struggle for conceptual clarity. As far back as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711430556">1983 Merriam</xref> noted that ‘mentoring appears to mean one thing to developmental psychologists, another thing to business people and a third thing to those in academic settings’ (p. 169). Twenty years later confusion over meaning remained an issue with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711430556">Bennetts (2002)</xref> commenting that ‘despite becoming popular as a means of personal and professional development, mentoring suffers from a lack of definition’ (p. 155). A recent survey of the literature found over 50 definitions, varying significantly in scope and breadth, pointing out that they are often ‘specific to, and reflective of the researcher’s discipline’ with scholars from business offering quite different interpretations of the terms than their counterparts in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz, 2009</xref>: 527). A similar disjuncture occurs between academic and practitioner literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711430556">Langer (2010)</xref> has recently exposed that ‘although there are some areas of overlap in mentoring theory and practice, little consistency exists in the way mentoring is defined both within and across these categories’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>Though many have called for a clear definition of mentoring applicable across the field, that goal may be both undesirable and unrealistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711430556">Haggard et al., 2011</xref>). It may be undesirable because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711430556">Zellers et al. (2008)</xref> have persuasively argued, the highly contextual nature of mentoring means scholars should be cautious about importing observations made within one setting (for example, the business sector) to other areas (such as academia). It may be unrealistic because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz (2009)</xref> have argued, the lack of a consistent definition may be symptomatic of a lack of a shared theoretical base. We support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen’s (2008)</xref> call for ‘greater unification rather than fragmentation of knowledge’ (p. 167) on mentoring, and, like them, argue it is ‘time to move out of . . . disciplinary silos’ (p. 160). Adopting the CAS lens provides an opportunity to do just that because while it provides an overarching theoretical lens, it treats each CAS and its context as unique.</p>

<title>Research questions for mentoring using a CAS lens</title>
<p>What research questions might a CAS perspective encourage mentoring research to ask? The fundamental questions CAS researchers might ask regard emergence. How does emergence happen, why, and what emerges from the mentoring relationship? These questions give rise to a series of sub questions largely unaddressed in the literature to date.</p>
<p>Beginning at the macro level, we might ask how the competing demands of the overlapping systemic context affect the mentoring relationship. Both the mentor and the protégé belong to a number of systems simultaneously and, importantly, these are not necessarily identical. Mentor and protégé may come from different departments within an organization, or indeed may come from different organizations. How then do the individuals balance the demands of the multiple systems they belong to when engaged with mentoring, particularly if those demands compete with the demands of the mentoring system? It is not too difficult to envisage a protégé being pressured by an organizational superior to behave in ways or complete tasks that might impact on the protégé’s relationship with a mentor. Indeed, recent research on when mentoring goes bad (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711430556">Chandler and Eby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711430556">Eby et al., 2010</xref>) suggests the complexity of the mentor/protégé relationship and its fluid state. We see CAS theory as having the capacity to explain that complexity and state of flux.</p>
<p>Another system-level issue for mentoring research that a CAS lens opens up for exploration is the examination of how structure produces behavior while acknowledging behavior produces structure. That is, how is the mentoring relationship shaped by the individuals at the same time as they are transformed by it? The CAS lens does not limit the researcher to exploring the system acting on the mentor and protégé, but looks at how the interaction between the whole system and its parts mutually form one another, within the context of other systems. Similarly, could the mentoring relationship itself have a dialectical relationship with the systems that comprise its context?</p>
<p>Given the complex environment that mentoring relationships are situated within is in a constant state of flux, the mentoring relationship itself is also inescapably dynamic and emergent. A CAS lens prompts us to ask how the mentor and protégé understand and respond to the dynamism inherent in the relationship. In particular, we might ask how mentor and protégé interaction patterns emerge during mentoring. Theoretical awareness of the dynamic emergent processes in mentoring might broaden the conversation between mentor and protégé, freeing them from the expectations of engagement in a neat, linear and self-contained process, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711430556">Jones and Brown’s (2011)</xref> recent reflective contribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711430556">Bokeno (2007)</xref>, for example, suggests that a CAS-informed perspective of mentoring will help the mentor and protégé understand that multiple pathways can be found towards the same goals and that (dis)ordered exploration of the relationship rather than predictable, linear steps will likely lead to better outcomes.</p>
<p>Understanding the mentoring relationship as a CAS then leads to potentially fruitful research questions at the micro level. Given flexibility and collaboration are essential to successful bonds between agents in a CAS, and yet, tension and instability will extend boundaries and encourage innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711430556">Bokeno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711430556">Palmberg, 2009</xref>) how can mentoring relationships navigate these contradictory pulls? Research on the processes of relating that address these characteristics will likely benefit the mentoring literature. Such research could inform practice. For example, understanding the processes of relating, the ability to create individual but interdependent visions, to foster positive attractors, and experiment rather than follow detailed rules may help in the design of formal mentoring programmes and help explain and inform the success, or otherwise, of both formal and informal mentoring relationships.</p>
<p>Another micro-level question that we might ask is what are the opportunities for intervention in negative cycles of interaction? The CAS approach calls attention to the generalized repeated patterns of interaction that occur between individuals and between individuals and the system. In the mentoring relationship each individual interaction is emergent and unpredictable, yet, over time, communication and behavior patterns emerge. Understanding the mentoring relationship as a CAS could allow the researcher to identify, given the predictable unpredictability of the relationship as a system, where there might be opportunities to intervene.</p>

<title>Difficulties in adopting the CAS lens</title>
<p>Adopting a CAS lens to research mentoring is not without its problems, however. A significant issue faced by many scholars attempting to import the new science of complexity into management is the tendency to subsume complexity into the dominant, functionalist, managerial paradigm. Though offering a significant opportunity to understand organizations in new ways, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711430556">Zhu (2007)</xref> notes with disappointment that ‘achievements in natural complexity sciences are enthusiastically transferred into explanations of organization change and management’ (p. 445) in watered down and inaccurate ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711430556">Zhu (2007)</xref> argues that management scholars fail to notice that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>if rules are specifiable and imposable they are not genuinely emerging; if organizations can be moved to and positioned at the edge of chaos they are then subject to intentional manoeuvre, not self-organizing; and if a population of strategies rather than a single strategy are employed, then more, not less, formulation and implementation is needed. (p. 446)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such is the problem with agent-based modelling efforts when studying emerging macro-behaviors of systems. That is, such models are based on pre-conceptualized rules for agent behavior, leading to somewhat predictable, or at least derived, macro-behaviors.</p>
<p>If CAS theory is to be successfully applied in mentoring, scholars must consciously fight the desire to impose order, predict the unpredictable, and take a reductionist view of the mentor and protégé.</p>
<p>Ideally, application of complexity theories in mentoring will emphasize the non-linearity and unpredictability of mentoring relationships and stress the ‘patterns [that] emerge unpredictably in myriad local interactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711430556">Zhu, 2007</xref>: 448). In this context, ‘visions, strategies and initiatives from leaders and managers are no more than gestures . . . calling forth responses from many, different, local agents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711430556">Zhu, 2007</xref>: 448). Attention needs to shift from outside intervention towards joint action achieved through conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711430556">Cooke-Davies et al., 2007</xref>). Greater self-reflexivity is also highlighted because, somewhat counter intuitively, ‘complexity thinking actually requires us to spend a little more time thinking, and a little less time working’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711430556">Richardson, 2008</xref>: 13). Complexity thinking means accepting one’s limits, especially about what can be planned and pre-determined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adopting a complexity science based theory challenges current research methods. Mentoring research from a CAS perspective will necessarily be context specific, rendering quick-and-easy-questionnaire type approaches untenable. The field of leadership is facing the same issue as it imports complexity thinking into its oeuvre. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711430556">Uhl-Bien and Marion (2009)</xref> encourage leadership researchers using the CAS lens to employ multi-method studies. For example, they advocate the use of longitudinal studies that focus on processes, using qualitative approaches, case studies, simulation and modelling to help gather rich contextualized data. This is also a good recommendation when applied to mentoring.</p>
<p>However, favouring these methods comes at a cost for the mentoring researcher. If we regard mentoring relationships as CAS we are unlikely to be able to conduct quick, reductionist studies. Static snapshots of the agents or systems are of less interest than adaptions and emergence in relationships over time. In addition, the CAS lens does not prove useful for building constructs, isolating variables or working towards prescriptive outcomes.</p>
<p>The need for contextualized research and longitudinal, messy methods when using a CAS approach makes it difficult for the researcher to provide quick, sharp, practical advice to organizations or individuals. A possible way around the obstacles of the CAS lens is to combine theoretical lenses and methodologies in somewhat of a hybrid approach to theory building and research. Action Research and Appreciative Inquiry, for example, are two methodologies suited to a complexity-based theory as they focus on working with dynamic emergence.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Contemplating future research in mentoring, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz (2009)</xref> argue that theoretical work in mentoring should ‘continue to draw from other fields’ and conclude with the hope that ‘alternative, theoretical frameworks will advance the literature in the coming years’ (p. 540). We have argued the case for CAS to be one of those frameworks. We have shown through our discussion of the complex and systemic features of mentoring why the CAS lens has so much potential for the field.</p>
<p>Driven by a number of factors, CAS is a natural fit with the mentoring relationship. First, a CAS lens offers the opportunity to focus on the process of connecting and so capture the rich, dynamic, complex, and emergent experience of mentoring. Second, it encourages renewed attention to context beyond the dyad. In doing so, it has the additional benefit of allowing a fresh conceptualization of the mentoring relationship. Seeing the mentoring relationship as a CAS in itself, as well as seeing it as part of other such systems, resolves some of the weaknesses of the traditional mentoring models – particularly their emphasis on linearity and their level of analysis at the individual level. Furthermore, by highlighting the complexity of the social world, CAS theory draws attention to the futility of all theory attempting to be normative and prescriptive. The CAS lens also highlights the influence of structure on behavior, even as behavior is influenced by structure, while simultaneously emphasising the adaptive nature of both the relationship-as-system and the individual agents. Finally, like mentoring, CAS theory is cross-disciplinary. Its cross-disciplinary nature means it has the potential to provide a unifying lens for the many disciplines contributing to mentoring research and help with the integrative work called for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711430556">Eby and Allen (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our impression of the mentoring literature is that mentoring scholars are struggling to find a theoretical lens that captures the vagaries and complexities of current mentoring practice. The CAS lens, grounded in complexity science and systems theory, is appropriate because it is a holistic, environment-sensitive, and dynamic lens suited to the complex processes of relating among mentor, protégé, and context – a lens more about emergence than effectiveness or efficiency. Certainly, emergence is evident in the field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711430556">Crisp and Cruz (2009)</xref> argue that the mentoring literature has lagged behind the development and implementation of mentoring programs in practice, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711430556">Ragins and Kram (2007)</xref> note that ‘new hybrid forms of mentoring [are] being offered by organizations without guidance or connection to empirical research’ (p. 4). A CAS lens may help bridge the gap between traditional theory and emergent practice by providing a theoretically sound but flexible and dynamic framework through which to view the mentoring relationship.</p>
