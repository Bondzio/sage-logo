<abstract>
<p>Products of unknown safety and efficacy were once referred to as “quackery,” and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was empowered to protect public health by preventing their sale and forcing them from the market. However, in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act legitimized their sale as “dietary supplements.” Sales increased dramatically, and many Americans now use herbals, homeopathics, and other so-called supplements. The Food and Drug Administration cannot act against them until patients have already been harmed, a dangerous situation. Furthermore, no governmental agency has the authority to force the manufacturers to furnish proof of efficacy. It is vital for physicians to warn their patients that they should use these unproven products only with great caution, and must never discontinue legitimate medical therapy in lieu of unproven products.</p>

<p>My guest editorial discusses an area of mutual concern, one that impacts the practices of all legitimate medical professionals. I will briefly describe the resurgence of unproven therapies and medications (often referred to as “quackery”) in the United States and its implications for physicians, including pediatric neurologists.</p>
<p>Those with a passing familiarity with the classics recall the fable of Pandora’s Box, in which Pandora was presented with a box (or jar) which she was cautioned not to open. Because of overwhelming curiosity, she opened the box despite the warning, loosing all of the evils into the world (eg, war, hatred). The only object remaining in the box was hope. My editorial will use Pandora’s box as a backdrop for the current situation regarding unproven therapies.</p>
<p>The old patent medicines of the 1800s were a profitable and pernicious business, in which millions of Americans were sold products of unknown safety and efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812441064">1</xref>
</sup> Patent medicines harmed and killed countless babies, children, and adults. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was intended to stop this pervasive and predatory quackery, and did indeed deal it a great blow. However, those supporting unproven therapies fought back. For instance, Congress acted to ensure that at least one form of quackery would survive. Senator Royal Copeland (also a homeopathic physician) inserted a specific loophole in the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempting homeopathic products from the new law that would have required proof of efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812441064">2</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Other forms of quackery were much better controlled for most of the 1900s, but also began to reappear, especially during the “New Age” hippie movement of the 1960s. Quackery mushroomed in establishments known as “health-food” stores that set up shop in malls and city streets throughout America. Pseudomedical practitioners also made inroads into legitimate medicine, including naturopaths, iridologists, herbalists, nutritionists, shamans, ayurvedic purveyors, traditional Chinese healers, magnet and color healers, and countless others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812441064">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Free public access to homeopathic products, health food stores, and a host of assorted pseudomedical practitioners made unproven medical therapies highly profitable in the 1980s and early 1990s. Eyeing the potential profit, supporters of unproven therapies hoped to create a legal climate in which they could repackage cheap weeds as expensive herbal medicines and turn other cheaply obtainable raw materials into “dietary supplements.” But the big stumbling block was the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the diligent federal agency charged with protecting the health of the American public from unproven medications. Thus, pressure built for a law to legitimize and allow widespread sales of herbs and “dietary supplements,” without the oversight of the FDA. Utah became a touchstone for the movement. Utah is known popularly as “cellulose valley” because of the large number of herbal and dietary supplement manufacturers headquartered there. Their champion was Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who championed The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812441064">9</xref>
</sup> When DSHEA was signed into law, FDA’s ability to safeguard the health of the American public was seriously compromised. DSHEA allows herbs and other “dietary supplements” to be sold without proof of safety or efficacy being provided to the FDA for legitimate scientific review before they are marketed.</p>
<p>“Health Fraud products are articles of unproven effectiveness that are promoted to improve health, well being, or appearance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812441064">10</xref>
</sup> By this legal federal definition, all unproven products marketed via the DSHEA are fraudulent, being of unproven efficacy. DSHEA requires dietary supplements to carry a disclaimer explaining the lack of proven efficacy: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.” The disclaimer is not featured prominently on the label in large print but is often buried in small print on the back, being easily overlooked or ignored.</p>
<p>Issues of unproven efficacy aside, what about potential danger to purchasers? DSHEA provides that manufacturers can sell dietary supplements for virtually any medical condition without pretesting for safety on humans or animals. Patients who purchase dietary supplements take the place of the laboratory rats used in legitimate safety research. DSHEA ties the hands of the FDA, empowering it to act against unproven dietary supplements only after patients have already been harmed, a dangerous public health situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812441064">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pandora’s Box is open, and those supporting unproven therapies and medications have sufficient funds to mount advertising campaigns that will surely defeat any attempt to halt their sales. The United States is little better than a third-world country in regard to access to unknown products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812441064">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>DSHEA wrought compelling changes in the ethics of pharmacy. Community pharmacy supports unproven products, driven largely by desire for profit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812441064">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812441064"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812441064"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812441064">16</xref>
</sup> One need only examine the shelves of most chain pharmacies and many independent community pharmacies to see dozens of unproven but highly profitable dietary supplements and homeopathics. The majority of community pharmacy journals and organizations stand solidly behind unproven products, seeming to legitimize this burgeoning source of revenue for their readers.</p>
<p>Some readers of this journal may wonder if their own patients resort to quackery. Suppose, for the sake of argument that a patient wishing to locate information on autism, cerebral palsy, or epilepsy decided to explore the world of “alternative medicine” via their laptop computer. A Google search of “autism natural medicine” yields 2.8 million hits. One website suggests such treatments as <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>, Passiflora, St John’s wort, chamomile, biochemic tissue salts, and flower essences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812441064">17</xref>
</sup> Readers discover on a second website that autism is due to a protozoa, treated through disturbing bacterial biofilms with use of “Nattokinase” and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812441064">18</xref>
</sup> These deceptive statements are never refuted or corrected. They enter cyberspace with a pseudoauthority that appeals to patients searching for any kind of assistance.</p>
<p>Similar searches for cerebral palsy and seizures are no more encouraging. People grasping at straws who should seek help from trained physicians instead place misguided faith in a host of websites promising relief from serious medical conditions. All it takes is faith in their claims and a credit card.</p>
<p>To finish with Pandora, all concerned medical professionals must ask . . . where is the hope? Is there any possibility that the political situation in the United States might once again value the scientific method over unproven hype? It would take a legislator with the courage to stand for the forces of rationality and legitimate scientific medicine. We need a law forcing all purported medicines (including dietary supplements, herbs, and homeopathics) to provide proof of safety and efficacy to the FDA prior to their being marketed, and a swift removal of all products lacking that proof. A solid law would require all advertisements to be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission with accompanying proof of their claims, including documentation of each claim’s approval by the scientists of the FDA. We need laws to force all pseudomedical healers (eg, naturopaths, herbalists, acupuncturists, iridologists, reflexologists, and shamans) to submit their treatments to the light of science, or to fold up their house of cards and head home. We need a law to close all health food stores, herbal shops, and the like, and to halt all pseudomedical practitioners from providing medical advice about any medical condition. We need an FDA empowered to halt sales of unproven medications. The FDA must be given adequate funding and manpower to carry out its mission of protecting the health of the American public.</p>
<p>The public deserves education about this matter. People expect instant miracles from legitimate medicine, refuse to listen to physicians, and believe health food store clerks can offer reliable medical advice.</p>
<p>Information can help ethical medical professionals gain ground in the fight for legitimate medicine. Pediatric neurologists must talk to their patients about dubious therapies and medications, respectfully but firmly regarding the risks and dangers of unproven medications and therapies. They can speak to lay groups, civic groups, religious groups, and in any other venue. Local newspapers may also grant interviews on quackery. It is vital to become familiar with the tactics of quackery through perusing such websites as quackwatch.com. Confronting quackery can be unpleasant for one’s personal life. The author was interviewed for an article in the leading state newspaper.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812441064">19</xref>
</sup> Retaliation from the other side caused personal and professional upheaval. However, even small gains are victories. I am hopeful that pediatric neurologists will place their powerful and highly respected reputations on the line to expose the dangers of unproven medications and therapies.</p>
