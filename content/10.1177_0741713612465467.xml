<abstract>
<p>Learning is generally viewed as a positive process bringing benefits to the individual, leading to growth and self-development. But is this always the case? This article draws on empirical research with refugees and considers the processes of transforming experience and learning that accompanies transition to life in the United Kingdom. I will argue for the importance of social context and nonformal learning, and suggest that models and theories based on transformative learning that ignore context provide only a partial and distorted picture of the learning and identity processes at work for this particular group of immigrants. There is a complexity and depth to the learning that they experience, which calls for an enlarged concept of learning and its potential outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article seeks to illuminate the learning involved as refugees make the transition to life in the United Kingdom. It draws on a broad view of learning that goes beyond the formal and institutional, and indicates that some of the strongest learning comes from what refugees have experienced and practiced informally. It therefore compliments the body of research that has focused on formal learning and the experience of immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612465467">Andersson &amp; Guo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713612465467">Gibb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713612465467">Guo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713612465467">Mojab, 1999</xref>). One of the most significant theories to be drawn on to elucidate the relationship between learning and immigration is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612465467">Mezirow’s (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713612465467">2000)</xref> theory of transformative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713612465467">King, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713612465467">Magro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor, 1994</xref>). This article seeks to challenge conceptualizations that view the outcomes of learning as always positive and bringing benefits to the individual. It suggests that there is a darker side to learning, which is not captured by transformative learning or by other conceptualizations that are underpinned by notions of personal growth, positive change and adaption.</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I outline Mezirow’s theory of transformative learning and the links that have been drawn with immigration and the development of intercultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor, 1994</xref>). One of the criticisms leveled against transformative learning theory is its lack of attention to sociocultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713612465467">Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741713612465467">Taylor, 2007</xref>). I will briefly review the sociolegal context of immigration and integration in the United Kingdom before drawing on research conducted with a group of 10 refugees, all of whom came to the United Kingdom with higher level or professional qualifications. Although participants had come from a range of national and cultural backgrounds, the one feature they shared is their professional and educational background, which was an important source of their identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612465467">Bourdieu’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612465467">1998</xref>) framework of <italic>habitus</italic>, social, cultural and symbolic capital is drawn on to elucidate how movement across social space can establish positions of disadvantage and stymie attempts to rebuild professional and positive identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612465467">Morrice, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the European Commission’s <italic>Memorandum on Lifelong Learning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612465467">Commission of the European Communities, 2000</xref>), I am taking nonformal learning to mean learning that does not generally lead to formalized certificates, for example, learning that occurs in the workplace or through engagement in civil organizations. Informal learning is understood as a “natural accompaniment to everyday life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612465467">Commission of the European Communities, 2000</xref>, p. 8). It is often unintentional and occurs through daily social practices and interactions. However, the boundaries between formal, nonformal, and informal are fluid and can only meaningfully be drawn in relation to particular contexts and for particular purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713612465467">Colley, Hodkinson, &amp; Malcolm, 2003</xref>). The case study highlights the importance of nonformal and informal learning and how the social, cultural, and legal context in which refugees in the United Kingdom find themselves shapes the nature of transformative learning and influences perspective transformation. It points to the need for an enlarged concept of learning, which acknowledges that perspective transformation can involve profound ontological processes and can have negative outcomes.</p>

<title>Learning and Immigration</title>
<p>For refugees movements across social spaces are moments of intense learning as they have to modify the structure and the meaning of their lives as adults and adapt to the new social world. Uprooted from former communities, culture, work, and language they are stripped of aspects of their previous identity. The process of migration disrupts the inherited frames of reference and the accumulated biographical repertoire of knowledge and understanding, and they are forced to learn new behaviors, understand new rules, and to adapt to new values and another type of social organization. Becoming a refugee is therefore a source of deep learning as they confront unexpected changes in their life plans and the need to reshape their lives and reconstruct their identities.</p>
<p>A number of models have been developed to try to elucidate the identity shifts and adaptive processes that occur as immigrants negotiate new and unfamiliar cultural contexts. The focus of these has generally been how individuals develop cultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612465467">Bennett, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713612465467">Hammer, Bennett, &amp; Wiseman, 2003</xref>) or cultural intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713612465467">Earley &amp; Ang, 2003</xref>). The assumption being that adaption to new cultural contexts is developmental and that the individual’s sense of identity, confidence, and self-esteem increases over time. For example, Bennett’s Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity suggests that as the interpretation of cultural differences becomes more complex, the migrants’ understanding of their own and other cultures, and consequently their intercultural competence, is increased. The model is designed along a continuum from ethnocentric to ethnorelative. As individuals move along the continuum they become more interculturally competent and revise their frame of reference to make it more inclusive of cultural concepts and understandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612465467">Bennett, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor (1994)</xref> points to the lack of research that brings a learning perspective to bear on the adaptive processes that immigrants undergo as they make the transition to living in a new cultural context. He suggests that Mezirow’s theory of transformative learning provides a useful model for understanding the development of intercultural competence and identifies three dimensions that link the two sets of literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713612465467">Mezirow (2000)</xref> defines transformative learning as
<disp-quote>
<p>the process by which we transform our taken-for-granted frames of reference (meaning perspectives, habits of mind, mind-sets) to make them more inclusive, discriminating, open, emotionally capable of change, and reflective so that they may generate beliefs and opinions that will prove more true or justified to guide action. (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A central proposition is that when an individual’s “frame of reference” or “meaning perspective” is discordant with their experience, a “disorientating dilemma occurs,” individuals begin to critically reflect on and question the validity of their inherited meaning perspective, and transformation of perspective can occur. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor (1994)</xref> links this to the notion of “culture shock” in the intercultural competency literature. He suggests that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612465467">Mezirow’s (1990)</xref> 10 stages of perspective transformation are analogous to the movement from lower to higher levels of cultural competency. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor (1994)</xref> highlights the similarities in outcomes with the intercultural competency literature emphasizing higher levels of integration and adaptation, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612465467">Bennett (1993)</xref> refers to as <italic>ethnorelativism</italic>, and transformative learning theory’s emphasis on the emergence of a “superior perspective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612465467">Mezirow, 1990</xref>, p. 14). This notion of individual development is encapsulated in Mezirow’s final two phases of learning, which are “[b]uilding competence and self-confidence in new roles and relationships . . . [and] a reintegration into one’s life on the basis of conditions dictated by ones new perspective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612465467">Mezirow, 1994</xref>, p. 224). A key supposition about the learning that occurs as immigrants make the transition to life in a new cultural context is that there will be positive change as they become better adapted to the environment. Mezirow’s work has been used in other studies with immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713612465467">King, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713612465467">Magro, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion that learning occurs when individuals are faced with situations that are new and unfamiliar, or where they are confronted with what they do not know and perhaps need to know, is not confined to transformative learning theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612465467">Jarvis (2006)</xref> suggests that the disjuncture between biography and experience is at the start of all learning. He describes episodes where “our biographical repertoire is no longer sufficient to cope automatically with our situation, so that our unthinking harmony with our world is disturbed and we feel unease” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612465467">Jarvis, 2006</xref>, p. 16). He goes on to suggest that the need to try to reestablish harmony “may be amongst the most important motivating factors for most individuals to learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612465467">Jarvis, 2006</xref>, p. 77). In a recent article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612465467">Newman (2012)</xref> has questioned whether transformative learning is indeed fundamentally different in kind from other learning, or whether it is merely an aspect of adult learning. Concluding that “any learning effectively done involves reassessment and growth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612465467">Newman, 2012</xref>, p. 40), he argues that we should abandon the term <italic>transformative learning</italic> and replace it with the term <italic>good learning</italic>. My concern here is not whether transformative learning differs in degree or kind from other forms of learning, it is to highlight the assumption underpinning the transformative model, and shared more broadly in conceptualizations of learning, that positive outcomes invariably accompany learning. Implicit in all of these understandings is the sense that learning is about change for the better and that somehow it is always a good thing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612465467">Jarvis (2006)</xref>, for example, suggests that learning “plumbs the depth of human existence-in-the-world. We are always both being-in-the-world and becoming, developing, growing, maturing” (p. 14).</p>
<p>In his review of the empirical literature on transformative learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741713612465467">Taylor (2007)</xref> highlighted the importance of recognizing that transformative learning may not always have positive outcomes for the individual. He pointed to the need to broaden the definitional outcomes of perspective transformation to include the potential for a more negative impact on identity and conceptions of self. His review also drew attention to the lack of research into the sociocultural factors that shape the transformative experience. Instead, much of the empirical research has focused on the individual, while tending to ignore contextual factors such as previous life experiences and the social space in which individuals are living and learning. Related to this is the paucity of studies that have explored perspective transformation from informal learning and nonformal educational settings; most studies have been located in formal education settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741713612465467">Taylor, 2007</xref>). Picking up on some of these points, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713612465467">Naughton and Schied (n.d.)</xref> draw on a wide range of contexts and human experiences to argue for recognition that transformative learning can lead to processes and outcomes that are less than benign. They suggest that the discourse of transformative learning has become appropriated as “a metonym for a process that goes only toward what can be described as a ‘positive’ direction or outcome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713612465467">Naughton and Schied, n.d</xref>., p. 339). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713612465467">Kiely’s (2004)</xref> study of the long-term impact of perspective transformation from an international service-learning program questions the assumption that new perspectives can be “reintegrated” into people’s lives in a straightforward and uncomplicated way. For students in his study there was a long-term struggle inherent in perspective transformation.</p>
<p>It is this body of literature that calls for greater attention to the sociocultural context, to the nonformal learning that occurs across diverse social sites, and recognition that learning might not always lead to positive outcomes that this article contributes to. It also supports arguments put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612465467">Mojab and Carpenter (2011)</xref> that stress the need for learning and educational programs to recognize the material conditions and struggles of people’s lives. Rejecting the notion that learning can be theorized as an abstract cognitive experience without attenuating social processes, they draw on the concept of “learning by dispossession” to describe the process of “disconnecting and dislocating both educators and learners from their material reality of war, militarisation, occupation, social inequality and poverty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612465467">Mojab &amp; Carpenter, 2011</xref>, p. 560). While the thrust of their argument is to expose the ideological nature of citizenship programs, the understanding that learning involves a complex mediation of social experience and meaning making from which learners should not be “dispossessed” is relevant to the argument here. The following section outlines the sociolegal context in which those seeking asylum in the United Kingdom are placed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741713612465467">
<title>The U.K. Context: Policy and Public Discourses</title>
<p>The formal definition of a refugee, set out in the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951, is based on individuals fleeing persecution and is the basis for international refugee law. It defines a refugee as a person who
<disp-quote>
<p>owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted . . . is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . . . (Article 1 A(2) cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741713612465467">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The legal definition of a refugee is used in contrast to asylum seeker, which refers to a person who has applied for asylum but whose application has not yet been concluded. The UNHCR estimate that the United Kingdom offers protection to approximately 3% of the world’s refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741713612465467">UNHCR, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are significant differences between the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of the granting of asylum and the reception and services provided on arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713612465467">Noll &amp; van Selm, 2003</xref>). In the United States, the great majority of refugees arrive through resettlement programs—permission to immigrate to the United States is applied for while the individual is still abroad. Once resettlement has been approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), the resettled refugees are automatically eligible to work and to receive public aid and medical assistance for up to 8 months. A much smaller minority, less than a quarter, apply for asylum once in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713612465467">Li &amp; Batalova, 2011</xref>). This contrasts with the United Kingdom where a little over one tenth of all those granted refugee status or leave to remain arrive through resettlement programs, the majority arrive as asylum seekers at the U.K. border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612465467">Home Office, 2009</xref>). Once in the United Kingdom, they must apply to the U.K. Border Agency where their application is assessed to see whether they meet the criteria set down in the UN Convention.</p>
<p>Over the past decade increasingly severe restrictions have been imposed on those who come to the United Kingdom seeking asylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612465467">Flyn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741713612465467">Somerville, 2007</xref>). U.K. policy discourses around refugees, and to an even greater degree asylum seekers, is underpinned by the notion that they are a problematic group who first need to be controlled and second need to be changed if they are to become good citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612465467">Morrice, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741713612465467">Yuval-Davis, Anthias, &amp; Kofman, 2005</xref>). Asylum seekers are not eligible for welfare services and are excluded from the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713612465467">Home Office, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612465467">2000</xref>). Those who do not have independent means, or family and friends who can support them, are dispersed to hostels around the country while their claim is processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612465467">Home Office, 2009</xref>). Asylum seekers are excluded from English for Speakers of Other Languages classes and other publicly funded education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713612465467">LSC, 2007</xref>). The net result of these policies is to promote the perception of those seeking asylum as a burden on the community rather than as an asset or potential resource. It also gives rise to a period of time where asylum seekers are left in limbo, unable to begin the process of resettlement. This delay in accessing training and employment opportunities can result in loss of skills, confidence, and self esteem; the longer the period of inactivity and exclusion from mainstream activities the more difficult integration becomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713612465467">Bloch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713612465467">Waddington, 2005</xref>). Only once asylum seekers receive a positive decision on their application from the U.K. Border Agency and gain refugee status can integration begin.</p>
<p>Alongside this policy discourse there is significant hostility surrounding asylum issues in public discourses. Reporting of asylum issues by U.K. newspapers is regularly cited by refugee support organizations as one of the biggest problems affecting the quality of life of refugees and asylum seekers in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713612465467">Information Centre about Asylum and Refugees, 2004</xref>). Research into public attitudes around asylum conducted by the Independent Asylum Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713612465467">Hobson, Cox, &amp; Sagovsky, 2008</xref>) found that only 18% of people in their survey viewed the term <italic>asylum</italic> positively. Their research found that the majority of respondents held negative views about those who come to the United Kingdom seeking asylum, including that they were here to “steal jobs and scrounge on welfare,” that they received “preferential treatment in the allocation of housing and public services,” and were “a threat to British culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713612465467">Hobson et al., 2008</xref>, p. 14). The report concluded that overall, the treatment of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom fell “seriously below the standards to be expected of a humane and civilized society.”</p>
<p>Both policy and social discourses represent refugees as problematic and a source of social problems. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612465467">Bourdieu’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612465467">1998)</xref> framework, it can be argued that discourses are schemes of perception and classification that symbolically construct refugees as inferior and ensure that relations of subordination and domination are established and maintained. Direct violence or overt discrimination can be dispensed with; the subordinate positioning of marginalized groups such as refugees is reproduced through structures of perception and appreciation that are presented as natural. These systems ensure that refugees are constructed as lacking in qualities necessary to generate valuations of being good citizens. Faced with symbolic disparagement, refugees are stymied in their ability to articulate positive and meaningful subjectivities and identities for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713612465467">Morrice, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With this sociocultural context in mind, we can now turn to consider how refugees manage these constructions and revise their understanding and interpretations about the world around them.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The research was conducted between 2005 and 2010 at the University of Sussex on the South coast of England. It combined a longitudinal study with a life history approach to explore the learning and identity processes that accompany transition and, second, to understand how individual biography shapes and informs the strategies adopted by refugees in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612465467">Morrice, 2011</xref>). The data from 10 refugees, 6 men and 4 women, of different nationalities, are drawn on for the purpose of this article. Four from Iraq, two from Ethiopia, three from Iraq, and one from Zimbabwe. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741713612465467">Table 1</xref> sets out the participants (all of whom were given pseudonyms), their relevant demographic backgrounds, and premigration occupations. All have good levels of English and were aged between 24 and 48 years at the start of the research. Participants were recruited from a University of Sussex course that was designed specifically to support refugees who wished to access higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713612465467">Morrice, 2009</xref>). Forty past students were invited to participate and the sample was self-selecting. Initial interviews usually took place within a year of arrival in the United Kingdom and were conducted every 6 to 9 months thereafter. A total of 58 interviews were conducted over a 4-year period.</p>

<p>Occupations since arriving in the United Kingdom are listed chronologically. Many of the participants had engaged in voluntary work; for reasons of space voluntary work is not recorded here.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Stories were collected in the tradition of life history method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612465467">Armstrong, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612465467">Bertaux, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713612465467">Plummer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741713612465467">Yow, 2005</xref>). The value of this method is its focus on the individual’s subjective reality and its “attempts to locate individuals in their overall life experiences as well as their broader social-historical backgrounds in which they live” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612465467">Armstrong, 1987</xref>, p. 10). A guide identifying broad topics to be covered was used for each interview. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741713612465467">Yow (2005)</xref> describes, this is a plan for the interview, but at the same time does not limit the narrator to those topics if there are others that they wish to raise during the course of the interview. In recognition of the fact that the participants in the study were refugees and had experienced degrees of fear, persecution, loss, and separation, I avoided a traditional life history approach of asking participants to recount their life story at the first interview. Rather, the initial interview was a “real-time” interview and concerned life and experiences in the United Kingdom; only once a level of trust had been established did we move to the in-depth interview about life prior to the United Kingdom. In reality, of course, many of the interviews did not fall neatly into either only being about the past, or only being in real time. Instead, most involved some interweaving of past stories and memories with the present. For the initial interview, which invited participants to talk about their life since arriving in the United Kingdom, the same guide was used for each participant. The second interview invited participants to talk about their life prior to coming to the United Kingdom. Subsequent interviews consisted of a mix of broad, open-ended questions that were standard to all participants, combined with specific questions for each participant that picked up elements of their story and themes from earlier interviews.</p>
<p>Each interview lasted just over an hour and all participants were invited to check the interview transcripts and to make any amendments or deletions to their story. A thematic narrative analysis was employed to analyze interview data and generate findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713612465467">Plummer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713612465467">Riessman, 2008</xref>). This method of analysis is primarily concerned with the content of the narrative rather than precisely how a narrative is structured, and it values keeping the “story” intact for interpretive purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713612465467">Reissman, 2008</xref>). Each interview was examined to identify emerging themes and concepts; over time newly gained data were analyzed with an eye to both particular theoretical themes and concepts that had evolved from earlier analysis and those that were found new in the later transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713612465467">Plummer, 2001</xref>). As each case study was constructed, cross-case analysis was employed to identify common thematic elements across research participants. As part of the narrative analysis, I recorded my personal reflections after each interview to foster ongoing reflexivity and methodological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713612465467">Riessman, 2008</xref>). The temporal aspect afforded by the longitudinal method provides opportunity to identify coherence and consistency in narratives and at the same time can capture moments in time when the cohesive narrative presentations and theorizations of self might become disrupted or challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713612465467">Plumridge &amp; Thomson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741713612465467">Thomson &amp; Holland 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings are presented under three themes: learning to adapt, learning to live in the asylum system, and learning who and what you are not.</p>
<sec id="section5-0741713612465467">
<title>Learning in the New Cultural Context</title>
<p>Like many migrants one of the major themes in participants’ stories, particularly in the early narratives after their arrival, was the different cultural, social, and political values and assumptions that they encountered in the United Kingdom. The theme of adapting to new cultural beliefs and expectations was particularly pronounced where participants were from a culture that was very different from the U.K. culture. To use Mezirow’s framework, the historically and culturally constructed meaning schemes that participants brought with them did not sit comfortably in U.K. society and culture. This disjuncture triggers a disorientating dilemma, which is the first phase of perspective transformation and corresponds to the culture shock in the intercultural competency models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713612465467">Taylor, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Savalan ran his own business in Iran. He came to the United Kingdom in 2004, and after working for several years as a security guard in nightclubs he gained a place on an undergraduate business degree program. He describes Iran as “a prison and all the people are prisoners” with little understanding of other cultures. His expectations of the United Kingdom had been shaped by television in Iran, and he relates how he had expected everyone to be carrying guns and walking the streets with laptops. He talks of the culture shock he experienced on arrival:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everything was numb. For 45 days I was numb in Dover, I didn’t fear because I was like shocked. I couldn’t see properly what was going on and the first three months. . . . You see the boxers they box, one of them punch and they can’t see. You are shocked. I was like that . . . coming here and, you know, facing gay people. We haven’t got gay people, we haven’t got lesbians. Like I saw two men kissing each other and I was like, “What’s going on here?” But it was very interesting, you go somewhere and you face something that you never experienced.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Savalan vividly portrays the “disorientating dilemma” and the challenges to his tacit assumptions he experienced when confronted with unexpected and disconcerting aspects of U.K. culture. His narrative went on to emphasize the enormous amount of informal and incidental learning that living in a new culture demands. He would watch cultural celebrations on television and programs about everyday lives and practices to understand and learn about the country he was now living. Every new word that he came across was carefully written down and learnt.</p>
<p>The shock of a new culture was less intense for Maryam, an engineering teacher from Iraq. Before the Ba’ath Party placed restrictions on her family’s movements she had travelled in both Europe and the United States. She worked in a shop for the first 7 years after arrival in the United Kingdom while she struggled to obtain visas for her husband and two older children to join her. With her family reunited she eventually entered higher education to retrain as a teacher. She describes Iraq as being a “closed culture” where the political, cultural, and religious context was tightly circumscribed. She describes how the political and religious ideas put forward by the Government of her country “grow in your mind” and how difficult it is to comprehend and adapt to the ideas and culture of a more open and permissive society. In contrast to being a tourist where you “watch” and “see” a different life, actually living in a new culture involves more active learning.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So when I arrived here I didn’t think about UK, any European country I will reach I will be melted with them, I will grow, I will try my best to grow my children and to live like them in peace, this is what I think. So when I reached England I think I need to know everything about this culture . . . about their system, about everything in the life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Savalan, Maryam’s description suggests a process of critically reflecting on previously held assumptions and purposefully transforming her frame of reference: adopting new roles and ways of acting both in her relationship with her children and her husband and also to blend into wider U.K. society.</p>
<p>Acting strategically to create situations where they might develop new understandings and perspectives was a theme in many of the interviews. Yoseph had just graduated from higher education in Ethiopia when, facing discrimination in the labor market because of his Eritrean background, he fled to the United Kingdom. He immediately enrolled at a local college with a view to eventually gaining a place in higher education. He clearly recognizes the importance of building diverse social networks and the informal learning that occurs within them.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I met [a fellow Ethiopian] at college. Honestly speaking I wasn’t very interested. I am in England now and I have to mix with English people. If I keep always with my people I won’t learn anything. I want to learn English language better and I want to learn English culture and mentality. I want to mix and be part of this society, but if you keep always with your own people it is very difficult. They drag you back and you will never improve, because most of the things they know, you know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Coming to terms with gender differences was a common theme in narratives. Said, a mechanical engineer from Iraq, had given up all hope of working in a skilled or professional role and was working as a maintenance engineer or “odd job” person to support his family. He describes how in Iraq it would be “shameful” and “shocking” to see a woman walking in the street smoking a cigarette. But “here, when you walk it is something normal.” He went on to say how important it was to have the opportunity to discuss and explore such cultural differences with other people because it is only through talking about such differences that you can understand them.</p>
<p>The learning described above, where, when faced with a new and different culture refugees have to critically assess their assumptions, plan a course of action to deal with their new situation, and acquire new knowledge and skills in order to implement their plans, fits with Mezirow’s (1991) understanding of transformative learning. Disjuncture or disharmony ultimately leads to greater cultural awareness, greater confidence, and competence in dealing with the new social context. It also fits with the intercultural competency literature of how, over time, individuals revise their frames of reference and develop greater cultural competency. However, there was also deeper and more profound learning occurring as refugees moved through the asylum system and attempted to reestablish careers in the United Kingdom. Refugees have to learn the social scripts of what it means to be an asylum seeker and then a refugee. This learning was particularly profound and insidious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741713612465467">
<title>Learning in the Asylum System: Illegal Working and Refugee Identity</title>
<p>As set out earlier, the majority of refugees enter the United Kingdom as asylum seekers and undergo a period of waiting while their asylum claim is processed by the U.K. Border Agency. All participants were eventually granted refugee status, but some of the earlier interviews capture the experience of being an asylum seeker. While waiting for their claim to be determined, asylum seekers are not permitted to attend English language classes, and they are not permitted to work and are not eligible for welfare benefits. This leaves them in a very precarious position, and participants’ early narratives as asylum seekers illuminate the conflict between the ideal or imagined identities that they hoped to create, and the reality of an identity that restricts their entitlements and access to economic, educational, and other positive identity resources.</p>
<p>Patricia came from a family of teachers in Zimbabwe: Her father had been a head teacher, her mother and most of her siblings had been teachers. She fled to the United Kingdom on her own, leaving behind her family including her three children. She waited 9 months for her asylum claim to be settled. Having arrived in the United Kingdom with very little money but unwilling to be dispersed to live in a hostel she had no option but to work illegally in order to pay rent, bills and buy food.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yes it was illegal, it was illegal. That’s what I’m saying, I’m not sure whether they didn’t know that this was illegal because obviously they didn’t even see my passport, but they still gave me a job. . . . I didn’t even have a bank account, I was using this lady, who I used to live with, I was using her bank account. . . . Not even anybody back home can ever imagine me or anyone doing that. There’s no way you can actually make anyone understand what you went through. There’s no way. The lies that you tell, the anxiety, oh goodness, it was really . . . its funny looking back now and you think “My goodness, how did I do all that, how did I get away with that?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although none of the participants in the research drew attention in their narrative to having taken paid employment while waiting for their asylum claim to be processed, a significant proportion had done so, and for all of them it was a source of shame. Effectively they became circumstantial law breakers—adopting identities and learning behaviors that were very far from anything they could have imagined prior to coming to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Given the social and political discourses around asylum issues, it is not surprising that for the majority of participants in the research the identity of both asylum seeker and refugee was an identity associated with vulnerability and shame. When asked if there was anything that had surprised him about life in the United Kingdom, Yoseph from Ethiopia replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah; the asylum process . . . people don’t like asylum seekers. They don’t like you if they know you’re an asylum seeker. People generally think that asylum seekers should be poor, dirty and illiterate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The difference in entitlements and security makes the status of refugee greatly preferable. Yet being a refugee was still something to be kept hidden. Savalan’s response to being asked about the identity of refugee was typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it was a big worry if people asked me “what are you doing here?” What can I say because, like I am a refugee but I have got respect for myself, I don’t want to be down in front of people. . . . So I prefer not telling them why I am here and what for. . . . They never say this refugee did something good. Everything what they say about refugees is bad.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Farideh had graduated from Iran with a degree in nutritional science. She had worked in a hospital for 8 years before she had to unexpectedly flee Iran bringing nothing with her except the clothes she was wearing. She explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>As a refugee I felt you are living somewhere that you don’t belong to. Especially English people; they are not very interested with communicating with. . . . I can’t say foreign people, it’s asylum seekers. What can I say . . . there is not a good perception of refugees, the view is not good of refugees. . . . When I speak to English people the first question they ask me is “When do you intend to go back?” What can I say? I think English people trust the media. It affects people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Learning how to find work in the illegal economy, how to avoid situations or conversations where they might be asked about their status in the United Kingdom was a major concern for participants. Through the media, through encounters with others, negative stereotypes and meanings are assimilated and learnt informally. This learning constitutes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741713612465467">Sayer (2007)</xref> has referred to as “informal moral education” and affects both objective and subjective well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741713612465467">
<title>Learning What and Who You Are Not: Loss of Respect and Professional Identity</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741713612465467">Table 1</xref> indicates, all the refugees had been in full-time professional occupations before coming to the United Kingdom, or in the case of Joseph had just graduated from higher education. They arrived with expectations of reestablishing professional identities and securing employment in the same or similar professions. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612465467">Bourdieu’s (1977)</xref> framework, each was from a <italic>habitus</italic>, which brought particular dispositions and which framed expectations in the new social space. The <italic>habitus</italic> they were born into and the cultural and social capital acquired had enabled them to move quite smoothly through education and into professional positions in the country they had grown up in. However, migration involves the movement to a new social space where capital accumulated was not necessarily recognized as legitimate and did not have exchange value.</p>
<p>The sense of loss of social status and financial independence was acute as each of the participants was obliged to find work in the low skilled and often casual labor market. This included working in care homes, as maintenance workers, delivering fast food, working in catering and cleaning, as security guards, and as traffic wardens. Realizing that the cultural capital that had enabled them to achieve professional, social, and economic success in their own country was not valued in the United Kingdom was a painful and bitter experience. There was recognition of the very real issues about occupational competences and the need to re-skill, and there was willingness to “top-up” qualifications and to retrain where necessary, but not to start from scratch as if they had no previous qualifications or experience. Maryam, who had 15 years of teaching experience, describes her experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t know the system, what to do, where to go. I wanted to teach. I asked many people . . . one person told me to start again; that would take four years. . . . That’s not very good for me to start over again at university, particularly with the family and at my age. It’s humiliating for me, what would my family say? They wouldn’t understand why I had to start over again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alan, an Iranian Kurd, had a degree in civil engineering and had worked for 3 years before he left Iran. He was in his mid-20s in 2003 when he arrived and describes his disappointment at not being able to practice his profession:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was a civil engineer in my country and worked as a civil engineer. So when I came to this country I found I couldn’t get any job with my Iranian qualifications. . . . I didn’t want to start at the beginning and study all these things that I’d already studied again, and I didn’t really want to do any other job. I’ve seen other people who had qualification from their country and they do other jobs like making a business or working in a pizza shop or factory rather than in their own specialism, and I didn’t want to be like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sadly, a great many refugees in the United Kingdom do end up working in low skilled, casual work unrelated to their past experience or qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713612465467">Jonker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713612465467">Houghton &amp; Morrice, 2008</xref>). The U.K. Home Office found that almost a third of refugees entering the United Kingdom had university qualifications and more than 37% were in professional or managerial occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713612465467">Kirk, 2004</xref>). Despite these high levels of human capital, unemployment and underemployment among refugees remains high. The U.K. Department for Work and Pensions estimate that the national average is around 36% unemployment for refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713612465467">Bloch, 2002</xref>). A number of studies outside of the United Kingdom have exposed highly educated immigrants’ experience of deskilling and lack of recognition of their prior learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713612465467">Guo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713612465467">Mojab, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612465467">Andersson and Guo (2009)</xref> track the source of this devaluation of prior learning and work experience to epistemological misperceptions that conflates difference with deficiency, inferiority, and hence renders overseas credentials, especially those from the third world, invalid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612465467">Andersson &amp; Guo, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accustomed to earning a living to support themselves and family members, being unemployed, and living off of state benefits was a source of shame for participants in the research. Abel had worked as a judge in Ethiopia. Arriving with fairly good levels of English language he was keen to start working and supporting his family immediately, regardless of the status of the work. He had been applying unsuccessfully for what he described as “simple jobs”—stacking shelves in supermarkets, laboring and so on. He described his frustration at the loss of respect he felt at not being able to secure a job:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know in our culture you lose your self-respect, even within your family, once you end up just getting benefits. It is a big difference here. There [Ethiopia] I just lived in my own home and I just live on my own earnings, here I am just living as a beggar. That’s what I’m learning here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At times Abel felt that his lack of success in the job market was due to racism. He describes how he had applied for a job at a local supermarket stacking shelves. He was given an interview and observed doing the job, and he had left feeling confident that he had performed well. Disappointed when he received a letter of rejection and keen to learn from his experience he asked for feedback:
<disp-quote>
<p>And I went back and I asked her to give me the feedback and she said that the budget has been scrapped. I asked “Is that because I’m Black or because I’m African?” But she didn’t answer, she just said that she’d given the job to someone else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After almost 2 years Abel did eventually get a job as a traffic warden and achieve the financial independence he sought. It was a far cry from his previous job in Ethiopia and the respect and social status that had accompanied that role.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t want to stay on the benefits. That’s the best thing about the job. That’s why I’m doing it. Someone has to do it, although I resent it, having to do it. The public resent it, but still it is a job to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant, Amir, came to the United Kingdom in 2003 with a degree in industrial management from Iran. Having completed his studies he had be running the family’s paint factory, exporting paint all over the world. He felt the reason he had been unable to secure employment was that he was overly qualified for the positions he was applying for:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve spent 14 months looking for work. Forty to 45 applications each week. These are very low level jobs compared to my experience and qualifications. . . They are afraid of you because the manager working there doesn’t have much experience of managing, or much education. You threaten his position.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accepting lower status employment often involved retraining in a new career. Zeinab came to the United Kingdom with a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Baghdad, Iraq. Her husband, who had completed his PhD at the University of Oxford, was also struggling to find employment. Like many refugees she had accepted that her human capital was not recognized and that she would have to find alternative career opportunities in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know, it’s a big change for us. . . . I have an experience for more than 20 years from design and chemical engineer, also my husband. But now we are looking for jobs and we, what we say, we suffered a lot to find jobs equivalent to what we have in the past. . . . I’m doing teacher training now. I will teach maths in schools. I have no choice; it’s the only job I can do. My experience is in research; research and design, that’s my dream. . . . It’s a big, big loss. But I say the good thing is my husband and my son is safe now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These narratives indicate a “darker” side to becoming a refugee that transformative learning cannot accommodate. The learning outlined here does not lead to positive outcomes; rather, it is concerned with having to unlearn and let go of much of who and what they were. A significant part of their experience involved learning to accept that their cultural capital was not recognized and had little, if any, exchange value. It also involved learning to live with loss of professional identity and the social status and respect that accompanied their premigration identity. For most it had involved periods of unemployment and dependence on welfare benefits; for some this loss of financial independence continued over a period of many years.</p>

<sec id="section8-0741713612465467" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In comparing the countries they had come from with the United Kingdom both Savalan and Maryam echo Mezirow’s language of “imprisonment” and “escape” (Mezirow, 1978, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612465467">Newman, 2012</xref>). Savalan refers to Iran as a being a “prison” with little understanding of other cultures and other ways of being; Mayam talks of a “closed culture” where Government ideas “grow in your mind.” Like previous studies that have considered immigration and learning there was significant learning in all of the participants’ narratives, which resulted in perspective transformation, positive change, and adaption. However, this provides only a partial picture of the learning and identity processes at work. The learning did not end with the development of cultural competence and did not involve a “reintegration into one’s life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612465467">Mezirow, 1994</xref>, p. 224). On entering the United Kingdom, participants were placed in the asylum system, which I have suggested constructs and positions those seeking asylum as being problematic. Excluded from economic, educational, and other positive identity resources many, like Patricia, learnt how to break the law to enter informal and semilegal employment. This was a source of shame for participants and made it hard for them to generate valuations of being good and moral subjects. We saw how the powerful discourses surrounding asylum seekers and refugees impose negative social definitions and associations that are assimilated and learned informally from the media, from encounters with others, and their expectations and assumptions. These discourses ensured that participants learnt that to be an asylum seeker/refugee is to be disparaged and stigmatized.</p>
<p>The refugees in this study learnt that the cultural and social capital that had enabled them to move into professional roles in their country of origin was not recognized as legitimate in the United Kingdom. Opportunities to build on existing qualifications were rarely available, instead most experienced significant periods of unemployment and dependence on welfare benefits, what Abel refers to as learning to “liv[e] as a beggar.” If they eventually managed to secure employment it was most often in unskilled and manual work. The loss of professional identity and the social status, respect, and financial independence that accompanied it was acutely felt. Toward the end of the 4-year study period, six of the participants had secured places in higher education to retrain, either in the same professional area as they had occupied prior to migration or in a new employment field. Although sometimes this involved accepting employment of lower status, as in the case of Zeinab who gave up her dream of continuing as a researcher and university lecturer to train as a teacher, “the only job I can do.” Two of the participants, Alan and Abel, had taken higher education courses but had, as yet, failed to secure employment in their field. Two, Amir and Said, were unemployed or in manual or semiskilled employment, areas of work they believed they would remain in. This learning involves a critical assessment of assumptions and exploration of new options, but the outcomes are not benign or positive as in transformative learning and other conceptualizations of learning that stress ongoing construction of self and the need to “reestablish harmony” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612465467">Jarvis, 2006</xref>). The process is more about identity deconstruction and involves learning who and what they are not.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is clear that becoming a refugee involves significant learning. Some of the transformations enable the individual to develop cultural competence and better adapt to the new sociocultural space. However, there is a deeper underbelly of learning that is not captured by transformative learning and other theories of learning that stress positive outcomes, personal development, and growth. Through social activity and interaction, refugees constructed meaning, learn, and internalize the social identity of refugee. They faced varying degrees of hostility and racism in their daily lives, which affected subjectivities and sense of self. Interlocking messages from immigration policy and broader public discourses shaped the transformative and learning experience. Learning what it means to be a refugee raised fundamental ontological issues about how they make sense of the world and who and what they could be in the world. There is a complexity and depth to the learning that refugees experience, which is not always a straightforward process of building on previous learning, neither is it necessarily positive or beneficial. Rather, it is contradictory and largely deconstructive. Much learning is concerned with recognizing that their previous learning counts for very little and involves having to “unlearn” and let go of much of who and what they were; it is concerned with subjectivity and with identity <italic>de</italic>construction. The case study of refugees has underlined how transformative learning not only involves epistemological processes of changing ways of thinking and changes how the world is perceived, but it can also involve a more profound ontological process where individuals have to adjust their sense of who they are and what they can be in the world. It has demonstrated the importance of considering the social and cultural factors that shape the transformative experience and highlights the need for learning theories to recognize the potential disbenefits and negative outcomes of learning on identity and conceptions of self.</p>
