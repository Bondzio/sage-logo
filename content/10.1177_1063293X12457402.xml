<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the rapidly increasing volume of today’s global manufacturing resources, the enterprises are required to participate in a global supply chain and collaborate with each other to provide core competencies and exploit advantageous resources. Consequently, the enterprises are increasingly faced with the challenges of efficient resource location or discovery in distributed manufacturing environments.</p>
<p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X12457402">Duke et al., 2005</xref>) has been widely recognized as a promising approach to overcome the barriers of technical interoperability of distributed resources by eliminating the technical discrepancy of different software, platforms, and infrastructures within an enterprise or across geographically distributed enterprises. On the other hand, the Semantic Web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12457402">Berners-Lee et al., 2001</xref>) provides an ontological foundation that overcomes the barriers of semantic interoperability of distributed resources by eliminating the involved data heterogeneity. As an explicit, formal specification of a shared conceptualization of a domain of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X12457402">Gruber, 1993</xref>), ontologies have been widely used in many domains of human life and work to support semantic interoperability between different organizations. The combination of SOA and Semantic Web leads to the Semantic Web service (SWS) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X12457402">McIlraith et al., 2001</xref>) that enables the efficient, service-oriented integration and discovery of distributed resources across disparate business processes. Consequently, the semantic service-oriented, distributed manufacturing applications can integrate the distributed manufacturing resources of participating enterprises by publishing, discovering, and sharing heterogeneous manufacturing services in a meaningful and accurate way to compete favorably in the rapidly changing global market. Each manufacturing service can be enriched by adding semantic information with Web Ontology Languages for Services (OWL-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12457402">Martin et al., 2004</xref>) ontology.</p>
<p>However, in distributed manufacturing environments, the service interoperation across enterprise boundaries is scalable, loosely coupled, self-organizing and unpredictable, and lack support of a centralized management middleware. In this case, distributed manufacturing enterprises may have to play roles of decentralized service middleware in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner to realize cross-enterprise collaboration.</p>
<p>In this article, we present an ontology-based service-oriented P2P architecture for semantic discovery of manufacturing services across virtual enterprises in distributed manufacturing environments. The proposed architecture has provided a seamless integration of SWS and P2P architectures, which facilitates the efficient, service-oriented integration and discovery of distributed manufacturing resources and achieves highly scalable coupling and collaboration across distributed virtual enterprises. The P2P interaction is deployed on top of a distributed hash table (DHT)-based protocol called Chord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12457402">Stoica et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Each enterprise exhibits as a peer that publishes sharable manufacturing services through its private service registry. The peers sharing similar ontological interests through ontological directory are clustered together, and the most reputed peer is elected as the super peer through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters. Then, a “super peer”–based P2P overlay network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12457402">Yang and Garcia-Molina, 2003</xref>) is formed.</p>
<p>All super peers form a reputed DHT-based structured P2P overlay, and the leaf peers are communicated with and controlled by respective super peers. Each super peer maintains a finger table of its friend peers, which may route the service request to the target super peer who or whose leaf peer hosts the requested service. Then, a manufacturing service request can be first routed to the suitable super peer through structured indexing, and further to its leaf peer through client/server communication, thus supporting efficient service discovery.</p>
<p>In order to validate the implementation of the proposed architecture, it has been applied in a proof-of-concept manufacturing scenario in practical industrial application, where the operation of the system has been demonstrated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1063293X12457402">
<title>Related study</title>
<p>In the past decade, the emerging SOA has presented a potentially feasible solution to the manufacturing resource integration, in the form of service-oriented manufacturing through service discovery, and attracted increasing research interests. The current research to manufacturing service discovery can be classified into two categories: centralized and decentralized approaches.</p>
<sec id="section3-1063293X12457402">
<title>Centralized approaches to manufacturing service discovery</title>
<p>The service registry has been widely utilized for service matchmaking and retrieval, and contributes to the centralized publication and discovery of Web services. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X12457402">Goel et al. (2008)</xref> presented an application of a distributed SOA for the preliminary design of gas turbines, which is based on the concept of registration and discovery of services in real time. During the design process, a one-dimensional analysis code is wrapped into a service using a standard interface, which is then discovered for optimization of a turbine where multiple services are executed in parallel. In order to share computer-aided design (CAD) assembly data among manufacturing systems participating in collaborative product development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X12457402">Byung et al. (2011)</xref> proposed the concept of parallel Web service, which can accelerate the retrieval of CAD assembly data, along with the application of parallel processing. The prevalent Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry was used to publish and discover the Web services for CAD in a centralized architecture. However, centralized service registries including UDDI lack the ontological support to store semantic information about Web services, thus inhibiting the efficient, accurate, and automatic discovery of the required Web services, such as manufacturing services in service-oriented, distributed manufacturing environments.</p>
<p>Recently, some research efforts on SWS management have provided an ontological support for semantics-based manufacturing service discovery that addresses the above-mentioned issue. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12457402">Jiang et al. (2008)</xref> extended the UDDI registry specification to include OWL-based semantic descriptions about manufacturing services and to support reasoning of those descriptions for service discovery in distributed manufacturing environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12457402">Ameri and Dutta (2008)</xref> proposed a graph-based Manufacturing Service Description Language (MSDL), which is an upper ontology for the structural representation of manufacturing services to support semantic manufacturing service discovery through a manufacturing-compatible service repository. MSDL is extended in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12457402">Cai et al., 2011</xref>) by representing complex manufacturing services from both aspects of structural knowledge and constraint knowledge using an ontology-based and constraint-based service modeling approach, to deal with the more complex matches in manufacturing service matchmaking and discovery.</p>
<p>Most of the existing service-oriented manufacturing framework as in the literature mentioned earlier utilized the centralized coordination mechanism for service discovery. However, as the number of manufacturing services grows and these services become more dynamic in highly distributed networked environments, it will become impractical to ask disparate enterprises to adopt a unified service description language and a unified global ontology to publish and access services from a single centralized service registry. In addition, the centralized service registry will lead to drawbacks such as single point failure, inflexibility, limited scalability, server bottleneck, and insufficient openness in dealing with semantic discovery of manufacturing services across virtual enterprises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1063293X12457402">
<title>Decentralized approaches to manufacturing service discovery</title>
<p>Recently, there have been some proposals for the implementation of the manufacturing service discovery based on decentralized mechanisms to address the drawbacks of traditional centralized mechanisms. In particular, the P2P technology has become a popular paradigm for building decentralized systems, therefore providing avenues for the enterprises to share and manipulate collaborative manufacturing applications in a decentralized manner for its flexibility, scalability, robustness, and openness.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063293X12457402">Ferreira and Ferreira (2004)</xref> discussed the implementation of essential B2B services for P2P e-marketplaces, based on a leading P2P platform, and illustrated its benefits by applying the P2P approach to a vendor of industrial equipment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063293X12457402">Wang et al. (2008)</xref> proposed a distributed manufacturing scheduling framework at the shop floor level by modeling the shop floor as a collection of multiple work cells, each of which is represented as a multiagent-based flexible manufacturing peer. Distributed manufacturing scheduling is conducted through Web service discovery facilitated by the service-oriented shop floor integration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X12457402">Xiang et al. (2008)</xref> presented a P2P service discovery framework for a Virtual Manufacturing Organization (VMO), in which, each peer (a VMO member) publishes the manufacturing services that it intends to share and maintains a list of friend peers that it has recently interacted with, allowing a fully distributed and flexible service discovery process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12457402">Munoz-Gea et al. (2010)</xref> developed a P2P-based supply chain service discovery prototype based on the top of DHT and utilized an eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) to prevent the use of a service by unauthorized entities. Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063293X12457402">Yin et al., 2010</xref>) has proposed an agent-based and P2P-based Semantic Grid for distributed manufacturing collaboration. A hierarchy of autonomous, adaptive agents forming a super peer–based P2P network is laid out in the Semantic Grid to provide, in an open, dynamic, loosely coupled and scalable manner, the service publication, discovery, and reuse for management of applications that need to utilize manufacturing Grid services.</p>
<p>Although the P2P technology has become a popular paradigm for building decentralized systems in distributed service-oriented manufacturing environments, to construct a valid search strategy of P2P system that is required to scale to a large number of peers in highly concurrent, distributed manufacturing environments remains a challenging issue. To address this issue, our proposed architecture organizes the peers into a super peer–based P2P overlay network through ontological directory in order to realize the advantages of both centralized and decentralized architectures. Only all super peers form a DHT-based structured P2P overlay, and the leaf peers are communicated with and controlled by respective super peers. In particular, a reputation-based trust model is proposed to elect the most reputed peer as the super peer through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1063293X12457402">
<title>Reputation-based trust management</title>
<p>Our study in reputation-based trust model has been inspired by a large amount of recent study in the area of reputation-based P2P architecture. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12457402">Xiong and Liu (2004)</xref> presented a reputation-based trust-supporting framework, which includes a coherent adaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on a transaction-based feedback system and a decentralized implementation of such a model over a structured P2P network. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12457402">Rosas et al. (2011)</xref> proposed an efficient and simple way to build a group of trusted nodes—called <italic>Trusted Ring</italic>—within a DHT. This allows reputable nodes to coalesce in order to provide a pseudo-trusted service: a service that is almost fully trustworthy, since the nodes that process requests exhibit a very high probability of being trustworthy. Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X12457402">Yan et al., 2011</xref>) proposed a user-centric reputation framework that differentiates the local reputation from the global reputation based on quality of service experience similarity for personal and trusted service selection in P2P-based service web. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12457402">Lin et al. (2011)</xref> presented a trust model that quantifies and compares the trustworthiness of peers based on a hierarchical fuzzy system. Six capability factors are identified to describe the peers’ trust on the capability, and one security factor, named “Malicious behavior,” is used to evaluate the peers’ trust on security. The model consisted of local trust computation based on fuzzy techniques and global reputation aggregation, which integrates feedback from other peers to produce a global reputation for each peer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X12457402">Chithra and Sheila (2012)</xref> proposed a trust model that combines peer profiling with anomaly detection technique. Each peer can establish trust based on its own prior activities with other peers by comparing the current activity of a peer with its historical data, and genetic algorithm (GA) has been employed to detect the anomalous behavior.</p>
<p>The proposed reputation-based trust model is based on the above-mentioned studies, but has extended them by incorporating the manufacturing service and the relevance of service in an ontology-based service-oriented P2P architecture. The important enhancement facilitates the evaluation of the trust model to build a scalable and reputed DHT-based structured P2P overlay that support mass manufacturing collaboration.</p>

<title>Functional requirements</title>
<p>To facilitate the efficient, service-oriented integration and discovery of distributed manufacturing resources and achieve highly scalable coupling and collaboration across distributed virtual enterprises, the high-level system architecture with hybrid SOA and P2P paradigm is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12457402">Figure 1</xref>. The system architecture allows distributed enterprises to integrate their core manufacturing resources by publishing, discovering, and sharing respective manufacturing services to compete favorably in the rapidly changing manufacturing environments.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the global level, the system is built with super peer–based P2P network, and each enterprise exhibits as a peer that publishes sharable manufacturing services through its private service registry. The peers sharing similar ontological interests through ontological directory are clustered together, and the most reputed peer is elected as the super peer through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters. All super peers form a reputed DHT-based structured P2P overlay, and the leaf peers are communicated with and controlled by respective super peers. Each super peer maintains a finger table of its friend peers, which may route the service request to the target super peer who or whose leaf peer hosts the requested service.</p>
<p>On the local level, each peer publishes manufacturing services through its private service registry, which can be shared within the same peer or by other peers. If a user in an enterprise peer wants a manufacturing service, the service request is first matched with those published manufacturing services in the local peer’s private service registry (i.e. hosted by the local peer). If the local search fails, the service request is routed to the local peer’s super peer or super peer’s friend peer for further service lookup until one or some matching services are returned.</p>
<p>For example, a client LP11-1 in a leaf enterprise peer LP11 who wants a manufacturing service cannot find a matching one in its private service registry. Then, the service request is routed to the leaf peer LP11’s super peer SP1 for further service lookup. Because the search fails, the service request is routed to the super peer SP1’s friend peer, that is, the super peer SP2 through SP1’s finger table in DHT-based Chord ring for further service lookup. Because the search still fails, the service request is further routed to the super peer SP2’s friend peer, that is, super peer SP3 through SP2’s finger table for further service lookup. Supposed the super peer SP3 satisfies the required ontological interest through its ontological directory, the super peer SP3 forwards the service request to its leaf peer LP31 that hosts the requested service. Eventually, a matching service published by the Client LP31-1 in the leaf peer LP31 is returned to the client LP11-1 in the peer LP11.</p>
<p>However, in order to construct a valid search strategy of P2P system that is required to scale to a large number of peers in highly concurrent, distributed manufacturing environments and to develop the enabling technologies for the efficient discovery of manufacturing services across P2P-based virtual enterprises, the following functional requirements need to be addressed:</p>

<title>Layered software system architecture</title>
<p>To realize the functional requirements described earlier, a layered software system architecture is designed to facilitate modular development of physical network, DHT-based overlay network, reputation-based trust model, semantic SOA network, and interface platform, corresponding to five software layers: resource layer, DHT-based overlay layer, reputation-based trust model layer, semantic service layer, and e-portal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12457402">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1063293X12457402">
<title>Resource layer</title>
<p>The resource layer is situated in the physical network and includes all types of manufacturing resources owned by collaborative enterprises, which are engaged in different structural, spatial, behavioral, functional, temporal, or other relations. These include computing resources, engineering resources, logistic resources, storage resources, material processing resources, data resources, and human resources. The distributed manufacturing environments are dynamic, and the involved resources can change rapidly. The resource layer provides the infrastructure to build the distributed manufacturing system for semantic discovery of manufacturing resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1063293X12457402">
<title>DHT-based overlay layer</title>
<p>As the collaborating enterprises are deployed in a decentralized manner and communicate with each other using a P2P manner in distributed manufacturing environments, a P2P protocol is responsible for handling resource requests and routing them to the enterprise peer hosting the requested resources. Each enterprise that exhibits as a peer may play roles of resource consumer, resource router, or resource provider.</p>
<p>The peers sharing similar ontological interests through ontological directory are clustered together, and the most reputed peer is elected as the super peer. All super peers form a reputed DHT-based structured P2P overlay, and the leaf peers are communicated with and controlled by respective super peers. The P2P overlay layer is deployed on the top of a DHT-based protocol called Chord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12457402">Stoica et al., 2001</xref>) to take advantage of its structured indexing mechanism and efficient lookup service.</p>
<p>Each super peer has an ontological interest through ontological directory, indicating its complete directory path of the problem-solving domain, for example, “/manufacturing service/material processing service/material removing service/turning service/.” Chord uses an <italic>m</italic>-bit identifier ring for routing and locating resources. The resources’ identifier IDs are generated using Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-1 algorithm to hash the peer’s ontological directory path as <italic>m</italic>-bit keys to determine the resource destination, and then an exact keyword-based lookup of the hashed key on the DHT can be executed.</p>
<p>Each super peer maintains a finger table of its friend super peers, which may route the resource request to the target super peer who or whose leaf peer hosts the requested resource. The entries of the finger table include both the Internet protocol (IP) addresses of the relevant peer nodes and Chord identifiers of other peers, that is, friend super peers with an exponential step on the identifier ring. The <italic>i</italic>th entry in the table at node <italic>n</italic> contains the identity of the first node, <italic>s</italic>, that succeeds <italic>n</italic> by at least 2<sup><italic>i</italic>− 1</sup> on the identifier circle, that is, <italic>s</italic> = <italic>successor</italic> (<italic>n</italic>+ 2<sup><italic>i</italic>− 1</sup>), where 1 ≤<italic>i</italic>≤<italic>m</italic> (and all arithmetic is modulo 2<sup><italic>m</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12457402">Stoica et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, the peer lookup in Chord uses static finger table and exact queries, that is, each super peer is indexed in the DHT through Chord by static keywords and discovered by the other super peer by means of exact keyword-based matchmaking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1063293X12457402">
<title>Reputation-based trust model layer</title>
<p>Distributed manufacturing environments involve a lot of collaborating enterprise peers. To reduce the excessive peer communication overhead, the peers sharing similar ontological interests through ontological directory are clustered together, and only the most reputed peer is elected as the super peer through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters and forms the DHT-based Chord ring. The involved trust parameters include the relevance of resource a peer recommends to its neighbor peers, the time a peer spends to recommend the required resource to its neighbor peers, the total number of resources a peer recommends to its neighbor peers, the feedback a peer receives from other peers for its resource execution, and the total number of executed resources a peer provides to other peers.</p>
<p>The reputation-based trust model is responsible for quantifying and comparing the reputation value of peers through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters. It includes a multicriteria decision-making module, a trust-collecting module, a feedback sender, and a trust repository for storing the peers’ trust data. The reputation-based trust model will be elaborated in detail in section “A reputation-based trust model.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1063293X12457402">
<title>Semantic service layer</title>
<p>The SOA virtualizes and integrates the core manufacturing resources of enterprises by wrapping up them as Web services to overcome the barrier of technical interoperability of geographically distributed manufacturing resources. However, the heterogeneity and incompatibility among distributed manufacturing services over heterogeneous enterprise peers is still a major obstacle to the exact keyword-based peer discovery. In the semantic service layer, the proposed architecture has enhanced the enterprise peer with semantic service description such that the service request of a peer is first routed to the peer with matching ontological interest, which then retrieves the semantically matching service from its service registry.</p>
<p>The manufacturing services can be described with the existing semantic service standards, for example, OWL-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12457402">Martin et al., 2004</xref>) ontology to model its manufacturing capabilities including service type, service target, manufacturing feature, manufacturing equipment, input parameters, and output parameters, as can be referred to our previous study in ontology-based manufacturing service modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12457402">Cai et al., 2011</xref>) and will not be repeated here for conciseness. The UDDI registry and OWL-S registry are used to advertise both syntactic and semantic capabilities of manufacturing services, respectively. A mapping table is built to map the corresponding syntactic and semantic capabilities of manufacturing services in both registries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1063293X12457402">
<title>E-portal layer</title>
<p>The e-portal layer takes the form of an e-portal in the software system architecture. It allows the enterprises to act as active service collaborators instead of passive service receivers in the service delivering process. The e-portal includes three types of personalized collaborative interfaces that support the system interaction with resource providers, resource consumers, and knowledge engineers, respectively, according to their roles in the application context. The resource providers use these interfaces to wrap the list of manufacturing resources they provide, manage the encapsulated manufacturing services, and specify the context under which each of these services can be invocated. The resource consumers use these interfaces to input their service requests, look up the required manufacturing services, invocate the appropriate manufacturing service for execution, and submit the feedback upon service execution. The knowledge engineers use these interfaces to manage service registries, enterprise peers and their finger tables, trust repositories, and ontology repository consisting of resource ontology, general ontology, service ontology, and mapping ontology.</p>

<title>Structure of an enterprise peer</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1063293X12457402">Figure 3</xref> depicts the internal structure of an enterprise peer, its involved components, and their interactions. Different from the client–server architecture, the adopted P2P architecture allows an enterprise peer to play roles of both server and client. An enterprise peer consists of five types of components: server components, client components, knowledge components, knowledge-processing components, and query-processing components.</p>

<p>The server components include a resource wrapper, a semantic annotator, and a service advertiser. The resource wrapper is used to virtualize the manufacturing resources provided by resource providers by wrapping up them as Web services. The semantic annotator is used to semantically annotate the manufacturing services with OWL-S ontology. The service advertiser is used to advertise the manufacturing services into the private UDDI registry and OWL-S registry from both aspects of syntactic and semantic descriptions.</p>
<p>The client components include a service identifier, a service decomposer, a service invocator, and a feedback sender. The service identifier is used to identify and transfer the initial service request in natural language into standard semantic service request through OWL-S service ontology. The service decomposer is used to decompose the complex service request into simple service requests if necessary to facilitate service discovery. The service invocator is used to invocate the appropriate manufacturing service for execution. The feedback sender is used to submit the feedback rating upon service execution.</p>
<p>The knowledge components include a private UDDI service registry, a private OWL-S service registry, a mapping table between UDDI and OWL-S registries, a peer repository for storing a cross-enterprise model with P2P relationships, a super peer’s finger table of its friend peers, a trust repository for storing the peers’ trust data, and ontology repository consisting of resource ontology, general ontology, service ontology, and mapping ontology. The resource ontologies, general ontologies, and service ontologies developed in different peers may not be fully consistent; therefore, the mapping ontologies are used to bridge the semantic gap between two corresponding ontologies in communicating peers.</p>
<p>The knowledge-processing components include a service registry manager, a service manager, a peer manager, a trust manager, a trust-collecting module, a multicriteria decision-making module, and an ontology manager. The service registry manager is used to manage the setting, administration, and mapping of UDDI and OWL-S service registries. The service manager is used to organize the manufacturing services, such as service classification, service clustering, and service conflict resolution. The peer manager is used to manage the peer repository and the peer’s finger table of its friend peers. The trust manager is used to manage the peers’ trust data that can be collected through the trust-collecting module and feedback sender. The multicriteria decision-making module is used to quantify and compare the reputation value of peers among related multiple trust parameters.</p>
<p>The query-processing components include a local service discovery mechanism, a query routing mechanism, and a service ranking mechanism. The local service discovery mechanism is used to search the private service registry for an appropriate manufacturing service matching with the service request. The query routing mechanism is used to route the service request from the current peer to the peer hosting the requested service. The service ranking mechanism is used to rank a few of found, candidate manufacturing services, and select the best one.</p>

<p>where α, β, and γ denote the weight factors for multiple criteria to indicate the respective importance of multicriteria and depend on the characteristics of online virtual organizations.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1063293X12457402">Equation (1)</xref> consists of three parts. The first part is a weighted accumulation of relevance of services recommended by peer <italic>u</italic> to its neighbor peers in its historical recommendation. As we define the similarity between service request and recommended service as the relevance of service, <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>u, i</italic>) can be normalized on interval [0, 1], with 0 indicating 100% dissimilarity and 1 indicating 100% similarity. There are already several similarity calculation methods between manufacturing services in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12457402">Ameri and Dutta, 2008</xref>) and our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12457402">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), which are based on solving a multicriteria decision-making problem for dealing with the trade-offs among diverse properties about service capabilities (e.g. service name, service category, service cost, service target, service interface, service location, service inputs, and service outputs) and uses a formal definition of the ontological concepts as the basis of comparison. Increasing the value of the first part will increase the reputation value of peer <italic>u</italic> toward the other peers.</p>
<p>The second part is a weighted accumulation of the difference between the time peer <italic>u</italic> spends to recommend the requested service to its neighbor peers, that is, <italic>T</italic>(<italic>u, i</italic>), and the averaged time all peers spends in service recommendation in all their historical recommendations, that is, <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1063293X12457402"><mml:math display="inline" id="math2-1063293X12457402"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is normalized on interval [−1, 1] by division by the maximum value of <italic>T</italic>(<italic>u, i</italic>) and <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-1063293X12457402"><mml:math display="inline" id="math3-1063293X12457402"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Smaller values of <italic>T</italic>(<italic>u, i</italic>) tend to increase the value of second part and, in turn, increase the reputation value of peer <italic>u</italic>.</p>
<p>The third part is a weighted accumulation of rating of feedback peer <italic>u</italic> receives from other peers for its historical service executions. <italic>Q</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>u, j</italic>) is also normalized on interval [0, 1], with 0 indicating worst and 1 indicating best. Increasing the value of the third part will increase the reputation value of peer <italic>u</italic>.</p>
<p>As the new peers have no historical reputation to calculate the reputation values, the default values of reputation will be assigned to them within a certain period, for example, 1 month or 1 year. After this period, their default reputation values will be replaced by the practical reputation values calculated from the historical reputations.</p>

<title>Semantic discovery process of manufacturing services using reputation-based P2P architecture</title>

<p>When a resource user looks up a manufacturing service by selecting an ontological interest domain through ontological directory path browser and inputting a service request in natural language, the service request will be transferred into the OWL-S-based semantic specification by analyzing the structure of original service specification through OWL-S service ontology. The overcomplicated service request may be decomposed into simple services to facilitate service identification. Then, a semantically enhanced search in the private OWL-S registry is conducted for the matching semantic service description through service matchmaking mechanism. To calculate the manufacturing service similarities, there are already mature ontology-based similarity calculation methods of manufacturing services in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12457402">Ameri and Dutta, 2008</xref>) and our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12457402">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), which use a formal definition of the ontological concepts, that is, manufacturing resource ontologies as the basis of comparison. Domain-specific manufacturing resource ontologies that have been developed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063293X12457402">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) can be used to underlie the calculation of resource similarities.</p>
<p>If a few candidate manufacturing services are found to be qualified to match the wanted service request, they will be ranked through a GA-based multiobjective decision-making method developed by the ‘ earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063293X12457402">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), which deals with the trade-offs among multiple objectives including similarity, time, cost, quality, and availability, with the best one finally selected.</p>
<p>After a semantic service in the OWL-S registry is found, its mapping syntactic service in the UDDI registry can be returned to the user for invocation, followed by the service execution.</p>
<p>However, if the above-mentioned semantic discovery process of manufacturing service within a local enterprise peer does not find an appropriate manufacturing service, the service request will be routed to the local peer’s super peer for further service lookup. If the search still fails, the service request will be routed to the super peer’s friend peers, through the former’s finger table in DHT-based Chord ring for exact matchmaking of ontological interest. The friend peers may in turn route the ontological interest to their friend peers for further help until the target super peer is found. When a target super peer is found to satisfy the required ontological interest through its ontological directory, the target super peer will forward the service request to its leaf peer that hosts the requested service. In the target leaf peer, a semantically enhanced search in its private OWL-S registry is conducted for the matching semantic service description through service matchmaking mechanism again, until the problem is solved.</p>
<p>Assume that a local peer <italic>A</italic> routes the service request to its super peer <italic>B</italic>, which in turn routes to its friend super peer <italic>C</italic>, which in turn routes to its leaf peer <italic>D</italic> that has a matching manufacturing service <italic>MS</italic> and returns it to peer A for execution. After service execution, the peer <italic>A</italic> will submit a feedback rating for its satisfaction about the manufacturing service <italic>MS</italic> provided by peer <italic>D</italic>. In this case, the reputation values of these peers will be updated as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-1063293X12457402" list-type="simple">

<p>Peer <italic>A</italic>: Its reputation value is not updated because it is the service requester, and has neither recommended nor provided a manufacturing service to the other peers.</p>

An enterprise peer may also add or edit ontologies, knowledge, or content in its ontology repository. As different enterprise peers may have inconsistent ontologies, a peer may construct a mapping ontology to resolve the involved knowledge conflict. The service ontology is translated into OWL-S, and the other ontologies are translated into OWL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12457402">McGuinness and Harmelen, 2004</xref>), which is the most expressive semantic markup language to ontologies to date on the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Output parameters: <italic>surface roughness</italic> is 1.2 µm and <italic>dimension accuracy</italic> is 3 µm.</p>
</list-item>

<p>The above-mentioned service discovery result is satisfactory because of the following matchmaking processes:</p>
<list id="list6-1063293X12457402" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The required ontological interest domain, that is, <italic>turning service</italic> is satisfied by the discovered enterprise peer that has an exactly matching ontological interest domain.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The required service type, that is, <italic>turning service</italic> is satisfied by the discovered service, which has service type <italic>lathe finish service</italic>, because <italic>lathe finish service</italic> is a subclass of <italic>turning service</italic> according to the defined manufacturing service ontology.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The required service target, that is, <italic>stainless steel shaft</italic> is satisfied by the discovered service, which has service target <italic>metal shaft</italic>, because <italic>stainless steel shaft</italic> is a subclass of <italic>metal shaft</italic> according to the defined manufacturing resource ontology.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is self-explanatory that the corresponding produced manufacturing feature <italic>conic surface</italic> is matched bet-ween the service request and discovered service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The required input parameters (i.e. <italic>workpiece diameter</italic> is 30 cm, <italic>workpiece length</italic> is 70 cm, and <italic>workpiece weight</italic> is 170 kg) are satisfied by the discovered service, which has input parameters (i.e. <italic>workpiece diameter</italic> is 10–100 cm, <italic>workpiece length</italic> is 10–150 cm, and <italic>workpiece weight</italic> is &lt;500 kg), because the former parameters are covered by the latter parameters, respectively.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The required output parameters (i.e. <italic>surface finish</italic> is 2 µm and <italic>dimension accuracy</italic> is 3 µm) are satisfied by the discovered service, which has output parameters (i.e. <italic>surface roughness</italic> is 1.2 µm and <italic>dimension accuracy</italic> is 3 µm), because <italic>surface finish</italic> is equivalent to <italic>surface roughness</italic> according to the defined manufacturing resource ontology, and the former parameters are covered by the latter parameters, respectively.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The above-mentioned manufacturing service discovery only takes 5 s to obtain the solution, but it takes an experienced human planner at least 1 h to obtain the similar solution. If the problem becomes more complicated when a lot of enterprises publish their various manufacturing service in the Internet, the proposed approach will further outperform the human planners.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the aim of tackling technical and semantic interoperability and achieving highly scalable coupling and collaboration across virtual enterprises in distributed manufacturing environments, this article seamlessly integrates three main computing paradigms: Semantic Web, Web service, and P2P into an ontology-based service-oriented P2P architecture for semantic discovery of manufacturing services. It provides a decentralized, flexible framework that allows new collaborating enterprises to participate in the existing cooperative study dynamically during runtime without permission and coordination from a central server. It utilizes a novel and efficient peer search strategy based on a reputation-based trust model for quantifying and comparing the reputation value of peers through multicriteria decision making among related trust parameters, such that the quality search results can be retrieved within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>The prototype system presented in this article has been demonstrated through an example of practical manufacturing service discovery in the machining process planning of a metal part and is believed to be useful in manufacturing industries. Further development of the system and evaluation with regard to its performance is underway for possible commercial uses in the future.</p>
