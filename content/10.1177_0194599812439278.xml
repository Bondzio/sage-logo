<abstract>
<p><italic>Objective.</italic> There is continued debate over the value of laryngeal nerve monitoring (LNM) during thyroidectomy. Previous studies have suggested that utilization of electromyographic endotracheal tubes for neuromonitoring is limited. We queried head and neck surgeons regarding their attitudes toward LNM.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design.</italic> Voluntary survey.</p>
<p><italic>Setting.</italic> Internet based.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods.</italic> An anonymous survey of the members of the American Head and Neck Society was performed. Information was collected on participants’ training history, practice setting, years of experience, and annual volume of thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. Participants’ use of LNM and their beliefs regarding possible benefits were assessed.</p>
<p><italic>Results.</italic> One hundred seventy surveys were completed (18% response rate). Of respondents, 65% use LNM in at least some thyroid and parathyroid cases, 37% always and 28% sometimes. The most commonly cited reasons for LNM use were “medical-legal protection” and “increased confidence.” Comparing otolaryngologists to general surgeons, 43% versus 17% (<italic>P</italic> = .016) always use LNM, 27% versus 36% sometimes use monitoring, and 30% versus 47% never use monitoring. Younger surgeons were more likely to use LNM.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion.</italic> Currently, no consensus exists regarding the use of LNM during thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Our results suggest that LNM use has become more widespread. Irrespective of the reasons surgeons are adopting LNM, if this trend continues, LNM may eventually become routine practice among head and neck surgeons.</p>

<p>Identification and preservation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is a crucial component of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. Temporary or permanent injury of the RLN is one of the known complications of these surgeries. While surgical techniques differ, it is widely recognized that the gold standard for protection of the nerve is visual identification rather than avoidance.</p>
<p>Rates of postoperative vocal cord paralysis and paresis after thyroidectomy have decreased over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439278">1</xref></sup> In an attempt to further reduce the incidence of injury and facilitate dissection, some surgeons have incorporated the use of intraoperative laryngeal nerve monitoring (LNM). This provides real-time functional feedback on the status of the RLN. Many different nerve-monitoring techniques have been used, including laryngeal palpation and intramuscular needle electromyography. Largely because of its ease of use and reliability, the most widely adopted method of nerve monitoring is a system that uses an endotracheal tube with surface electromyography electrodes, which directly contact the vocal cords.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439278">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The clinical value of these electromyographic endotracheal tubes (EETs) remains a source of considerable debate. Published studies report contradictory results regarding the benefits of ETTs, with some showing decreased RLN injury rates and others finding no difference. A recent literature review and meta-analysis by Higgins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439278">3</xref></sup> found that there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of true vocal cord palsy in patients who underwent thyroidectomy with or without an EET. Nonetheless, anecdotally, the use of EETs appears to be increasing. Adoption has been widespread enough to warrant publication of guidelines for their use.</p>
<p>Two previous surveys assessed the patterns of utilization of LNM by surgeons during thyroid surgery. Horne and her colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439278">4</xref></sup> questioned a random cohort of otolaryngologists practicing in the United States. In this group, approximately 45% of surgeons reported using intraoperative monitoring in their practice. Only 23% stated that they used it in every case. Of note, 84.5% of participants in that survey were practicing in a private or health maintenance organization setting. In 2009, Sturgeon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439278">5</xref></sup> surveyed the members of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) and registrants of the 2006 AAES annual meeting. In that study, only 37.1% of respondents acknowledged using neuromonitoring—13.8% routinely and 23.3% selectively. These studies were conducted several years ago and assessed the patterns of use of select groups of surgeons. We hypothesized that despite the lack of clear evidence showing the clinical benefits of LNM, its use has increased among surgeons since these previous studies were published. In an effort to gauge current utilization, we surveyed the members of the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) regarding their usage of EETs during thyroid and parathyroid surgery.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812439278" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the State University of New York–Downstate Medical Center institutional review board. An Internet-based survey was developed consisting of questions designed to gather information related to surgical training, surgical volume, practice setting, use of EETs, and attitudes toward this technology. After this survey was approved for distribution by the AHNS research committee, it was circulated by the AHNS. An email describing the study and its purpose, with a hyperlink to the survey, was distributed to all members of the AHNS.</p>
<p>All data were collected and stored by surveymonkey. com, an online survey distributor. Data were obtained in an anonymous fashion. The survey was conducted between April 1, 2010, and May 31, 2010. Compiled data were downloaded in a spreadsheet. Results were analyzed with SPSS version 14.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York). Association between variables and variance of specimens were examined by χ<sup>2</sup> test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 170 surgeons, of the 944 members of the AHNS who were asked to participate in the study, completed surveys (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812439278"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812439278"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This represented an 18% response rate. General surgeons completed 36 of the surveys (21%); the remainder were completed by otolaryngologists (n = 134, 79%). Of respondents, 105 (62%) operate in an academic setting, 34 (20%) work in private practice, and 31 (18%) practice in both. Most (n = 146, 86%) are involved with resident education. Respondents were placed into 1 of 5 categories with regard to annual thyroid and parathyroid surgery volume: 10% performed 0 to 15 cases, 27% performed 16 to 40 cases, 17% performed 41 to 70 cases, 20% performed 71 to 100 cases, and 26% completed more than 100 cases.</p>

<p>Of all respondents, 65% reported using ETTs for LNM in at least some of their thyroid and parathyroid cases.

<p>Respondents who use this technology were more likely to believe that ETTs reduce transient and permanent RLN dysfunction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

The median year of completion of residency for those who sometimes or always use ETTs was 1994, as compared with a median completion year of 1988 for those who never use them (<italic>P</italic> = .011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812439278"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In theory, LNM provides additional information to the surgeon about the status of the laryngeal nerves during thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. While different methods have been described, use of ETTs appears to be the most widely adopted technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439278">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439278">7</xref></sup> This form of intraoperative monitoring can be used to aid in identification of the RLN, facilitate safe dissection of the nerve after identification, and provide information regarding the likely postoperative function of the nerve. While several studies have shown benefits of ETTs, there continues to be disagreement among surgeons over their actual clinical value. Some surgeons feel that they are able to identify the nerve reliably without the use of ETTs and that the ETTs do not actually reduce the rate of postoperative vocal cord dysfunction, making them superfluous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439278">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439278"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439278"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439278">11</xref></sup> Others argue that ETTs are not dependable enough, with too many false-negatives or false-positives. In addition, opponents cite the high costs of ETTs, suggesting that whatever the added benefit of their use, it does not justify their expense. Despite these arguments, the use of ETTs does seem to be increasing, and it is important to understand their patterns of use. Surgeons do not practice in isolation, and it is important for them to be aware of local, national, and international practice patterns. Regardless of an individual surgeon’s opinion of a new surgical technique or medical device, they should remain abreast of developments among their colleagues.</p>
<p>Compared with previous similar studies, the results of the current study suggest that the use of LNM, specifically with ETTs, has grown. Among the cohort of surgeons we assessed, approximately 65% use ETTs in at least some of their thyroid or parathyroid cases. Particularly among otolaryngologists, adoption has become widespread, with upward of 70% employing them at least occasionally. This contrasts with general surgeons, among whom 47% never use ETTs. It is unclear why this disparity between surgeons with different training backgrounds exists. Despite the relative gap between specialties, the rate of adoption of this technology among general surgeons in our study (53%) is markedly higher than that found by Sturgeon and his colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439278">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, while we found that surgeons who use ETTs are more likely to believe that they reduce the incidence of RLN dysfunction, medical-legal liability and surgeon confidence were the most often cited reasons for ETT use. Irrespective of whether ETTs provide clinical benefit for patients and regardless of the rationale for their adoption, our data suggest that their usage by surgeons, particularly otolaryngologists, has expanded. If the current practice patterns are reflective of a broader trend and younger surgeons continue to take advantage of this technology, the likelihood is that ETT use will only continue to increase. Importantly, the vast majority of respondents to this survey are involved with resident training. As the percentage of attending or mentoring surgeons who use ETTs increases, an expanding population of residents who were trained with this technology will enter the workforce. This is important because as the inertia of this trend continues, the debate over the use of this technology may become moot. Nonetheless, this does not imply that LNM is or should become standard of care. Determining standard of care is a complex issue that goes beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>The potential limitations of performing a survey must be considered when interpreting our data. The question of a possible responder bias exists in any voluntary survey that is performed. In addition, the pool of possible respondents to this survey is limited to a relatively narrow cohort made up of the members of the AHNS. Thus, a disproportionately large percentage of surgeons who completed this questionnaire practice in an academic setting. A broader collection of surgeons may have responded quite differently than those in this group. In addition, the 170 respondents represent only an 18% response rate. This is quite a low rate and may represent a skewed segment of the AHNS. Consequently, the validity or accuracy of our results may be limited. However, the goal of this survey was not to determine exact percentages but rather to assess broad practice patterns. While the precise percentages might be inexact, we believe that the data accurately reflect that large numbers of head and neck surgeons are currently using LNM.</p>
