<p>This ambitious study, originally a doctoral thesis presented at the University of Münster, is instructive and rewarding in drawing attention to a large number of incomplete, sometimes little-known works by Goethe, and in inviting us to think afresh about the meaning of a literary fragment. Drawing analogies with art history, Becker suggests that a fragment may, at one extreme, be a rough sketch outlined in a letter, corresponding to an artistic <italic>croquis</italic>; at the other, it may be an incomplete but self-contained work, a torso, with enough integrity for the author to publish it. Apparent gaps in some of Goethe’s works may in fact indicate his aesthetic inventiveness. Thus <italic>Faust. Ein Fragment</italic> (1790), with its puzzling lacunae, really represents ‘die “neue” Form, in der die Moderne ästhetisch verarbeitet wird’ (p. 89), though the author soon qualifies this claim by noting that in the revised version of 1808 Goethe did in fact fill some gaps, e.g. explaining the appearance of Mephisto.</p>
<p>An exploration of fragmentary form in Goethe seems, however, to have been overlaid, indeed displaced, by another and more interesting project, namely a thoroughgoing political reading of Goethe. An early chapter discusses his Sturm und Drang texts featuring ‘große Kerle’, towering figures who resist authority. The longest chapter (pp. 177−303) deals with many of Goethe’s literary responses to the French Revolution, including some, such as <italic>Der Bürgergeneral</italic> (1793) and <italic>Hermann und Dorothea</italic> (1797), which are not fragments. A shorter but still 70-page chapter on ‘Napoleon-Bilder’ follows; then a study of the <italic>Wilhelm Meister</italic> novels and some associated texts as exemplifying the development of the good citizen.</p>
<p>Very roughly, Becker argues that Goethe’s early Titanic rebels – Prometheus, Mahomet, Faust – turn into the figure of the conquering ‘Bourgeois’ whose ‘Turbokapitalismus’ (p. 197) destroys the pre-industrial world as Faust destroys Gretchen (not to mention Philemon and Baucis). Another version of the ‘Bourgeois’ is the cunning Odysseus, who in the ‘Nausikaa’ fragment is evidently going to seduce and abandon his Phaeacian hostess. Their positive counterpart is the ‘Citoyen’, variously represented by Achill (mourned in the <italic>Achilleis</italic>, 1799), by Dorothea, and above all by Wilhelm Meister. Though Goethe seldom mentions Napoleon, he saw him as another destructive ‘Bourgeois’ and prefigured him in Odysseus.</p>
<p>This scheme is certainly a stimulating hypothesis. It lacks nuance (not just in my drastic summary) and relies on key terms (‘Bourgeois’, ‘Citoyen’) that Goethe did not use. It is vulnerable in detail. If Faust is so pernicious, why is he saved? The solely negative view of Napoleon ascribed to Goethe is at odds with his statement: ‘Außerordentliche Menschen, wie Napoleon, treten aus der Moralität heraus. Sie wirken zuletzt wie physische Ursachem wie Feuer und Wasser’ (recorded by Riemer, 3 February 1807). And if Wilhelm is such a model citizen, why did Goethe describe him as ‘ein armer Hund’ (to the Kanzler von Müller, 22 January 1821)? Goethe is a more ambivalent writer than Becker allows for.</p>
<p>Becker’s approach generates provocative readings of some texts, one-dimensional or downright implausible readings of others. Her interpretations of Goethe’s continuation of <italic>Die Zauberflöte</italic> (1799) as showing the melancholy survival of the <italic>ancien régime</italic>, and of ‘Reise der Söhne Megaprazons’ (1792) as an allegorical tour through revolutionary Europe, are rewarding. But because the protagonist of the dramatic sketch <italic>Mahomet</italic> (1772−3), having adopted pantheism, compares his contemporaries’ illusory gods to ‘kleine Fürsten’, his speech is called a ‘gesellschaftspolitische … Diskussion’ (p. 51), and Goethe’s real theme, the corruption of a religious innovator, is lost from sight. In addition, the author’s impressive erudition too often leads her to accumulate detail that does not advance her argument. Nevertheless, it is an achievement to have integrated so many little-known texts into a picture, however schematic, of Goethe’s political development.</p>
