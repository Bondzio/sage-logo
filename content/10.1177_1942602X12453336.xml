<abstract>
<p>School nurses have the responsibility of maintaining the medical files of middle- and high-school athletes. This includes collecting and monitoring the sports preparticipation physical exam. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in young athletes and, therefore, is one of the primary reasons that competitive athletes undergo sports preparticipation physical exams. Although there is no governing body that has established mandates regarding the nature and scope of this physical exam, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommendations for cardiovascular screening for competitive athletes. However, these recommendations are not always included on the preparticipation physical exam form and it is not always clear if the health care provider completing the form screened the athlete using these recommendations. Therefore, it is important that school nurses not only be knowledgeable of the AHA recommendations but also consider advocating for their school districts to include these recommendations on the physical exam form if they are not currently.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of death in young athletes during exercise even though it is not exceptionally common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12453336">Asif &amp; Drezner, 2012</xref>). However, it is tragic and devastating to the entire community when it occurs because athletes are often seen as more physically fit than the general population of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>). Common causes of SCD in young athletes include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), commotio cordis from a blunt trauma to the chest, coronary artery anomalies, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocarditis, and aortic aneurysms in individuals with Marfan syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12453336">Maron &amp; Zipes, 2005</xref>). Exercise is a trigger that can precipitate lethal arrhythmias in athletes especially when they have unknown underlying heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12453336">Siddiqui &amp; Patel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the mechanisms currently used to identify student athletes who may be at risk for SCD is the preparticipation sports physical exam. In the U.S., no uniform mandate with regard to the scope and liability of the performance of this exam exists; therefore, there can be great variation in the quality of the sports physical examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>). The AHA has published specific recommendations that include 12 elements that screen student athletes for significant cardiovascular risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>). These 12 elements are designed to help the health care provider complete a thorough cardiovascular screening during the physical examination in order to identify students who may have an underlying or undiagnosed cardiovascular disorder or disease. However, not all health care providers may include these elements in their preparticipation sports examination, especially if they are not specifically identified on the examination form that the provider is completing.</p>
<p>School nurses (SNs) often hold the responsibility of both ensuring student compliance and monitoring student clearance with regard to the preparticipation sports physical examination for school-sanctioned sports and athletics. The forms used for this exam may be designed by the school district, may be outdated, or may not include all the necessary information to adequately complete a thorough cardiovascular screening. The SN is in a unique situation because he or she often has knowledge of the medical history and background of the students in their school and may be situated to identify cardiovascular risk factors affecting sports clearance. Therefore, it is important for the SN to have an understanding of these AHA 12 elements for preparticipation cardiovascular screening of competitive athletes.</p>

<title>Preparticipation Cardiovascular Screening Recommendations</title>
<p>Completion of a medical history and physical exam does not guarantee that individuals at risk for SCD will be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12453336">Seto, 2011</xref>). However, the AHA 12 elements are endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>) and are recommended for use in order to improve the standardization of physical examinations for athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12453336">Siddiqui &amp; Patel, 2010</xref>). Routine use of electrocardiogram (ECG) to screen all competitive athletes is controversial and currently not recommended practice in the United States. Studies evaluating the value of using ECG to routinely screen all athletes, independent of identified risk factors, are mixed. However, consensus at this time indicates that routine ECG screening is not cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12453336">Corrado, Basso, &amp; Thiene, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12453336">Estes &amp; Link, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12453336">Morse &amp; Funk, 2012</xref>). Routine ECG screening is used in other countries.</p>
<p>The 12-element AHA recommendation for cardiovascular screening is divided into three distinct sections: personal history, family history, and physical examination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12453336">Table 1</xref>). A positive response to any one of the 12 items is judged sufficient to make a referral for a cardiovascular evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>). Obtaining an accurate and detailed medical history that includes both a family and personal history is imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12453336">Seto, 2011</xref>). Ideally, the preparticipation sports physical examination should be completed by the athlete’s primary care provider or in the primary provider’s office because this will increase the examiner’s ability to access important medical information and family history on the athlete. Additionally, it is a strong recommendation that a parent or guardian be present to verify and answer questions related to personal and family history as adolescents may not fully understand the questions, have a complete knowledge of family history, or be accurate historians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12453336">Asif &amp; Drezner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Personal History</title>
<p>There are five questions within the personal history section. The questions target recognition of a history of exertional chest pain, exertional dyspnea or fatigue, history of unexplained syncope, prior recognition of a heart murmur, or elevated systemic blood pressure. Any of these findings should result in a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation. Postexertional syncope is often identified in the personal history portion; it is both benign as well as common and often does not warrant follow up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>). However, syncope that occurs during exercise (as opposed to after the athlete has stopped exercising) is a serious finding and an indication for cardiovascular referral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Hypertension is a common cardiovascular condition in competitive athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12453336">Maron &amp; Zipes, 2005</xref>). Elevated systemic blood pressure increases the athlete’s risk for complication when he or she exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12453336">McCambridge et al., 2010</xref>). Although children and adolescents with hypertension are encouraged to participate in regular physical activity, competitive activity may be restricted for some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12453336">McCambridge et al., 2010</xref>). A big concern for the hypertensive athlete includes sports that involve a component of static exercise alone (i.e., muscle exertion without joint movement) or sports that include both a static and a dynamic (i.e., muscle exertion through joint movement) component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12453336">McCambridge et al., 2010</xref>). It is known that blood pressures can increase significantly during static exercise. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12453336">Table 2</xref> highlights sports and the amount of static and dynamic components present. Athletes with stage 2 hypertension, not in normal range with treatment, or with hypertension that coexists with another cardiovascular component may be restricted from some sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12453336">McCambridge et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, hydration and sodium should be of concern and be monitored in the hypertensive athlete because of the athlete’s increased fluid and sodium need during exercise; hypertensive athletes may be restricted as part of their medical regimen.</p>

<title>Family History</title>
<p>Family history must also be carefully reviewed with the parent or guardian as well as the athlete. A family history of premature or SCD before age 50 is red flag and may be related to an undiagnosed heart condition such as HCM or long QT syndrome. Special attention should also be paid to a poorly characterized death; for example, an unexplained automobile accident or drowning may have been an unacknowledged SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>). Unexplained syncope or fainting in a family member is also important to highlight and evaluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12453336">Seto, 2011</xref>). Other family history that elicits red flags includes family members that are disabled from heart disease or have known cardiac conditions. It is recommended that the athlete and parent or guardian be specifically asked about a family history of HCM, Marfan syndrome, long QT syndrome, and arrhythmias. HCM is an inherited disorder that causes a thickening of the myocardial wall that can lead to SCD during physical exertion due to an obstruction in outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12453336">Rowland, 2009</xref>). Additionally, repetitive exercise and physical training in an athlete can stimulate myocardial hypertrophy, placing the athlete with HCM at further risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12453336">Rowland, 2009</xref>). Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that results in connective tissue weakening. Individuals with Marfan syndrome often develop mitral valve prolapse and dilated aortic roots which can lead to aortic dissection, especially under physical exertion. Long QT syndrome is a condition where the heart has a lengthened repolarization time that can result in lethal ventricular arrhythmias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1942602X12453336">
<title>Physical Examination</title>
<p>A thorough cardiovascular examination is to be included in the preparticipation sports physical. Assessing for heart murmurs in both the supine and standing position is imperative for the health care provider to perform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12453336">Maron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12453336">Seto, 2011</xref>). Murmurs that increase in intensity in the standing position are red flags for referral. Vascular assessment that includes pulse strength comparison in both radial and femoral pulses to evaluate for aortic coarctation is also recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12453336">Seto, 2011</xref>). Evaluating athletes for physical characteristics of Marfan syndrome is also important. Even though Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder, approximately 25% of cases are new mutations and, therefore, a family history may not be present. Some of the physical characteristics associated with Marfan syndrome include scoliosis, chest wall deformities, arm span greater than height, hyperlaxity of joints, long fingers, and myopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12453336">Peterson &amp; Bernhardt, 2011</xref>). Lastly, the health care provider assesses for hypertension and vascular differences by completing sitting brachial blood pressures, ideally in both arms.</p>

<sec id="section6-1942602X12453336">
<title>Implications for School Nurses</title>
<p>The AAP, AAFP, and ACSM all recommend using the AHA 12-element preparticipation cardiovascular screening for competitive athletes for sports clearance. The SN is often responsible for monitoring athlete compliance in obtaining preparticipation sports physicals. Therefore, it is important that the SN be both informed and knowledgeable about current recommendations in this matter. Additionally, the SN may have vital medical and family history that is pertinent to the health and safety of athletes who may be at risk for SCD. Because variation often exists among physical exam forms required by school districts, the SN is well situated and qualified to evaluate these forms and to make appropriate recommendations in order to ensure that aspects of a preparticipation cardiovascular screening are included. ■</p>
