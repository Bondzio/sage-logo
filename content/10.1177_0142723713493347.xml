<abstract>
<p>This study examined the impact of training mothers to talk elaboratively about the past on children’s understanding of mind. The researchers randomly assigned 102 mothers of 19-month-old children to a training or no-training group. Mothers in the experimental group received training in an elaborative style of talking about the past when children were 21, 25, and 29 months of age. Children were assessed on a battery of theory-of-mind tasks at 44 months. Results showed that children with initially lower levels of expressive vocabulary in the trained group benefited from elaborative talk about the past in terms of their understanding of mind. The article discusses the role of elaborative reminiscing, and specifically the importance of elaborative questions about the past, in children’s growing representational skills.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children’s ability to understand the subjective experience of their own and others’ social worlds via their social interactions has generated considerable research interest (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723713493347">Carpendale &amp; Lewis, 2006</xref>, for a review). Specifically, one such aspect of social interaction – elaborative reminiscing in which parents include rich memory cues in past event conversations with their children – offers a partial explanation for how communicative processes might support children’s developing theory of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723713493347">Welch-Ross, 1997</xref>). The present intervention study extends this line of research by directly testing the effect of training mothers to talk more elaboratively about past events on children’s theory of mind development.</p>
<p>There are now well-established links between parent–child conversations about mental states and emotions, and individual differences in children’s social understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723713493347">Adrián, Clemente, &amp; Villanueva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723713493347">Howard, Mayeux, &amp; Naigles, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723713493347">Jenkins, Turrell, Kogushi, Lollis, &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723713493347">Meins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723713493347">Ruffman, Slade, &amp; Crowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142723713493347">Slaughter, Peterson, &amp; Mackintosh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142723713493347">Symons, Fossum, &amp; Collins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723713493347">Taumoepeau &amp; Ruffman, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723713493347">2008</xref>). There is also evidence that parent–child conversational turns that are semantically connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723713493347">Ensor &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>) and elaborated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142723713493347">Peterson &amp; Slaughter, 2003</xref>) go some way towards developing children’s understanding of the representational nature of mental states. Against this background, we consider below the conversational co-construction of a mental state in more detail within the context of reminiscing.</p>
<sec id="section2-0142723713493347">
<title>Talking about the past and children’s mind development</title>
<p>It is not just the use of mental state language in the here-and-now that provides information about the mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713493347">Fivush, Haden, and Reese (2006)</xref> argued that it is critical to distinguish between talk about mental states in the past and present. Reminiscing is important for maintaining continuity between our past internal states and our present situation. Because talk about the past focuses solely on communication about mental states (i.e., memories), it is a potentially powerful conversational tool for informing children’s growing understanding of mind (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142723713493347">Nelson &amp; Fivush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713493347">Fivush et al. (2006)</xref> argued that past event conversations offer an opportunity for parents to reflect with their children on past mental states, including past emotions, in a manner that is qualitatively different to talk elicited in many previous studies of children’s mental state understanding. Thus, many studies (as noted above) have examined maternal talk about ongoing mental states or talk about characters in a picture book. Talk about personally experienced mental states may engender more in-depth discussion between parent and child about the causes and resolution of those states. Parents who engage more extensively in these types of explanations about past mental states, especially past negative emotional states, have children with better socioemotional skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723713493347">Laible, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723713493347">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723713493347">Laible &amp; Song, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723713493347">Laible &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723713493347">van Bergen, Salmon, Dadds, &amp; Allen, 2009</xref>), a more integrated self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723713493347">Bird &amp; Reese, 2006</xref>), and better coping skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0142723713493347">Sales &amp; Fivush, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual variation in a mother’s style of reminiscing about the past influences the impact of reminiscing on children’s later memory retrieval (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723713493347">Boland, Haden, &amp; Ornstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723713493347">Hedrick, Haden, &amp; Ornstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>), language and narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723713493347">Peterson, Jesso, &amp; McCabe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>), as well as being linked to children’s understanding of print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723713493347">Leyva, Reese, &amp; Wiser, 2011</xref>), and theory of mind development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>). Highly elaborative reminiscing is characterized by talk about the past that provides statements rich in detail and engenders child participation in reconstructing the past event through the use of open-ended questions and questions that allow the child to confirm or deny new pieces of information. These characteristics provide explicit opportunities to discuss reasons for the child’s experienced internal states as well as exposing the child to contrasting perspectives on a shared event. Moreover, the use of open-ended questions actively encourages the child to provide his or her perspective on the event. In contrast, a low elaborative style is characterized by fewer elaborative statements and open-ended questions and tends to engender more repetitive past event discussions. Indeed, not only do parents vary in the degree to which they elaborate about the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713493347">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>), but mothers who are <italic>highly</italic> elaborative during past event conversations have children with a more advanced theory of mind, both in terms of their own previous false beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723713493347">Welch-Ross, 1997</xref>) and their understanding of the source of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>), even after controlling for children’s language skill.</p>

<title>Language and theory of mind</title>
<p>Children’s language abilities are closely linked with their performance on theory-of-mind tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723713493347">Astington &amp; Baird, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723713493347">Milligan, Astington, &amp; Dack, 2007</xref>) and production of memory narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723713493347">Farrant &amp; Reese, 2000</xref>). One set of explanations for why language impacts the development of theory of mind focuses on the interrelation between children’s language skills and the development of such skills for interpreting and understanding the representational nature of conversations about mental states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723713493347">Farrar &amp; Maag, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723713493347">Fernández, 2013</xref>) and past events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142723713493347">Nelson, 2005</xref>). When children understand that language represents all manner of events and experiences (e.g., past events), they are then in a position to make sense of conflicting and dual representations of these events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142723713493347">
<title>Goals and hypotheses</title>
<p>The overarching aim of this study was to extend the correlational findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723713493347">Welch-Ross (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese and Cleveland (2006)</xref> by testing the reported relations between parental reminiscing style and children’s theory of mind at 44 months using an experimental intervention paradigm. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723713493347">van Bergen et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated in a training study an association between child–adult elaborative talk about past events and children’s emotion understanding, to our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effects of training parents in elaborative reminiscing for promoting children’s theory-of-mind understanding more broadly.</p>
<p>The present analyses extend a training study of the effects of elaborative reminiscing on children’s autobiographical memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>). The findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese and Newcombe (2007)</xref> showed that increased parental reminiscing as a function of training leads to children having richer and more accurate memories of the past at age three and a half, especially if their initial levels of self-awareness were high. In the current study, we extend the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese and Newcombe (2007)</xref> in the same sample by examining the effect of training mothers to talk more elaboratively with their children from age one and a half to two and a half on children’s theory of mind at age three and a half.</p>
<p>Our first hypothesis was that elaborative talk about past events allows a child to reflect on the relation between mental states and the events around them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>) and to engage in information and perspective-sharing discussion. Therefore, we predicted that children of trained mothers would have a more advanced understanding of mind by age three and a half, over and above mothers’ use of mental state language more generally, which is known to predict theory of mind development in preschool children.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis was that children’s exposure to elaborative reminiscing, as a function of their training group, might moderate the well-known relation between children’s language development and their theory of mind. Because our training scheme was based on a dialogic model of parent–child conversation, it is conceivable that more elaborative maternal reminiscing in the trained group might moderate the language effect on theory of mind development. We predicted that features of elaborative talk that place particular emphasis on the participatory aspect of parent–child reminiscing, such as questions and confirmations of children’s past event information, would actively encourage the co-construction of the past event. Therefore, the explicit linguistic scaffolding of this type of talk is most likely to benefit children with lower productive language levels. We contrasted this to non-participatory elaborative talk, such as elaborative statements, which reinforce the representation of a past event but do not necessarily engender children’s participation in discussing the event. In other words, variation in children’s exposure to elaborative talk might have a differential effect on children’s theory of mind as a function of their level of language ability. We predicted that maternal elaborative reminiscing would moderate the effects of low productive language levels on children’s theory of mind.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0142723713493347">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We initially recruited 128 families with one and a half year old (19 months) children to participate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref> for details about the initial sample). By the three and a half year (44 months) post-test, 26 families had dropped out of the study because of family moves or inability to contact (20), personal reasons (5), or the child being placed in foster care (1). The final sample thus consisted of 102 families (42 girls; 62 first-borns) who participated at all timepoints. Most of the families came from New Zealand European backgrounds (89.2%), with the remaining families coming from Māori (8.8%) and Asian (2%) backgrounds. All children spoke English as their first language. The children’s mothers had an average of 14.57 years of education (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.14) upon entry into the study, with a median of 14 years. The families’ socioeconomic status was calculated on the basis of paternal occupation for 93 families who provided this information. On average, the families were of middle socioeconomic status, with a mean of 2.91 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.41) on a paternal occupational scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723713493347">Elley &amp; Irving, 1976</xref>). A 1 on this scale denotes a skilled professional such as a lawyer or doctor, whereas a 6 represents an unskilled laborer. Results of one-way analyses of variance with retention status as the between-subjects factor indicated that families who left the study either during the training year or at the time of the 44-month post-test did not differ significantly from families who completed the study in terms of mothers’ initial education, fathers’ occupation, or children’s language (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .06; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0142723713493347">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>Female researchers visited all families at home for a pre-test at 19 months, and then every two months (at 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29) during a training phase, followed by post-tests at 32 and 44 months (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723713493347">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref> for details). Only mothers in the intervention group participated in reminiscing training at 21, 25, and 29 months. All children received a small gift at the completion of each session.</p>

<sec id="section9-0142723713493347">
<title>Past event conversations</title>
<p>Parents were asked to converse with their children about two past events. Mothers were free to choose any events they wished to discuss with their children, as long as those events had only occurred once and mothers had been present at the event. Mothers typically chose recent outings to discuss with children such as farm visits, parades, or museum visits. Mothers were instructed to talk with their children about the two events for as long as they wished in as natural a way as possible. Researchers left the room during the conversations, which were videotaped and audiotaped.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0142723713493347">
<title>Past event coding</title>
<p>Immediately after the pre-test visit, researchers scored children’s language and coded the mother–child past event conversations directly from video. The conversations were coded directly from videotape because of the short timeframe available for group assignment, which precluded the time-consuming process of transcribing conversations and coding from transcripts. Videotaped conversations were coded only for variables identified as most critical for mother–child reminiscing at this age in previous research with a different sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723713493347">Farrant &amp; Reese, 2000</xref>): (1) mothers’ open-ended questions containing new information (<italic>open-ended elaborative questions</italic>; e.g., <italic>What color was the fish?</italic>); (2) children’s provisions of new information (<italic>memory elaborations</italic>; e.g., <italic>pink</italic>); and (3) children’s empty but attentive conversational turns (<italic>placeholders</italic>; e.g., <italic>I don’t know</italic>). Placeholders are an important indicator of children’s willingness to engage in past event conversations, especially at younger ages when they are not yet supplying much memory information. Placeholders (along with memory information) act as a measure of how on-topic or engaged the child is in conversing about the target event. As children get older, memory information increases and placeholders decrease, but both codes reflect on-topic contributions to the conversation. Indeed, placeholders at 19 months predict children’s later provision of memory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723713493347">Farrant &amp; Reese, 2000</xref>: Figure 3). Placeholders must be coded from videotape at young ages because, similar to a measure of joint attention, coders must note children’s shared eye gaze with the mother during the conversational turn. A second coder independently coded 25% of the 19-month conversations from videotape and reached a reliability of 86.3% (kappa = .80) with the main coder across the three critical codes.</p>

<sec id="section11-0142723713493347">
<title>Children’s language</title>
<p>Mothers completed the MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (MCDI:WS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723713493347">Fenson et al., 1994</xref>) for their children over the ensuing week and returned it along with a demographic form in a prepaid courier envelope approximately one week after the visit. We adapted this inventory slightly by listing a New Zealand equivalent beside 24 of the words (e.g., crib/cot and diaper/nappy, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Read, 2000</xref>). The language inventories were scored for children’s total vocabulary, the mean sentence length for the three longest sentences, and a sentence complexity score. Because most children were only beginning to combine words at 19 months, performance on the sentence measures was at floor and these measures are not included in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0142723713493347">
<title>Group assignment</title>
<p>Mothers were first classified as having lower or higher levels of education based on the presence or absence of tertiary education. Within each educational group, each dyad was then matched as closely as possible to another dyad on the basis of children’s total vocabulary and maternal open-ended elaborative questions. Then the two dyads in each pair were randomly assigned to either the training or no-training group prior to the 21-month visit. The final sample at the 44-month timepoint consisted of 49 dyads (18 females) in the training group and 53 (29 females) dyads in the untrained or no-training group.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0142723713493347">
<title>Training phase (21–29 months)</title>
<p>All families were visited every two months in the home during the training phase (at 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29 months). The same two female researchers each visited half of the families. Half of each researcher’s families were in the training group and half were in the no-training group. At each of these visits, researchers asked all mothers to complete a new MCDI:WS language inventory for their children and mail the inventory back to researchers in a prepaid courier bag within one week of the home visit. All children also participated in deferred imitation assessments at each of these sessions. These interim language and memory assessments are not pertinent to the present analyses.</p>
<p>At the end of the 21-, 25-, and 29-month sessions, researchers supplied mothers in the training group with a bag containing an instruction sheet and a battery-operated tape recorder loaded with a 60-minute cassette. The instruction sheet was titled ‘Tips for Talking about the Past’ (see Appendix in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>). Researchers introduced the reminiscing conversations to mothers as a way to extend their children’s language development. They explained that children would be better able to participate in the conversations if mothers chose shared events as a topic and asked <italic>what, when, who</italic>, and <italic>where</italic> questions about the event. If children didn’t respond, mothers should rephrase their question to contain <italic>new information</italic> to help their children participate. When children did provide a response, mothers were encouraged to praise children’s responses and then follow up with another open-ended question. Researchers asked mothers to talk with their children as often as possible over the ensuing week in an elaborative fashion about past experiences. They encouraged mothers to keep it fun by giving lots of cuddles during the conversation. Researchers also provided mothers with a certificate and a stamp, and encouraged mothers to let the child stamp the certificate each time they discussed a past event. We initially intended to use these interim recordings as an additional manipulation check, but because not all mothers returned the tapes after each training session, or reported that they had forgotten to record their conversations onto the tapes, we did not analyze these recordings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>). The reminiscing conversations at 32 months (post-test 1) served as the manipulation check.</p>

<sec id="section14-0142723713493347">
<title>Post-test 1 (32 months)</title>
<p>The same two female researchers from the pre-test visited all families at home for two post-test sessions to test children’s language and past event conversations. The primary researcher was unaware of the children’s group assignment and conducted all tasks. The researcher who had visited families during the training phase operated the audio and video equipment.</p>
<sec id="section15-0142723713493347">
<title>Past event conversations</title>
<p>At the first session of the 32-month post-test, mothers participated in a past event conversation with their children about two recent shared past events that had occurred since the last home visit, and the end of the training phase, three months before. Therefore, mothers never discussed with their children events they had previously discussed during the training phase. The primary researcher gave all mothers, regardless of training group assignment, the same instructions as at pre-test for these past event conversations, which was to talk in whatever way and for as long as they wished about the past events. Researchers were out of the room during the past event discussions, which were audiotaped and videotaped.</p>

<sec id="section16-0142723713493347">
<title>Past event coding</title>
<p>Mother–child post-test reminiscing conversations were transcribed fully and coded from transcripts with a mutually exclusive and exhaustive coding scheme. Relevant codes for this study included open-ended elaborative questions, closed-end elaborative questions (<italic>Did we see a fish?</italic>), elaborative statements (<italic>We saw a pink fish at the aquarium</italic>.), confirmations or negations of a child’s response (<italic>Yes, that’s right!)</italic>. Relevant children’s codes were again their provision of memory elaborations, placeholders, and their repetitions of information previously introduced in the conversation (<italic>memory repetitions</italic>; e.g., <italic>Pink fish</italic> after mother asks ‘<italic>Did we see a pink fish?</italic>’) and off-topic talk (<italic>I wanna go play now</italic>.). Additional codes assessed mothers’ repetitive utterances (<italic>Remember we saw a fish?</italic> After <italic>Did we see a fish?</italic>) and mothers’ and children’s meta-cognitive utterances (<italic>I don’t remember that part</italic>), associative links to other related events (<italic>Last week we saw fish at the doctor’s office, you’re right</italic>), and off-topic utterances (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref> for more detail). These additional codes either occurred infrequently (meta-cognitive, associative, and off-topic talk) or were not conceptually related to the outcome of children’s theory of mind (maternal repetitions). We also created a non-elaborative talk variable that excluded all maternal utterances that were elaborative questions, statements, or confirmations and other utterances that have been linked in prior research to an elaborative reminiscing style such as evaluations, associative and meta-memory talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723713493347">Reese, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Fivush, 1993</xref>). The non-elaborative variable consisted of mainly repetitions, prompts, off-topic and unclassifiable talk. Reliability between two independent coders on 25% of the transcripts was 85% (Cohen’s kappa = .79) for mothers’ codes and 88% (Cohen’s kappa = .80) for children’s codes. The main coder then coded all remaining transcripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0142723713493347">
<title>Past event mental state language coding</title>
<p>Each maternal utterance was also coded for references to mental state terms. The criteria for this coding scheme were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723713493347">Taumoepeau and Ruffman (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723713493347">2008)</xref>. Each maternal utterance was coded for references to desire, emotional, and cognitive states. A total mental state language variable for each event was created. Reliability between two independent coders on 25% of the transcripts was 80% (Cohen’s kappa = .76) for mothers’ codes. The main coder then coded all remaining transcripts. All mother–child conversational coding at post-test 1 was completed prior to the 44-month timepoint (post-test 2), so coders were blind to children’s theory of mind performance.</p>

<sec id="section18-0142723713493347">
<title>Children’s language</title>
<p>At each session, the primary researcher administered a standardized language measure, one for receptive and one for expressive vocabulary. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III, Form A (PPVT-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723713493347">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>) was administered at the beginning of the first session and the companion Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142723713493347">Williams, 1997</xref>) was administered at the beginning of the second session. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723713493347">Reese and Read (2000)</xref>, we allowed children to substitute New Zealand words for certain objects (e.g., <italic>wardrobe</italic> for <italic>closet</italic>). Both tests have good reliability and validity for children as young as two and a half years of age. Standard scores for both measures were used in analyses. Mothers also completed the MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (MCDI:WS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723713493347">Fenson et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section19-0142723713493347">
<title>Post-test 2 (44 months)</title>
<p>Children’s theory of mind was tested on a battery of six tasks originally adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723713493347">Welch-Ross (1997</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>) in two sessions separated by one week. Mother–child reminiscing conversations and language assessments were also conducted at the 44-month timepoint, but we do not discuss those measures here (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>). Three of the tasks (appearance-reality, unexpected contents, and mistaken location) tested children’s understanding of conflicting representations and the other three tasks (see-know, see-tell, and informative views) tested children’s understanding of the origins of knowledge. The order of tasks was counterbalanced within and across the two sessions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723713493347">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In the appearance-reality task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723713493347">Gopnik &amp; Astington, 1988</xref>), the researcher showed children a sponge that was painted to look like a rock, and asked, ‘What does this look like to your eyes right now?’ If the child gave the correct answer (rock), the researcher said, ‘Yeah, it looks like a rock.’ If the child gave the incorrect answer (sponge), the researcher stated the correct answer for the child, ‘It looks like a rock, doesn’t it?’ The researcher then directed the child’s attention to look at what the prop did, and squashed the sponge, and then handed it to the child. While the child was touching the prop, the researcher asked the child, ‘What is this really?’ If necessary, the researcher prompted with, ‘Is it really a rock or really a sponge?’ with the options in counterbalanced order. If the child gave the correct answer, the researcher said, ‘Yeah, it’s really a sponge.’ If the child gave the incorrect answer, the researcher said, ‘Well, it’s really a sponge.’ The researcher then removed the prop from the child, and asked the child, ‘When you first saw this, before you touched it, what did you think it was?’ The researcher prompted with, ‘Did you think it was a sponge or did you think it was a rock?’ with the options in counterbalanced order. Finally, the researcher introduced the child to a Big Bird puppet and said, ‘Big Bird has never touched this. What does Big Bird think this is?’ The researcher prompted the child with, ‘Does Big Bird think this is a rock or does Big Bird think this is a sponge?’ with the options in counterbalanced order. Children received 1 point for answering each of the last two questions correctly (maximum score of 2).</p>
<p>For the unexpected contents task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723713493347">Gopnik &amp; Astington, 1988</xref>), the researcher showed children a closed crayon box and asked if they knew what was inside the box. If the child gave the correct answer (crayons), the researcher confirmed that it was a good guess. If the child gave any other answer, the researcher stated the correct answer for the child (‘It looks like a crayon box, doesn’t it?’). The researcher then opened the box and revealed that there were candles inside and showed the contents to the child. The researcher closed the box and then asked the first belief question. ‘Before, when you first saw the box all closed up like this, what did you think was inside the box?’ The researcher prompted the child if necessary with ‘candles’ or ‘crayons’ in counterbalanced order. Then the researcher introduced the child to a Cookie Monster puppet and asked the second belief question. ‘This is Cookie Monster. He hasn’t looked inside the box. What does Cookie Monster think is inside the box?’ The researcher put Cookie Monster away and then asked the control question, ‘What is really inside the box?’ Children received one point for each of the belief questions only if they answered the control question correctly (maximum score of 2).</p>
<p>The mistaken location task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142723713493347">Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983</xref>) assessed children’s understanding of false belief. The researcher introduced children to two puppets, Big Bird and Elmo, and proceeded to tell a story about the puppets both playing with a toy car. Big Bird then put the car into the blue box before leaving to eat lunch. Elmo proceeded to take the car out of the box and continue playing with it, before putting it back in a red box, and then leaving to eat his lunch. When Big Bird returned from lunch, the researcher asked the child, ‘Where will Big Bird look for the toy car?’ If the child did not answer the question, the researcher prompted, ‘Will Big Bird look for the car in the blue box or the red box?’ with the order of the boxes counterbalanced. Finally, the researcher asked a control question, ‘Where is the car really?’ Children’s answers were given a score of 1 (correct) if they passed the control question and answered the false belief question correctly. A score of 0 was given if the children answered either question incorrectly (maximum score of 1).</p>
<p>The see-know task assessed children’s understanding that visual access equates to knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723713493347">Wimmer, Hogrefe, &amp; Perner, 1988</xref>). The researcher had a box and a bag of small objects (spoon, boot, suitcase, and stop sign). First, the child was introduced to the puppet Big Bird. Big Bird had a hat over his eyes and ears and the child was told that when this occurred, he could not see or hear anything. In two trials, the ‘self’ trials, after placing a prop inside the box, the researcher asked the child to look inside the box, then closed the box and asked, ‘Do you know what’s inside the box?’ and then, ‘Does Big Bird know what’s inside the box?’ In the remaining ‘other’ trials, after the researcher placed the prop inside the box, the puppet looked into the box but the researcher did not allow the child to see inside the box. The child was asked, ‘Does Big Bird know what’s inside the box?’ followed by, ‘Do you know what’s inside the box?’ The order of the props and trials was counterbalanced. A score of 1 was given for each trial in which the children answered correctly both questions (maximum of 4).</p>
<p>The see-tell task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723713493347">Gopnik &amp; Graf, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142723713493347">O’Neill &amp; Gopnik, 1991</xref>) was used to assess children’s experiential origins of their knowledge. The researchers placed four small objects, one at a time, inside an opaque bag. The four objects were plastic flowers, a tennis racket, an egg, and a hat. On two ‘tell’ trials, the researchers placed an object inside the bag but did not allow the child to see the object, closed the bag and then told the child what was inside the bag (e.g., ‘There are some flowers inside this bag’). The researcher then asked the child, ‘What is inside the bag?’ After the child responded, the researcher then asked, ‘How do you know what’s inside?’ If the child did not respond, the researcher prompted them with, ‘Did you see what was inside, or did I tell you what’s inside?’ On two ‘see’ trials, the researcher placed an object inside the bag, and then showed the child what was inside before closing the bag and asking them what was inside. The remainder of the trial continued as above. The order of the props and trials was counterbalanced. Children were given one point for every question answered correctly (maximum of 4).</p>
<p>The informative views task also assessed children’s understanding of the origins of knowledge (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723713493347">Taylor, 1988</xref>). The researcher introduced the child to a puppet, Elmo, and showed that when Elmo wears a hat with ear flaps he was not able to see or hear anything. Then the researcher showed the child a picture that contained two animals (a giraffe and an elephant). First, the child was asked to identify each animal. Then, the child was shown the same picture five times. In trial 1, the picture was completely covered; in trials 2 and 3 a small ambiguous part of one animal was visible; in trial 4 an identifiable part of the giraffe was visible, and in trial 5 (control), the complete picture was visible. At each trial, the researcher removed Elmo’s hat and allowed Elmo to ‘look’ at the picture and stated, ‘This is what Elmo can see now.’ Then the researcher asked, ‘Does Elmo know if there’s an elephant in the picture?’ and ‘Does Elmo know if there’s a giraffe in the picture?’ The order of questions was counterbalanced across trials. The child received one point for each of the first four trials if they answered both questions correctly (no to all questions in the first three trials and a ‘yes’ in the fourth trial to the giraffe question). If a child failed to answer ‘yes’ to either of the questions in trial 5, however, they received a score of 0 for the entire task (maximum score of 4).</p>

<title>Data reduction</title>
<p>Missing data were dealt with in all analyses by substituting the mean score for that child’s training group. There were 27 pieces of missing data out of 1428 tasks (1.8%). At pre-test, one mother–child conversation was not recorded. At post-test 1, seven children had missing data for the PPVT; five children had missing data for the EVT; and four mother–child conversations were not recorded. At post-test 2, three children did not complete the see-know task, two children did not complete the informative views task, and two children did not complete the appearance-reality, mistaken location, and mistaken contents tasks. Note that if a child failed the control question for a theory-of-mind task, they were given a score of 0 for that task. Some variables were positively skewed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723713493347">Table 2</xref>): the language and conversational variables at pre-test, and three of the conversational variables at post-test 1 (mothers’ elaborative statements and both child conversation variables). Log transformations were completed on the skewed variables and transformed scores were used in all correlational and covariance analyses. Untransformed variables are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723713493347">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Preliminary analyses indicated that all tasks assessing theory of mind, except for mistaken locations, were moderately intercorrelated, <italic>r</italic>(100) = .24–.50, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt;.01. We created a composite theory-of-mind score using the mean aggregate of the standardized scores (<italic>z</italic>-scores) of the informative views, see-tell, see-know, unexpected contents, and appearance-reality tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723713493347">Ensor &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>). The alpha for this theory-of-mind total score was .70. We omitted the mistaken identity task as it failed to correlate with any of the other tasks; the descriptives indicated that performance on this task was at floor (73% had a score of 0).</p>
<p>There were no differences at pre- and post-test in maternal use of elaborations with boys versus girls, nor did girls and boys differ in their theory-of-mind task performance (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .45). The following main analyses were conducted on the sample as a whole.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0142723713493347">
<title>Pre-test analyses</title>
<p>Although at pre-test there were no significant differences between the trained and untrained group in terms of children’s total vocabulary, there was a trend for the children in the trained group to have slightly poorer MCDI:WS total vocabulary, <italic>F</italic>(1, 100) = 3.51, <italic>p</italic> = .06. A further trend was found for mothers in the no-training group to have fewer years of education than mothers in the training group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 100) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> = .05. For this reason, maternal education and child MCDI vocabulary at pre-test are covaried in all analyses assessing effects of training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0142723713493347">
<title>Changes in mothers’ talk as a function of training</title>
<p>Our first goal was to determine if the trained mothers differed from mothers in the untrained group in their past event style at post-test 1, shortly after the training phase (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0142723713493347">Table 3</xref>). We tested changes in three groups of dependent variables: non-elaborative talk, four components of elaborative reminiscing (open-ended elaborative questions, closed-ended questions, elaborative statements, confirmations), and mental state language. In addition to maternal education, we also controlled for pre-test maternal and child elaboration variables that were correlated with post-test maternal elaboration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0142723713493347">Table 3</xref>). We used one-way ANCOVA (between-subjects factor: training [trained, untrained]; covariates: maternal education, maternal elaborative questions, children’s memory elaborations and placeholders at pre-test, children’s MCDI:WS pre-test) to test for post-test differences in mothers’ elaborative, non-elaborative talk, and mental state language. Results yielded no main effects of training for mothers’ non-elaborative talk, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 2.91, <italic>n.s</italic>., nor for maternal mental state language, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = .169, <italic>n.s</italic>. For elaborative reminiscing, there were significant main effects of training on mothers’ use of open-ended elaborative questions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 7.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>p</italic>η<sup>2</sup> = .07 and confirmations of children’s utterances, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 10.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>p</italic>η<sup>2</sup> = .10 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723713493347">Table 2</xref>), with no effects on elaborative statements, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 1.44, <italic>n.s</italic>., or closed-ended questions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = .81, <italic>n.s</italic>. Thus, mothers who were trained to use more open-ended questions and encouraged to praise their children’s responses (confirmations) in elaborative reminiscing were indeed more elaborative than mothers in the untrained group at post-test 1. Moreover, this effect was specific to an increase in mothers’ use of open-ended elaborative questions and confirmations, rather than in non-elaborative talk or the general quantity of maternal talk per se.</p>

<title>Changes in children’s talk as a function of training</title>
<p>We also determined if children’s use of memory elaborations and conversational placeholders changed as a function of training. Using ANCOVA (between-subjects fixed factor: training group [trained, untrained]; covariates: maternal education, maternal open-ended elaborative questions, children’s memory elaborations and placeholders, child language at pre-test) results yielded a main effect of maternal training, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 5.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), <italic>p</italic>η<sup>2</sup> = .05, on children’s memory elaborations, but not on their conversation placeholders, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = .43, <italic>n.s</italic>. Thus, children of trained mothers used significantly more memory elaborations at post-test 1 even after controlling for their language (MCDI and memory elaborations and placeholders) at pre-test and mothers’ education (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723713493347">Table 2</xref>). There were no differences in children’s MCDI, EVT, and PPVT scores as a function of training (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .93) Thus the training had a specific effect on memory elaboration rather than an overall language effect.</p>

<title>Correlates of children’s theory of mind</title>
<p>Across the sample, children’s theory of mind at post-test 2 was correlated with their total MCDI vocabulary, PPVT, EVT, memory elaborations, and placeholders at pre-test and post-test 1. At post-test 1, maternal use of elaborative questions (including both open and closed questions), confirmations, and mental state language were also correlated with children’s theory of mind at post-test 2. Neither maternal use of elaborative statements or non-elaborative talk at post-test 1 was correlated with children’s later theory of mind (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0142723713493347">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Training effects on children’s theory of mind</title>
<p>Given that mothers indeed benefited from the training scheme in that they used more open-ended elaborative questions at post-test, our main goal was to test the main effect of training mothers on individual variation in children’s theory-of-mind scores at post-test 2. Using hierarchical regression, we entered all covariates of theory of mind (see section above) in the first step (mothers’ education, open-ended elaborative questions at pre-test, and children’s pre-test memory elaborations plus placeholders and pre-test MCDI scores) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0142723713493347">Table 4</xref>).

<p>Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0142723713493347">Table 4</xref> contains the beta weights of the final step in the regression. The results show that there was no main effect of maternal training on children’s theory of mind, over and above the effect of children’s language.</p>
<p>As predicted, children’s language ability was significantly related to children’s theory of mind development. The second analysis examined if this relation was moderated by the training. To test this, we re-ran the regression model depicted in Model 1 and included the interaction term of training group (dummy variable: control) × 19-month total MCDI score centered (continuous variable) in the final step (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0142723713493347">Table 4</xref>, Model 2). The results show that the interaction term was indeed significant and accounted for an additional 4% of the variance in children’s total theory-of-mind scores at post-test 2, <italic>F</italic>(1, 95) = 4.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Thus, for every standard deviation decrease in children’s language the effect of training significantly increases. The effect of training mothers to talk more elaboratively reduced the effect of language on theory of mind, thus buffering children who were reported to produce fewer vocabulary items. Moreover, the slopes of these equations depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0142723713493347">Figure 1</xref> show that the relation between language and theory of mind for children in the trained group was no longer significant, <italic>t</italic>(98) = .31, <italic>n.s</italic>., whereas the slope for the untrained group remained significantly different from zero, <italic>t</italic>(98) = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In other words, by buffering their language through maternal training, the theory-of-mind differences at post-test 2 between the children with higher and lower reported vocabulary at the outset of the study were erased.</p>

<title>Potential mechanisms underlying changes in children’s theory-of-mind scores</title>
<p>To check that the increases in elaborative reminiscing are indeed driving this effect, we tested whether mothers’ use of conversational features that engender child participation in the discussion, such as elaborative questioning (open and closed) and confirmations, was a mechanism underlying the moderating effect of training on the relation between language and theory of mind. We were thus interested in whether the effects of these specific features of mothers’ past event conversations might account for the buffering effect on the relation between language and theory of mind. To test this, we ran another regression, in which we entered the same set of covariates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0142723713493347">Table 4</xref>. In the next step we entered our composite elaborative reminiscing variable (maternal elaborative questions and confirmations at post-test 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723713493347">Cleveland, Reese, &amp; Grolnick, 2007</xref>) and child MCDI at pre-test, followed by the interaction term of composite elaborative reminiscing at post-test 1 × child MCDI at pre-test. In the final step, we included children’s EVT post-test 1 scores to control for the possibility that children’s post-intervention expressive language scores might be driving the effects on theory of mind.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0142723713493347">Table 5</xref>, the final model accounts for a significant 29% of the variance in children’s theory of mind scores at post-test 2. The interaction between the composite measure of mothers’ elaborative talk and children’s initial language accounted for a further significant 4% in variance, <italic>F</italic>(1,93) = 6.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The addition of children’s 32-month EVT scores did not make a significant contribution to further variance. As a final analysis we tested the interaction effect of mothers’ elaborative statements and children’s initial language. This interaction term did not make a significant contribution to children’s later theory of mind. Therefore, it appears to be mothers’ elaborative talk engendering child participation that is particularly effective for promoting theory of mind in children who are less linguistically proficient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overarching aim of this study was to extend our understanding of how one source of parent–child conversations, that is, highly elaborative reminiscing about past events, directly contributes to children’s mind understanding. Moreover, we used a training paradigm to examine the causal effects of any purported relation. Thus, we examined whether training a group of mothers in elaborative ways of talking about past events had a direct effect on their children’s mind understanding. As reported elsewhere, the effects of training mothers to talk more elaboratively resulted in increases in maternal elaborative reminiscing as well as increases in children’s provision of memory information about past events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research has established a clear relation between children’s language abilities and theory-of-mind understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723713493347">Milligan et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we replicated these findings in our study, such that children with better language skills, irrespective of their experimental condition, had better theory-of-mind scores across all theory-of-mind tasks, and that maternal references to mental states were also related to children’s performance on theory-of-mind tasks. Our main finding, however, demonstrated that the relation between language development and theory of mind was conditional on whether mothers had been trained in elaborative reminiscing, over and above their use of mental state language. A pattern of effect emerged in which children who had initially low levels of language at pre-test benefited from mothers who were trained to talk frequently about past events and who elaborated on those events using techniques that encouraged children’s participation, such as elaborative questions and confirmations of children’s provision of memory information. Although the percentage of variance in theory of mind accounted for by this interaction was small, the effect was such that the theory-of-mind abilities of low-language children of trained mothers began to look similar to the theory-of-mind abilities of children with higher language skills as a result of maternal training in elaborative reminiscing. This effect was not observed in the untrained group. That is, in the untrained group, children with low language abilities continued to exhibit lower theory-of-mind scores than children with higher language abilities. This finding adds to and is consistent with the finding that the beneficial effect of siblings on children’s understanding of mind is restricted to children with low language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723713493347">Jenkins &amp; Astington, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Why would increases in elaborative questioning and confirmations benefit children’s theory of mind, and why would there be a specific effect for children with smaller vocabularies? From a socio-constructivist point of view, parent talk about past events that draws on children’s experienced mental states would most likely benefit children who are in a period of transition marked by lower language skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723713493347">Jenkins &amp; Astington, 1996</xref>). By three and a half years of age, children are capable of narrating and representing personal experiences in a primitive but canonical story form with their inclusion of actions, descriptions, orientating, and evaluating devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723713493347">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>). These narrative skills provide evidence of language that may help children internalize and strengthen their theory of mind. The benefit of elaborative questioning for children with lower language skills is that it provides specific prompts and cues for the child to reflect on a past event (and therefore on the process of thinking), but also encourages the child to engage in the explicit exchange of information about a past event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723713493347">Kelly &amp; Bailey, 2013</xref>). In doing so, the technique engages the child in conversation about the shared perspective of an event, thereby introducing the child to different points of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142723713493347">Harris, 1996</xref>). In support of this claim, we found that children’s memory elaborations, which are a measure of increased provision of new information about the past event, also increased as a function of training and specifically as a function of mothers’ open-ended elaborative questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Newcombe, 2007</xref>). Consequently, mothers’ confirmations of children’s own memory elaborations were also particularly helpful for children’s later theory of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723713493347">Cleveland et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, children of mothers who use an elaborative reminiscing style are learning to co-create a richer shared representation of past events.</p>
<p>Children with better language skills are likely, on the other hand, to be better able to engage spontaneously in past event information exchange and therefore have more opportunities to benefit from the shared perspective derived from this type of information sharing. From this perspective, the finding that elaborative statements did not moderate the relation between language and theory of mind suggests that the benefit derived from elaborative reminiscing for children’s theory of mind is dependent on the <italic>active</italic> participation of children in the conversation. Elaborative statements, while also referring to past events, only provide extra information, but do not explicitly engage the child actively in the process of exchanging information about a shared representation. The effect of elaborative questioning and confirming is in line with the finding from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723713493347">Ensor and Hughes (2008)</xref> in which maternal use of semantically connected utterances at age two made a significant, independent contribution to children’s social understanding at age four. Although in that study parent input was obtained from daily experiences (and not solely from past events), the key similarity with the present study is that connected conversations, like elaborative questioning, involve the child in the co-construction of the shared event. Thus, elaborative questions and confirmations of children’s memory elaborations adds a new dimension to this finding, that is, talk that focuses on semantically related events helps focus the child on the co-construction of a shared event.</p>
<p>We cannot be certain from this study, however, whether elaborative reminiscing is uniquely effective in promoting children’s theory of mind. The children in the maternal training group also experienced more conversations with their mothers than did children in the control group. However, we can conclude that mothers’ elaborative questions and confirmations in the context of reminiscing are more beneficial than non-elaborative talk or elaborative statements for children’s theory of mind when language levels are low. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723713493347">van Bergen et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that mothers’ elaborative reminiscing conferred benefits for children’s emotion understanding over and above the effects of simply teaching mothers to interact with their children in a more positive way. Our study is the first to test experimentally the benefits of elaborative reminiscing for children’s theory of mind; in future research, it will be important to test the unique benefits of elaborative reminiscing over and above other types of positive parent–child interactions. For instance, examining the use of elaborative talk in other, non-past oriented conversations to see if an elaborative style per se is also effective in promoting theory of mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the study found that maternal mental state language did not uniquely contribute to children’s theory of mind within the context of reminiscing after accounting for maternal elaborations, this study did not examine separately mental state utterances within elaborative versus non-elaborative utterances. We found, however, that mothers’ elaborative questions were only modestly correlated with their mental state utterances, suggesting that these two types of utterances are not collinear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142723713493347">Rudek and Haden (2005)</xref> tracked mothers’ and children’s mental state terms in reminiscing from when children were 30 to 42 months. Children contributed very few mental state terms to past event talk at these ages, and mothers’ mental state talk at 30 months did not directly predict children’s mental state talk at 42 months. At these young ages, at least in the context of <italic>displaced events</italic>, perhaps elaborative questioning rather than specific mental state talk is more effective in helping children to build an understanding of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142723713493347">Ontai &amp; Thompson, 2008</xref>). At older ages, mothers’ meta-cognitive talk during past event conversations may be more beneficial for children’s theory of mind (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723713493347">Reese &amp; Cleveland, 2006</xref>). Future research could disentangle the longitudinal effect of maternal references to mental state terms in the here-and-now versus mental state talk during past events on children’s theory of mind.</p>
<p>It is also unclear at this stage if these findings could be extended to a more culturally diverse sample. Although there is some culturally mediated variation in the extent to which parents will engage in reminiscing talk with their children, elaborative reminiscing across cultural and socioeconomic groups is predictive of children’s autobiographical memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723713493347">Leyva, Reese, Grolnick, &amp; Price, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142723713493347">Reese, Hayne, &amp; MacDonald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723713493347">Wang, 2006</xref>). Further research needs to explore the utility of training parents in elaborative reminiscing for children’s theory-of-mind development in a more culturally heterogeneous sample.</p>
<p>The added contribution the present study makes, in addition to the firmer conclusions we can draw from an experimental design, is that it identifies how children’s language levels influence the extent to which children might benefit from different types of input in their theory-of-mind understanding. Taken together, these findings suggest new directions for research in which the effect of maternal input on theory of mind is assessed across conversational contexts. As such, this knowledge can help form a more nuanced picture of the specific ways in which different types of parental language input interact with children’s cognitive abilities to influence the development of theory of mind.</p>
