<abstract>
<p>The following insights into the reading skills of 312 participants in adult basic and secondary education programs are based on a principal components analysis of reading components’ contributions to variance in reading comprehension. Overall, 75% of variance was explained by four composite variables representing word skills, language comprehension, memory, and fluency errors (which was nonsignificant). Differences existed in the degree to which the three significant components contributed to variance by adults’ functional reading level. These differences demonstrate a progression in which lowest ability readers seem to primarily draw on word skills and secondarily on memory, mid-level readers begin to integrate language comprehension skills with word reading and memory, and better readers engage in a balance of all three skills and abilities, yet remain below the 25th percentile in reading comprehension. Intervention developers and instructors are encouraged to not view this population as homogeneous but rather to be sensitive to the differences in reading behaviors among adult education participants.</p>

<p>Forty-three percent of U.S. adults lack the basic knowledge and skills needed to do more than “search, comprehend, and use information from continuous texts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429197">Kutner, Greenberg, &amp; Baer, 2005</xref>, p. 2). Because more than 60 million (79%) of these adults are between 16 and 64 years of age, a large reading skill deficit exists among the current and future U.S. workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429197">Kutner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711429197">U.S. Census Bureau, 2000</xref>), and it has economic, civic, and cultural implications that merit the attention and resources of the scientific research community. However, most extant reading research and theory describe developing readers (i.e., children) or adults in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711429197">Kruidenier, 2002</xref>). Little is known about whether general theories of reading development apply to adult struggling readers and, in particular, those adults who make efforts to improve their reading skills through Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948711429197">AEFLA, 1998</xref>) programs (Title II). Effective adult education (AE) intervention development and planning may be hindered by lack of empirical data and reading models that describe this population.</p>

<title>Reading Models</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429197">Rapp, van den Broek, McMaster, Kendeou, and Espin (2007)</xref> cited a need for models that provide intervention developers a better understanding of processes in which struggling readers engage, how these processes compare to those of good readers, and under what circumstances those processes are ineffective. Several models of reading have been developed using data from children or typically achieving adolescent or adult readers. The simple view of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711429197">Gough &amp; Tunmer, 1986</xref>), which posits that reading comprehension is the product of word recognition and language comprehension, explains a substantial amount of variance in reading comprehension among young readers. The component model of reading adds a speed variable to the simple view to further explain variance in reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711429197">Joshi &amp; Aaron, 2000</xref>). Theory also supports such multicomponent models as the convergent skills model of reading development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948711429197">Vellutino, Tunmer, Jaccard, &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>), the interactive models of reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711429197">Verhoeven &amp; Perfetti, 2008</xref>), and the direct and inferential mediation model of reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711429197">Cromley &amp; Azevedo, 2007</xref>). However, we cannot assume that these models of reading will apply to adults with low reading levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711429197">MacArthur, Greenberg, Mellard, &amp; Sabatini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711429197">Miller, McCardle, &amp; Hernandez, 2010</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711429197">Nanda, Greenberg, and Morris (2010)</xref> attempted to fit data from AE participants with third- to fifth-grade reading levels to three child-based models of reading skills and concluded that child-based models could not be relied on to describe adult struggling readers.</p>

<title>Studies of Reading Components and Adults With Low Literacy</title>
<p>The path model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429197">Mellard, Fall, and Woods (2010)</xref> found 11 significant cause and effect relations between seven component skills and reading comprehension of AE participants. The most important paths in this model were from phonemic decoding to word reading, and from word reading to reading fluency. Paths from word reading to vocabulary and reading comprehension were also relatively important, and vocabulary, in turn, had an effect on both language and reading comprehensions. In addition, auditory working memory and rapid automatic naming were exogenous variables that indirectly contributed to reading comprehension. These findings still need to be tested across normative samples or an entirely different sample at different points in time.</p>
<p>This path model of AE participant reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429197">Mellard et al., 2010</xref>) is undergirded by several empirical studies of adults with reading difficulties that examined contributions to reading by individual components (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429197">Davidson &amp; Strucker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429197">Durgunoglu &amp; Oney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711429197">Greenberg, Ehri, &amp; Perin, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711429197">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711429197">Sabatini, 2002</xref>) and, in many instances, reported that these adults apply their skills in different, perhaps compensatory, ways compared to children. Several studies concluded that some adults with reading difficulties struggle because of their decoding skills and that low word recognition skills tend to lead to greater reliance on contextual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711429197">Bruck, 1998</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948711429197">Bell and Perfetti (1994)</xref> noticed that below-average adult readers had less effective word identification skills, especially with pseudo-words, and a less clear connection between memory constraints, efficient processing, and reading comprehension compared to studies of youth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711429197">Greenberg et al. (1997)</xref> found that adults and children differed in use of phonological and word recognition skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711429197">Greenberg et al. (2002)</xref> also found that adult readers were more likely to rely on visual decoding skills than on phonological skills and that decoding skills were weaker in adults than in children reading at comparable levels.</p>
<p>Research suggests that an AE participant reading model should include a word recognition component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429197">Catts, Hogan, &amp; Fey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429197">Cutting &amp; Scarborough, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711429197">Sabatini, Scarborough, Shore, Bruce, &amp; Sawaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948711429197">Vellutino et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429197">Davidson and Strucker (2002)</xref> studied word recognition, decoding, vocabulary, and reading comprehension skills of adults reading at a fourth- to sixth-grade equivalent. Native English speakers tended to score higher on reading comprehension than on word recognition, perhaps compensating for low word recognition by using context and substitution of real words for unrecognized words.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429197">Cutting and Scarborough (2006)</xref> proposed a speed component. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711429197">Sabatini (2002)</xref> supports this view, noting differences on word recognition tasks associated with reading speed, and observed that beginning adult readers struggled with word recognition and decoding skills in terms of accuracy and efficiency. General processing speed limitations and working memory may affect reading ability of adults with low literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711429197">Savage et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711429197">Stringer &amp; Stanovich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948711429197">Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987</xref>). Processing speed may in turn influence development of skills in word recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711429197">Stringer &amp; Stanovich, 2000</xref>). Given the association between speed and word recognition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711429197">Sabatini et al. (2007)</xref> suggested a word skills component encompassing reading speed and word recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429197">Perfetti, Yang, and Schmalhofer (2008)</xref> speculated that working memory played a role in differences in the speed with which skilled and poor comprehending college students moved from word recognition to integrated reading.</p>
<p>Fluency, defined as “the oral translation of text with speed and accuracy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711429197">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Jenkins, 2001</xref>, p. 239), may be another component that contributes to reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711429197">Sabatini et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711429197">Fuchs et al. (2001)</xref> found that reading fluency related more directly to reading comprehension than did word recognition, although the relationship was less strong in adults than in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948711429197">Sabatini, Sawaki, Shore, and Scarborough (2010)</xref> drew a later conclusion that a fluency component did not significantly improve on the simple view of a reading model.</p>
<p>The literature suggests expanding a reading components model to include such language comprehension elements as vocabulary and listening comprehension. Reading comprehension suffers when individuals with learning disabilities struggle with vocabulary knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711429197">Gersten, Fuchs, Williams, &amp; Baker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711429197">Stanovich, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711429197">Braze, Tabor, Shankweiler, and Mencl (2007)</xref> found that vocabulary and decoding were worthy targets of remediation among young, unskilled adult readers. A study of reading development found that poor readers in 3rd grade were most limited by word level reading skills and less so by verbal knowledge and reasoning; by 10th grade, verbal knowledge and reasoning became greater influences on poor readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711429197">Schatschneider et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711429197">Cunningham, Stanovich, and Wilson (1990)</xref>, in a confirmatory factor analysis of reading in undergraduate college students, included factors of verbal comprehension, word recognition, and reading ability. This study included measures of listening comprehension and working memory, yet with weaker loadings for verbal comprehension and word recognition.</p>

<title>Challenges to Measuring Component Skills</title>
<p>Although reading models validated with children do not adequately represent the reading of AE participants, the instruments used to measure the various component skills may be reliably used with adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711429197">MacArthur, Konold, Glutting, and Alamprese (2010)</xref> established internal reliability and construct validity with many of the measures used in past and present studies of adult reading. Nevertheless, measurement of comprehension and component skills poses a challenge. If two comprehension measures reflect different subsets of component skills, findings, although perhaps correlated, are likely to be mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429197">Cutting &amp; Scarborough, 2006</xref>). If an assessment measures one component in one study and a different component in another study, we would expect high correlations between these components. For example, the <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711429197">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>) measured vocabulary in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429197">Davidson &amp; Strucker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711429197">Greenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711429197">Truch, 1994</xref>); other studies used it to measure IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711429197">Bruck, 1998</xref>) or language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711429197">Cunningham et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429197">Cutting &amp; Scarborough, 2006</xref>). Correlations among measures become an important consideration in selecting components for study or in interpretation of results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0731948711429197">
<title>Differences Among Adults With Low Literacy</title>
<p>Assuming that measurement challenges can be adequately addressed, a single model representing AE participants may still be insufficient because they are not homogeneous in their component skill levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711429197">Mellard, Fall, and Mark (2009)</xref> found significant differences in word reading power and speed between learners grouped by AE reading levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429197">Davidson and Strucker (2002)</xref> likewise identified significant differences in component skills by reading level from a sample of AE learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429197">Patterson (2008)</xref> reported a high prevalence rate of learning disabilities (LD) in the AE population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711429197">Mellard and Patterson (2008)</xref> found that AE participants who self-reported having an LD and those who did not differed significantly on measures of reading comprehension and IQ. These differences introduce complexity to understanding component roles in comprehension for this population and merit further study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0731948711429197">
<title>Present Study</title>
<p>Existing models of reading comprehension validated with child and adolescent data may not adequately explain variance in reading comprehension of AE participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711429197">Nanda et al., 2010</xref>). Which components are relevant to describing this population is unsettled, and a small body of literature on individual component contributions and a path model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429197">Mellard et al., 2010</xref>) suggest several possible significant components. Because of these two issues, we applied principal components analysis (PCA) to identify reading constructs for describing this population. From these constructs we developed a model of reading comprehension to describe the range of English-speaking AE participants in total and by three functional reading level groups. These findings have implications for developing curriculum and instruction to address the unique needs of AE participants and may be applicable to other adult struggling readers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0731948711429197" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used primary data collected in a broader study of adults enrolled in AEFLA literacy programs. Single-variable and sequential multiple regression analyses tested relations between literature-derived components of reading comprehension with the sample in general and by reading level subgroups. Principal components analysis produced composite variables for a reading component model. This model was further refined using sequential multiple regression analysis with a stratified sample that equally represents all reading levels in adult basic and secondary education (ABE and ASE) programs. To test this model’s predictive value with readers at different functional reading levels, we conducted sequential multiple regression analyses with three functional reading level subgroups.</p>
<sec id="section7-0731948711429197">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Research staff collected data from 13 Midwestern AEFLA programs, excluding participants receiving English as a Second Language (ESL) services. Study volunteers had to meet criteria of the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) for AE participation, that is, be at least 16 years old; have withdrawn from secondary education without earning a credential or attaining basic (e.g., eighth-grade equivalent) reading, writing, or math skills; and have U.S. citizenship or authorization to work in the United States as a foreign national in order to receive a nominal participation payment.</p>
<p>AEFLA programs classify English-speaking participants into six levels of instruction, which span from non-literate to high school level literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711429197">USDE, 2010</xref>). In this National Reporting System (NRS), adults with little or no reading ability—no more than a grade level equivalent (GLE) of 2—are classified as Beginning Adult Basic Education Literacy, Level 1. Individuals who can read and comprehend a paragraph of simple and compound sentences containing familiar vocabulary, similar to a 3rd or 4th GLE, are classified as Beginning Basic Education, Level 2. Level 3, the Low Intermediate Basic Education classification, is like a 5th or 6th GLE and includes adults who can read texts on familiar subjects that have clear underlying structure and can use context to interpret meaning. High Intermediate Basic Education, Level 4, includes individuals who can read simple descriptions and narratives on familiar subjects or from which new vocabulary can be determined by context and can make some minimal inferences and can compare and contrast information from the texts at a 7th or 8th GLE. Low Adult Secondary Education learners, or Level 5, can comprehend a variety of expository materials on common topics, can identify the main idea in reading selections, and can use a variety of context issues to determine meaning—equivalent to 9th or 10th GLE. Level 6, High Adult Secondary Education learners, can comprehend, explain, and analyze information from literary works, including primary source materials and professional journals, and can use context cues and higher order processes to interpret the meaning of written materials as would an 11th- or 12th-grade student.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0731948711429197">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>We drew a stratified sample from 713 volunteers to represent participants in the six NRS educational functional reading levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711429197">USDE, 2010</xref>) at the time of entry into the current AE program. National Reporting System level was determined by <italic>Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711429197">CASAS, 2001</xref>) reading diagnostic scores. For each study site, we randomly selected a stratified sample from Level 4, 5, and 6 volunteers, for a total of approximately 60 learners per level. Due to few Level 1, 2, and 3 volunteers, we used a convenience sample that included all eligible individuals up to a total of 60 per level. Among the selected 568 learners, 237 were no longer available or declined to participate when contacted, and we eliminated 14 participants’ data about which we had validity concerns (e.g., statistical outliers and people with such cognitive disability as traumatic brain injury) and 5 because of incomplete assessments, for a sample size of 312.</p>
<p>We formed three functional reading level data sets: Beginning (Levels 1–2, <italic>n</italic> = 73), Intermediate (Levels 3–4, <italic>n</italic> = 119), and Secondary (Levels 5–6, <italic>n</italic> = 120). For modeling purposes, we created a more balanced, stratified sample by randomly selecting 35 participants each from Levels 2 through 6 and retaining all 29 Level 1 participants (<italic>n</italic> = 204).</p>
<sec id="section9-0731948711429197">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>The sample is demographically similar to national and state AE programs, which include ESL participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711429197">Glass, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429197">USDE, 2005</xref>). Gender representation was 56% female compared to 55% both nationally and in the state. Our Secondary learners were disproportionately female (68%), whereas Beginning and Intermediate learners were more gender balanced (49% and 44% female, respectively).</p>
<p>The sample’s mean age was 32 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 15) with a median age of 25 years. The proportion of adult learners younger than 25 was representative of AE programs in the state (48% and 50%, respectively) but differed from the national profile (38%). Our Beginning learners tended to be older (<italic>M</italic> = 39, <italic>SD</italic> = 15) and Secondary learners tended to be younger (<italic>M</italic> = 26, <italic>SD</italic> = 11), with Intermediate learners’ average age falling in between (<italic>M</italic> = 32, <italic>SD</italic> = 15).</p>
<p>The total sample was 49% White (including Hispanic ethnicity), 35% African American, and 8% each multi-race and other racial groups. Beginning learners were 62% African American, 25% White, 10% multi-race, and 3% other racial groups. Intermediate learners were 49% White, 35% African American, 10% other racial groups, and 6% multi-race. Secondary learners were 64% White, 18% African American, 9% multi-race, and 8% other racial groups.</p>
<p>Most study participants were native English speakers, but 7% spoke Spanish in their childhood, and 11% spoke languages other than English or Spanish. Non-native English speakers were least represented among Beginning learners (4% Spanish; 7% other languages) and most among Intermediate (13% Spanish; 8% other) and Secondary (11% Spanish; 9% other) learners.</p>
<p>Nearly three quarters of the sample had no secondary education credential; 61% completed at least one high school grade without graduating, and 15% completed only up to eighth grade. Beginning learners were most likely to have completed a secondary credential (44%), with 42% having some high school education and only 14% completing up to just eighth grade. Only 15% of Intermediate learners completed a secondary credential, 71% had some high school education, and 14% completed no more than the eighth grade. Secondary learners were 14% high school graduates or greater, 69% some high school, and 17% attained eighth grade or less.</p>
<p>More than half of the sample reported reading difficulties as a child, 30% reported having an LD diagnosis, and 39% reported that they had received remedial help or participated in special reading classes. Seventy-seven percent of Beginning learners reported having difficulty reading as a child, with 49% having LD diagnoses, and 62% receiving remedial reading instruction. Intermediate learners reported that 64% had childhood reading struggles, 28% LD, and 47% remedial classes. Last, Secondary learners reported difficulty with reading as a child only 38% of the time, 15% had LD, and 19% had remedial reading support.</p>

<title>Literature-Derived Composite Variables</title>
<p>The following groups of measures make up the literature-derived composite variables used in regression analyses. For reading comprehension, we used the Passage Comprehension subtest of the <italic>Woodcock Reading Mastery Test–Revised</italic> (WRMT-R PC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731948711429197">Woodcock, 1998</xref>), which measures ability to read and comprehend two- to three-sentence passages using a cloze procedure for 68 items. The instrument reports internal reliability of .87 to .98 and concurrent validity of .79 to .92. We also used the <italic>Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System</italic> reading assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711429197">CASAS, 2001</xref>), which assesses adult functional literacy (i.e., competencies related to workplace and survival needs) with validity and strong psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711429197">Flowerday, 2005</xref>). CASAS is broadly used in AE, human services, and labor agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429197">National Institute for Literacy, 2004</xref>). Internal consistency values range from .88 to .92.</p>
<p>For language comprehension, we used the Listening to Paragraphs subtest of the <italic>Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals</italic> (CELF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711429197">Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 1987</xref>), which requires listening to a paragraph and orally answering questions that test ability to recall information about the text, understand and remember story details and the sequencing of events, and make predictions and inferences. The authors reported a test–retest reliability of .52 to .91 and concurrent validity of .75 for total language scores and the WISC-III IQ assessment. We also used the Story Recall subtest of the <italic>Woodcock-Johnson III</italic> (WJ-SR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711429197">McGrew &amp; Woodcock, 2001</xref>), which assesses listening ability and language development by requiring participants to state as many story details as they remember from a series of orally presented stories that increase in difficulty. Test–retest reliability of the instrument is .85. The concurrent validity with the <italic>Stanford-Binet IV</italic> short-term memory and the WJ short-term memory cluster is .714.</p>
<p>For vocabulary, we used the <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–III</italic> (PPVT-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711429197">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>), which measures receptive vocabulary by having participants point to one of four pictures representing a stimulus word pronounced by an examiner. The median alternate-form reliability coefficient is .94. Concurrent validity is indicated by .40 to .76 correlations with 10 other vocabulary tests. We also used the Expressive Vocabulary subtest of the <italic>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III</italic> (WAIS Vocabulary; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731948711429197">Wechsler, 1997</xref>), which requires participants to provide oral definitions for 33 progressively difficult words. The reliability coefficients for the 16- to 24-years age group are .90 to .94.</p>
<p>For word recognition, we used several measures. The WRMT-R Word Identification subtest (WID) presents 106 isolated words in order of difficulty for participants to orally read each within 5 seconds. Reported internal reliability is .87 to .98, and concurrent validity is .79 to .92. The Sight Word Efficiency subtest of the <italic>Test of Word Reading Efficiency</italic> (TOWRE SWE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948711429197">Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1999</xref>) measures ability to recognize familiar sight words with a 45-second administration time. Average reliability quotients reach or exceed .90 and have concurrent validity values of .86 to .89 with comparable measures in younger populations. The <italic>Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency</italic> (TOSWRF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711429197">Mather, Hammill, Allen, &amp; Roberts, 2004</xref>) measures silent reading efficiency by using 32 rows of words arranged in order of difficulty strung together without spaces. Participants have 3 minutes to draw lines in the place where one word ends and the next word begins. Test–retest reliability for the instrument is .91 to .92. Validity is supported by the coefficients representing the relation between TOSWRF and the TOWRE, which range between .73 and .78.</p>
<p>Phonological awareness and decoding were assessed via several subtests of the <italic>Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing</italic> (CTOPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948711429197">Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 1999</xref>), which are normed for ages 5 through 24 years and include an untimed Elision (E) subtest that measures the extent to which a participant can say 20 increasingly difficult words after dropping designated sounds. The test–retest reliability is .88, and the concurrent validity with <italic>Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Tests</italic> is .75. The CTOPP Blending of Non-Words (BN) subtest measures a participant’s ability to put together speech sounds to name 18 different non-words. Test–retest reliability is .88, and the concurrent validity with <italic>Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Tests</italic> is .58. We also used the TOWRE Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE), which measures the number of printed, pronounceable non-words accurately decoded within 45 seconds. Average reliability quotients reach or exceed .90, and concurrent validity values are .86 and .89 with comparable measures in younger populations. In addition, the WRMT-R Word Attack (WA) subtest was used. It requires participants to read in order of difficulty 45 nonsense words or words with a low occurrence rate in English. Internal reliability is .87 to .98 and concurrent validity is .79 to .92.</p>
<p>For decoding we used a variable composed of the above-described phonological awareness and decoding and the word recognition composite variables were also included among literature-derived variables for regression analyses.</p>
<p>For speed we used the CTOPP Rapid Color Naming (RCN), which measures speed in naming the color of 36 blocks, and the CTOPP Rapid Letter Naming (RLN), which measures how fast a participant can name 36 visually presented alphabetic characters. For these measures, higher scores represent poorer performance. Test–retest reliability is .70 to .92, and construct identification validity is demonstrated by a comparative fit index of 0.99 and chi-square of 27.6 with six degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>To assess fluency, two 1-minute oral readings from sixth-grade-level passages from the <italic>Qualitative Reading Inventory–3</italic> (QRI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948711429197">Leslie &amp; Caldwell, 2000</xref>) provided words correct and word errors as distinct measures of fluency. Word errors (WE) consist of word additions, omissions, repetitions, self-corrections, and mispronunciations. Words correct (WC) equals total words read less word errors and is the fluency variable suggested by the literature (we used this measure only for our literature-derived composite variable). Study data indicate an alternate-form reliability of .94 and a .78 correlation with the <italic>Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711429197">Mather et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0731948711429197">
<title>Other Measures</title>
<p>Three additional measures were not included in our literature-derived composite variables but were available for the PCA. The WAIS Block Design subtest measures general intelligence by requiring replication of two-color designs starting with two-block designs and progressing in difficulty to nine-block designs. The average reliability coefficient for the measure is .86 and the construct validity correlation with the WISC-III is .80. The WAIS Information subtest assesses general knowledge through a series of oral questions and answers. The average reliability coefficient for the measure is .91 and the construct validity correlation with the WISC-III is .80. The WJ Auditory Working Memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711429197">McGrew &amp; Woodcock, 2001</xref>) assesses cognitive ability in terms of short-term memory span through listening to words and numbers, separating the words from the numbers, and stating the words in sequential order followed by the numbers in sequential order. The instrument has .84 median reliability for adults.</p>

<sec id="section14-0731948711429197">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>Graduate research assistants trained to criterion on all instruments individually administered the assessment battery to each participant at the AE sites. We checked variables to ensure that they met assumptions of normal distribution, central tendency, and multicollinearity and plotted all variables with another relevant variable in scatter plots for visual inspection following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429197">Tabachnick and Fidell’s (2007)</xref> recommended data cleaning procedures. We inverted CTOPP RCN and RLN speed variables in the PCA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0731948711429197">
<title>Principal Components Analysis</title>
<p>We conducted a PCA to determine the pattern of loadings for each variable on component constructs and the relationship of each of the raw scores from variables to other variables in the analysis. We used an oblique rotation and eliminated variables without substantial contributions (i.e., λ loadings less than 0.5) to any component. Components with eigenvalues over 1.0 were considered valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429197">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). We excluded the reading comprehension variables to prevent overlap of predictor and outcome variables.</p>
<sec id="section16-0731948711429197">
<title>Regression Analyses</title>
<p>To construct PCA-defined composite variables, we first calculated the stratified sample’s <italic>z</italic>-scores for individual variables and then averaged the relevant <italic>z</italic>-scores for each composite construct. We used these variables in regression analyses, where the dependent variable was reading comprehension defined as the composite of WRMT-R PC and CASAS Reading scores, and independent variables were literature-derived composite variables representing decoding, phonological awareness and decoding, word recognition, language comprehension, speed, vocabulary, and fluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429197">Figure 1</xref>). For the adult literacy model, we entered variables from greatest to least variance explained by the PCA.</p>

</fig>
<p>For both single-variable and sequential multiple regression analyses, we used the four previously described data sets. The stratified sample is most heterogeneous and represents the full range of skills and abilities in our study population. The reading level groups, although representing truncated distributions with limited score ranges and thus less predictive utility, are nevertheless informative for understanding the different degrees of reading component skills at functional reading levels.</p>

<title>Reading Comprehension</title>
<p>The stratified sample averaged 4th-grade reading level on the WRMT-R PC and 8th-grade functional reading level on the CASAS. Literature-derived variables most highly correlated with the reading comprehension composite for the stratified sample were word recognition (<italic>r</italic> = .85), decoding (<italic>r</italic> = .85), and fluency correct (<italic>r</italic> = .82). Reading level subgroups’ WRMT-R PC mean raw scores varied from 22 to 37 to 48, for the Beginning, Intermediate, and Secondary subgroups, respectively, equating to standard scores of 41, 69, and 89—or grade equivalents of 2nd, 4th, and 8th—and were in the lowest quartile for their age-normed reference group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948711429197">Figure 2</xref>). Subgroup scores on the CASAS were 12, 17, and 25, which approximate functional reading levels of 3rd-, 7th-, and 11th-grade students.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section20-0731948711429197">
<title>Language Comprehension</title>
<p>The stratified sample averaged only slightly lower than the appropriate age normative samples, with minimal differences in raw scores by subgroup. The language comprehension variable was moderately correlated to reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .67) and most highly correlated to vocabulary (<italic>r</italic> = .94).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0731948711429197">
<title>Vocabulary</title>
<p>The samples’ receptive and expressive vocabulary scores averaged a full standard deviation below norm. WAIS Vocabulary scores by group were at the 16th, 9th, and 2nd percentiles for adults ages 30 to 34. The vocabulary composite was most correlated to language comprehension and was also moderately correlated to reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .67).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0731948711429197">
<title>Word Recognition</title>
<p>Word recognition power and speed scores for the stratified sample were consistent with the 4th-grade reading level. WRMT-R WID and the TOWRE SWE averaged 1.8 and 2.5 standard deviations below appropriate age norms, respectively. It is not surprising that the word recognition variable was highly correlated with decoding (<italic>r</italic> = .96), fluency correct (<italic>r</italic> = .93), reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .85), and phonemic awareness and decoding (<italic>r</italic> = .82). By reading level subgroup, WRMT-R WID mean standard scores were 31, 65, and 82 for the Beginning, Intermediate, and Secondary subgroups, respectively, and TOWRE SWE mean standard scores were 57, 72, and 82. When viewed in comparison to other adults, every group’s scores were in the bottom quartile (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429197">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0731948711429197">
<title>Phonological Awareness and Decoding</title>
<p>The phonological composite variable strongly correlated with reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .77), word recognition (<italic>r</italic> = .82), and fluency (<italic>r</italic> = .81). The decoding variable strongly correlated with its constituent parts, reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .85), and fluency correct (<italic>r</italic> = .92). CTOPP E and BN and TOWRE PDE each averaged roughly third-grade level and were from 1.5 to 4 standard deviations below appropriate age norms. The Beginning, Intermediate, and Secondary subgroups had TOWRE PDE standard scores of 55, 70, and 80, respectively, which were in the 1st, 2nd, and 9th percentile for adults (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429197">Figure 1</xref>). The WRMT-R WA averaged about the 4th-grade level but was nearer to normative sample levels. The subgroups’ WRMT-R WA scores were 2nd-, 3rd-, and 6th-grade level—or mean standard scores of 59, 78, and 91, which are less than the 1st, 7th, and 28th percentiles among adults of similar age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0731948711429197">
<title>Speed</title>
<p>Speed was inversely related to reading comprehension with a negative correlation coefficient of –.54. The negative correlation was expected; higher scores (more time elapsed) represent slower readers. The stratified sample’s average CTOPP RCN and RLN demonstrated slower processing speed than the normative sample and corresponded to a sixth-grade level. For the Beginning, Intermediate, and Secondary subgroups, RCN was 2nd, 16th, and 37th percentile, respectively; RLN was 1st, 9th, and 25th (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429197">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0731948711429197">
<title>Fluency Correct</title>
<p>Words correct highly correlated with reading comprehension (<italic>r</italic> = .82) as well as with word recognition (<italic>r</italic> = .93) and phonological awareness and decoding (<italic>r</italic> = .81). The stratified sample averaged 100 words correct per minute (<italic>SD</italic> = 51) and 10 errors per minute (<italic>SD</italic> = 6), indicating 91% accuracy at a third-grade level oral reading rate. For the Beginning, Intermediate, and Secondary subgroups, the oral reading rates were roughly equivalent to 1st, 2nd/3rd, and 4th/5th grade rates, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section26-0731948711429197">
<title>Principal Components Analysis Results</title>
<p>The PCA yielded a total explained variance of 75%, identifying four components whose eigenvalues were greater than 1.0 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948711429197">Figure 2</xref>). The first component, Word Skills, accounted for 50.4% of the variance and was composed of RCN (λ = 0.68), RLN (λ = 0.87), SWE (λ = 0.97), PDE (λ = 0.80), Word ID (λ = 0.85), WA (λ = 0.79), WC Passage 1 (λ = 0.88), WC Passage 2 (λ = 0.93), E (λ = 0.50), and TOSWRF (λ = 0.67). The second component, Language Comprehension-PCA, accounted for 11.1% of the variance and consisted of WAIS Voc (λ = 0.77), WAIS Information (λ = 0.83), and PPVT (λ = 0.75). The third component, Memory, accounted for 8.3% of the variance and consisted of the CELF Listening to Paragraphs subtest (λ = 0.82), WJ Story Recall (λ = 0.73), and WJ Auditory Working Memory (λ = 0.52). Finally, the fourth component, Fluency Errors, accounted for 5.3% of the variance based on both passages of WE (λ = −0.91 and .87) and BN (λ = 0.40).</p>
<p>A reasonably high level of fit between PCA-derived variables and the predicted reading comprehension model was expected because they were based on the same data sets. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711429197">Table 2</xref> shows that Word Skills had the greatest correlation with reading comprehension for the stratified sample (<italic>r</italic> = .82). Memory (<italic>r</italic> = .67) and Language Comprehension-PCA (<italic>r</italic> = .65) variables also correlated well with reading comprehension.

<p>Recognizing that subgroup data sets are inherently less predictive because they are truncated samples, nonetheless regression analyses identified important similarities and differences among the components’ predictive value. For Beginning and Intermediate learners, our analyses identified word recognition, fluency correct, and decoding as most predictive of variance in reading comprehension but found vocabulary to be a nonsignificant variable for the Beginning group. For Secondary learners, however, vocabulary was the most predictive component, followed by language comprehension, decoding, and word recognition.</p>
<p>The decoding composite variable explained a similar amount of variance at all reading levels. However, distinct patterns become apparent when examining the predictive value of the individual components. For example, word recognition explained about half the variance for the Beginning group but less variance for the Secondary level group. Likewise, phonological awareness and decoding explained more variance among the higher group than both lower level groups. Fluency, however, explained more variance in the Beginning group than in the other two groups.</p>
<p>Contributions to variance in reading comprehension increased as scores improved for language comprehension, vocabulary, and speed. Language comprehension-lit. explained very little variance for Beginning readers, somewhat more for Intermediate readers, and almost half of reading comprehension variance among Secondary readers. Vocabulary was not a significant predictor of reading comprehension for the Beginning group but was significant and explained about a quarter of the variance among the Intermediate group and half of the variance among the Secondary group. Speed, although significant for all groups, explained far less variance at each level than other components. An important consideration is that these analyses point to the likelihood that multivariable models of reading will differ by functional reading level.</p>

<title>Adult Literacy Model</title>
<p>Based on PCA results, we conducted multivariate regression analyses for the four data sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948711429197">Table 4</xref>) reflecting our four participant samples. Each of these composite variables was intended to reflect the PCA-identified components and used every variable included in the previous analysis. Although the Fluency Errors variable was identified as a distinct component in the PCA, this composite variable did not significantly predict reading comprehension at any level, and therefore we excluded it from our new model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Individual reading skills that are crucial to reading instruction with children had moderate to strong correlation with reading comprehension for our stratified sample of AE participants (<italic>r</italic> = .54–.85). The word recognition variable we created to represent learners’ accuracy and efficiency with word lists explained nearly three fourths of the variance in reading comprehension. Similarly, our fluency variable, which measured in-context word reading efficiency, and our decoding variable each explained a substantial amount of comprehension variance. These findings lend support to the practice of emphasizing word-reading skills in adult reading instruction, however, that view may be incomplete. Principal components analysis identified four component constructs that collectively explained about three fourths of the variance in reading comprehension. However, unlike models validated with children, we found that word skills explained only 50% of the variance whereas language comprehension explained 11%, memory 8%, and fluency word errors 5%.</p>
<p>On the surface, our analyses may indicate that a measure of word reading skills may be just as useful for predicting reading comprehension among AE participants as a more complex model. In fact, in our previous work with this population, we recommended just such an approach for placing learners in literacy instruction groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711429197">Mellard et al., 2009</xref>). However, in the present study we found that the PCA-defined components related differently to reading comprehension for subgroups defined by functional reading levels. Word Skills (β = .64), Language Comprehension (β = .26), and Memory (β = .14) each significantly contributed to the stratified sample model. A fourth variable, Fluency Errors, did not significantly contribute to the regression analysis. For the three reading level subgroups, we found a progression pattern of contribution from these three reading components. One model showed that the Beginning level relied on Word Skills (β = .64) and Memory (β = .27), with no significant Language Comprehension component. A second model demonstrated Intermediate level reliance on Word Skills (β = .51), Language Comprehension (β = .29), and Memory (β = .28). Finally, the Secondary level also drew on all three reading component skills—Word Skills (β = .36), Language Comprehension (β = .30), and Memory (β = .29)—but did so with more balance (reflected by the similar regression weights or β) compared to intermediate and stratified sample models.</p>
<p>Our models depict different kinds of reading efforts taking place with each ability level. In the broader context of the nation’s AE programs, beginning adult learners represent 23% of ABE and ASE participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711429197">USDE, 2007</xref>). These adults seem to struggle with word reading and draw on their memory with seemingly no reliance on their familiarity with language systems. In this view, our sample’s least accomplished learners were working at recalling individual words and their meanings. They had difficulty integrating word meanings in or across sentences.</p>
<p>The most advanced group in our study represents about 29% of the total ABE and ASE population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711429197">USDE, 2007</xref>). The model of their reading presents a picture of more balanced, mature reading in which word skills, language comprehension, and memory work in concert to access and integrate knowledge that leads to better understanding of the texts they read. The questions that remain to be answered are, what limits and what enables their reading comprehension? We know that their performance level on many measures of reading component skills is far below normative groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429197">Figure 1</xref>), yet these learners are substantially better off than the other two groups. The strategies employed by this group seem effective in the degree to which they help the learners accomplish the administered tasks in our assessments, but in a broader, day-to-day application these learners may require such intense focus to comprehend that they are functionally limited. Our data do not help us understand whether their comprehension strategies are efficient.</p>
<p>Intermediate adult learners make the remaining 48% of ABE and ASE learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711429197">USDE, 2007</xref>). This group seems to demonstrate nascent integration of their word reading and memory with their knowledge of language systems. Like the more advanced group, some of these learners may have limited lexical and background knowledge from their lack of reading experiences, thus even less raw material to access and integrate into comprehension.</p>
<p>One reason for differences between reading levels may be differing task demands at different levels of reading comprehension measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711429197">Hock and Mellard (2005)</xref> found that reading strategies needed to answer the lowest level CASAS items were looking for clues and generating questions. However, at the highest CASAS level, examinees benefit from such additional strategies as summarizing and drawing inferences, which tend to require higher cognitive skills than looking for clues and generating questions.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429197">Rapp et al. (2007)</xref> indicated, by understanding the processes and breakdowns in low literacy learners, better interventions may be developed to help this population become proficient readers. Our models indicate that the AE learner needs to develop more than word reading skills to progress beyond a 4th-grade reading level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711429197">Schatschneider et al. (2004)</xref> found, 3rd- and 7th-grade readers with poor reading performance lacked word reading skills; however, 10th graders with poor reading performance were more influenced by their limited verbal knowledge and reasoning skills. Likewise, in our own research, a descriptive path model of reading comprehension for AE learners demonstrated reliance on word reading in lieu of developing more mature reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429197">Mellard et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, our stratified sample’s listening comprehension averaged only slightly below normal, but vocabulary averaged a full standard deviation below normal. Thus, we surmise that AE participants who are able to develop word recognition skills will still need to overcome language experience limitations (e.g., improve their semantic and meaning systems) and perhaps cognitive access to information or memory limitations if they are to become good readers. Furthermore, we suggest that they need interventions that will help develop cognitive or memory strategies that connect and integrate prior knowledge with information acquired from the texts in order to improve reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Intermediate learners, the largest contingent of ABE and ASE participants, may be the best target for increased intervention and research. Improved instructional and curricular decisions addressing their needs could have the largest payoff in that it would affect the most people and it would be most efficient in terms of the level of effort required to achieve learning gains. On the other hand, this group is clearly not the least accomplished and has reached the minimal functional literacy threshold. Research and intervention foci become value questions: Should we invest in helping the lowest achievers become minimally functional or helping the minimally functional readers to become mature readers?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we identified four components of reading explaining three fourths of the variance in reading comprehension among adult education participants: Word Skills, Language Comprehension, Memory, and Fluency Error (which is a nonsignificant contributor to the model). Differences in the extent to which the significant components explained variance in reading comprehension at three functional reading levels provide insights into the reading processes in which AE participants currently engage. Lowest ability readers rely mostly on word reading skills for reading comprehension and draw, to some degree, on memory. Mid-level readers also rely heavily on word reading skills but use both memory and language for comprehension. The better readers among this population engage in more balanced activity, with word reading, language comprehension, and memory each contributing about the same amount to their reading comprehension. We recommend that intervention developers and providers be sensitive not only to the differences between more accomplished and less accomplished adult readers but also to the differences in reading behaviors at different functional reading levels among adult education participants. We can improve our reading instruction and learner outcomes by more strategically addressing differing learner needs.</p>
