<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Compressive and quadriceps forces have been associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative importance of each load component during noncontact ACL injury.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> We hypothesized that the introduction of a quadriceps force lowers the axial compressive force threshold to produce ACL injury.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Six pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric knees, flexed to 15°, were loaded with axial compression (group A) or compression with a quadriceps force (group B) until failure. All specimens underwent axial compressive loading under displacement control with a time to peak load of 50 msec. The initial displacement of the MTS actuator was 8 mm and was increased in 2-mm increments with successive tests until catastrophic damage of the joint occurred. Failure was determined by a combination of clinical specimen examination and force-displacement data analysis and by dissection and direct visualization after failure was recognized. Differences in failure load between groups were examined using a paired <italic>t</italic> test (significance, <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In group A, there were 2 isolated ACL injuries, 2 ACL ruptures combined with a tibial plateau fracture, and 2 isolated tibial plateau fractures. In group B, there were 5 isolated ACL ruptures and 1 tibial plateau fracture. There was a significant difference in the average failure load between groups A and B: 10 832 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 9743-11 604 N) and 6119 N (95% CI, 4335-7903 N), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Isolated compressive forces displayed an ability to produce an ACL injury in this cadaveric model, but the addition of a quadriceps load significantly reduced the compressive force required for ACL injury.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> Compressive and quadriceps forces contribute to noncontact ACL injury and should be taken into account when developing ACL injury prevention programs and rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction.</p>

<body>
<p>Of all anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, 70% have been reported to be noncontact injuries (NC-ACLIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511430204">2</xref></sup> The exact mechanism of NC-ACLI is not known. Axial compressive forces are capable of creating ACL injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430204">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430204">12</xref></sup> A recent video analysis of NC-ACLI identified a vulnerable landing position, which is hypothesized to result in rapid excessive axial loading of the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> This vulnerable position consists of a flat-footed landing with an extended knee and the hip in flexion. The flat-footed landing position reduces the ability of the calf muscle to contract and absorb energy, thus resulting in a greater impulse to the knee than would be the case with a flexed knee. Tibial plateau angle, in relation to the femoral condyles, may also play a role in ACL injury, especially when the lower extremity is in a vulnerable landing position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430204">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430204">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another explanation of NC-ACLI is that it is the result of a forceful, eccentric quadriceps contraction. During an unplanned or disrupted maneuver, the anterior vector of a forceful quadriceps contraction on a relatively extended knee has been postulated to result in an anterior force on the tibia, straining and potentially tearing the ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref></sup> However, the 1 study to date that showed rupture of the ACL with isolated quadriceps forces produced failure in only 6 of 11 cadaveric specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To our knowledge, no studies have attempted to elucidate the role of a forceful quadriceps contraction in the axially loaded knee or to determine the relative contribution of each toward the injury mechanism. The goal of the current study was to compare the axial compressive load required to damage the ACL with and without the presence of a simulated forceful quadriceps contraction. We hypothesized that the introduction of a quadriceps force lowers the axial compressive force threshold required to produce ACL injury.</p>

<title>Specimen Preparation</title>
<p>Six pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric knees (donor age range, 47-59 years) were acquired from the Maryland State Anatomy Board and underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning of the proximal femur to rule out osteoporosis. After thawing at room temperature, each knee was examined clinically by an orthopaedic surgeon for ligamentous integrity by means of an anterior drawer test; all were deemed stable. The specimens were then sectioned through the tibia and fibula 15 cm distal to the joint line and through the femur 20 cm proximal to the joint line. All skin and muscle tissue was removed from the specimens with careful dissection, leaving intact all the static constraints of the knee and the extensor mechanism. The distal 8 cm of each sectioned tibia and the proximal 8 cm of each sectioned femur were cleaned thoroughly. The tibia and fibula were then potted in 3-inch- and 2-inch-diameter polyvinyl chloride pots, respectively, with dental acrylic.</p>
<p>Each polyvinyl chloride pot was inserted into a corresponding aluminum pot on the custom-designed and -built testing rig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511430204">Figure 1</xref>). The femoral pot was attached directly to an MTS actuator (Model 858, MTS Corp, Eden Prairie, Minnesota) and fixed at an angle of 15° with respect to the actuator. The tibial pot was fixed parallel to the actuator in a cradle that allowed it to rotate freely about its long axis and was mounted on an X-Y table on the MTS table. The knees were therefore positioned in approximately 15° of flexion. We chose this knee flexion angle to re-create the “vulnerable knee position” documented in a previous video analysis study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Each knee specimen was potted in polyvinyl chloride pipes and placed in 15° of flexion in a custom-designed fixture on a materials testing machine. A 1500-N simulated quadriceps load was generated by pretensioning a cable attached to the patella, passed over a pulley and connected to a load cell on the crosshead (not shown). The tibia/fibula were potted in polymethylmethacrylate but allowed to rotate about the tibia’s long axis and to translate in the horizontal plane. For specimens tested in compression only, the quadriceps cable was not installed through the patella.</p>

<title>Specimen Testing</title>
<p>One of each pair of knees, alternating left and right, was randomly assigned to undergo an isolated axial compressive force (group A), and the contralateral knee was assigned a combined/concurrent simulated isometric quadriceps contraction and axial compressive loading (group B).</p>
<p>In group B, the simulated quadriceps contraction was achieved by looping a length of one-eighth-inch steel cable through the patella via 2 longitudinal drill holes. The cable was linked to a beam on the MTS machine, independent from the actuator, and a load cell was connected that measured the tensile force within the extensor mechanism. A preload of approximately 1500 N of tensile force was then applied statically to the patella immediately before axial loading by means of a turnbuckle linking the extensor mechanism cable to the load cell. We chose 1500 N as the quadriceps force because it approached the reported voluntary contraction force (3000 N) of the quadriceps in 15° of extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430204">18</xref></sup> during testing, as determined during pilot work, but did not approach the overload capacity of the cell. Tensioning of the extensor mechanism was performed immediately before the axial load application to reduce the effect of viscoelastic creep on the extensor mechanism. The ultimate “quadriceps force” delivered to the knee was consistently greater than 1500 N because of the independent relationship of the quadriceps force anchor point to the MTS actuator. As the MTS actuator was advanced, the tension in the extensor mechanism increased, simulating a rapid and forceful quadriceps contraction.</p>
<p>All specimens underwent axial compressive loading by displacing the MTS linear actuator under displacement control over a period of 50 msec to simulate the time to peak of the ground-reaction force during a typical jump landing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430204">16</xref></sup> The initial displacement of the MTS actuator was 8 mm. If the force-displacement curve suggested damage, that is, an increased displacement with a sudden decrease in load, then the specimen was removed and subjected to an anterior drawer test and inspected for fractures under fluoroscopy. If no failure occurred, the displacement was increased by 2-mm increments with each subsequent test until catastrophic damage of the joint occurred. Once the specimen failed, specific injuries were confirmed by dissection and direct visualization and were photographed.</p>

We concur with Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430204">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511430204">13</xref></sup> that excessive joint compressive forces can result in complete ACL rupture in human cadaveric knees. Our compressive forces (9743-11 604 N) were higher than those found in the study by Meyer et al (2900-7800 N),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430204">12</xref></sup> which may be the result of the 5-kg weight that they attached to the femur via a pulley to apply a slight posterior preload. This posterior load transmitted shear force across the knee joint and may have functioned in a manner similar to the shear component of the quadriceps load in our study by lowering the compressive axial force needed to injure the ACL. Compressive force differences between the studies may also be attributed to specimen quality. Our specimens all had normal bone mineral density, whereas the bone mineral density of the specimens in the study by Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430204">12</xref></sup> was not measured. Our compressive forces were also higher than those found in porcine knees flexed to 70° (1812-2659 N).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430204">19</xref></sup> It is difficult to reconcile cross-species differences. Maximum peak vertical ground-reaction forces experienced by 1-legged landings after jumping maneuvers have been estimated to range from 2 to 18 times the body weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430204">11</xref></sup> The compressive loads reported for group A would have to be at the high end of this physiological spectrum to produce injury. It is difficult to determine how much lower the compressive forces to produce ACL injury would have been if hip flexion and a higher posterior tibial slope were taken into account.</p>
<p>Several authors have shown that an axial weightbearing compressive force combined with the posterior slope of the tibial plateau can produce an anterior tibial force in knees with intact or deficient ACLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430204">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430204">17</xref></sup> In a videotape analysis of ACL-injured and control athletes, Boden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> showed that injured athletes first contacted the ground with the hindfoot or entirely flat-footed compared with initial contact of the forefoot in controls. There was minimal change in the average ankle position of the injured athletes (4.1°; range, 10.70° to −6.6°) compared with that of controls (43.8°; range, 22.9° to −20.9°) over the first 5 frames (30-Hz frames/s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> These findings indicate that the calf muscles are not functioning properly to absorb the ground-reaction forces. Additionally, the injured athletes attained the flat-foot position substantially sooner than the controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> The shorter time span reduces the ability of the calf muscles to contract and absorb forces, resulting in increased impulsive forces at the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430204">3</xref></sup> On the basis of these findings, the authors of this study, as well as others, have concluded that axial compressive forces are a critical component of NC-ACLI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511430204">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430204">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results confirmed the hypothesis that the introduction of a quadriceps force lowers the axial force threshold necessary to generate NC-ACLI. That 5 of 6 specimens in group B failed with an isolated ACL injury suggests that the contribution of the quadriceps force results in a more clinically relevant injury pattern than the axial compressive load alone (group A). The quadriceps has been reported to be an antagonist of the ACL and may contribute to NC-ACLI during a forceful eccentric contraction at the point of initial ground contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430204">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511430204">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511430204">15</xref></sup> Previous reports have postulated that the anterior vector of the quadriceps (as applied to the tibia through the patellar tendon) is the primary contributing force to ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430204">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430204">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511430204">10</xref></sup> Because the angle of NC-ACLI has been reported to occur between 10° and 30° of knee flexion, the compressive component of the quadriceps reaction force is larger than the anterior shear component applied through the patellar tendon. In one biomechanical study, the quadriceps compressive force was estimated to be 2 to 3 times greater than the anterior shear force at knee flexion angles of 15°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430204">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the knee is flexed, the anterior shear forces decrease while the compressive forces stay relatively constant and equivalent to the total patellar tendon force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430204">14</xref></sup> Because the anterior shear force is a small component of the quadriceps contraction, it is likely insufficient to cause ACL injury. Rupture of the ACL with isolated quadriceps force has been produced in a previous cadaveric study, but the quadriceps force used was high (4500 N). van Eijden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430204">18</xref></sup> reported that the maximum voluntary quadriceps contraction at 15° of knee flexion is close to 3000 N. It is difficult to envision a scenario in which the quadriceps would be contracted to such a magnitude in isolation of other muscles to generate the shear component of 2160 N reportedly needed to damage the ACL.</p>
<p>The quadriceps may contribute to NC-ACLI by more than just the compressive and anterior forces on the tibia. It is possible that instead of contracting eccentrically, the quadriceps contraction has a temporary concentric/isometric component that limits and/or prevents knee flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> In the dangerous landing position, hip flexion causes the center of mass to be posterior to the foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430204">4</xref></sup> Therefore, to prevent a backward fall, the quadriceps may need to contract concentrically/isometrically and allow the athlete to center the trunk over the leg.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is that several of the cadaveric specimens, especially in group A, failed by fracture or ACL injury combined with a fracture instead of isolated ACL injury. The likely explanation is that a pure axial compressive force without a concomitant quadriceps contraction does not perfectly replicate the injury situation. The specimens in this study, although in the normal range, had bone mineral density values on the lower end of those expected for the young active population at risk and therefore may have fractured instead of sustaining isolated ACL injuries. It is also likely that the position of the leg and/or application of forces did not exactly reproduce the NC-ACLI mechanism.</p>
<p>Our current study did not include hip flexion, which may have enhanced the risk of ACL injury versus fracture. Hip flexion effectively increases the posterior tibial slope, making it easier for the lateral femoral condyle to slide (pivot shift) posteriorly on the tibial plateau and rupture the ACL with a compressive force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430204">1</xref></sup> Doing so would have theoretically lowered the compressive forces to failure and increased the chances of an ACL injury over a tibial plateau fracture.</p>
<p>The study is also limited because it did not account for the full dynamic situation at the knee, such as the effect of hamstring and/or gastrocnemius contraction or valgus forces, especially in female athletes. Because of the complexity of setting up a cadaveric study with multiple muscle forces and varying abduction moments, we decided to focus on the axial and quadriceps components of the injury. Our quadriceps contraction was simulated with a 1500-N preload and then isometric contraction during the test while we recorded the resulting quadriceps load. It is unlikely that this scenario exactly replicates the in vivo situation; however, lacking definitive data on the quadriceps load magnitude and rate, we assumed the previously mentioned load and documented the outcome. It is unknown what effect the repetitive nature of the tests had on our specimens. It is possible that microdamage accumulation may have occurred in soft tissue structures, for example, the ACL, and cartilage fissures or subchondral bone that would otherwise not have been the case if a single-load application had been conducted. We chose to conduct displacement controlled tests of increasing magnitude because conducting load-controlled compression tests at such high loading rates would have placed our testing equipment at undue risk of damage. It is also unknown what effect removing the specimen from the fixture to conduct drawer tests had on subsequent loading, although every effort was made to return the specimen to its previous position. Alternatively, the current data may provide conservative force estimates for injury to the ACL.</p>
<p>In summary, our results have shown that an axial compressive force to the knee can produce disruption of the ACL complex, but it often occurs in conjunction with a fracture. Addition of a quadriceps force significantly lowers the axial compressive force threshold needed to disrupt the ACL. Thus, forces sustained while landing from a jump are sufficient to cause injury to the ACL, but in the presence of quadriceps contraction, the injury threshold is significantly reduced.</p>
