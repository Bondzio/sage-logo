<abstract>
<p>Despite the vast differences in cultures, economies and political make-up of countries in the Asia Pacific, UPI’s journalism training organization, UPIU, has found that the journalism students struggle with similar issues—mainly the absence of sources, news hook (or news angle) and organization (or structure). This commentary describes how UPIU addresses these issues.</p>
