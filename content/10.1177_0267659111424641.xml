<p><italic>Background</italic>: The objective of this systematic evaluation was to identify the sentinel standards necessary to obtain a core level of communication required of a clinical perfusionist during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Once these sentinel standards were identified and a core level of communication was established (via four simulated case scenarios), a team of cardiac healthcare professionals was assembled to interpret both the accuracy of response and the speed of response encountered in each case scenario.</p>
<p><italic>Methods</italic>: Four simulated case scenarios were utilized in order to replicate the typical patterns of verbal exchange that occur during surgeries using extracorporeal technology. The simulated case scenarios included CPB interactions associated with preparation, initiation, maintenance, termination and post CPB. For all CPB interactions, two variables were measured: accuracy of the perfusionist’s response and speed of the perfusionist’s response. The cases took place in a controlled setting within an empty operating room at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Four clinical perfusionists each represented the role of the “perfusionist” in all simulated case scenarios.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>: When analyzing the accuracy and speed of the responses, each clinical perfusionist recorded an average score of 96.3% or higher with all case scenarios. Since the clinical perfusionists who participated in the scenarios were primarily pediatric perfusionists, the scores were best during the pediatric case scenario, 99.3% (Case Scenario #4). The lowest scores were captured during Case Scenario #3 (96.3%) which involved a more intense adult patient scenario.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>: The systematic evaluation of both response accuracy and response time (presented in various adult and pediatric patient case scenarios) can be beneficial within the realm of perfusion education.

This study supports the idea that simulation and evaluation may ease the transition for students from the didactic to clinical realm in terms of communication. Further studies need to be developed in order to define “standard” CPB communication guidelines for perfusion students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A key instrument within all forms of industry is communication. This instrument, unfortunately, can be deficient within an institution’s infrastructure. When a breakdown in communication occurs in high intensity industries, sentinel events, such as aviation disruptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111424641">1</xref></sup>, construction accidents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424641">2</xref></sup>, and medical errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111424641">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111424641">7</xref></sup>, can occur.The relationship between communication and the healthcare industry has undoubtedly been essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111424641">8</xref></sup> in terms of accuracy and response time. There are many high stress specialties within the healthcare industry that require a strict level of communication to ensure positive outcomes. One particular area where communication level is of great importance is the Cardiac Operating Room (OR). In the cardiac OR, the need for proper communication is one of the most crucial instruments required to allow healthcare professionals to perform efficiently and safely in a high stress environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424641">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111424641">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many similarities within the aviation and healthcare industries with concern to communication standards. One example is that members of the operating room team use a pre-surgical “time-out” checklist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111424641">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111424641">12</xref></sup>, similar to how pilots use a pre-flight checklist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111424641">13</xref></sup> The concept of reviewing patient information and confirming the correct procedure prior to incision (in order to maintain optimal patient safety and, consequently, to avoid a sentinel event) is synonymous with the meticulous preparation that pilots perform prior to flying an airplane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424641">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perfusion education programs have adapted their curriculums to include more didactic training and have advanced their clinical training in order to keep up with technological advancements. While the importance of communication in healthcare has been established, it is a surprise that many perfusion education programs have not fully adopted communication as a core principle of learning in their curriculums. Furthermore, there is a lack of evaluation criteria available properly to determine the basic communication skills of the perfusion student. As an example, there has been a trend to include simulator training to teach students in a more advanced, but controlled setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424641">15</xref></sup> It is the recommendation of the authors that the progression of a student within a perfusion education program should require a “standard level” of communication in order to determine the safety and efficiency of all entry-level perfusionists. This curriculum could prove beneficial to the student, the educational program and the profession.</p>
<p>The objective of this systematic evaluation was to identify the sentinel standards necessary to obtain a core level of communication required of a clinical perfusionist during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A sentinel standard is defined for this study as the necessary level of communicative aptitude expected of a cardiovascular perfusionist in the healthcare environment. Once these sentinel standards were identified and a core level of communication was established (via four simulated case scenarios), a team of cardiac healthcare professionals was assembled to interpret both the accuracy of response and the speed of response encountered in each case scenario.</p>

<sec id="section2-0267659111424641" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Four simulated case scenarios were utilized in order to replicate the typical patterns of verbal exchange that occur during specific times while using extracorporeal technology. The simulated case scenarios included those CPB interactions associated with preparation, initiation, maintenance, termination and post CPB. For all perfusion-related interactions, two variables were measured: accuracy of the response and speed of the response. The cases took place in a controlled setting within an empty OR at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. There were a total of five participants in the evaluation process. The acting roles within the examination were that of the surgeon, anesthesiologist, physician assistant, circulating nurse and perfusionist. Five licensed clinical perfusionists each represented the role of the “perfusionist” in all four simulated case scenarios. One licensed perfusionist was used as a test subject with each of the clinical scenarios. The other four perfusionists represented the actual study participants. Television monitors showed hemodynamic sections and a picture of the OR bed. Background noise was developed via suction canisters and a heater cooler. Each of the participants wore proper attire in order for the OR environment to closely resemble normal conditions during a typical clinical case.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the clinical perfusionists did not play any of the other roles in the simulated case scenarios and were not exposed to the any of the scenarios prior to the examination process. Furthermore, each supporting cast member in the examination had the responsibility of individually evaluating the perfusionist’s accuracy and response time for all four scenarios. This allowed for each perfusionist to be scored objectively four times by four separate evaluators rather than having a subjective opinion of only one or two examiners.</p>
<sec id="section3-0267659111424641">
<title>Simulated Case Scenarios</title>
<p>Simulated Case Scenario #1 included an adult patient who underwent open heart surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Case Scenario #2 presented an adult patient who suffered from aortic insufficiency. Case Scenario #3 represented a patient who had undergone previous surgeries for a CABG X 3 and an aortic valve repair, now presenting with recurring coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation. Case Scenario #4 represented a pediatric patient who was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and was undergoing a Norwood procedure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111424641">Table 1</xref>). Each case scenario was developed by utilizing normal command and response combinations that could occur during each specific operation. All four testing scenarios were approved by David Holt, Program Director of the UNMC perfusion education program.</p>

<title>Grading</title>
<p>Each question in the evaluation tool had a subscale of 0-5 points. The accuracy level and response time had a positive correlation to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659111424641">Figure 1</xref>). The highest amount of points able to be achieved per question was 5/5. Obtaining a 5/5 entailed answering the question both correctly and within three seconds. If the question was answered correctly after more than three seconds, then 3/5 points were given. If the question was answered incorrectly initially but then corrected then 1/5 points were given. There were no points awarded for a question that was answered incorrectly twice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659111424641">Figure 1</xref> is an example of a question from the examination’s grading scale.</p>

<p>With each simulated case scenario, the results were averaged from each of the four evaluator’s grading sheets. The averaged grade for each case scenario was then placed into an average with the other clinical perfusionists’ grades. All of the grades for each case scenario were then averaged to develop the “Standard Grade” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659111424641">Table 3</xref>). The “Standard Grade” is the level of proficiency that a clinical perfusionist should achieve in order to reach a satisfactory communication status.</p>

<p>The “standard level” of communication skills was determined through the evaluation of each perfusionist. The averages for each of the case scenarios ranged between 96-99%. The highest average score was shown to be from Case Scenario #4, 99.3%. The lowest average score occurred from Case Scenario #1, 96.3%. Particular patterns were observed with some of the questions due to the repetition of commands during the initiation and termination CPB process of each case scenario. Most questions that were of variation were due to the differences in procedures with each specific patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659111424641" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The association of the high scores between all four scenarios displayed a direct correlation between all four perfusionists’ understanding of the subject matter. Due to this distinct similarity between all the results within each case scenario, a “standard level” of communication was made for each of the case scenarios. The “standard level” was shown to be of a high value, which illustrates the importance of communication guidelines. The evaluation tool helped show a fundamental understanding of the need for communication standards within the cardiovascular perfusion clinical setting. The “standard level” determined from the study will ultimately help a perfusion education program develop communication standards that are both objective and measurable and that the perfusion student must possess in order to be considered at an entry level.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the clinical perfusionists who participated in the study primarily perform neonatal and infant pediatric cases, but, on occasion, also work with adult congenital CPB cases. The knowledge that is required to perform a CPB case for an adult patient undergoing coronary artery bypass is very different when compared to a pediatric CPB procedure. Although there are procedural differences between adult and pediatric CPB, the evaluation tool was validated in that the pediatric clinical perfusionists were able to receive very high scores with three adult, simulated case scenarios.</p>
<p>Each case scenario included basic communication interactions that would occur within the cardiac OR during the preparation, initiation, maintenance, termination and post CPB time period. Examples of the questions that were given to each of the four clinical perfusionists are as follows (with the answers in italics):</p>
<list id="list1-0267659111424641" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Nurse comes over and asks you if you would like to check the blood for the patient, you respond with, <italic>“Yes of course”</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The anesthesiologist asks you to put 1% of Isoflurane on. What do you respond with? <italic>“Isoflurane on at 1%.”</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If there is activity after the twenty minutes has passed, what are you going to mention to the surgeon? <italic>“It has been twenty minutes since the last cardioplegia dose and there is a little activity.”</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The responses that were developed for each question were derived from the experience of the authors who are clinical perfusionists. The design of each question was structured to help a perfusion student recognize the desired response in a timely fashion. The correct response was designed to allow the perfusion student to be able to utilize this standard communication tool in a cardiac OR.</p>
<sec id="section7-0267659111424641">
<title>Implementation into a Perfusion Education Program</title>
<p>This communication standard tool could be instituted within a perfusion education program to help assess the perfusion student’s communication level. A perfusion education program could introduce the four simulated case scenarios over two semesters. The first semester would allow the perfusion student to participate in Case Scenarios #1 and #2. The second semester would allow the student to participate in Case Scenarios #3 and #4. This hypothetical program would allow students to be introduced to the proper communication commands during the beginning of their perfusion academic experiences. The inclusion of Case Scenarios #3 and #4 within the second semester would progress the student’s communication ability to a level that would prepare him/her to face the adversity which could occur during the clinical fellowships.</p>
<p>A grading scale for the perfusion student should be defined by academic program directors. The actual score that a perfusion student will most likely acquire would not be in the highest level; therefore, a leniency of the grades with each case scenario may need to be curtailed in the first semester when compared to the second semester. For instance, the score would be acceptable if a perfusion student scored &gt;75% within the first semester for Clinical Scenarios #1 and #2. As the student progressed to the second semester, the acceptable score would increase to approximately &gt;85%. If a student does not pass the tests with the standard grade, then he/she would enter a probationary stage to help them improve upon their clinical communication skills (i.e. knowledge base, response accuracy, response time). The student would then be responsible for observing a clinical instructor to help them understand the communication skills needed to be a proficient perfusionist within the clinical setting. The student would then be re-tested on the four simulated case scenarios and would need to achieve the standard grade to be deemed able to progress to their clinical fellowships.</p>

<sec id="section8-0267659111424641">
<title>Importance to the Cardiovascular Perfusion Profession</title>
<p>The use of communication skills has long been emphasized within the perfusion community. Obtaining the ability to communicate with other healthcare professional roles within the cardiac surgical environment is not only a key objective to perform a basic procedure, but is also essential to have a successful outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424641">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424641">17</xref></sup> Inclusion of this “standard” communication evaluation through perfusion education programs would help perfusion students develop the required skills needed to become a more proficient clinician. By helping students become overall better candidates prior to graduation, the end result would allow the profession to become more advanced, in that new graduates would obtain a better understanding of their specific clinical role during cardiac surgery. The concept of this uniform set of commands and responses could also be adopted within a current perfusion program within the protocol section of the department. Due to the opposition of other healthcare professionals within the cardiac OR, the adoption of this tool set may have some obstacles to overcome. If the fortitude of the perfusion program is able to facilitate the involvement of the other disciplines within the Cardiac OR then the possibilities are endless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659111424641">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111424641">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The systematic evaluation of a perfusionist’s response accuracy and response time (presented in various adult and pediatric patient case scenarios) can be beneficial within the realm of perfusion education in that it may help introduce students to core communication concepts within the clinical realm. The study’s findings support the concept that the evaluation may ease the transition for students from the didactic to the clinical realm in terms of communication. Further studies, however, need to be performed in order to develop the concept of a “standard” communication guideline for perfusion students in regards to CPB. The need to optimize the level of communication with each specialty within the clinical arena is not only imperative to patient safety, but also can have a direct correlation with patient outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424641">20</xref></sup></p>
