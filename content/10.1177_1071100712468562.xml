<sec id="section1-1071100712468562">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Although cross-sectional biomechanical studies have reported that wearing high-heeled shoes can change the musculoskeletal system of the lower extremities, the long-term effects of wearing such shoes on the ankle remain unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal changes in ankle range of motion and muscle strength in habitual wearers of high-heeled shoes and to provide information for clinicians undertaking functional evaluations of the ankles of such patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712468562">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Habitual wearers of high-heeled shoes (n = 10; age, 23.9 ± 2.7 years) and wearers of flat shoes (n = 10; age, 23.8 ± 2.1 years) were selectively recruited, and the range of motion, maximal voluntary isometric force, and concentric contraction power of their ankles were measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712468562">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Wearers of high-heeled shoes showed increased ankle range of motion on plantarflexion at 25 degrees and inversion at 10 degrees compared to flat shoe wearers (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) but decreased dorsiflexion (about 17 degrees) and eversion (13 degrees; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Concentric contraction power in ankle eversion was also 2 times higher in wearers of high-heeled shoes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712468562">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>These subjects had functional deformity of the ankle in a supinated direction and increased eversion power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1071100712468562">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>We cautiously recommend that habitual wearers of high-heeled shoes (those who walk in such shoes for more than 5 hours more than 6 times a week) undertake intensive ankle stretching exercises in the direction of dorsiflexion as well as eversion.</p>

<body>
<p>Various studies have warned women that wearing high-heeled shoes (HHS) for a long time can cause musculoskeletal changes in the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremities and trunk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712468562">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712468562">24</xref></sup> Kinematic changes that occur during walking, such as increased ankle plantarflexion and hyperextension of the metatarsophalangeal joint, are caused by wearing HHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468562">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712468562">12</xref></sup> In particular, the risk of metatarsalgia caused by increased plantar pressure at the metatarsal head is increased with frequent wearing of HHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712468562">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712468562">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712468562">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712468562">25</xref></sup> Kinetic changes also occur; that is, plantar pressure moves inward,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712468562">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712468562">22</xref></sup> and the center of mass moves forward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712468562">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The kinematic and kinetic changes caused by HHS might induce deformities of the ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints. However, most studies performed to determine the musculoskeletal changes induced by HHS have included a period during which HHS were not worn. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake a survey to measure the changes that accompany the actual frequency of wearing HHS.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that habitual wearers of HHS have limited full extension of the knee during walking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712468562">23</xref></sup> increased fatigue of the peroneus muscle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712468562">11</xref></sup> and increased Achilles tendon stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712468562">6</xref></sup> However, the long-term effects of HHS on ankle range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength remain to be discovered.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the ankle ROM and muscle strength of habitual wearers of HHS and flat shoes (FS) and to identify characteristics of the ankles of habitual wearers of HHS. When women wear HHS, their ankle joints are placed in a more plantarflexed position and require more stability. We postulate that frequent wearing of HHS for a long time increases the maximal range of ankle plantarflexion and inversion and eversion strength.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1071100712468562">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 20 women (age range, 21-29 years) participated in our study. Participants with dysfunction of the neural or musculoskeletal system or pain were excluded. All completed a questionnaire with demographic information, medical history, and the duration of the period over which they wore HHS over the preceding 6 months. The participants were divided into 2 groups based on the criteria outlined in another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468562">7</xref></sup>: an HHS group and a FS group. The HHS group included 10 women who had worn HHS at least 3 days a week over the past 6 months. The FS group included 10 women who had worn HHS less than 3 days a week over the past 6 months. The 2 groups were not significantly different in terms of age, height, weight, foot length, foot width, or total period of wearing HHS. Furthermore, none had regularly participated in any sports, strength training, or stretching exercises for the past 6 months. Two subjects were excluded from the study because they had a low likelihood of wearing HHS over the past 6 months, although they had often worn HHS for more than 3 days a week for the previous 1 month. A total of 22 participants were recruited in this study. The Ethics Committee of Korea University approved this study. All participants provided their informed consent, and their identities were coded to protect their privacy.</p>

<title>Measurement of ROM</title>
<p>To examine changes in maximum ankle ROM caused by HHS, active and passive ROM was measured using an inclinometer (Angle Finder AF200M, Dasco Pro Inc, Rockford, IL). Maximal angular ranges of inversion, eversion, plantarflexion, dorsiflexion with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion (DF-KF), and dorsiflexion with the knee fully extended (DF-KE) were measured. To measure the ROM of inversion and eversion, the subjects were seated with their feet off the floor to ensure that the anterior border of the tibia was vertical and to prevent hip rotation. After fixation, the angles of the movement of the metatarsal head in the frontal plane were checked. To measure the ROM of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, subjects were asked to place their ankles over the edge of a table while lying in a supine position. Then, the maximal movement angle of the fifth metatarsal bone was used to determine the ankle ROM on the sagittal plane relative to the vertical. To examine the effects on the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, dorsiflexion was checked with the knee at 90 degrees flexion and fully extended. To measure DF-KF, the subject lay in a supine position with hip and knee at 90 degrees flexion with the tibia fixed in place horizontally. The angle of ankle maximal dorsiflexion from the vertical was then measured. All measurements were taken 3 times.</p>

<sec id="section9-1071100712468562">
<title>Measurement of Muscle Strength</title>
<p>Ankle muscle strength was measured using a multimodal dynamometer (Primus RS, BTE Technologies Inc., Baltimore, MD). To measure the maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIF) in 4 directions (inversion, eversion, plantarflexion, and dorsiflexion) of both ankles, an axis of dynamometer was fixed in place. Concentric contraction power at the 25% and 75% MVIF levels was measured for both ankles in the same MVIF posture, and subjects were instructed to use maximal effort to ensure concentrated speed as well as force. Measurement postures were determined in the plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion directions. To measure dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, the subject lay in a supine position with the pelvis and tibia fixed in position up on a table (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712468562">Figure 1</xref>). Strength of ankle eversion and inversion was then measured in a sitting position by fixing the thigh in place to prevent movement of the hip joint (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712468562">Figure 2</xref>). All measurements were repeated 3 times.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Our purpose was to compare the ROM, MVIF, and concentric contraction power at 25% and 75% MVIF between the HHS and FS groups. We used an independent <italic>t</italic> test to compare demographic characteristics and the period of wearing HHS between groups. Levene’s test for equality of variances was used in relation to the underlying assumptions of parametric statistics. The reproducibility of trials was tested by intraclass correlation coefficients. Data from the 2 groups included the average of 3 trials for the left and right ankles and were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance in SPSS 12.0. Statistical significance was accepted for <italic>P</italic> values less than .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>No significant differences between the HHS and FS groups in mean age, height, weight, foot length, foot width, or period of wearing HHS were observed. However, a significant difference was observed in the frequency of wearing HHS and walking while wearing HHS for a week (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712468562">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the maximum ROM differed between the HHS and FS groups. ROM measures were dichotomized as active and passive ROM. Measurement of active ROM was chiefly performed in the clinical field because most of the tasks performed during daily life require active ROM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712468562">4</xref></sup> Passive ROM was measured to confirm the passive viscoelastic properties of the involved muscles, pain, and neural inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712468562">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To understand clinically the musculoskeletal effects of wearing HHS, orthopaedic examination of habitual high-heeled shoe wearers is important. The purpose of this study was to compare ankle ROM and muscle strength between habitual wearers of HHS and FS. We found that the physical ability of the ankles of wearers of HHS was significantly different from that of the wearers of FS in terms of kinematics and kinetics.</p>
<p>Regarding kinematic changes, the maximum ROM of plantarflexion and inversion was higher in the HHS group compared with the FS group; however, DF-KE and eversion were lower. This indicates that the range of ankle joint mobility in the HHS group was shifted to a supinated position. These results lead to the speculation that tissues around the ankle become lax on the anterolateral side and stiff on the posteromedial side—that is, an elongated anterior talofibular ligament and a stiff deltoid ligament and Achilles tendon. We considered that changes in ankle ROM related to the supinated position were caused by kinematic characteristics during walking with HHS. Other studies have reported increased maximum peak angles of plantarflexion and inversion in the ankle during walking with HHS; however, their experimental data compared maximum peak angles of the ankle in HHS and FS and were inconsistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468562">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712468562">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712468562">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712468562">30</xref></sup> Thus, it is possible that the gait pattern when wearing HHS affects supinated deformation of the ankle ROM in wearers of HHS.</p>
<p>In particular, the ankle plantarflexed position in HHS would reduce the length of the gastrocnemius muscle relative to the other calf muscles. We dichotomized dorsiflexion ROM in the knee at full extension and at 90 degrees of flexion because examinations of ankle dorsiflexion at different knee positions are useful for discriminating posterior ankle structure shortening between monoarticular and biarticular muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712468562">19</xref></sup> The maximum ROM of DF-KE was about 16 degrees lower in the HHS group compared with the FS group, whereas DF-KF was not different or was only slightly different. This indicates that the gastrocnemius muscle fascia of the HHS group was shorter than the other ankle structures, such as the soleus muscle and the posterior joint capsule.</p>
<p>The supinated metamorphosis of the ankle in the HHS group would lead to functional changes in the musculoskeletal system; that is, it would disturb efficient shock absorption of the deltoid and spring ligament<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468562">7</xref></sup> and increase the risk of anterior talofibular ligament sprains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712468562">21</xref></sup> In addition, limited ankle dorsiflexion ROM is associated with poor calf muscle pump function in limbs with chronic venous insufficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712468562">19</xref></sup> and could contribute to increased gait deviations, such as decreased step length and walking speed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712468562">8</xref></sup> Thus, we were able to establish that kinematic changes induced by wearing HHS have a negative influence on the ankle and that regular ankle stretching in the direction of dorsiflexion, with the knee extended, and at eversion is essential for habitual wearers of HHS.</p>
<p>We also found that the HHS group had a significantly higher concentric contraction power in eversion than the FS group. Muscle power is the ability of a muscle to produce force rapidly, is defined as the product of force and time, and is generated during activities that involve movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712468562">28</xref></sup> We first considered that increased muscle power of eversion would be induced as an adaption to mediolateral instability induced by a narrow heel. A previous study also reported that peroneus muscle activity was increased during walking with heeled shoes owing to a decreased base of support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712468562">30</xref></sup> The enhanced eversion power observed in the HHS group indicates that ankle instability while wearing HHS can induce a rapidly generated force affecting the peroneus muscle and that this is important for preventing ankle sprains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712468562">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712468562">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712468562">16</xref></sup> Second, increased eversion power results from shifting the center of the body mass laterally when women walk in HHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712468562">11</xref></sup> That is, the medial longitudinal arch and the spring ligament complex are key structures for shock absorption generally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712468562">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712468562">30</xref></sup> During the stance phase of walking wearing HHS, however, the center of gravity shifts laterally with increased hip adduction. The external moment arm of the ankle axis is increased, and the peroneus muscle requires more power to maintain balance. This process emphasizes the role of the peroneus muscle as a shock absorber. Thus, the increased mediolateral instability and the lateral transfer of the center of gravity during walking in HHS act as the main effectors increasing the concentric power of ankle eversion.</p>
<p>Our results show that habitual wearers of HHS have to increase dorsiflexion and eversion ROM. Thus far, several studies have reported the effect of stretching exercises on the calf muscles to increase the dorsiflexion ROM of normal subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712468562">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712468562">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468562">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1071100712468562">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1071100712468562">32</xref></sup> Of these, a passive stretching exercise with programmed long, frequent stretching times (more than 150 seconds per day, 5 days per week for 6 to 8 weeks) with a short resting period had a positive effect on increasing ankle ROM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712468562">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712468562">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468562">13</xref></sup> For habitual wearers of HHS, more intensive stretching exercises are necessary. In addition, our study suggests that the stretching exercises should be performed in the direction of not only dorsiflexion but also eversion. Further studies are required to determine whether the intensity of the outlined stretching program is effective for habitual wearers of HHS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study found that habitual wearers of HHS have a significantly altered musculoskeletal system in the ankle, resulting in supinated ROM and increased eversion power. Moreover, ankle adaptations to maintain balance from a narrow base of support when wearing HHS evoke kinematic and kinetic changes. However, the ankle adaptations are known to have a clinically negative impact by increasing the risk of inversion sprains,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712468562">21</xref></sup> poor calf muscle pumping,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712468562">19</xref></sup> and unstable gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712468562">8</xref></sup> Therefore, we recommend that clinicians check the frequency of a patient’s wearing of HHS and that they understand the physical characteristics of the ankles of habitual wearers of HHS when undertaking functional evaluations.</p>
