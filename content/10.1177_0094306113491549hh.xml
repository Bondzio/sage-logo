<p>During the 2008 Democratic primary, my friend, a Congressional staffer, and I worked as volunteer canvassers for the Obama campaign in Pennsylvania. She would drive up from Washington, DC to Philadelphia every weekend for the eight weeks leading up to the Pennsylvania Presidential primary in April. She was a Democratic Party insider, very familiar and experienced with electoral politics. She had already been to New Hampshire and Iowa, and her plan for the spring was to work for the campaign in all the swing states. Me? It was my first time to be, as I saw it, actively engaged with American politics beyond resentfully casting a vote for the lesser of two evils. Through canvassing, I was learning about the community I live in and through my activism, I believed I was advocating for the rights of all of us to participate in democracy. After years of living outside the United States, I was determined to contribute directly to the restoration of American democracy decimated by eight years under the Bush Administration, which is how I perceived what I was doing at the time. While I felt that my individual vote made little difference to the politics of the country, my active participation in a campaign to convince others to vote for Obama would make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>Those were magical times. At each door-knock, with very few exceptions, we were greeted with warm enthusiasm from our fellow citizens—we were, after all, working in solidly Obama territory: a woman even sang to us as she opened her door. People repeatedly expressed gratitude to us for doing what was in their estimation honorable and civically-minded “good work.” The Saturday before the Pennsylvania primaries, we knocked on the door of a house shared by two sisters, one was a mother of two young children, and the other was a professional returning to graduate school. They were both Democrats but undecided regarding the two primary candidates, Clinton or Obama. They wanted us to stop and take the time to talk to them about the fine details of Obama’s platform. As volunteer canvassers, my friend and I were equipped with a script that outlined key Obama positions and a “blockwalking” VAN (Voter Activation Network) list, a package of printouts with hundreds of voters’ names, addresses, basic demographic information, and a checklist on specific data that we were supposed to gather from each door-knock. We had to make contact with all the voters in our blockwalking packet that morning and we were not to go “off script” or deviate from our list. We were to spend no more than one minute speaking to each voter. Talking to the sisters, we broke all the rules that the campaign staffers had laid down with us. We stayed on the sisters’ front porch for a good 15 minutes, we discussed positions not found in the script and I relied heavily upon my friend’s insider knowledge to field the harder questions. And we left our personal email addresses with the sisters. They wanted a way to follow-up with us if they had more questions. These were all big no-nos. The following Tuesday afternoon, I received an email from one of the sisters, letting me know that in the morning both had voted for Obama. We lived for those moments.</p>
<p>Rasmus Kleis Nielsen explores the long overlooked experiences of campaign workers, especially those who knock on doors or make phone calls to millions of voters, running local American political campaigns in his new book, <italic>Ground Wars: Personalized Communication in Political Campaigns</italic>. Nielsen takes us inside the temporary, store-front offices that hum with computers, printers, and phone banks peopled with civically-minded volunteers looking to help but frustrated that their telegraphic intrusions are met by hang-ups and the occasional shouted epithet. He takes us outside to pound the pavement with newly-recruited paid canvassers beleaguered by stiffly written scripts and little direction from campaign staffers. Through his ethnographic lens, we hear from recent college graduates on the bottom rung of their political careers, working on a “need-to-know” basis from head office, not to mention for less than minimum wage, all for a campaign on which they hope to cut their professional chops.</p>
<p>Through a meticulously detailed, and at times quite humorous, ethnographic narrative, Nielsen reveals the emotional labor and the technological, political, and financial assemblages that pool together for a few months to fight in the “ground wars” for two local Congressional candidates on the American East Coast. He guides us through the recent history of electoral campaigns, particularly since the 2000 Presidential elections, and the slow adoption of the tools utilized to great effect by marketing and made possible by database software, especially predictive analytics. Nielsen stresses throughout that the research in this book is about “personalized communication,” the extremely “narrowcast” communications made possible through the door-to-door canvassing utilized in recent years by several political campaigns, and made most famous by Obama’s grassroots ground game during the 2008 campaign for the White House.</p>
<p>And ostensibly he is right; the book is a deep exploration of the technological, political, and human resources that are rallied to fight for a candidate. In <italic>Ground Wars</italic>, canvassers become the most effective tool of persuasion in the political toolbox—these workers are both the medium and the message of the campaign and can stand between voters and a candidate winning office. Contrary to the accumulated wisdom of many twentieth-century political campaigns, when canvassing was considered an old-fashioned waste of money, door-knocks and phone calls made to individual voters are now considered to be essential to any campaign strategy. Direct, person-to-person communications become crucial in the last few days before an election to get voters to polls, and sometimes, can mean the difference between winning and losing a race.</p>
<p>But what the book really does is document the emotional capital expended by campaign workers of all different stripes: the volunteers, the paid part-timers, the staff, and management who labor long hours for few rewards—a pleasant phone call, a voter who says yes they will be voting for that particular candidate, a correctly completed blockwalking packet. The book’s most interesting chapters are the ones that focus on the intense labor and emotions that go into fighting these “ground wars.” The chapter “Contacting Voters at Home” is by far the most strongly written and compelling primarily because in this chapter Nielsen stays close to the field data and goes deep into the emotional work of campaigns. He frames the emotional labor that campaign workers engage in mostly through Goffman and Hochschild, with no consideration to the recent work on affective labor in queer and feminist studies, but this is not necessarily problematic. He does not consider the stratification of labor, which seemed rife in the field sites that he describes, but again, his focus, as he asserts, is on theorizing how personal communication works in contemporary campaigns, and not necessarily on how social hierarchies are recapitulated in the microcosms of campaign offices. He does tend to rely far too heavily on parenthetical asides, which can become tedious and distracting at times: Nielsen’s work is strongest when he keeps close and tight to his fieldwork. As he notes, there is no other research in the existing political communication or sociological literature that gives ethnographic consideration to these unsung campaign workers and operations.</p>
<p>As I read his ethnographic account of campaigning, memories of my own experience on hitting the pavement for Obama came flooding back. Turns out, my motivations for participating and my behavior during canvassing (veering off script, stopping too long to speak with voters, going into people’s living rooms!) were fairly typical of campaign volunteers, much to the chagrin of staffers. For those of us who are fighting in the ground wars of American electoral politics and who have doubted if this is the best way to engage in democratic culture, Nielsen’s book is essential reading.</p>
