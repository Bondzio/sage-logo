<p>Africa has had its moments of hope and optimism, but this is the one that promises a genuine, lasting takeoff. Across this diverse continent of 54 sovereign nations and more than a billion people, a growing number of Africans are finding success. With six of the world’s 10 fastest growing economies over the past decade, Africa’s despair and penury, violence and intolerance are increasingly being left behind. Civil wars and despots are giving way to prosperity and democracy. Africa and the West have long had a fraught relationship—from Europe’s first penetration of the so-called “Dark Continent” by 15th century explorers to the colonial era when a host of western powers—Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Spain—sent their legions and traders to conquer and enslave. Even today, the West too often considers Africa a locus of unrest and upheaval rather than a region for engagement and investment.</p>
<p>This is the first of our annual issues designed to spotlight a different region of the world, debuting with a new, hopeful Africa. Each winter, we will turn to a different corner of the world for our cover theme. Here, we have chosen to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, believing that the Maghreb more properly belongs in a discussion of the Middle East. This issue unspools some of Africa’s most exciting, contemporary stories that need to be told if the world is to understand what’s involved in building a region that is strong and free yet able to peacefully maintain its vast quilt of nationalities, languages, cultures, and religions. </p>
<p>So we begin with the Big Question—a selection of international experts reflecting on the role technology should play in opening up the continent to new ideas and opportunities. Then, Map Room traces the little-known buried reserves of fresh water that could become a crucial, life-saving resource in the future. The popular rapper and one-time Sudanese child soldier Emmanuel Jal gives us a taste of why music gives him strength and how sacrifice can transform nations. To understand the persistence of violence on the continent, our Anatomy of Terrorism delves into the Nigerian terrorist network, Boko Haram, which seeks to impose its own warped brand of Islam on Africa’s most populous nation. For our Conversation, we spend 90 minutes with Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame, revered by many for his vision, reviled by others for his firm, some say despotic, rule that he justifies as a necessity for the moment. Through a gateway in Somalia, Turkey is making inroads into Africa where richer nations have failed. Julia Harte chronicles how Turkey’s “virtuous power” doctrine could become a model for the developed world. One entrenched legacy of the colonial era is the continent’s languages—English, French, and Portuguese. Oyenike Adeosun describes the difficult linguistic choices Africans must make if they are to prosper in a globalized world. Finally, Fidelis Allen, from his perch in the Niger Delta, uncovers how oil extraction is destroying a region and its way of life—an environmental, cautionary tale with implications far beyond the oil fields of Nigeria.</p>
<p>In our Portfolio, the extraordinary Saudi photojournalist Hasan Hatrash, behind the scenes in Mecca, chronicles the spiritual enlightenment of one young Muslim as he undertakes the physical and emotional trials of the hajj. To our Chat Room, we’ve invited Ali Akbar Salehi, the brilliant technocrat now serving as Iran’s minister of foreign affairs, who explains his vision of Iran’s future and its relations with the world. Through the economic angst, violent protests, and political instability in Greece, the plight of its people has been largely ignored. Greek commentator Nikos Konstandaras, managing editor of the Athens daily <italic>Kathimerini</italic>, reveals the struggles of his people in a moving, personal essay and makes clear what Europe should do to help them and save itself. Craig R. Whitney, a veteran editor of <italic>The New York Times</italic> whose new book explores the role of the Second Amendment in America, looks at the shameful failure to control the spread of small arms across the world. From London, Katie Engelhart delves into the impact a trial in a British court may have on colonial legacies on every continent. With perhaps the most critical elections in the history of Pakistan looming next spring, Arsla Jawaid examines the potent role young people will have on the selection of the next leader of Islam’s only nuclear power. Finally, in his Coda, <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> editor David A. Andelman comments on the pace of change and asks whether a strategy of do-no-harm is a worthy goal for leaders in today’s fraught world.</p>
