<p>My favourite articles from a practical, if not intellectual, point of view are the ones that support and confirm my intuitive beliefs and current practice. My least favourite are those that are both counter-intuitive and tell me I’m doing the wrong thing (the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412472847">Davis et al. (2004)</xref> telling me my ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) is no better than trapezectomy is a good example.</p>
<p>This article represents a little of both. At first skim of the abstract I could easily convince myself that there is a ‘<italic>highly statistically significant relationship between radiographic displacement, at review, and clinical outcome scores</italic>’; something that is intuitive and allows me to feel comfortable with the number of these fractures that I treat surgically. On studying the article in more detail I find that ‘<italic>the final alignment of the distal radius, as shown radiologically, has only a minor influence on the clinical outcome of Colles’ type distal radius fractures</italic>’, which I find counter-intuitive and will fuel my managers’ argument that I am wasting their money when I operate on these fractures.</p>
<p>This article only includes non-operated fractures so cannot tell us how badly the operated fractures would have done if left alone; presumably these would have had the worst malunion? Further, by excluding undisplaced fractures we do not know the variability in their outcomes and how that may relate to the presented results. Is the inability to correlate outcome with malunion a valid finding or does it reflect an inability of our outcome measures to identify subtle, but clinically important, differences in outcome: is the Global Wrist Outcome Score sensitive enough or indeed valid?</p>
<p>In addition, should we make conclusions based on an article with only a 46.6% follow-up rate? It is always difficult to achieve high follow up rates in trauma series, especially when assessing long-term results, nonetheless what did happen to the other 50%? Could they all have had displaced fractures, all have had a poor result and all chosen to have further treatment elsewhere? Probably not – but we do not know!</p>
<p>The article does however suggest that radiological outcome only accounts for 23% of variability in outcome in distal radius fractures and uses this fact to question the recent trend towards volar plating. This is not the first time that I have been forced to question this aspect of my practice (and my intuition) by an article looking at outcome and comparing it with radiographic parameters. The conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412472847">Forward et al. (2008)</xref> from their 38-year follow-up of 106 patients was that ‘<italic>imperfect reduction of these fractures may not result in symptomatic arthritis in the long term</italic>’. This article also made me question why I treat so many wrist fractures with volar plates.</p>
<p>On reflection, however, although these articles cause me to question my practice, they do not really provide me with enough evidence to answer the question they pose. Granted ‘<italic>almost all degrees of malunion are compatible with good function, and poor function may be seen in the presence of normal radiological anatomy</italic>’ but can we really conclude that it ‘<italic>may be that the considerable resources allocated by many hard-pressed health services to open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures would be better used in other ways’</italic>?</p>
<p>The potential benefits of plating over cast fixation cannot be answered by an article that looks only at non-operative management. It can question how important it is to achieve a good reduction, but not whether we should fix the fractures in the first place. We know there are advantages to open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF; quicker return to independence and improved short term-outcomes have been shown in several studies. There may not yet be any good prospective double-blind randomized trials to prove that volar plates confer a significantly better long-term outcome than ‘<italic>supervised neglect</italic>’, but we intuitively know it is only a matter of time – don’t we? Surely they must, my Hand Therapists are always telling me how well my patients are doing – what more evidence do I need?</p>
<p>I started this commentary by describing my favourite and least favourite articles. They represent only about 5% of all the articles that I read. The other 95%, in attempting to answer an important question, often succeed in increasing our understanding a small amount; they usually, however, end up posing more questions than they answer; ‘why do some undisplaced fractures do badly?’, ‘why do some badly displaced fractures do well?’, ‘what accounts for the other 77% of the variability?’, ‘how can I predict the ones that won’t do well?’ and ‘which ones should I really be fixing?’. I commend Finsen and colleagues for trying to answer a big question, but unfortunately I do feel that this article is one of those articles that leaves me with more questions than answers.</p>
