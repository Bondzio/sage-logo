<abstract>
<p>Political communications literature has long been concerned with the question of whether media exposure results in symptoms of “malaise”—disaffection and withdrawal from politics—or, alternatively, whether it can mobilize people for political activity. Thus far, the results of research into this question have been inconclusive and at times contradictory in nature. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted in the context of the United States or other advanced democracies, and in these countries media use competes with a variety of other—perhaps much stronger—factors influencing political engagement, such as well-developed partisanship, strong group loyalties, lifelong personal experiences with the political system, and so forth. We chose to investigate the “malaise versus mobilization” question in the context of three new democracies—the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland—where the above-mentioned factors have not yet had a chance to mature, and where media use could potentially have an especially strong impact on attitudes and behavior. The project utilizes a series of comparable questions on national random-sample surveys carried out in each country during the parliamentary election campaigns of 2005 and 2006 to map party supporters and media audiences, and assess questions about malaise versus mobilization. Our maps of party supporters and media audiences show that TV news and tabloids reach larger and more diverse audiences than broadsheets and some niche broadcasting channels. In all three countries, while there were no significant relationships between media use and trust in government, there was some evidence to support the mobilization hypothesis: the use of broadsheets and politically opinionated weekly news magazines had a strong positive relationship with political engagement that remained when controlling for political interest and a number of sociodemographic characteristics. Our research suggests that the malaise versus mobilization debate continues to be an important basis for studying these more recent democracies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades, political communications has developed into a field rich with diversity, embracing approaches ranging from system-level comparative analyses of interconnections between media and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212452450">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>) to individual-level experimental research into cognitive mechanisms behind the processing of media messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212452450">Lau and Redlawsk 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212452450">1</xref></sup> Among these diverse approaches has been the research into questions of strength and direction of media effects in the context of proliferation of new outlets and consequent fragmentation of audiences in advanced industrial democracies. On the question of strength, opinion has been divided between scholars who argued that the media would play an increasingly important role as political competition evolved into the image-centered spectacle of “video-politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161212452450">Sartori 1989</xref>) and, on the other side, those who predicted a diminution of the media’s role as a consequence of the fragmentation of what once were large, politically diverse audiences into a plethora of smaller, ideologically self-selected groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212452450">Bennett and Iyengar 2008</xref>). On the question of direction, in the so-called malaise versus mobilization debate, some studies have linked media use, and especially exposure to television, to various symptoms of the former, including erosion of social capital, growing levels of public cynicism, disenchantment with democracy, and disengagement from the public sphere, as evidenced by declining election turnouts and diminishing involvement in civic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212452450">Robinson 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212452450">Cappella and Jamieson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212452450">Brehm and Rahn 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212452450">Putnam 1995</xref>). Other scholars, however, have reported evidence for a “virtuous circle” of influence between media use and political engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212452450">Norris 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>But it has also been suggested that despite the long history of interconnections and parallel institutional development between the worlds of media and politics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161212452450">Seymour-Ure 1996</xref>), in established democracies media effects are a relatively weak force in comparison to “bedrock political values associated with class, religion, age, gender, and education, as well as social networks and . . . personal knowledge and experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212452450">Newton 2006</xref>: 209). By contrast, in new political systems the complex interconnections between social-structural variables, group loyalties, values, organizations, and patterns of behavior that characterize state–society relations in older democracies have not yet matured, and the citizenry does not yet have the benefit of a lifetime of personal experience with a political system’s key actors, institutions, and policy outputs. This ought to be particularly true in postcommunist East-Central Europe, where the specific combination of short democratic history, underdeveloped parties, and “tabloidized” politics would seem an ideal environment for media outlets to potentially play an outsized role in shaping perceptions of leaders, parties, and issues. While a number of volumes (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212452450">Jakubowicz and Sükösd 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212452450">Dobek-Ostrowska et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212452450">Klimkiewicz 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212452450">Petković 2004</xref>) have focused on changes in media systems and policies in this part of the world, less attention has been paid to deep-level comparisons among postcommunist countries using individual-level data linking media audiences with party support.</p>
<p>Consequently, in what follows we focus on three countries from this region—Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic—which after the fall of communism underwent a journey from a condition of state monopoly in both political and media realms to a remarkable proliferation of political parties and media outlets. As we explain, much trial-and-error was involved in both of these processes: in the first case, political entrepreneurs drew from a plethora of social-structural and cultural cleavages to create “offers”—political parties—with enough appeal to enough voters to get and stay elected; in the second case, media entrepreneurs experimented with styles and formats (e.g., broadsheet vs. tabloid) and ideological viewpoints (e.g., well-defined vs. centrist/neutral) to create newspapers, radio stations, and television channels with enough appeal to large enough audiences to allow them to stay in business. There were many failures along the way, but by the middle of the 2000s these new political and media systems began to settle down.</p>
<p>The paper is structured as follows: in the first part we look at the audience fragmentation hypothesis, and specifically at the question of whether this “settling down” resulted in the survival of at least some media outlets catering to ideologically narrow audiences roughly corresponding to party electorates. We present evidence to support this hypothesis: for each country we provide two “maps,” one showing the position of party supporters and another of media audiences in an ideological issue space. In the second part we take up the malaise versus mobilization debate. By choosing a point in time (the mid-2000s) when all three countries were mired in political scandals, we first examine the hypothesis that “democratic malaise,” defined as loss of trust in democratic institutions, can be linked to specific types of media use. Lastly, we consider the “mobilization” side of the debate by examining whether other kinds of media use affected the level of political engagement of Czech, Hungarian, and Polish citizens.</p>

<title>The Parallel Processes of Party and Media System Development</title>
<p>The story of media system development in post-1989 East-Central Europe is one of a truly remarkable transformation, whereby in the span of twenty years strict political control and a relative paucity of choice has given way to unprecedented freedoms and an exuberant variety of programming. Along the way, this transformation was accompanied by rapid technological change and the emergence of new types of media and media delivery methods, starting with cable and satellite television in the 1990s and extending, most recently, to the rise of blogs and social networking web sites that are increasingly important as carriers of information. Last but not least, this change has unfolded in parallel with the development of democratic institutions and democratic cultural norms from what was largely a blank slate twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The transition to democracy and market-based economics that followed the collapse of communism had a powerful impact on media landscapes and on political communication across East-Central Europe. Most fundamentally, it brought about the end of state monopoly in print and broadcasting, and opened up domestic media markets to competition from private enterprise. But managing this process was not an easy task for the region’s new democracies. Apart from the legal, technical, and logistical issues, not to mention political resistance to transforming the old state-run outlets into genuinely “public” services, there was the complex task of drafting the appropriate legislation needed to provide a legal framework for the operation of their new, commercial competitors. In retrospect, much of what transpired was very haphazard, with a “make it up as you go along” quality, but it is worth recalling that in the 1980s commercialization of television broadcasting was still a relatively new phenomenon, even in Western Europe (West Germany, for example, saw its first privately owned television channel go on the air only in 1984).</p>
<p>In developing media policy, one of the first tasks facing the new democracies was to provide the nascent political parties and civic organization with a means of communicating with the wider society for both electoral campaigning and, more broadly, for the purpose of restoring pluralism of opinion in public discourse. In the print realm, this was largely achieved by breaking up the giant, state-owned media enterprises left over from the communist era, such as Poland’s “RSW,” which in the final years of the old regime published 244 different press titles and employed close to 100,000 people, including almost 60 percent of all Polish journalists. As part of the transformation process guided by a newly drafted law and administered by a special “Liquidation Commission,” some newspaper titles were privatized by being handed over to their employees, others were transferred to political parties and civil society organizations, and the remainder sold to the highest bidder, including to foreign investors such as the French <italic>Groupe Hersant</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212452450">Dobek-Ostrowska 1998</xref>: 40). In the electronic realm, there was a complicating technical factor having to do with the scarcity of available broadcasting frequencies and the consequent need for an appropriate regulatory framework. In the Polish case, would-be radio and television entrepreneurs chose not to wait for politicians and policy makers, and so the early 1990s were a time of dizzying proliferation of new media outlets, at first mostly local radio stations operating from low-power transmitters in a “pirate” fashion. Some of these stations ultimately did not survive the rigors of the marketplace, but others, such as <italic>Radio Małopolska Fun</italic> (operating since January 1990 and today called RMF-FM), eventually evolved into major commercial broadcasters with a national reach. Because of higher startup costs, there were initially fewer players on the television side, but the overall pattern was much the same as with radio, with a number of small, unlicensed stations appearing on the air starting in 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212452450">2</xref></sup> This dynamic growth of new media outlets soon attracted the attention of both foreign and domestic investors. Of these perhaps the most widely known, not to mention the most flamboyant, was Nicola Grauso, an associate of Silvio Berlusconi, who by 1993 acquired a controlling stake in thirteen Polish TV stations that featured programming sent in by way of Berlusconi’s <italic>Reteitalia</italic> network, prompting Britain’s <italic>Guardian</italic> to call him the “pirate king of Polish television.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212452450">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to Poland’s free-for-all, the commercialization of electronic media systems in Hungary and the Czech Republic was more sedate, which in part was due to prolonged legislative wrangling over the allocation of frequencies, and in part reflected the hesitation on the part of potential investors concerned about the relatively small size of their media markets (each of these two countries has a population of about ten million, compared to Poland’s thirty-eight). In Hungary’s case, in 1989 the government declared a moratorium on the allocation of broadcasting frequencies, effectively freezing the growth of commercial electronic media for much of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161212452450">Szekfu 1994</xref>). Consequently, Hungary did not see its first privately owned television channels, TV2 and RTL-Klub, go on the air until 1997. In Czechoslovakia, the postcommunist restructuring of the media system was complicated further by political wrangling over the future of the federal state itself, which in due course led to its division (in 1993) into Czech Republic and Slovakia. Prior to that point, of the three television channels of the state-owned broadcaster (ČST), the first one was a “federal” channel transmitted throughout the country, the second one a “national” channel that broadcast in Czech in Czech lands and in Slovak in Slovakia, and the third one transmitted Soviet-sourced programming in Russian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212452450">Noam 1991</xref>: 281). After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the Czech state broadcaster (ČT) retained two of the frequencies and the third one was allocated in 1994, amid much controversy and accusations of favoritism, to a private channel called TV Nova, later joined by another privately owned channel, Prima.</p>
<p>From today’s perspective, these early 1990s battles over the allocation terrestrial broadcasting frequencies seem almost quaint, since the individuals and companies involved in them failed to anticipate the extremely strong growth of cable and satellite systems with their ability to offer hundreds of channels of simultaneous programming. By the early 2000s, the penetration of cable and satellite television, fueled by the rapidly falling cost of consumer electronics, reached almost 70 percent households in Hungary and around 40 percent of households in Poland and the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212452450">Jakubowicz 2007</xref>: 333). And with the price of satellite “Receiver + Antenna + 6 Month Free Subscription” packages dropping to as little as the equivalent of US$100,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161212452450">4</xref></sup> this new technology became available to virtually all demographic groups, including lower-income residents of rural areas, who hitherto were forced to rely exclusively on over-the-air broadcasts.</p>
<p>This technological change, with its proliferation of outlets and consequent fragmentation of the audience, was also not anticipated by the region’s politicians. Having spent much of their own lives under the shadow of communist media monopolies, they seemingly internalized the belief that control of the media—especially television—is one of the attributes of political power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161212452450">5</xref></sup> Consequently, post-1989 attempts to transform state-run media outlets into genuinely independent, public broadcasters with a mission to provide the kind of programming that commercial outlets were unwilling or unable to produce, time and again clashed with political resistance, leading to an almost two-decade-long pattern of so-called media wars waged in all countries of East-Central Europe.</p>
<p>Although the details varied, the conflicts had a number of common elements. One concerned “national broadcasting councils,” whose stated purpose was to provide impartial oversight over the public media. In theory, their members were to be independent individuals appointed by national parliaments, but in practice control over them fell to political parties, which enthusiastically packed the councils with their own appointees, exploiting the public media as vehicles for both political patronage and electoral self-promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212452450">Mungiu-Pippidi 2003</xref>). And then there was ideology. In Hungary and Poland, the ideological roots of conflict over the public media lay in the “pacted” nature of the 1989 political transition, which allowed the former communist parties not only to survive as powerful organizational entities but also to rebrand themselves into democracy- and market-friendly social democrats. This transformation was never accepted as genuine by the ideological right, which was also outraged by the former rulers’ apparent success in avoiding retribution or even accountability for their time in power. As a consequence, in the 1990s the political scene in Hungary and Poland became structured by the conflict between a glibly pragmatic postcommunist left (Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and Poland’s Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]—interested in glossing over the past) and a stern, moralizing anticommunist right (Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and Young Democrats [Fidesz], and Poland’s Solidarity Electoral Action [AWS] and Law and Justice [PiS]—fixated on settling accounts with history). Caught in the middle were social-liberal parties—Poland’s Democratic Union/Freedom Union (UD/UW) and Hungary’s Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), despised by the right for their “let bygones be bygones” attitude to the past and their refusal to join in the anticommunist crusade.</p>
<p>It was this fundamental ideological conflict, not disputes over the specifics of economic or foreign policies, which have dominated electoral competition in both countries well into the 2000s (and in some ways still continue to shape it today), and in many respects the infamous “media wars” were simply one of its aspects. With their righteous zeal and a sense of historic mission, the right in both countries was infuriated by what it saw as the prevalence of left-liberal voices in both print and broadcast media, and sought to correct this imbalance by appointing right-thinking (so to speak) individuals to key journalistic and management positions. Of course the left, for its part, was hardly blameless, in that, following their electoral wins in Poland (1993, 2001) and Hungary (1994, 2002, 2006), the communist successor parties in both countries showed little hesitation in using public radio and television for shameless self-promotion, though perhaps without the holier-than-thou moralizing characteristic of the right.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the Czech case the nature of the conflict was somewhat different owing to that country’s mode of transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime (i.e., through collapse, not negotiation). With an unrepentant and unreformed Communist Party confined to the margins of the political scene, the public Czech Television (ČT) became caught in the clash between a more idealistic, participatory model of democracy favored by the dissident-playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel and a more structured, party-driven model favored, naturally enough, by leaders of the largest political parties keen to divide up the spoils of power—including control of the public media—among themselves. The conflict reached a climax in the fall of 2000, when employees of public television went on strike in protest against partisan meddling in the media, aided by mass public demonstrations in the streets of Prague and encouraging words from President Havel. The events prompted Vaclav Klaus, leader of the right-of-center Civic Democrats (ODS), to utter the much-quoted phrase that the crisis would end either in “victory for normalized democracy” or in the “triumph of Havlocracy,” which he saw as a kind of mob rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161212452450">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why were the region’s politicians so intent on retaining control of the public radio and television channels? For starters, for much of the 1990s the public media were by far the dominant players in their respective markets, with audiences that dwarfed those of the just-emerging privately owned stations. Audience fragmentation came only gradually as cable and satellite gained more subscribers and as operators of these services began to feature ever-increasing variety of specialized, thematic channels. But even after these developments, public television news programs were still able to command large audiences: for example, Polish data from mid-2005 show that the main public channel (TVP1) registered a daily average of 3.2 million viewers for its flagship 7:30 <sc>PM</sc> news broadcast and additional 2.7 million and 2.6 million for the 5:00 <sc>PM</sc> and 10:00 <sc>PM</sc> editions respectively. By comparison, the privately owned TVN claimed about 2 million viewers for its 7:00 <sc>PM</sc> news program while another private station, POLSAT, had about 1.4 million viewers for its 6:45 <sc>PM</sc> program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161212452450">7</xref></sup> Given those large audiences, and given that even in the mid-2000s television news remained the dominant source of election-related information for citizens of Hungary and the Czech Republic (in Poland it was second only to political advertising, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161212452450">Table 1</xref>), the politicians’ motives become easier to understand.</p>

<p>Second, it is worth recalling that at the beginning of the post-1989 transition process, most of East-Central Europe’s new political parties were quite small, with few members and limited organizational structures, making them heavily dependent financially on state subsidies and electorally dependent on the media for contact with potential voters. The sources of this problem lie in the fact that, compared with Western Europe, the region’s party membership figures as percentage of the total electorate were (and still remain) quite low: around 2.8 percent, compared to a West European average of 5.5 percent in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161212452450">Walecki 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212452450">Kopecky 2006</xref>). With few dues-paying members, the parties depend on state subventions ranging from direct funding (whose amount is based on the proportion of seats won in the last election) to various indirect subsides, including free media time (e.g., during recent parliamentary election campaigns Czech political parties received fourteen hours on public TV, divided equally among them) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161212452450">Walecki 2003</xref>). In practice, however, this free media time has proved to be of limited value because the programs—each only a few minutes long—tended to be lumped together into 15- to 20-minute blocs, making them a bit tedious for even the most civic-minded of viewers. Plus, at the beginning of the 1990s the quality of some of these party programs was embarrassingly low, and consequently some people watched them more for their comedic value than for any informational content. As time went on, the quality of this programming improved, but nonetheless there was always the temptation to go beyond it and secure favorable coverage in news programs by either pressuring or co-opting journalists and their bosses. Of course it took two to tango, and indeed from the journalistic side there was also at times the temptation to improve one’s career prospects by serving the powers that be, with sometimes deleterious impact on the quality of journalism and on professional ethics. As a consequence, the history of the past two decades offers a veritable smorgasbord of cases of political pressure being applied to news programming in the public media, with some of the more blatant cases drawing critical attention from the OSCE in its election monitoring reports from Hungary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212452450">OSCE 2002</xref>) and Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212452450">OSCE 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Political Scandals of the Mid-2000s</title>
<p>By the time of the 2005–2006 elections, the temperature of political conflicts in all three countries was as high as ever. In Poland, in the run-up to the 2005 campaign, all signs seemed to point to a major restructuring of the party system. The ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) had been devastated by a corruption and bribery scandal (the so-called Rywin-gate) that broke out in 2003, and opinion polls also began to show sharp increases in support for an agrarian-populist party called “Samoobrona” (Self-Defense) and for a market-liberal party called the Civic Platform (PO). Another new party rising in the polls was Law and Justice (PiS). Started in 2001 by the twin Kaczyński brothers, by 2005 it was poised to win both parliamentary and presidential elections by advocating social solidarity in the economic sphere along with policing measures for fighting corruption that critics saw as a dangerous departure from the standards of Western-style liberal democracy.</p>
<p>The Hungarian party system on the eve of 2006 elections showed no such signs of impending change. As in the case of Poland, Hungary’s post-1989 politics were dominated by the “ex-communists versus ex-anticommunists” divide, but unlike the Polish one, Hungary’s party system was more stable, with electoral competition since the mid-1990s largely focused on just two major players: the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) on the left and Hungarian Civic Union (FIDESZ) on the right. Indeed, the 2006 election promised to be basically a rematch of 2002, when MSZP won by a narrow 46 percent to FiDESZ’s 41 percent of the popular vote. Probably the most memorable aspect of the 2006 campaign was its air of denial of the worsening condition of the country’s public finances, with neither the government nor the opposition prepared to face up to the fact that austerity measures would need to be implemented in the near future. On the contrary, the campaign consisted of the MSZP and FIDESZ trying to outbid each other with promises of even more public spending, which they fully knew to be impossible, and which likely led many voters on all sides to believe that they were being lied to by their politicians. And indeed, when some months after the election (and long after the opinion survey used in this paper was conducted) the MSZP leader was caught on audio tape uttering the memorable phrase that throughout the campaign “we lied morning, noon and night” in order to remain in power, this admission sparked outrage and even riots in the streets of Budapest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212452450">Ilonszki and Kurtan 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Czech elections of 2006 also seemed poised to deliver a major upset to the incumbents. The government coalition, led by the Czech Social-Democratic Party (ČSSD), hung on to power by a one-seat majority in parliament, but with the smaller parties in the coalition threatening to walk out, and with the ČSSD itself having fared disastrously (8.8 percent of the votes) in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, anything seemed possible—all the more so given that the campaign itself was conducted in an atmosphere heavy with scandals involving the ČSSD’s leading politicians, including both a former and a current prime minister, both of which were accused of links with organized crime. The scandal reached its zenith a few days before the elections when a secret report by the head of the police organized crime unit, which accused prime minister Jiri Paroubek not just of links with the mafia but also of pedophilia, was leaked to the press. Despite—or perhaps because of—this leak (indeed, many voters may well have suspected that the opposition Civic Democratic Party [ODS] was behind this heavy-handed attempt to discredit its rival and turned against it), in the actual election the ČSSD suffered only a narrow loss of 32 percent to ODS’s 35 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161212452450">Plecita-Vlachova and Stegmaier 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Mapping Party Supporters and Media Audiences in the Mid-2000s: Data and Results</title>
<p>In trying to make sense of the role the media played in the overheated political atmosphere of those years, the first step is to visualize the sizes and ideological characteristics of the major outlets’ audiences in relation to party electorates. The Polish data presented below come from the 2005 Polish National Election Survey (PGSW), to which the present authors were able to add a number of media-related questions. Identical questions were then asked in national random sample surveys commissioned during the 2006 parliamentary election campaigns in Hungary and the Czech Republic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1940161212452450">8</xref></sup> Specifically, each survey contained a battery of thirteen policy-related questions asked on an 11-point scale. For each question, respondents were shown a card that described the two polar positions, as in the example below:</p>

<p>Turning to the right side of each diagram, we see a pattern suggesting that television news programs on both public and private channels have both the largest audiences and cast the widest ideological net (i.e., the group mean for these audiences is close to the center of each diagram). The situation with commercial radio is much the same (large, catch-all audiences), but with newspapers we see some differences in that daily tabloids tend to appeal to a broad spectrum of readers while broadsheets and opinion weeklies have more ideologically defined audiences. Overall then, on the basis of the above data we can conclude the following: (1) in the mid-2000s in all three countries television news on both public and commercial channels continued to attract large and politically diverse audiences; (2) as to newspapers, daily mass-market tabloids likewise succeeded in securing large, catch-all–type reader bases; (3) although there is some evidence of ideological self-selection of audiences, it appears to be confined to the smaller, relatively high-brow outlets, such as broadsheet newspapers and weeklies with ambitions of opinion leadership, as well as some niche broadcasters, such as Poland’s Radio Maryja, catering to ultra-traditionalist Catholics. In short, although some smaller outlets are “preaching to the converted” (in some cases, literally), the larger ones do not, leaving open the possibility that media exposure may have important consequences for political attitudes and behavior. It is to this question that we turn next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1940161212452450">
<title>Malaise and Mobilization: The Background</title>
<p>In the long-running malaise versus mobilization debate, some studies have linked media use, especially the heavily reliance on television, to various symptoms of the former, including erosion of social capital, growing levels of public cynicism, disenchantment with democracy, and disengagement from the public sphere, as evidenced by declining election turnouts and diminishing involvement in civic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212452450">Robinson 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212452450">Cappella and Jamieson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212452450">Brehm 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212452450">Putnam 1995</xref>). Other scholars have reported evidence for “virtuous circles” of influence between media use and political engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212452450">Norris 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212452450">Livingstone and Markham 2008</xref>) and political trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212452450">Avery 2009</xref>). Still others have argued that malaise and mobilization effects may depend more on media content rather than form, pointing to different attitudinal and behavioral consequences resulting from the reading of broadsheet newspapers versus newspapers in general, or watching television news versus television in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212452450">Newton 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of East-Central Europe, we have some anecdotal evidence of “malaise” effects prompted by media-hyped political scandals that had deleterious impact on public confidence in elected officials and on approval of democracy itself. In Poland, the most notorious was the 2003 so-called Rywin-gate scandal, in which a lobbyist linked to the then-ruling communist successor party approached a commercial media company with a proposition of a multimillion-dollar payment in exchange for the passage of legislation favorable to the company. The scandal eventually led to the formation of a parliamentary commission of inquiry whose televised hearings gripped the nation for much of 2003. The commission’s revelations of deep-seated government corruption had a dramatic impact on citizens’ trust in political institutions and in the political system as whole: as the hearings progressed, answers to survey questions about satisfaction with the way democracy functioned in Poland fell to an unprecedented 20 percent of respondents, with 70 percent expressing dissatisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1940161212452450">11</xref></sup> Hungary experienced a similar moment in 2006, when Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany (MSZP) was caught on audiotape admitting that in the election campaign he had been “lying morning, noon and night” and was aided and abetted by the media in doing so. The release of the recording led to a crash of public confidence in the government and several days of riots in the streets of Budapest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161212452450">Schopflin 2006</xref>), which itself was ironic given that Gyurcsany simply dared to voice a deep political truth left unspoken even in Western democracies.</p>
<p>So much for malaise, but what about mobilization? One outstanding example of the latter is the phenomenon of Poland’s Radio Maryja (Radio Virgin Mary). Founded in 1991, Radio Maryja is now part of a major media conglomerate whose outlets also include a daily newspaper (<italic>Nasz Dziennik</italic>) and a television channel (TV Trwam). Although it is sometimes argued that Radio Maryja, under the leadership of its founder, Father Rydzyk, has acquired some characteristics of a religious cult, it does enjoy support among a significant segment of the Catholic clergy. Its programming consists of a mixture of religious services, call-in shows, and nationalist, xenophobic political commentary inundating listeners with conspiracy theories in which freemasons, Jews, international bankers, foreign companies, the European Union, liberals, progressive Catholics, and assorted free-thinkers are identified as threats to the nation and its traditional values. Although its reach is comparatively small (about 2 percent share, or one million regular listeners<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1940161212452450">12</xref></sup>), Radio Maryja’s overwhelmingly rural, elderly (70 percent are more than sixty years old) listeners have acquired a reputation for following the station’s political endorsements<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1940161212452450">13</xref></sup> and, even more importantly, for actually showing up at the polls at election time. Against the backdrop of low turnouts and high voter volatility, this group of voters became a prize keenly sought after by right-wing politicians, giving the radio considerable influence on the Polish political scene during the election campaigns of 2005 and 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212452450">Jasiewicz 2008</xref>). Furthermore, there is some evidence suggesting that regular listening to Radio Maryja leads to other forms of social and political mobilization, such as participation in rallies and demonstrations, individualized contacting of politicians, joining of grassroots organizational structures (the so-called Families of Radio Maryja), and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212452450">Burdziej 2008</xref>). Given that Polish society is characterized by generally low levels of social capital,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1940161212452450">14</xref></sup> the Radio Maryja phenomenon is truly exceptional; however, it must be borne in mind that it mobilizes people to action mainly through negative emotions, namely fear and hostility toward outsiders, making the interpersonal capital it generates rather more “unsocial” than “social” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212452450">Levi 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212452450">Chambers and Kopstein 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>But do the above expectations hold up in the light of available empirical evidence? Quantitative studies of media effects in the new democracies of East-Central Europe are still in their infancy, but there are data from Hungary and Poland showing that certain kinds of media use—specifically, exposure to “quality” press and to television news—has a positive impact on political knowledge, support for democratic values, and certain kinds of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212452450">Schmitt-Beck and Voltmer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212452450">Tworzecki and Semetko 2010</xref>). However, there is also evidence that East Europeans, having learned during the communist period to mistrust their strictly censored and propagandistic media, have no trouble identifying political bias in media messages and are not easily swayed by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212452450">Popescu and Toka 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212452450">Mickiewicz 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that in postauthoritarian settings there are definite limits to the ability of mass communications to influence political attitudes and behavior. In order to advance this debate further, we test some propositions resulting from the malaise versus mobilization debate in the postcommunist context. Specifically, we hypothesize that patterns of media use, even after controlling for interest in politics and for various socioeconomic background characteristics, will have a systematic and predictable impact on respondents’ (1) trust in political institutions and (2) various forms of political engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1940161212452450">
<title>Malaise and Mobilization: Data and Results</title>
<p>Given the number of variables simultaneously at play in the postcommunist transitions, the question of the impact of media exposure—in the sense of promoting malaise versus mobilization—is very much an open one, and can lead to several hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1940161212452450" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, expanding on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212452450">Putnam’s (1995)</xref> argument, it can be hypothesized that heavy consumption of entertainment-focused media products, such as tabloid newspapers, leads to diminished involvement in public affairs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, it can be hypothesized that a possible consequence of extensive exposure to public affairs content in an atmosphere heavy with political scandals could lead to “malaise” as defined by the Watergate-era classics of this literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212452450">Robinson 1976</xref>), that is, to the loss of trust in national political institutions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>And third, in direct opposition to the previous hypothesis but in keeping with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212452450">Schmitt-Beck and Voltmer (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212452450">Tworzecki and Semetko (2010)</xref>, exposure to “quality” press could enhance readers’ and viewers’ political sophistication and their understanding of democratic procedures and thus, by extension, enhance their trust and engagement with political institutions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To investigate these connections, we look first at the issue of political trust. In all three countries, the dependent variable was constructed in exactly the same way: as an additive index of responses to questions about respondent’s trust in (1) members of the national parliament, (2) the government (i.e., the prime minister and cabinet members), (3) the president, (4) the state bureaucracy, and (5) the courts and judicial system. The independent variables consisted of questions about media use (with outlets grouped by category: television news, broadsheet newspaper, tabloid newspapers, and news weeklies), interest in politics, and basic demographic data. The results of regression analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1940161212452450">Table 3</xref> and reveal that after the controls are added in, none of the media use variables remain statistically significant. In other words, no impact on trust in political institutions—either positive or negative—can be observed as a consequence of media use. While one should always be leery of making far-reaching conclusions on the basis of isolated opinion surveys (even three of them, from different countries), given that in each country these data were collected during a period of time heavy with political scandals, we believe that an across-the-board absence of relationships goes a significant way toward disproving the malaise hypothesis.</p>

<p>We turn next to the question of how media exposure affected respondents’ political engagement in the context of just-concluded parliamentary election campaigns (recall that each survey was taken in the immediate postelection period). In each country, the dependent variable was constructed in an identical fashion, as an additive index of responses to questions about (1) turning out to vote, (2) signing a petition, (3) donating money, (4) displaying banners, stickers, and posters, (5) collecting signatures, (6) collecting money, (7) attending election meetings or rallies, (8) talking with friends about the election, and (9) taking part in other political activities. And since there existed the possibility of a self-selection effect (whereby people with an interest in politics are likely to <italic>both</italic> follow the news media <italic>and</italic> be politically engaged) we added a control variable for political interest. The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1940161212452450">Table 4</xref> reveal that in all three countries there is a strong positive effect on political engagement resulting from exposure to broadsheet newspapers and weekly news magazines. This findings hold even after controlling for political interest and for socioeconomic background characteristics commonly associated with political participation, such as education and income. No relationship can be observed from exposure to television news or to tabloid newspapers (except in Poland, where tabloid newspaper readership has a statistically significant and, contrary to the “tabloidization” hypothesis, positive effect on engagement). These findings are especially revealing given that, as we showed in the previous section, broadsheets and opinion weeklies have more ideologically defined audiences than either tabloids or television news, not to mention that they also tend to appeal to consumers with higher socioeconomic status. As far as political engagement is concerned, it thus appears that use of “quality” press can be a mobilizing force even for individuals already well-endowed with resources typically associated with participatory behavior.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In sum, we investigated, first, whether the transition from state monopoly to pluralism in political and media markets in countries of East-Central Europe led to the fragmentation of media audiences into ideologically self-selected groups. We found that this fragmentation was limited mostly to the “quality” press and not to tabloids or television news. Second, we were interested in the relationship between different types of media—some with heavy public affairs content, others focused more on entertainment—and political trust and political engagement. The question was whether some types of media use are related to symptoms of so-called malaise, while others lead to political mobilization. In the case of trust in all three countries we observed no relationship, positive or negative, between attitudes about trust in government and various media sources. By contrast, the use of “quality” press displayed strong positive relationships with engagement in all three countries even after controlling for political interest and individual resources. Our results show that some kinds of media use—in this case, exposure to outlets that feature serious and in-depth analysis of public affairs—can indeed have a positive impact on participatory behavior in new democracies.</p>
<p>These findings are of course tentative given the cross-sectional design of our study. Research on the malaise versus mobilization debate would be significantly enhanced by panel designs that would provide the opportunity to assess stability and change at the individual level over the course of parliamentary election campaigns in each country.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The region of East-Central Europe, where the processes of political and media system transformation are still ongoing, offers an exceptionally rich laboratory for future research on political and media systems and the concepts of media effects that have been central to much political communication research over the past few decades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161212452450">Semetko 2007</xref> for a review of key concepts). Our research suggests that several well-known theories of media influence developed by scholars of advanced democracies can be addressed with empirical data from the newer political systems, and our evidence shows that there is support for some of these theories but not others. In this final section, we take a broader view and consider the importance of political communications research in the study of democratic development.</p>
<p>The three cases examined here—Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic—have been generally seen as the “success stories” of postcommunist democratization. However, stories coming out of these countries in recent years seem like something out of the realm of rather bad political fiction: identical twin brothers for a time simultaneously serving as president and prime minster in Poland, the Polish president’s death in a plane crash during a chaotic trip to Russia, the constitutional demolition derby in Hungary, the rise of an unusual Czech political party headed by a celebrity TV talk show host and famous for a pin-up calendar featuring its female parliamentary candidates in lingerie. But the truth is that each country did experience its own brand of political earthquake: In Poland between 2005 and 2007 the winning party attempted to transform the constitutional order in the direction of “illiberal” democracy by short-circuiting the system of checks and by subjecting the media to heavy political pressure. Although this attempt failed when its proponents were voted out of power in 2007, much the same thing was then attempted in Hungary after 2010 (with, as of this writing, still uncertain results). Meanwhile the Czech political system, once widely expected by scholars to quickly settle into boring respectability, is now derided by critics as a “rotting partitocracy”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1940161212452450">15</xref></sup> gripped by periodic convulsions involving accusations of corruption in high places.</p>
<p>But these dramatic and sometimes tragic developments beg the question: what theories and concepts in political science could have possibly led us to anticipate them? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161212452450">Ulfelder (2012)</xref> has argued, theories linking democratic consolidation and stabilization to membership in international organizations (and specifically the EU, of which the three have been members since 2004) do not seem to be of much help. Neither are theories linking democratic stability to economic growth, such as the supposedly “iron rule” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212452450">Przeworski et al. 2000</xref>) that democratic transitions in countries with per capita GDP of at least $6000 are virtually guaranteed to succeed. Or, for that matter, theories emphasizing the number of successful turnovers of power (of which there were several in each of the three countries) since the transition to democracy.</p>
<p>But what about theories of political communications? Was there anything in the nature of the media systems, the structure of the audiences, or the content of media messages that undermined democratic consolidation? One potentially fruitful line of inquiry could extend this article’s investigation of connections between party electorates and media audiences in the direction of linking media consumption patterns (especially the so-called echo chamber effects, where people read, listen to, or watch only those outlets that reinforce their political views) to ideological rigidity and, ultimately, the propensity to vote for radical, antisystem candidates and parties. Another useful approach may turn instead to television’s emphasis on personalities, which has long been recognized by political pundits and scholars around the world as having important implications for the electoral futures of leaders, candidates, and parties. In newly democratizing settings, where political parties are still in early stages of development and arguably still have not crossed the Weberian “threshold of depersonalization,” the potential effects of the media’s focus on personalities could be particularly significant. Whatever other factors may have been at play in the recent crises of democracy in East Central Europe, a plausible case can be made that these political systems were shaken to their foundations by colorful, outsized personalities—the Kaczyński brothers, Viktor Orbán, and Radek John—who succeeded, either inadvertently or by design, in cutting through the everyday cacophony of media messages. But the flip side, given the persistent organizational weakness of parties, is that these outsized personalities have also helped to structure the political scene since, in many important ways, politics in this part of the world still revolves around leaders instead of being defined by impersonal, institutional mechanisms. With the rapid spread of new technologies (blogs, social media) that facilitate audience self-selection, the potential for both echo chamber and personality effects could be even more magnified, so studies of communication linkages between parties and the public could be especially illuminating.</p>
<p>In short, as we have argued in this article, the processes of party system and media system development have been and will remain closely linked. In the context of election campaigns and referendums, as well as in routine nonelectoral periods, political parties and movements will continue to rely heavily on the media, both online and offline, not just to communicate with potential supporters but perhaps also to lock them into ideological echo chambers that drown out discordant opinions and facts. Personalities will continue to matter too, especially in the age of television augmented by the power of social media, and especially given the persistent weakness of parties in the East Central European region. Therefore, any new research into these party systems will do well to take into account the role played by media systems and political communications in democratic consolidation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they would have reached much the same conclusion if they looked for guidance to contemporary Western Europe. In 1980s Italy, for example, the public channels were allocated among the major political parties—Raiuno was controlled by the Christian Democrats, Raidue by the Socialists, and Raitre by the Communist Party—and this arrangement was hardly unique at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212452450">Noam 1991</xref>, 150–51).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in Hungry and Poland supporters of the communist successor parties—MSZP and SLD—are on the economic right (!), reflecting the fact that these parties embraced market reforms, and standing in sharp contrast to the hardline Czech communist successor party (KSCM), whose supporters are located at the far left of the economic dimension.</p>
