<abstract>
<p>We studied environmental action and its predictors in a multi-scalar context of climate change politics. We asked how belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and knowledge predict people’s engagement in environmental action by testing two alternative structural equation models (SEM). In one of these models all these factors directly predicted climate-friendly action, and in the other the effect of political trust, post-materialist values and climate change knowledge on climate-friendly action was mediated by belief in climate change. The models were tested with Eurobarometer 69.2 survey data of adult people living in Finland (<italic>N</italic> = 1,004). The SEM revealed that belief in climate change mediates the effect of post-material values, trust and knowledge on climate-friendly action. It is therefore important to recognize the role of belief in the public understanding of large-scale environmental problems. These results help political authorities to develop policies to encourage people’s engagement in climate-friendly action.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In this article we study the connection between the public understanding of science and action related to that understanding, by exploring the prerequisites for people’s engagement in environmental action from the perspective of the global environmental problem of climate change. We analyze the Eurobarometer data consisting of the adult Finnish population using structural equation modeling in order to find the dependencies between environmental action, belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and knowledge. We focus on participation in action aiming to mitigate climate change.</p>
<p>Climate change is a complex, abstract, statistically explained, and perhaps the most catastrophic environmental problem caused by the everyday actions of millions of people (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511410268">IPCC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511410268">Stern, 2007</xref>). In other words, it is a challenging multi-scalar environmental problem. While people act and cause CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on a local scale, climate occurs on a global scale, and the impacts of changed climate are encountered, again, on the local scale, in other localities. These local and global scales differ from each other in ontological terms (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511410268">Yaneva, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511410268">Chapura, 2009</xref>), a fact which makes it challenging to people to comprehend the problem and, especially, to become motivated to take action to solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511410268">Bickerstaff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511410268">Poortinga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511410268">Lorenzoni and Hulme, 2009</xref>). Therefore, in this article we ask what makes people initiate environmental action aiming at slowing down global climate change.</p>
<p>Even though climate is a global phenomenon, the mitigation of climate change requires changes at the grass-roots level, in individuals’ behaviour (cf., for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511410268">Spaargaren and Mol, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511410268">Clayton and Myers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511410268">Steg and Vlek, 2009</xref>). Yet, even though environmental policies encourage individuals to take action themselves, in practice this approach has encountered difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511410268">Nordlund and Garvill, 2002</xref>). Citizens seldom engage personally in climate-friendly action. In Finland, for example, climate-friendly behavior has been emphasized in many sectors of society such as energy saving, recycling, and public transport. Despite such eagerness only a few Finns take part in environmental-friendly action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511410268">Haikkola and Rissotto, 2007</xref>). In this study, we focus on people’s actual engagement in individual climate-friendly action, such as choosing a climate-friendly mode of transportation, reducing consumption or recycling.</p>
<p>Remarkable changes in the behavior of individuals are an important prerequisite for resolving both local and global environmental problems. However, local and global environmental problems differ remarkably regarding how people perceive their seriousness, acuteness and very existence. From this perspective, climate-friendly action is especially challenging; even if people consider climate change one of the most important threats facing our planet, so far significant alterations in individual and collective behavior have not been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662511410268">York and Gossard, 2004</xref>). One possible reason why so little has been done is the fact that climate change is an uncertain, abstract and ambiguous scientific phenomenon. People cannot perceive climate change directly, unlike cutting down a forest site, but people can interpret certain environmental changes as indicators of climate change, and their interpretation can be encouraged or blurred, for example by information they gather via media news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511410268">Heath and Gifford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511410268">Etkin and Ho, 2007</xref>). Recent incoherencies in the calculation methods for climate effects of human behaviors and contradictory results concerning the climate impact of meat production, for example, have made laypeople’s loss of trust in natural scientists’ messages even worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511410268">Pitesky et al., 2009</xref>). In this article we test the idea that because of the abstract and complex nature of climate change, people’s belief in the acceleration of climate change as a human-caused problem is a key motivator to their willingness to act, and in this respect people’s climate-friendly action differs from engagement in action that builds on direct observations and that is supposed to have concrete, local environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511410268">Paloniemi and Vainio, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We begin by reviewing the existing research on belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and climate change knowledge before turning to our empirical study and its findings.</p>
<sec id="section2-0963662511410268">
<title>Belief in climate change</title>
<p>Climate change is in many respects different from other environmental problems. First of all, climate is a statistical concept. Climate is a complex system and climate change is a non-linear and unpredictable process, which makes it difficult to notice and especially to prove through personal experience. In addition, climate has always been changing. Since the scientific models portray climate change as a complex and uncertain phenomenon, laypeople find it difficult to put together the information on climate change and to evaluate the risks and consequences of possible hazards caused by the changes in climate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511410268">Swim et al., 2009</xref>). Climate change and the acceleration of climate change as a human-caused problem are two different issues that become easily blurred among the public. Therefore, when studying climate change the role of belief that climate change is actually accelerating has to be explored in more detail.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs play an important role in the engagement in climate-friendly action. In the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511410268">Dietz et al. (2007)</xref> environmental beliefs and worldviews mediated the effect of values and other factors in explaining the support for climate-friendly action. Similarly, belief in climate change has been associated with engaging in climate-friendly action among forest owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511410268">Blennow and Persson, 2009</xref>). As a contrast, beliefs that a global climate change is not occurring and that it is not caused by people have been associated with environmental apathy and a perception that individual action has no significant effect on the large-scale outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511410268">Heath and Gifford, 2006</xref>). When people believe that they have no control over climate change, it facilitates denial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511410268">Gifford et al., 2008</xref>). It is also documented that behind such a tendency there is a phenomenon called system justification, a motivation to perceive the current system as fair, legitimate, beneficial and stable, leading to a desire to maintain and protect the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511410268">Jost and Banaji, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511410268">Jost et al., 2002</xref>). System justification tendencies are reported to be associated with greater denial of environmental realities and less commitment to pro-environmental action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511410268">Feygina et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662511410268">
<title>Post-materialist values</title>
<p>Recently, the public concern for environmental issues has increased. This increased concern for the environment has been explained by some researchers by a change in values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511410268">Inglehart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511410268">Nordlund and Garvill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511410268">Barr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511410268">Dietz et al., 2007</xref>). According to the famous theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511410268">Ronald Inglehart (1997)</xref>, people value most those issues that correspond to their unsatisfied needs. He argues that since people living in the wealthy nations do not any more have to focus on satisfying immediate material needs, they have been able to shift their focus from endorsing material values to altruistic and non-material values. Since food and other material commodities are abundant in wealthy nations, people’s relationship with nature, which is the source of these commodities, has changed. Nature is not any more perceived as the source of exploitation but instead something to be protected and to be cared for. This fundamental shift in values has been called post-materialism. Thus, in this article we study the possibility that the public understanding of climate change is explained by individuals’ value preferences. Climate change is a problem that reflects the relationship between nature and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511410268">Buckeley, 2000</xref>), and individuals’ preferences for either material or post-material values reflect the same relationship.</p>
<p>Inglehart’s post-materialist argument as the main source of environmental concern has been contested by some researchers: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511410268">Dunlap et al. (1993)</xref> found that citizens living in developing countries were no less concerned about the environment than citizens from industrialized countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511410268">Brechin and Kempton (1994)</xref> argue that not only the level of economic development, but also other sources, such as direct exposure to environmental degradation, the political and institutional framework in a community, and the effects of the mass media, do encourage concern for the environment (cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511410268">Gökşen et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511410268">Inglehart (1995)</xref> has also acknowledged that post-materialist values together with the exposure to environmental problems only partially explain environmental concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662511410268">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>Because of the global nature of climate change, people have a strong tendency to think that societal and political authorities have the responsibility to resolve the problem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511410268">Buckeley, 2000</xref>). Moreover, scientists and experts suggest climate-mitigating actions and solutions that involve both individuals and policy makers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511410268">Stern, 2007</xref>). One of the reasons why individuals do not engage themselves in climate-friendly action is the perceived (dis)trust in societal and political actors and the perceived lack of shared responsibility to engage in collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511410268">Bickerstaff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511410268">Poortinga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511410268">Lorenzoni and Hulme, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study we focus on trust in political actors. We define political trust as a confidence that political institutions are able to function well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0963662511410268">Tyler, 2003</xref>). In the context of people’s engagement in climate-mitigating actions, trust entails a risk in which people expect reciprocal efforts and dutiful behavior from all parties (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662511410268">Robinson, 1996</xref>). Currently, there is a trend of diminishing political trust in the wealthy countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511410268">Pharr et al., 2000</xref>). Diminished political trust has often been recognized as one reason for the low level of citizens’ engagement in action for the improvement of the common good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511410268">Dalton, 2005</xref>). However, in the context of environmental issues, people tend to mistrust governments, businesses, industry and sometimes experts even if at the same time they assign to these institutions and their representatives a great deal of responsibility for controlling environmental risks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963662511410268">Zwick and Renn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511410268">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that trust can have a negative, passivating function in environmental action. A high level of trust and satisfaction can inhibit personal action by transferring the sense of responsibility from the self to politicians and experts. On the other hand, a low level of trust and a disappointment in policy makers and experts can lead to a situation in which people look for alternative ways to influence the status quo. In fact, distrust in policy makers has been shown to increase engagement in non-institutional action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511410268">Kaase, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511410268">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511410268">Lubell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511410268">Paloniemi and Vainio, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511410268">Poortinga and Pidgeon (2003)</xref> suggest that there may be a healthy type of distrust, what they call “critical trust,” which allows a personal engagement in environmental action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511410268">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006</xref>). For example, people who report high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for the acceleration of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511410268">Kellstedt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662511410268">
<title>Knowledge of climate change</title>
<p>The perception of climate change as a serious problem and the likelihood of taking personal action are associated with knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511410268">Sundblad et al., 2007</xref>). Knowledge is reported to be linked to higher levels of environmental concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511410268">Mohai, 1985</xref>) and is one of the strongest predictors of protest behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511410268">Finkel et al., 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511410268">Lubell et al. (2006)</xref> found in their study that people with higher levels of perceived knowledge were more likely to participate in air policy activism.</p>
<p>The mass media has a significant responsibility to inform the public about climate change. The media creates social representations of climate change, which are shaped by political interests, ideologies and the interests of the readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511410268">Carvalho, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511410268">Höijer, 2010</xref>). Mass media appears to make a positive contribution to public understanding, as well as to perpetuate some popular misconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511410268">Stamm et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, the media has conveyed the image of scientific uncertainty in different ways, such as emphasizing certainty and simplicity in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963662511410268">Weingart et al., 2000</xref>) and uncertainty in the US (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511410268">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511410268">Antilla, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511410268">Carvalho, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, people are found to have limited understanding of the human role in the acceleration of global warming (see the review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511410268">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006</xref>). It has been reported that the public has a tendency to dissociate themselves from the causes of, impacts on and responsibility for tackling climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662511410268">Whitmarsh, 2009</xref>). One of the reasons why the public has a limited understanding of climate change lies in the nature of scientific knowledge itself. Scientific knowledge regarding the human role in accelerating climate change is constantly expanding, and as a result, the emerging knowledge becomes inherently uncertain and complex. As a result of contradictions and uncertainties in scientific knowledge, increasing knowledge of climate change does not necessarily lead to an increased concern for global warming among the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511410268">Kellstedt et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore uncertainty towards climate change can also be a product of increased knowledge rather than of ignorance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662511410268">Whitmarsh, 2009</xref>). In fact, previous research has similarly noted that attitudes towards science issues become more discriminating as knowledge increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511410268">Evans and Durant, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511410268">Bibbings, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, these theoretical perspectives – belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and knowledge – described above have their unique connections to pro-environmental action. Next, we will present a research design that we have developed to simultaneously test these perspectives empirically in the multi-scalar context of climate change action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662511410268">
<title>The research question and hypotheses of the study</title>
<p>In this study, we ask how belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and knowledge predict people’s engagement in action aiming to mitigate climate change. In order to answer that question, we tested two alternative models. They are based on our previous study of the environmental political participation of young people at the local context where these factors directly predicted interest in engaging in environmental action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511410268">Paloniemi and Vainio, 2011</xref>). According to the challenges coming from the multi-scalar nature of climate change as described above, the aspect of belief is added to these models in the current study.</p>
<p>First, we tested the Climate Change Action Model (CAM), where belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust in politics and climate change knowledge predict climate-friendly action among individuals (<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>).</p>
<p>Because of the particular nature of climate change as compared to other environmental threats, such as its multi-scalar nature, difficulty in perceiving climate change directly and the controversial nature of climate change information, we hypothesized that any variable has to be mediated by belief in climate change in order to increase climate-friendly action. Therefore we tested the Climate Change Action Path Model (CAMP), where the effect of post-materialist values, trust and climate change knowledge on climate-friendly action is mediated by belief in climate change (<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>).</p>

The data were collected in 2008; its special focus was on values, consciousness about climate change and attitudes towards climate change. The sample was drawn from those citizens who were 15 years or older (which in Finland was <italic>N</italic> = 4,353,495). The sampling method was multi-stage stratified random sampling. The questionnaire was collected by interviewing the participants face-to-face in people’s homes in the appropriate national language.

<p>For calculating the descriptives and the correlation coefficients, the categories for Sex: 1 = <italic>male</italic>, 2 = <italic>female</italic>.

</table-wrap>
<p><italic>Belief in climate change</italic> was operationalized following the current scientific understandings of climate change that (1) climate change is a process accelerated and possibly also slowed down by the actions of people; (2) it is a serious problem discussed accordingly also in the media; and (3) one essential reason for the changes in the global climate is the percentage of greenhouse gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide), in the atmosphere. The belief in climate change was measured by asking the participants if they agreed or disagreed with three statements: “Climate change is an unstoppable process, we cannot do anything about it,” “The seriousness of climate change has been exaggerated,” and “Emission of CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) has only a marginal impact on climate change.” The participants were asked to answer on a four-point scale from 1 (<italic>totally agree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>totally disagree</italic>). In other words, because the statements actually measured an agreement with a “non-belief” in climate change, high values represented a high belief in climate change.</p>
<p><italic>Post-materialist values</italic> were operationalized following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511410268">Inglehart (1971)</xref> by exploring different aspects found empirically to indicate post-materialism. The measure included three attitudinal items: “Immigrants contribute a lot to Finland,” “The State intervenes too much in our lives,” “Nowadays there is too much tolerance. Criminals should be punished more severely.” Four-point scales from 1 (<italic>totally agree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>totally disagree</italic>) were used. To measure high post-materialism, the values of the first question were reversed.</p>
<p><italic>Trust in politics</italic> was measured by asking the participants how much trust they have in four institutions: political parties, the Finnish Government, the European Union and the United Nations. For each institution, the participants were asked to respond by choosing between 1 (<italic>tend to trust</italic>) and 2 (<italic>tend not to trust</italic>). The values were reversed so that high values represented a high trust. Of these four institutions, the mean of the first two was used as indicating trust in national politics and the mean of the last two was used as indicating trust in international politics (because dichotomous variables are not recommended in AMOS, the software used in the study).</p>
<p><italic>Climate change knowledge</italic> was measured based on the respondents’ self-evaluation about their own knowledge. It was operationalized with three items: “Personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about [the different causes of climate change; the different consequences of climate change; ways in which we can fight climate change]?” Four-point scales from 1 (<italic>very well informed</italic>) to 4 (<italic>not informed at all</italic>) were used. The values were reversed so that high values indicated high perceived knowledge of climate change.</p>
<p><italic>Engagement in climate-friendly action</italic> was measured by asking the participants which of eight actions have they personally taken: (1) reducing their consumption of energy at home; (2) reducing their consumption of water at home; (3) separating most of their waste for recycling; (4) reducing the consumption of disposables; (5) reducing the use of the car by car-sharing or using one’s own car more efficiently; (6) choosing an environmentally friendly way of transportation; (7) where possible avoid taking short-haul flights; and (8) switching to an energy supplier or tariff supplying a greater share of energy from renewable sources than the previous one. Since the answers were dichotomous (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) the mean of the first four items was used as a measure of “the reduction of energy consumption” and the mean of the last four items was used as a measure of “finding climate-friendly alternatives.”</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the study increase our comprehension regarding how the public understanding of climate change is associated with individual climate-friendly action. Moreover, they shed light on different prerequisites for environmental action concerning the politics of multi-scalar environmental problems, and accordingly they suggest that policy makers and facilitators should increase their sensitivity when encouraging people’s competence to take environmental action. Increasing knowledge alone is not enough in order to motivate people to act climate-friendly. According to the findings, the belief that climate change is a human-caused problem acts in a key role in people’s engagement in climate-friendly action.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>belief in climate change</italic> as a human-caused problem is an essential element in predicting people’s pro-climate action. It predicted climate-action directly in the Climate Change Action Model (CAM), but what is even more interesting is the mediating role of belief in predicting the action, as presented in our Climate Change Action Path Model (CAMP). <italic>Post-materialist values</italic> and <italic>climate change knowledge</italic> which were not directly connected to climate-friendly action were connected to action when explained with the <italic>mediating role of belief in climate change</italic>. In other words, the post-materialist values and knowledge of climate change do not work if an individual does not believe that human beings have a role in the acceleration of climate change.</p>
<p>This finding about the importance of belief in climate change encourages us to take more seriously the differences in the local and global contexts when studying environmental participation and pro-environmental action. When scaling up from the local to the global scale and again back to the local scale, the perceptions and positions of people change remarkably. These changes are not something to overlook but should be understood better in order to increase the opportunities for people to make an environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511410268">Yaneva, 2005</xref>). Complex and multi-scalar phenomena are much more difficult to comprehend than concrete local questions. Thus, the concepts that may explain environmental action at the local scale do not explain it as such in a more complex context (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511410268">Paloniemi and Vainio, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We also found support for the findings that <italic>distrust</italic> in the current political system encourages people to take non-institutional action themselves, as stated in some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511410268">Kaase, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511410268">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511410268">Lubell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511410268">Paloniemi and Vainio, 2011</xref>). In CAM trust in politics decreased climate-friendly action directly, and in CAMP this negative connection was mediated by belief in climate change.</p>
<p>The result that trust in politics in the context of climate change action decreases belief in climate change and personal climate-friendly action is relevant in order to explain why so little is done in order to slow down climate change. The finding implies that the mechanism of a system justification seems to be operating in the environmental context in which it has just begun to be studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511410268">Feygina et al., 2010</xref>). According to the system justification theory, people have a tendency to believe that societal structures reproduce fairness and resolve global environmental problems in particular when individuals do not perceive that they have any control over them even if in reality these societal structures maintain a negative status quo. Climate change is an archetype of this kind of situation. Climate change is unfair towards populations, groups and species that are less responsible but more vulnerable to the changes of climate: for example women in developing countries, or species living in the Arctic. Moreover, the direct influences of changed action are often <italic>de facto</italic> small, while the problem is caused by the outcome of uncountable numbers of acts producing the Western lifestyle.</p>
<sec id="section13-0963662511410268">
<title>How to encourage climate-friendly action?</title>
<p>Our study suggests a number of relevant ideas for increasing people’s interest in environmental action in the future. First, as our study demonstrates, it is crucial to combat those beliefs that hinder environmental action. If the public is able to perceive environmentalism as a way of upholding (rather than threatening) cherished societal institutions and practices, it may be possible to transform resistance and inaction into constructive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511410268">Feygina et al., 2010</xref>). In order to better understand the function of system justification in the context of the public understanding of climate change, we have to acknowledge that climate change <italic>is</italic> a difficult problem to solve. There are no such arenas where individual citizens could directly participate in political decision-making to solve the global problem, but the solutions for mitigating climate change are an outcome of numerous small decisions that change everyday life practices. Therefore, it is also essential to help people to perceive the role of smaller decisions as a part of global problem-solving.</p>
<p>In addition, post-materialist values are shown to be an important element behind the interest in the environmental political action of adults when mediated by belief in climate change on the global scale as presented in the CAMP model. However, post-materialist values only partially explain environmental concern, because concern exists not only in industrialized countries, but also in developing nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511410268">Dunlap et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511410268">Gökşen et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, environmental concern has also been seen to be connected to cultural capital in terms of inherited social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662511410268">Strandbu and Skogen, 2000</xref>). Because values are unlikely to change after adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511410268">Inglehart, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511410268">1997</xref>) and no education is value-free (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511410268">Gudmundsdottir, 1990</xref>), we believe that in the future values should be more openly considered as part of the education of children and young people.</p>
<p>The state of environmental awareness of citizens has to be improved, as well. It is worth noting that knowledge of climate change increased the climate-friendly action of citizens only when mediated by a belief in climate change. Therefore, instead of aiming simply to increase the climate knowledge of people, we should pay serious attention to the question of how to make that knowledge matter. On the basis of the results of this study we consider that a belief in the emergence of environmental problems is an essential element of environmental awareness. Accordingly, we should on the one hand enlighten citizens’ feelings of the seriousness of the environmental problems, and on the other hand encourage them to gain ownership over solving the problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511410268">Jensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511410268">Jensen and Schnack, 2006</xref>). Through increasing such an awareness, complex environmental problems like climate change could be better realized, acknowledged and, thus, even managed.</p>
<p>Therefore we should openly ask who carries the responsibility for making changes. It is crucial to see that in this study trust in political systems decreased both the belief in climate change and attempts to solve climate change through our own actions. We argue that this result demonstrating the system justification tendency within the public understanding of climate change should be taken seriously. First, based on our results we claim that global climate change might well be too big a problem to be solved by the efforts of individuals living in Western societies, without extensive value, ownership and action-oriented education programs. Second, there is neither time nor sense in letting responsibility rest only with individuals. Therefore, politicians should understand that when people trust a political system those politicians should also acknowledge responsibility for the difficult task of creating climate policy decisions.</p>
<p>The official goals of national environmental policies rarely include increasing citizens’ political competence. If environmental political processes were considered learning processes, then both citizens’ and authorities’ political competence could be put to use more effectively than it is at present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511410268">Koskinen and Paloniemi, 2009</xref>). People’s tacit everyday knowledge could be better integrated into political practices and political decision-making could be better integrated into the everyday life of people through balanced dialogue between citizens and authorities. Such a dialogue could produce expertise, which could combine local and global scales, and which would be more dynamic and diverse than the skills of either scale alone. Moreover, such competence could be a counterforce for system justification beliefs, namely if people had more capacities, will and drive to act, then there would be less need for such a psychological coping mechanism as denial, nor would there be a need to evade large-scale problems.</p>
