      <abstract>
        <p>Nordic penal regimes are Janus-faced: one side relatively mild and benign; the other
          intrusive, disciplining and oppressive. This paradox has not been fully grasped or
          explained by the Nordic Exceptionalism thesis which overstates the degree to which Nordic
          penal order is based on humaneness and social solidarity, an antidote to mass
          incarceration. This essay examines the split in the foundation of the Swedish welfare
          state: it simultaneously promotes individual well-being in the social sphere but enables
          intrusive deprivations of liberty and in some cases, violates the principles of human
          rights. The backbone of the welfare state, Folkhemmet, the People’s Home, is at once
          demos, democratic and egalitarian and ethnos, a people by blood, exclusionary and
          essentialist. The lack of individual rights and an ethno-cultural conception of
          citizenship make certain categories of people such as criminal offenders, criminal aliens,
          drug offenders and perceived ‘others’, particularly foreign nationals, vulnerable to
          deprivation and exclusion.</p>

      <title>Countervailing tendencies in a mild penal regime</title>
      <p>In May 2011, the Justice Ombudsman of Sweden, Hans-Gunnar Axberger issued a searing report
        on the practices and policies of the Swedish Migration Board’s detention centers for
        migrants. Following his internal investigation, the Justice Ombudsman (JO) criticized the
        Board for misapplying the law in ways that subjected foreigners to more intrusive
        deprivations than nationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612468935">Axberger,
          2011</xref>: Dnr 6090–2009, p. 2). Detailing routines that placed self-harming detainees
        in remand prisons locked in cells, placed detainees in prisons with convicted criminal
        offenders, relied on poorly trained hourly wage workers to make placement decisions, and
        made the default position the most restrictive, the JO argued that these practices were
        simply wrong in principle. It was wrong to place people with immigration violations in
        prison alongside suspected and convicted offenders. Drawing attention to the imprisonment of
        self-harming detainees, he called the practice distressing, <italic>beklämmande</italic>,
        and regrettable, <italic>beklagligt</italic>, a practice no one seemed to support but
        continued anyway. The treatment of detainees, according to the Justice Ombudsman, violated
        human rights and was an insult to personal dignity. It was an outrage, <italic>en
          kränkning</italic>, a particularly stinging criticism in a society based on the
        maintenance of personal dignity through equal treatment.</p>
      <p>These practices coupled with the use of pre-trial detention in criminal cases, the common
        use of restrictions and isolation in pre-trial detention, the overrepresentation of foreign
        nationals in prison, the ‘return’ of failed asylum seekers, the deportation of criminal
        aliens, the deportation of children, the compulsory treatment of drug addicts and
        alcoholics, and the imprisonment of drug users are policy outcomes that do not neatly
        conform to the conventional view of Sweden as a reservoir of mild penal sanctioning and
        human rights protections. While Sweden does maintain relatively low imprisonment rates and
        relatively humane prison conditions as indicated by and central to the Nordic Exceptionalism
        (NE) thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480612468935">Pratt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480612468935">Pratt and Eriksson, 2012</xref>), it is
        clear there are a number of contemporary practices and policies that do not match the
        empirical description or normative underpinning of penal moderation. ‘Open prisons’,
        remarkable for their low level of security, inmate autonomy, and humaneness, figure
        prominently in the NE thesis as a barometer of Scandinavian progressivism, but in reality,
        this is not the norm as most inmates are housed in mid-level security units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480612468935">Kriminalvården, 2012</xref>), which fits
        better with Swedish values of moderation, that is <italic>lagom</italic>, not too much and
        not too little. But perhaps more importantly, there are a number of practices that highlight
        the ‘pains of imprisonment’, that is, the disciplining and distressing nature of
        confinement, even in relatively mild penal regimes such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and
        Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362480612468935">Basberg Neumann, 2012</xref>;

        the detention and deportation of migrants, against the historical backdrop of large-scale
        forced sterilization of thousands of Swedish women, including ethnic minorities such as the
        Roma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612468935">Broberg and Hansen, 1996</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1362480612468935">Roth and Hertzberg, 2010</xref>) and
        forced quarantine of HIV/AIDs patients in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612468935">Baldwin, 2005</xref>), suggests the presence, if not a
        pattern, of human rights violations of those deemed unwanted or ‘undeserving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480612468935">Åmark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612468935">Björkman, 2001</xref>), including at times foreign nationals
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480612468935">Axberger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612468935">Committee against Torture, 2008</xref>;

      <title>A split in the Swedish welfare state</title>
      <p>That said, none of these examples necessarily disqualify the NE thesis. But they are
        difficult to understand and explain given the thesis’ partial reading of the Swedish welfare
        state. The Nordic Exceptionalism thesis claims that Scandinavian/Nordic countries (Sweden,
        Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland) maintain more humane and mild penal regimes because of
        their distinctive welfare states which are rooted in social cohesion, conformity and
        egalitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480612468935">Pratt and Eriksson,
          2012</xref>). Strong cultures of equality, social solidarity, faith in social engineering,
        state expertise, and consensus politics, the thesis argues, decrease criminogenic conditions
        and moderate penal severity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362480612468935">Green,
          2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362480612468935">Lappi-Seppälä,
          2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>From this view, the only way to explain the repressive examples would be to see them as a
        breakdown or retraction of the welfare state, the result of social change. But it would be a
        mistake to argue that new trends are replacing a more moderate tradition. This is not a
        story about the globalization of punitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480612468935">Brown, 2005</xref>), the spread of American neoliberalism
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1362480612468935">Wacquant, 2009</xref>), or converging
        cultures of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362480612468935">Garland,
          2001</xref>). Nordic penal order is Janus-faced, to invoke Wacquant’s cogent image of the
        double-sided nature of the State: it is mild and harsh simultaneously. But to explain it, we
        need to deepen our analysis of the welfare state. Both mild and repressive elements coexist
        because of the duality of the Swedish welfare state—a duality that promotes individual
        well-being and autonomy in the social sphere while resisting individual rights in the legal
        sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1362480612468935">Trägårdh and Svedberg,
          2012</xref>). These factors are not mere ‘social costs’ associated with the welfare state,
        they are central to it. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1362480612468935">Henrik Tham
          (1995)</xref> has explained, the Social Democratic Party has a long history of
        interventionist approaches to crime and other perceived social problems with the latest
        attempt to create a ‘drug-free society’ through the imprisonment and confinement of both
        users and dealers. These measures were not imposed from the outside but came from
        within.</p>
      <p>The Nordic Exceptionalism thesis is fast becoming a social fact, that is, a taken for
        granted reality with a force of its own, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480612468935">Magnus Hörnqvist (2012)</xref> explains. This is problematic
        he argues, since many Nordic prison researchers find the thesis hard to uphold,
        controversial, and normative as evidenced in the recent collection, <italic>Penal
          Exceptionalism? Nordic Prison Policy and Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1362480612468935">Ugelvik and Dullum, 2012</xref>). Although many of the
        contributors in <italic>Penal Exceptionalism?</italic> are critical of the thesis, most
        mainly take issue with the characterization of penal outcomes but do not examine the welfare
        state itself, the driving force of the thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480612468935">Scharff Smith, 2012</xref>, is an exception). As such, there
        is a gap in our understanding of the welfare state that has important implications for penal
        order. This essay seeks to fill that gap.</p>
      <p>This essay has three goals:</p>
      <list id="list1-1362480612468935" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>(1) It identifies two structural barriers in the Swedish welfare state—the lack of
            individual rights and an ethno-cultural conception of citizenship—that create conditions
            conducive to intrusive deprivations in the penal field, particularly for perceived
            outsiders such as foreign nationals and ethnic minorities.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>(2) By identifying these structural barriers in the welfare state, the essay then calls
            into question the progressive characterization of Swedish penal order based on human
            dignity and social solidarity. It suggests we take more seriously the Janus-faced nature
            of the Swedish case.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>(3) It concludes by rethinking the degree to which welfare state generosity may or may
            not lead to mild penal sanctioning and suggests alternative and inclusionary mechanisms
            that can promote individual liberty.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>A note on research strategy: this article examines the specific case of Sweden rather than
        the range of Nordic countries; this approach is used to keep the empirical detail concrete
        and focused. At the same time, despite important cultural, political, and social differences
        across the Nordic countries, Sweden is often portrayed as the exemplar of the <italic>Nordic
          Model</italic>, opening the possibilities for generalization across the region. The
        article seeks to develop an alternative but possibly complementary account of Swedish social
        control—one that focuses on legal rights and social classification vis-à-vis citizenship
        rather than on the more conventional state paternalism approach. State paternalism does not
        sufficiently identify the institutional mechanisms that make such infringements on rights
        possible and why it comes at perceived ‘others’’ expense. A note on terminology: ‘the use of
        the terms repression’, ‘repressive uses of state power’, and ‘intrusive deprivations’ are
        meant to capture the infringement on individual rights, autonomy and self-governance as they
        operate through penal power in democratic societies which do not compare to the scale and
        intensity of repression under authoritarian regimes or the bloody suppression of civil
        liberties.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section3-1362480612468935">
      <title><italic>Folkhemmet</italic>: The People’s Home</title>
      <p>The Swedish welfare state is well known for its generosity and high standard of living; it
        is known for being universal (rather than means-tested), meaning, everyone has access to its
        social benefits regardless of income or socioeconomic status. Across the life course, from
        cradle to grave, everyone has access to health care, pension benefits, education, subsidized
        child care, unemployment and disability insurance, parental, family, and medical leave when
        needed. And as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362480612468935">Esping-Andersen
          (1990)</xref>, theorized, it is distinctive for its high degree of
          <italic>de-commodification</italic>, its high protection and state regulation against the
        ill-effects of the market. Individuals are protected against the vagaries of the market but
        they are also expected to contribute to the material well-being of the society, one of the
        most productive capitalist economies in the world. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612468935">Cavadino and Dignan (2006</xref>: 150) note, the Swedish
        welfare state is ‘comprehensive and egalitarian’ with ‘a high level of material security for
        all’.</p>
      <p>Historically, the Swedish welfare state was designed as ‘The People’s Home,’
          <italic>Folkhemmet</italic>, with a place for everyone. It promised security,
          <italic>trygghet</italic>, and well-being, which must have come as a welcome relief after
        a long and cruel 19th century of mass poverty, near starvation (in the countryside), mass
        emigration, delayed industrialization, and class conflict. Infused with the democratic and
        anti-elitist spirit of the popular movements, the People’s Home would be open to the folk,
        the ‘people’, inclusionary and universal, simultaneously merging the interests of factory
        workers with the poor but landed farmers and avoiding the more bourgeois conceit of the
        citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1362480612468935">Trägårdh, 1997</xref>). In
        other words: ‘The good home does not consider anyone as privileged or unappreciated; it
        knows no special favorites and no stepchildren … [N]o one tries to gain advantage [at]
        another’s expense, and the stronger do not suppress and plunder the weak’, explained Swedish
        Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480612468935">Pratt, 2008</xref>: 127). (For more on the history of the
        Swedish welfare state, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362480612468935">Marklund,
          2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1362480612468935">Stråth, 1993</xref>.) The
        Swedish welfare state would be referred to affectionately as a ‘home’, inspiring feelings of
        warmth, trust, and fidelity, and would be managed by benevolent parents. Quoting Prime
        Minister Hansson once more: ‘In a loving home exists equality, concern for others,
        cooperation and a helping hand’ (Hansson quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612468935">Arnáson, 2008</xref>: 155). I suggest that this domestic
        metaphor for the State blurs a crucial distinction between state and civil society and in
        the process diminishes the political conception of citizenship: here the conception of an
        individual as a rights-bearer vis-à-vis the State is supplanted by the idea of an individual
        as compliant family member subject to the paternalism of the State qua family.</p>

    <sec id="section4-1362480612468935">
      <title>Social solidarity vs individual autonomy</title>
      <p>The Nordic Exceptionalism thesis claims that the underlying dynamic of this generous and
        universal welfare state is rooted in social solidarity and homogeneity, a reflection of
        strong group cohesion and similar ethnic and religious identification, especially
        Lutheranism. Social organization based on sameness and togetherness then provides the basis
        for strong redistributive welfare state since everyone contributes and everyone benefits and
        in the penal realm, more mild and less intense punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480612468935">Pratt, 2008</xref>: 129). The NE thesis emphasizes the
        egalitarian nature of the social organization and cultural values. This is not contentious.
        But what is problematic is locating this egalitarian culture in a group-based society.
        Sweden is not a group-based society and seeing it as such makes it very difficult to grasp
        and explain its more repressive dimensions, internally directed.</p>
      <p>Instead, the individual is the principal organizing factor of Swedish society. In a
        groundbreaking and highly acclaimed history of the Swedish welfare state, <italic>Är
          Svensken Människa? Gemenskap och oberoende i det moderna Sverige</italic> [<italic>Is the
          Swede Human? Community and Autonomy in Modern Sweden</italic>], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612468935">Henrik Berggren and Lars Trägårdh (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612468935">2010)</xref> explain how individual autonomy
        is not only the driving force of the Swedish welfare state but the underlying moral logic of
        the society itself. Drawing on a wide range of social history and cultural analysis, they
        explain: <disp-quote>
          <p>In fact, the official rhetoric about solidarity and social democracy notwithstanding,
            Sweden is not first and foremost a warm <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> composed of
            altruists who are exceptionally caring or loving, but rather a hyper modern

      <p>The Swedish welfare state is not a reflection of a close-knit community, a
          <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic>, with neighbors taking care of one another; it is instead a
        tool for individual emancipation from precisely this kind of dependency and close community
        life. Far from being driven by collectivist movements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612468935">Berggren and Trägårdh (2010)</xref> explain how the welfare
        state rests on an older and possibly more potent cultural trope that resonated with the
        population: the free Swedish peasant, land-owner, independent, hard-working, enduring, and
        stoic. Deeply attached to independence and property rights, the yeoman farmer placed a high
        premium on autonomy, perceived as the highest virtue, especially in the unforgiving Nordic
        climate. Independent farmers (and not elites) effectively defeated attempts at collective
        ownership which were at stake in socialist reforms in the 1930s. To refer to Sweden as
        socialist is to fundamentally misunderstand the organization of the society itself; private
        property, regulated capitalism and entrepreneurship have produced one of the highest GDPs
        among the OECD countries. The resulting welfare state emancipated individuals from
        traditional forms of social organization and hierarchy: the family, the church, and
        charities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612468935">Berggren and Trägårdh,
          2010</xref>). It freed individuals from dependency: wives from husbands, children from
        parents, elderly parents from grown children, and to a certain extent, employees from
        employers. A generous welfare state is perceived to be a ‘necessary prerequisite to free
        citizens from demeaning and humbling dependence on one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612468935">Berggren and Trägårdh, 2010</xref>: 56). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612468935">Cavadino and Dignan (2006</xref>: 150,
        emphasis in original) identify the same underlying ethos in their analysis of Nordic Social
        Democracy: <disp-quote>
          <p>It is (although this may sound strange to some ears) more
              <italic>individualistic</italic>—society is extremely important, but at the end of the
            day it is there to serve the needs of all its individual members, not the other way
            around.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480612468935">Garland (2012)</xref>
        remarks that societies with weak ties and high levels of individualism are likely to produce
        relatively mild penal sanctioning, countering claims about strong group cohesion often
        assumed in the Nordic cases.</p>
      <p>In Sweden, equality vis-à-vis the welfare state is a tool to maintain individual autonomy
        and self-realization. Cavadino and Dignan connect this social democratic logic to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1362480612468935">Rawls’ (1972)</xref>
        <italic>Theory of Justice</italic> whereby rational actors enter into the social contract
        more out of self-interest than collectivist sentiment or attachment. In the penal realm,
        mild penal sanctioning can then be re-interpreted as the upholding of individual dignity,
        the refusal to ‘look[] down on anyone’, as Prime Minister Hansson described the
          <italic>People’s Home</italic> in 1928 (Hansson quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362480612468935">Pratt, 2008</xref>: 127). The way to uphold individual
        dignity in this context is to practice equal treatment, exemplified by ‘just deserts’
        philosophy of punishment. Proportionality in the Swedish case can dampen excessive and
        arbitrary sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612468935">Cavadino and
          Dignan, 2006</xref>: 151). Mild sanctioning in this context is driven by the demand to
        preserve individual dignity, a formative cultural value and principle of social
        organization, and is not necessarily a reflection of benevolence or great sympathy for other
        people, a type of mercy dynamic.</p>

      <title>The People’s Home: negative implications for rights</title>
      <p>By situating the individual in the center of the Swedish welfare state and moving away from
        group dynamics of social solidarity, we get a better sense of the fraught relationship
        between the individual and the State, a relationship which has serious implications for the
        use of the repressive power. As Trägårdh explains, the Swedish welfare state liberated
        individuals from traditional dependencies, improved their material well-being and sense of
        security, yet, this alliance between the State and individual,
          <italic>statist-individualism</italic>, as he calls it, disempowered individuals against
        the State. Swedish historians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362480612468935">Lundberg
          and Tydén (2010)</xref> have remarked on the same process: ‘the fundament right of the
        individual to govern his or her own life was lost during the very same process’. We might
        think of this as a kind of Faustian bargain in which individuals gained autonomy in certain
        areas of social life and greatly improved their life-chances, but gave up individual rights
        claims as dependency on the State increased. It is a kind of ‘iron-cage’, to invoke Max
        Weber, in which Swedes built a welfare state to attain individual autonomy and material
        well-being but whose liberties were ultimately restricted by the same process.</p>
      <p>Although the partially revised Nordic Exceptionalism thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480612468935">Pratt and Eriksson, 2012</xref>) highlights the pressures of
        conformity and social control, it does not address the weak legal tradition of individual
        rights. By focusing on the individual as the organizing principle in Scandinavian societies
        rather than group dynamics, we can gain a better appreciation for the high stakes involved.
        State intrusion upon individual liberty involves a scale, intensity, and seriousness that go
        well beyond the social pressures to agree or conform to group norms.</p>
      <p>In Sweden then, individual freedom is constructed <italic>through</italic> the State rather
        than conceived as freedom <italic>from</italic> the State, as in the British and American
        liberal traditions. It is critical to note that Sweden does not have a bill of rights or
        functional equivalent that protects individuals from the State. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1362480612468935">Johan Karlsson Schaffer (2012)</xref> explains, all of the
        Nordic countries historically have been skeptical of constitutional protections of
        individual rights: individual rights were perceived to be an impediment to welfare state
        expansion and would be considered less legitimate than resolving conflicts through the much
        preferred social democratic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480612468935">Husa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612468935">Nergelius,
          2008</xref>). Sweden does not actively practice Judicial Review in which an individual can
        challenge the constitutionality of the law or the violation of his or her fundamental rights
        through the high courts. Sweden relies more extensively on a Judicial Preview mechanism
        whereby a panel of appointed judges reviews the constitutionality of Parliamentary
        legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480612468935">Bull, 2011</xref>). In
        addition, Schaffer Karlsson argues that the influential Scandinavian realism school
        challenged the role of natural law and metaphysics in legal thinking, rejecting the idea
        that individuals have ‘inalienable rights’, a move that further weakened the status and role
        of individual rights in the constitution. In a contemporary example of this resistance,
        Sweden has yet to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Swedish
        domestic law despite being one of the Convention’s greatest advocates internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1362480612468935">Schaffer Karlsson, 2012</xref>) and despite
        having one of the highest rates of child well-being in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1362480612468935">Unicef, 2007</xref>). As legal scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612468935">Agust Thor Arnáson (2008</xref>: 160) argues: ‘Efficient
        administration of state matters and pragmatic solutions do by no means justify weak
        constitutional human rights protection.’</p>
      <p>What this means is that the State maintains ultimate power and authority to determine the
        public good and decides under what conditions the public good can override individual
        rights. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612468935">Arnáson (2008</xref>: 155)
        describes the Nordic model: ‘it can be described as a strong social democratic state, based
        on the idea of a sovereign parliament with little or no limitation of its power’. A recent
        rise of internationalism and European law in Sweden modifies but does not discount this
        strong view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362480612468935">Nergelius, 2008</xref>). In
        this configuration, individual rights are more vulnerable and less protected even though
        civil and political rights are guaranteed in the Swedish Constitution (Instrument of
        Government, Chapter 2 Fundamental Rights and Freedoms). Individual rights are more
        conditional than absolute. Article 21 of the Swedish Constitution, ‘Conditions for limiting
        rights and freedoms’, stipulates the conditions under which citizens’ rights can be
        suspended. Article 21 states: <disp-quote>
          <p>The limitations referred to in Article 20 may be imposed only to satisfy a purpose
            acceptable in a democratic society. The limitation must never go beyond what is
            necessary with regard to the purpose which occasioned it, nor may it be carried so far
            as to constitute a threat to the free shaping of opinion as one of the fundaments of
            democracy. No limitation may be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious,
            cultural or other such opinion.</p>
          <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612468935">Instrument of Government,
              2012</xref>: Article 21)</attrib>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Limitations on rights can be imposed as long as they do not supersede what is considered
        ‘necessary’ and what is considered ‘acceptable in a democratic society’. Even though power
        resides in the demos, the people, as represented by the majority in the Riksdag, this lack
        of specificity on constitutional restrictions leaves a high level of discretion to state
        authorities and the whims of the majority. What is acceptable at one time in place may not
        be acceptable in another. What is acceptable to social engineers (even those backed by
        popular support) may not be acceptable to the individuals or groups whose rights are
        limited. Article 25 goes on to state the limitations of the rights of foreign nationals with
        two of the 10 provisions explicitly restricting protections against the deprivation of
        liberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612468935">Instrument of Government,
          2012</xref>: Article 25). On a related point, anti-discrimination law and minority rights
        are less established in Sweden, introduced and consolidated as late as 2008 in the
        Discrimination Act, further illustrating a relatively weak legal structure for the
        protection let alone promotion of individual rights.</p>
      <p>The limitation on individual rights in Sweden, as a structural feature of the welfare
        state—that is, as a building block for state action and interpretation—has had major
        consequences for public policy and the intrusive use of repressive state power against
        individuals. To understand how structural features exert causal force on public policy and
        penal order, it is useful to recall insights from historical institutionalism. Here
        historical traditions, practices, and institutions create certain channels of action and
        eliminate others; they create strong ‘path dependencies’ in which the legacies of past
        practices continue to exert pressure on contemporary policy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1362480612468935">Pierson, 1994</xref>). The institutional environment creates
        a kind of <italic>habitus</italic>, in Pierre Bourdieu’s terms, a particular way of acting
        and thinking, an underlying logic or texture of the political field. What is imaginable,
        what is possible, what is considered acceptable in this particular context may be
        unthinkable in another. The historical institutional environment creates a repertoire of
        actions that are deemed legitimate and culturally resonate not only by state actors but by
        the population more generally who do not protest but support such activity because it makes
        sense to them and is perhaps more importantly, meaningful to them.</p>
      <p>In terms of the legacy of intrusive deprivations in Sweden, the same state that guarantees
        individual autonomy in terms of material well-being is the same state that authorized the
        forced sterilization of thousands of Swedish women on a scale that paralleled Nazi Germany
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612468935">Baldwin, 2005</xref>), that carried
        out one of the most restrictive and interventionist response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the
        1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612468935">Baldwin, 2005</xref>), and that
        continues to mandate treatment for alcoholics and drug addicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1362480612468935">Tham, 1998</xref>), all intrusions on individual liberty and
        personal dignity carried out in the name of public good (public health and public
        security).</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1362480612468935">Henrik Tham (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1362480612468935">2005)</xref> has extensively documented and
        explained a similar strain of intrusiveness in Swedish drug policy. Since the late 1960s,
        both the Social Democrats and Liberal Party have aggressively pursued a ‘drug-free Sweden’
        by penalizing drug consumption and banning alternative ‘harm reduction’ approaches. Harking
        back to the Temperance Movement, Sweden’s drug-free society stressed the principles of
        ‘sobriety, self-discipline, and the improvement of one’s life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1362480612468935">Tham, 2005</xref>: 70), authorizing the police to take urine
        and blood samples from drug users without their consent to realize this goal. Swedish
        prisons are literally filled with drug users who make up over 50 percent of the prison
        population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362480612468935">Kriminalvården,
        2012</xref>). Comparatively, these figures are high, especially when we consider that Sweden
        includes drug consumption as a drug offense. Looking at the breakdown of comparative prison
        populations by drug offense available from 2008, Sweden and the other Nordic countries are
        on the high end of the scale with over 30 percent of the prison population made up of drug
        offenders (including possession, trafficking, production) as compared to England and Wales
        with 16 percent, the Netherlands at 20 percent, and Germany with 15 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480612468935">Council of Europe, 2010</xref>). Sweden has
        a relatively smaller number of drug crimes reported to the police, 8000 drug crimes reported
        to the police in 2009, compared to 33,000 drug crimes reported in England and Wales or
        18,000 drug crimes reported in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362480612468935">Eurostat, 2012</xref>: Table 7, p. 12). These discrepancies,
        controlling for population, suggest that Sweden has a more proactive and intrusive approach
        to drugs compared to similarly situated member states in the European Union.</p>
      <p>Government officials have justified these intrusive practices as the most effective way to
        protect and vindicate the society that itself has been victimized by drugs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1362480612468935">Tham (2005</xref>: 70) explains, the
        drug-free society is the realization of a particular vision of the good society, the
        productive welfare state where everyone works, everyone contributes, and ‘everyone has a
        right to dignity’ even if that dignity must be forced onto them. These restrictive practices
        are not minor inconveniences for a few perceived outsiders but rather indicative of how
        power operates in this society more generally, and how it operates coercively but
        legitimately.</p>
      <p>In the penal realm, it is the same state that relies extensively on pre-trial detention and
        isolation of suspected (and not yet tried or convicted) offenders, including juvenile
        offenders denied contact with their own parents; it is the same state that authorizes the
        taking of nonconsensual blood samples from detainees, relies on ‘cage-like’ dog-pens as
        exercise facilities for remand prisoners (a practice associated more with Supermax prisons
        in Pelican Bay, California than in Gothenburg, Sweden), and confines a proportion of
        immigration violators with suspected and convicted criminal offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of
          Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>And as noted at the outset, these are all practices that go against conventional portrayals
        of Sweden as the apogee of enlightened social policy, an image that Swedish elites actively
        have promoted around the globe for most of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362480612468935">Nilsson, 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362480612468935">Roddy Nilsson (2012)</xref> explains, leading Social
        Democrats in the 1930s such as Gunnar and Alva Myrdal, well known in the USA for their
        scholarship on race, population, and social policy, brandished the image of Sweden as having
        the most ‘modern, progressive, and effective’ welfare state, one to be admired and emulated.
        The Swedish Institute, a government agency, picked up this practice in the 1940s and
        continues today to promote the <italic>Nordic Model</italic>. In the 1960s and 1970s, penal
        elites such as Torsten Eriksson, an internationally recognized penal reformer, continued to
        advance Swedish progressivism by encouraging the adoption of key features of the Swedish
        prison system, namely its humaneness and openness, information further spread
        internationally by Thorsten Sellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362480612468935">Nilsson, 2012</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362480612468935">Neil
          Kent (2012)</xref> explains how political elites such as Prime Minister Olof Palme

        World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as a guide and possible solution to European
        social and economic woes. Similarly, in early 2012, the Moderate led coalition government
        offered the <italic>Nordic Way</italic> as an antidote to growing European crises at the
        Northern Future Forum, a high level meeting of Ministers, including Prime Minister Cameron

      <title>Infringement on individual rights</title>
      <p>A less well-known feature of Swedish penal practice, and one that is absent in the Nordic
        Exceptionalism thesis (and not mentioned in the <italic>Nordic Model</italic>), has been the
        scrutiny and criticism it has incurred from international oversight committees: the United
        Nations Committee against Torture and the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention
        of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Less well publicized are human
        rights violations found by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR has made 99
        judgments on Sweden with over 50 percent of those decisions finding at least one violation

        dismiss their social significance as they indicate the contentiousness of individual human

            in the areas of legal safeguards against ill-treatment of persons in police custody, the

      </p>
      <p>The report continues with a list of findings and a set of recommendations, including: the
        need for Swedish police to better ‘integrate human rights concepts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 11) during the arrest and
        questioning of suspects; the recommendation that Swedish authorities stop ‘taking blood or
        other samples from detained persons without the latter’s consent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 13); guarantee detainees the right
        to a lawyer and to be informed about their rights; access to a doctor when in police
        custody; and in the case of juveniles, the right to have a lawyer or ‘trusted person’
        present during police questioning as the Committee found juveniles in police custody were
        not informed of their rights and ‘could be questioned without the presence of their parents,
        a social welfare representative or a lawyer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 24). On the conditions of detention,
        the report highlights several concerns about the use of ‘restrictions’ and isolation in
        Swedish prisons despite the ‘relaxed and quite positive’ relationship between the staff and
        inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 33). Of
        particular concern was the ‘impact of prolonged periods of isolation/segregation on the
        mental health of the inmates concerned’, including symptoms of anxiety disorder,
        post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, agitation, self-harm, and risk of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 37).</p>
      <p>In regard to the use of restrictions on remand prisoners (including limitations on visits,
        contact, access to media material, family members, segregation and isolation for periods
        from 6 to 18 months), the Committee made similar remarks: ‘The issue of restrictions imposed
        on remand prisoners has been central to the dialogue between the CPT and the Swedish
        authorities ever since the Committee’s first visit to Sweden in 1991’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 35). The CPT makes a note that the
        same concern has been documented by the United Nations Committee against Torture on its 2008
        visit. Yet, Sweden has yet to adopt or introduce any legislation or regulation on the use of
        restrictions even though restrictions are quite common: in 2009, 46 percent of remand
        prisons in Gothenburg, for example, were subject to some kind of restriction, including
        isolation, down from the 70 percent in March 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>). Juveniles were also subject to
        restrictive conditions ‘akin to isolation’, marked as ‘a draconian measure’ by the
        delegation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 35).
        Restrictions, the report noted, ‘should never be applied for the purpose of pressure to bear
        on persons remanded in custody’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT,
          2009</xref>: para. 38).</p>
      <p>To continue this catalogue, a few remarks about migration detention centers and the
        placement of immigration violators in remand prisons are necessary. In section 6 ‘Safeguards
        for persons detained under aliens legislation’, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT (2009</xref>: para. 64) strongly states: <disp-quote>
          <p>The CPT has already made its position on this matter clear in the past. In the
            Committee’s view, a prison is by definition not an appropriate place in which to detain
            someone who is neither suspected nor convicted of a criminal offense. This is all the
            more so when the prison in question is not in a position to provide them with a suitable
            regime. In those cases where it is considered necessary to deprive persons of their
            liberty under aliens legislation, they should be accommodated in centres specifically
            designed for that purpose, which offer material conditions of detention and a regime
            appropriate to their legal status.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>The Committee then states in bold-face type: ‘The CPT recommends urgent steps be taken to
        ensure that persons detained under aliens legislation are not held on prison premises’
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612468935">CPT, 2009</xref>: para. 64).
        Similarly, in its report on Sweden, the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) drew
        attention to the common place detention of pre-deportees, people who could be confined for
        an unlimited time period (unlike almost all other European Union member states). The UN
        Committee, paralleling the Swedish JO Ombudsman’s criticism of the Migration Board (above),
        was especially concerned with the placement of self-harming detainees in remand prisons
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612468935">CAT, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480612468935">Peter Scharff Smith (2012)</xref>, in
        one of the most critical essays on the NE thesis in <italic>Penal Exceptionalism?</italic>,
        tempers the well-known humane aspects of Scandinavian penal practice with the less
        well-known inhumane practices, practices that he explains have been central and distinctive
        to Nordic penal practice since the 19th century. With a focus on Denmark and the extensive
        use of pre-trial solitary confinement, which the State defends as a means to avoid collusion
        and interference with their investigation, he explains how this practice has effectively
        weakened if not violated the human rights of many of those subjected to such restrictions as
        documented by international review committees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480612468935">Smith (2012</xref>: 54) refers to these practices as the
        ‘anti-liberal social tendencies’ indicative of the Nordic welfare states, calling attention
        to the dualism inherent in this kind of state/society. He goes on to claim that these social
        control tendencies are probably more relevant and more powerful than the assumed humaneness
        of Nordic penal practice, a factor that has been downplayed and not well understood in the
        comparative literature.</p>

      <title>Universal but exclusionary welfare state, the roots of welfare nationalism</title>
      <p>What remains to be explained is how the Swedish welfare state functions as both a universal
        but exclusionary model. I argue that the weak individual rights tradition outlined above is
        further compounded by the partially exclusionary nature of the Swedish welfare state. For
        those individuals and social groups that are not fully incorporated into the social,
        economic, and the political order, the Swedish welfare state can be inaccessible and
        punitive. Sweden retains a relatively high rate of foreign nationals in prison, foreign
        nationals make up 27 percent of the prison population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1362480612468935">World Prison Brief, 2012</xref>), a figure higher than
        France or the UK, countries which have experienced long histories of ethnic conflict. The
        Swedish welfare state is fairly affluent and very generous and quite frankly a major
        accomplishment, if you belong to it. If you do not belong to it, Sweden can be a place made
        miserable by variegated social marginalization in core areas of social life: housing;
        employment; education; and criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362480612468935">Koopmans, 2010</xref>). For those with precarious status
        such as paperless migrants, whose presence on the territory is fast becoming criminalized,
        the Swedish welfare state, like the other Nordic welfare states, is becoming a place of
        forced deprivation, designed to illicit a quick exit from the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480612468935">Johansen, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362480612468935">Khosravi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1362480612468935">Weber and Bowling, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Sweden currently exhibits tendencies towards welfare-nationalism, a place where the welfare
        state must be preserved and made sustainable for those on the inside by limiting access from
        the outside. The structural barriers to belonging are quite high and hierarchical (rather
        than absolute), particularly for those deemed ‘other’, ‘undeserving’, or members of
        particular ethnic groups. In her comparative analysis of political economies and penal
        order, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480612468935">Nicola Lacey (2008)</xref> makes
        a similar observation that the coordinated economies of Northern Europe may be relatively
        mild toward insiders and more punitive toward outsiders. Although this essay has sought to
        complicate this view of absolute mildness in the Swedish case, Lacey’s insight is important.
        Moreover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1362480612468935">Leanne Weber (2012)</xref>
        argues against social democracy as an antidote to neoliberalism and its associated punitive
        penal order not because she rejects social democracy’s ideals of egalitarianism and
        retributive principles, but because it cannot accommodate the realities of global mobility
        and pressures toward denationalization; it is still rooted very much in nationalistic
        conceptions of membership and belonging that fail to protect nonmembers.</p>
      <p>Earlier, I discussed the People’s Home, <italic>Folkhemmet</italic>, identified by
        historians as one of the most important founding principles of the Swedish welfare state.
        The welfare state was built upon the concept of the <italic>folk</italic>, the common
        people, a democratic impulse that defined rich and poor alike. The idea of the folk is
        democratic in spirit but also retains a more exclusionary element. The folk concept was
        preferred to the concept of <italic>medborgare</italic> or citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1362480612468935">Trägårdh, 1997</xref>). But this move, I suggest, while
        naturalizing equality across social hierarchies de-politicized the nature of the State and
        its relationship to the individual. The welfare state is a ‘home’, a conceptualization that
        erases the political boundaries between state and society, between state and the individual.
        So rather than belonging to a shared political community based on political subjectivity and
        political contestation—that is, a civic conception of national belonging exemplified
        (although not always realized) in France or the USA—the folk concept foregrounds the people,
        an ethno-cultural view of national belonging. You are a member of the Swedish welfare state
        because you are part of <italic>a people</italic>, an ethnic group with shared experience,
        culture, language, and blood. <italic>Jus sanguinis</italic> is the main route to
        citizenship in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480612468935">Migrationsverket,
          2012</xref>). Although naturalization rates are relatively high in Sweden, the reality and
        legacy of ethnic belonging poses substantial obstacles for ethnic minorities to fully
        incorporate or fully belong to Swedish society. As economic historian, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612468935">Jenny Andersson (2009</xref>: 240, emphasis in original)
        explains: ‘the very notion of People’s home contains important and still vital allusions to
        an ethnic entity, the <italic>folk</italic>’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1362480612468935">Carly Schall (2012)</xref>, in her historical sociological
        account, identifies how the Swedish People’s Home both celebrated democratic values and a
        national heritage based on familial blood ties. According to Prime Minister Per Albin
        Hansson at the founding of the People’s Home: ‘democracy is rooted not merely in the
        constitution, but also in our traditions and in the disposition of the folk’ (Hansson quoted
        in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1362480612468935">Trägårdh, 2000</xref>: 14538). Here,
        democracy is <italic>not merely in the constitution</italic> but in the people. This
        configuration underscores the relatively weak position of the constitution (as the central
        organizing principal of democratic governance) and privileges the ethno-cultural view that
        democracy itself is intrinsic or ascribed in the character of the people. It essentializes
        democratic values (e.g. equality, freedom, tolerance, gender equality) locating them within
        the Swedish people—Swedes are just naturally democratic and egalitarian. By collapsing a
        people with democratic values, this ethno-cultural view of citizenship not only negates the
        historical reality in which democracy was fought for and won but in its ugliest variant
        further excludes perceived outsiders, portraying ethnic or cultural difference as somehow
        un-democratic, intolerant, and simply un-Swedish. If you do not belong to this
        ethno-cultural group and the legal channels to constitutional rights are blocked or
        underdeveloped, then this institutional arrangement creates a relatively weak social
        position vis-à-vis the State.</p>
      <p>Why does this matter for penal order? This section has sought to identify a central
        mechanism by which foreign nationals and other ethnic minorities are left out of the welfare
        state: the principle of the folk as a structural barrier to incorporation. Weak
        incorporation can and often does lead to increased social control (e.g. criminalization,
        penalization), supporting a key insight in the sociology of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612468935">Aas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480612468935">Bosworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362480612468935">Melossi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1362480612468935">Solivetti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1362480612468935">Wacquant, 1999</xref>). This aspect of the folk concept
        demarcates those who belong from those who do not, and as primary marker of membership and
        nonmembership in the polity, it may actually underpin other equally important structural
        barriers to incorporation, including labor market discrimination, housing segregation, and
        denial of voting rights. The organizing principle of the People’s Home, the folk, and its
        negative impact on penal order (relatively high rates of foreign nationals in prison) is not
        the result of shifting political winds (although it is an intensifier) or an import from the
        neo-liberal west but is part of the deep structure of the society itself. The rise of
        welfare nationalism and its subsequent criminalization and penalization of ‘others’
        resonates because it comes from within. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612468935">Andersson (2009)</xref> explains, welfare nationalism is a
        way to restore the essence of the People’s Home, with its nostalgia and romantic longing for
        ethno-cultural belonging. This is necessary she explains because ‘European integration and
        the Others that it brings with it is seen as a threat to the architecture and values of the
        Model, its collective agreements, wage bargaining … [and to] Swedish self-image and
        identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612468935">Andersson, 2009</xref>: 241).
        Sweden is trying to hold on to its generous welfare state and recreate a particular image of
        itself. And like many other societies (USA, UK, Australia, France), Sweden is relying on
        criminalization to do so.</p>

      <title>Discussion: the limits of Nordic Exceptionalism</title>
      <p>In their ‘In defense of Scandinavian exceptionalism’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1362480612468935">John Pratt and Anna Eriksson (2012)</xref> explain the
        importance of studying and explaining cases like the Nordic countries that practice penal
        moderation, especially when most criminology has focused on more general and punitive
        trends. It is critical to understand the presence of counter trends and by doing so provide
        a more accurate description and explanation of contemporary penal order in all its variation
        and complexity. Despite the increase in research on comparative penal sanctioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362480612468935">Lacey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362480612468935">Nelken, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1362480612468935">Whitman, 2003</xref>), we still do not know enough about
        societies that develop and maintain more mild penal sanctioning. The NE thesis is a
        significant contribution to this collective endeavor.</p>
      <p>In making their argument, the authors warn against the tendency in criminology for
        researchers to only look for the most severe penal practices and the most punitive penal
        trends, they warn against the gloom and doom of ‘catastrophic criminology’, invoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362480612468935">Pat O’Malley’s (2000)</xref> terminology. In
        some sense, the present essay is an example of the dystopia in criminology, rooting out
        repressive uses of state power even in one of the most humane and mild penal orders. The
        catalogue of potential human rights violations (even in Sweden) illustrates the tendency
        well. However, it is still a necessary exercise for two reasons: first, the causal dynamics
        of the Swedish welfare state based on individual autonomy but limited individual rights have
        not been fully appreciated in relation to penal order; and second, as public criminologists
        we cannot turn a blind eye to repression, especially as it sits side by side with
        progressive social ideals that are peacocked around the world by elites and academics,
        overshadowing the people restricted, excluded, or expelled by the <italic>Nordic
          Way</italic>.</p>
      <p>What is gained by this exercise? What are we to make of the Nordic Exceptionalism thesis?
        How might we rethink the degree to which welfare state generosity does or does not lead to
        mild penal sanctioning? How might we rethink the role of social solidarity and mildness? Can
        we consider an alternative to social democracy for a more moderate or just penal
        sanctioning?</p>
      <p>The pattern of human rights violations does not necessarily discount the relative leniency
        of the Swedish penal order but it does require us to think about the limits on its
        humaneness. We need to take more seriously its double-sided nature. We may need a less
        elegant term to capture the dual nature of the Swedish penal order: one that is both humane
        in certain respects and inhumane in others. This duality is not stratified by the type of
        offender or particular social group but can affect all offenders at different stages of the
        criminal justice system. For instance, consider that the same offender could be subject to
        isolation during pre-trial detention but later sentenced to a low level ‘open prison’. It is
        also important to note that the infringement upon individual rights does not seem to be
        driven by the desire or need to degrade or humiliate the offender as in the case of some
        forms of American punishment identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1362480612468935">James Whitman’s (2003)</xref>
        <italic>Harsh Justice</italic>; it is not this kind of inhumanity. We are not talking about
        Sherriff Joe Arpaio’s chain gangs de-based in the Arizona desert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362480612468935">Lynch, 2009</xref>). Nor are they rogue actions of a few
        staff members. Rather the infringement on rights is used as a deliberate mechanism of state
        control, discipline, and in some cases, coercion. It is the hyper-rationality of the State
        that leads to these impositions. The lack of garishness or vulgarity in these restrictions
        may be what keeps this kind of repression invisible or palatable to the public. The duality
        of the in/humanity must be taken into account if we are to properly understand and explain
        the Nordic cases, a conclusion also reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1362480612468935">Peter Scharff Smith (2012)</xref>.</p>
      <p>To understand this paradox in the penal realm, we need to revisit the dynamics of the
        Swedish welfare state. This essay has argued that a more individualistic reading of the
        welfare state enables us to see how individual autonomy was both gained and lost through the
        State. It is this iron-cage that is critical to grasp if we are to explain how individual
        rights are underdeveloped and vulnerable in a place like Sweden. In gaining material
        well-being and autonomy, individuals gave up certain legal protections against the State.
        This reading of the welfare state downplays the centrality of social solidarity as necessary
        to and for welfare state generosity and identifies a break in social solidarity: the
        foundation of the society is based on a fractured concept of the <italic>folk</italic>. The
          <italic>folk, the people</italic>, in its democratic form can promote social solidarity
        but in its ethno-cultural form, <italic>a people</italic>, folk can inhibit social
        solidarity across diverse ethnic groups. Societies without strong social solidarity but a
        strong sense of equality and democratic spirit can produce elements of a mild penal regime.
        Weak individual rights compounded by an ethno- cultural basis of belonging create the
        conditions that make individuals, particularly those cast as outsiders or ‘others’,
        vulnerable to intrusive uses of state power. What makes the Swedish variant of the
          <italic>folk</italic> particularly problematic is its conflation of civic virtues with
        ethnic identity, it essentializes democracy as Swedish. Cultural or ethnic difference
        becomes suspect, conflated with intolerance and inequality. An ethno-cultural conception of
        citizenship not only acts as a structural barrier to incorporation where weak incorporation
        tends to increase criminalization and penalization, but this essentialist construction
        spills over into the penal realm where crime committed by foreign nationals is portrayed not
        as social or moral deprivation but as confirmation of difference, un-Swedishness. Offenders
        then need to be properly re-socialized, re-trained as Swedes, punished, excluded or
        expelled. Criminal aliens are the largest group subject to deportation in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362480612468935">Migrationsverket, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1362480612468935">Westfelt, 2008</xref>). At its worst, an
        ethno-cultural conception of citizenship provides fodder for welfare nationalism, a
        protective and sometimes aggressive stance against outsiders that has brought far-right
        parties to power across Europe in recent elections, even in Sweden where the Sweden
        Democrats were elected to Parliament in 2009 on an anti-immigrant campaign that linked
        foreigners to crime. Although their impact on policy is marginal the party is gaining ground
        and taking working class voters away from the Social Democratic party.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these structural features—essentialized civic virtue and the lack of
        procedural safeguards for individual rights and stronger anti-discrimination law (which
        would limit or prohibit states from acting out ethnic prejudices)—have major consequences
        for penal order: they create the conditions conducive to intrusive deprivations without
        providing much legal or social recourse. The duality of the welfare state at once can bring
        about individual autonomy and material well-being but infringes upon the rights and
        liberties of individuals. These features weaken the relative humaneness at the center of
        Nordic penal regimes.</p>
      <p>This essay has important implications for how public criminologists understand the dynamics
        of the welfare state, how it is simultaneously universal but exclusionary. This is important
        because the Nordic cases and their associated social democracy are often put forward on
        normative grounds as best practices for penal moderation. But what this analysis suggests is
        that a polity that lacks procedural protections creates the conditions that make certain
        individuals vulnerable to intrusive deprivations and violations of human dignity, often
        justified as a public good. These infringements tend to be submerged in most accounts of
        Nordic Exceptionalism but are nevertheless central to it. This analysis also suggests that a
        polity that emphasizes membership, particularly one rooted in an ethno-cultural conception,
        but lacks sufficient procedural protections will have difficulty incorporating foreign
        nationals and other new members and may instead come to rely on the criminal law and penal
        sanctioning to sort, classify, contain, or expel unwanted or undeserving ‘others’. All
        democracies face this dilemma. Global mobility has increased the flow of people across
        borders but no democracy has guaranteed the rights to residency to any nonmember. How
        democracies incorporate new members is vital to their social, moral, and economic
        development. Social democracy, particularly as it is tinged by welfare nationalism, is not
        the solution to a more just and equal penal order. We may find more traction in alternative
        political forms such as deliberative democracy, a form of political association and debate
        that seeks to protect individual liberties and is based on inclusionary principles (see
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362480612468935">Loader and Sparks, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1362480612468935">Taslitz, 2012</xref>). Deliberative
        democracy may promote more mild penal sanctioning without excluding perceived outsiders and
        without infringing upon individual rights.</p>
      <p>There are many features in the Nordic cases worth preserving and worth emulating but the
        social welfare state comes with its own set of limitations, exclusionary mechanisms, and
        barriers to human dignity that have not been fully understood in the penal field. This essay
        has sought to fill that gap.</p>
