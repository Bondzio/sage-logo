<p>In this issue of <italic>Economic and Industrial Democracy</italic>, aspects of non-union employee representation, management practices in call centres, works councils as well as various aspects of flexibility, to name a few, are discussed with examples from Germany, Denmark, Norway, Turkey, India, Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The first article in this issue, ‘Non-union employee representation, union avoidance and the managerial agenda’ by Jimmy Donaghey, University of Warwick, UK, Niall Cullinane, Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland, Tony Dundon, National University of Ireland Galway, Ireland, and Tony Dobbins, Bangor Business School, UK, discusses non-union employee representation, from a case study perspective. The authors suggest that traditional explanations of non-union employee representation, NER, need to be complemented with institutional factors as well. Also, the outcome of the experience is discussed in terms of why an outcome in terms of a positive sum body failed. Both institutional and actor-based factors were lacking in this case study. Factors which can explain the lack of enduring NER are further discussed by the authors.</p>
<p>The second article is entitled ‘High commitment management practices re-examined: The case of Indian call centres’, and is written by Premilla D’Cruz and Ernesto Noronha, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India. The authors investigate high commitment management (HCM) practices in call centres located in India. The interviews with Indian management in call centres were carried out in two steps. The authors found that the implementation of HCM practices was influenced by two crucial factors, the sociocultural milieu as well as the organizational agenda. These were identified as the main factors behind the failure of implementation of such practices. The authors further claim that the lack of consultation with employees, or their representatives, was crucial.</p>
<p>In the third article, ‘Underemployment in a gender-segregated labour market’, by Randi Kjeldstad and Erik H Nymoen, Statistics Norway, the authors discuss the development of underemployment in Norway in terms of a gendered labour market. The structure of underemployment differs between male and female dominated areas of the Norwegian labour market. By using labour force survey data, the authors find that the female underemployed are excluded to a larger extent from longer working contracts. Labour market characteristics were important in explaining the persistence of underemployment, and persistent gender structures were especially important in this respect.</p>
<p>In the article ‘Organizing training for union renewal: A case study analysis of the European Union steel industry’, by Dean Stroud, Cardiff University, UK, it is suggested that it is important to analyse the role of the unions with regard to training. This has broad implications in terms of the ongoing restructuring process. Based upon his study of the steel industry, the author suggests that it is possible to use the union’s potential for renewal by being proactive in restructuring processes. One key area is training, where the role of the unions is pivotal. The role of national and cross-national organizations is illuminated. The unions’ failure to mobilize in terms of training is discussed by the author.</p>
<p>Anna Ilsøe, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, discusses the role of flexicurity in the article ‘Signs of segmentation? A flexicurity perspective on decentralized collective bargaining in Denmark’. On the basis of five case studies, the author discusses how the role of flexicurity functions in decentralized collective bargaining. The results suggest two different outcomes. For several workers, the decentralized bargaining is an advantage, while for some workers the outcome is less advantageous, resulting in soft or hard versions of flexibility. In terms of outsider/insider theories, the results suggest that there is also a difference between workers in terms of flexibility capacity.</p>
<p>Another Scandinavian study, by Jon Erik Dølvik and Kristine Nergaard, Fafo, Institute for Labour and Social Research, Norway, titled ‘Variable pay, collective bargaining and trade unions: A comparison of machinery and banking companies in Norway’, discusses how the introduction of variable pay systems in Norway has affected collective bargaining and the role of trade unions. The authors find that existing industrial relations have handled the transformation smoothly. Marked differences could however be found between the two sectors. In the machinery companies, few changes were noticed, while a marked tendency towards more variable pay was found in the banking sector. The role of trust is further explored by the authors.</p>
<p>The article ‘What triggers the establishment of a works council?’, by Jens Mohrenweiser, Centre for European Economic Research, Germany, Paul Marginson, Warwick Business School, UK, and Uschi Backes-Gellner, University of Zurich, Switzerland, discusses how works councils are established, based on German data. They found that the management was active in one-third of the cases. In cases of changes of ownership and mergers, for example, there is a higher probability that a works council will be established.</p>
<p>The final article in this issue, ‘The political economy of Turkish Conservative Democracy as a governmental strategy of industrial relations between Islamism, neoliberalism and social democracy’, by Taner Akan, Kocaeli University, Turkey, discusses aspects of IR in Turkey from a critical point of view. The author suggests that Conservative Democracy as an IR governmental strategy can be associated with a ‘hard pragmatism’, with severe consequences for the rapid decline in trade union membership.</p>
