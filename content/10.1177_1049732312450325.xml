<abstract>
<p>In this study we explored how those recovering from addiction negotiated self, and the role supported accommodation played in the journey back from addiction. Transcripts from 11 in-depth interviews were analyzed by 2 coders who identified the most salient themes relevant to the self in recovery within the personal contexts of participants. The participants noted that reclaiming the self that had been lost to addiction was of primary importance to them. The recovery journey exposed a self that had reached the lowest point in life; one that was hardly recognizable; one that was undesirable. Engaging with supported accommodation provided participants with a sanctuary within which to reclaim the self, and was seen as central to their recovery.</p>

<body>
<p>Recovering from addiction is a highly complex and problematic process involving multiple personal and contextual factors. Although it is recognized that social support, self-efficacy, motivation, and the physical environment in which recovering addicts find themselves are all important dimensions that are involved in recovery, a fundamental task is the construction of a self-identity that does not incorporate the characteristic of “substance abuser” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450325">Hughes, 2007</xref>). What triggers the search for self-identity in adolescence is widely accepted as a stage in which a developmental crisis is confronted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450325">Erikson, 1968</xref>). Erikson posited that during adolescence one is faced with the crisis of identity vs. role confusion, with consolidating one’s sense of self being the successful outcome, and confusion with respect to who one is and how one fits into the social world being the alternative.</p>
<p>The developmental factors associated with identity formation begin before birth, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450325">Akhtar and Samuel (1996)</xref>. At that point, parental wishes and personal contexts are influential. The newborn learns much about the self through interactions with significant others, especially the mother or primary caregiver. For example, the messages received might reflect a self that is worthy of love and attention, or might reflect a self that is unworthy and lacking a social place. Secure attachment is also seen as indicative of development of a positive sense of self as the child separates from the parent in a safe environment. During adolescence, identity formation poses numerous struggles related to gender, social standing, power, and autonomy (Akhtar &amp; Samuel). The phenomenon of self represents the recognition of the “true self”: that which remains central to the person regardless of context.</p>
<p>These theoretical explanations for the search for identity are not necessarily explicitly relevant to the recovering addict. What often primes the addict to launch into the journey of self-discovery is reaching a point of degradation wherein a fundamental crisis of existence, rather than a developmental crisis, is experienced. This confronts the addict to change direction, to “not sink any lower.” Often, this point is triggered by a particular experience in a person’s life, such as deterioration in health, facing possible jail or custody disputes, strained financial resources, and family dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450325">McKay &amp; McLellan, 1998</xref>). In many instances, such events have led to those engaging in substance abuse recognizing their problematic lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450325">Hanninen &amp; Koski-Jannes, 1999</xref>). With this epiphany came the need to reconstruct an identity and lifestyle without addiction, often accompanied by changes in one’s living environment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450325">Doukas and Cullen (2009)</xref> questioned whether a person who has experienced long-term substance abuse could ever establish an identity that does not incorporate the dimensions of a recovering addict, suggesting that recovery is an ongoing process. This stance has significant implications for the individual, because it implies that the addictive identity needs to be integrated into the new identity. If the alternate stance is accepted, recovery is seen as a life event that, once achieved, involves the creation of a new identity wherein the old self is sloughed off.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450325">Hughes (2007)</xref> took a more optimistic perspective, and wrote of the capacity for the transformation of self-identity from user to nonuser, a journey that is achieved by adopting positive identity formation practices. One important arena wherein positive identity practices can be fostered is within the person’s social network. The development and maintenance of stable, personal relationships has long been recognized as influential on positive psychological well-being and health in the general adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450325">Ryff &amp; Singer, 2000</xref>). As such, suggesting that there is a role for social support and a need to develop and maintain healthy social networks in recovery from problem substance abuse is a reasonable assumption, and has in fact been associated with recovery and the maintenance of long-term sobriety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450325">McIntosh &amp; McKeganey, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Just because social networks exist does not automatically ensure that the members have a positive influence on the recovering addict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450325">Goehl, Nunes, Quitkin, &amp; Hilton, 1993</xref>). In fact, some social connections, particularly those established during the addiction phase of a person’s life, might facilitate relapse rather than recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450325">Havassy, Hall, &amp; Wasserman, 1991</xref>). Yet these social networks have been significant and, at times, the sole social support—a contextual factor that is not easily ignored. Adding to the complexity is the distancing, with time, of social networks that are absent from the addiction context. Although these former friendships might reemerge and have the potential to underpin “healthy” networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450325">Wills, 1990</xref>), some members might be insensitive to or unaware of the problems inherent in drug and/or alcohol cessation. They might also elicit feelings of inadequacy in those recovering from addiction, resulting in further distancing and isolation.</p>
<p>At the time they are withdrawing from substance use, offering structural and functional assistance in the form of stable housing and the provision of opportunities to increase positive social support networks has been demonstrated as helpful to many recovering addicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450325">de Leon &amp; Wexler, 2009</xref>). When independent living might be a daunting prospect that many might not be prepared to take, transitional housing through supported accommodation might be beneficial. Supported accommodation is provisional housing for those emerging from rehabilitation, to provide them with shelter and time to adjust before attempting independent living.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450325">Shinebourne and Smith’s (2009)</xref> in-depth case study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312450325">Ward’s (2010)</xref> theoretical observations have provided valuable insights into the relationship between recovery from addiction and self-identity. Although there has also been significant research into the search for self-identity after trauma (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450325">Gelech &amp; Desjardins, 2011</xref>), what is lacking in the research literature is investigation to gain an understanding of how recovering addicts perceive their journey to sobriety, and whether they see the discovery of self as part of that journey as they engage with supported accommodation. Consequently, in this study, we undertook a qualitative approach to come to an understanding of the meanings people give to the notion of self in their journey back from addiction. Eleven men and women who had spent time recovering at a specialized supportive accommodation facility told of their experiences, influences, motivations, and, of greatest relevance to this study, their identity as they struggled to free themselves of addiction.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312450325" sec-type="methods">
<title>Informants and Method</title>
<p>The supported accommodation facility and the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee provided approval for the study prior to its commencement. We used a broadly phenomenological methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450325">Norlyk &amp; Harder, 2010</xref>) whereby participants were given the opportunity to share their experiences of addiction, the journey to recovery, and supported accommodation. A purposive sample was necessary because it was important to achieve specificity and better understand the ways people construct the notion of self in recovery. The inclusion criteria we used were being over the age of 18 years and having spent time recovering from drug and/or alcohol addiction in supported accommodation. Participation was voluntary. The sample comprised 6 men and 5 women aged between 20 and 46 years (mean age, 30.73 years) who were willing to share their experiences. Participants reported their age at substance-abuse onset, which ranged from 12 to 14 years, with a mean age of 14.82 years. The number of times participants had been in rehabilitation ranged between one and 13 times. Eight of the participants had been in rehabilitation four times or less, with four of these having had the experience only once. Participants were encouraged to speak openly about their experiences of life as they engaged in recovery from addiction.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312450325">
<title>The Interviews</title>
<p>We conducted semistructured, one-on-one, in-depth interviews to gather data for this study. Each participant was encouraged to speak openly and honestly about his or her experiences on the road to recovery, including helpful encounters and perceived barriers to succeeding. We adopted a recursive style that allowed dialogue pertinent to the research question to take place, but were in no way prescriptive of the conversations. By employing this style we allowed the participants more freedom of expression and encouraged a deeper engagement between participant and interviewer. We commenced each of the interviews with an open-ended question about the participant’s experience of addiction. We also explored aspects relevant to background history, including childhood memories, family life, and introduction to drugs and alcohol, because this permitted a deeper understanding of each participant’s journey to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312450325">Groenewald, 2004</xref>). Additionally, we made field notes reflecting our observations and personal awareness at the time of the interviews; these were used as part of the preliminary analysis. The interviews ranged in length from 45 to 80 minutes and were audiotaped with the informed consent of each participant. Staff members at the supported accommodation facility were available to participants who might need further assistance after the interviews took place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312450325">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We recorded the interviews and transcribed them to identify themes. We then read the transcriptions several times to get an overall “feel” for the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450325">Giorgi, 1997</xref>). This formed the basis for identifying and extracting themes that related to recovering from addiction. The themes represented the meanings embedded in the words of the participants. We reached consensus regarding the themes after reviewing the transcripts independently. The process of coding and categorizing the data ensured that we explored the concepts that had been identified.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732312450325" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>For all participants interviewed, regardless of the number of times each had been in rehabilitation, the dominant theme to emerge was that the journey of recovery from addiction was primarily a task of formulating an identity or notion of self without addiction. Within this overarching theme, the most salient subthemes to emerge in relation to the notion of self in recovery from addiction were meeting the challenge of the fundamental crisis of existence; acceptance of self-responsibility for change; recognizing the undesirable self; searching for the nonaddictive self; claiming the new identity; and the role of supported accommodation in the journey toward self. By exploring each of these subthemes, a poignant sense of the deep struggle to hold on to the new self as distinct from the addict self became evident.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312450325">
<title>The Self in Crisis</title>
<p>Ego developmental and humanistic theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450325">Erikson (1968)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450325">Maslow (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312450325">Rogers (1967)</xref> maintained that our purpose is to strive to reach our full potential. This striving gives a sense of purpose in life and impacts positively on self-concept and worth. The goal for most people is to maintain a positive self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450325">Stapel &amp; Schwinghammer, 2004</xref>). Participants in this study, recovering from problematic substance use, also recognized the importance of achieving a positive sense of self, but spoke of the struggle to crawl from what they recognized as their lowest moments:
<disp-quote><p>I felt really, really low. I could have been doing so much more. . . . I would have finished Year 12 [in school] and probably went to uni [university/ college]. I probably would have had my own place and a good job and all that. And instead, I was living in my car. I was probably smelly. . . . You know, I was at my lowest point. I started working as a prostitute, and I felt at my lowest, lowest, lowest.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The people the recovering addicts described themselves to be at this point of crisis were not whom they desired to be—nor whom they had expected to be. There had been aspirations, potential, capabilities, and enthusiasm, but with addiction there was poverty, aversion, despair, and shame. It was “like being the king of the shit, really,” someone looked on by others as lacking credibility and reliability, someone unworthy of their trust. This was, for the participants, the lowest they had found themselves; a point from which they perceived they could go no further down: they had reached “rock bottom.” Being confronted with this fundamental crisis of existence, or existential crisis, has previously been identified in the literature as one of the dominant reasons for desiring change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450325">McIntosh &amp; McKeganey, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312450325">
<title>Acceptance of Self-Responsibility in the Change Process</title>
<p>Being able to reflect on the people they had become at this lowest point was the beginning of their search for help, and for these participants, this included engaging in supported accommodation. They became aware of the need to transform their self-perception by striving for a more meaningful and positive self-concept as a primary factor in that recovery. What was emerging for them was the person who might have been; the person each had hoped to become; the person each wanted others to encounter: “I wanted to be seen as a reliable person and a trustworthy person, and I wanted to get my credibility back.” Accepting responsibility led to the need for change motivated by a desire to be viewed by loved ones, and particularly by their children, as something other than a “useless drug addict.” The need to be respected and acknowledged as a person of worth was a significant step in their journeys toward stability and more “normal” lives; a significant step toward making life-enhancing change:
<disp-quote><p>I’ve got a responsibility to provide a responsible and safe life for him. . . . I suppose being a dad, a good dad too, that’s very important for me—really, really important . . . stable job, stable living environment. All that. Just stable. That’s how I see my life going. . . . That’s the big thing for me, stability now.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312450325">
<title>Recognizing the Undesirable Self</title>
<p>Negotiating their sense of self-worth along the recovery journey posed numerous challenges, one of which was rediscovering the potential within, and finding that which was not the “addict.” This process of rediscovery meant facing up to aspects of the self they would rather not claim, forgiving themselves and moving forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450325">Bowden, 1998</xref>). As one participant reflected, she was at her “lowest.” She had nowhere to call “home,” and worked as a prostitute to support her drug habit. This was far from a desirable self, far from the person she knew she could have become except for her addiction. Besides such negative self-images, participants were faced with negative images communicated to them by others. These images form what is known as “the looking glass self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450325">Vaughan &amp; Hogg, 2002</xref>): the self as reflected in the eyes of others. These images were of the “druggie,” the “useless,” and the “thief.” These were often overwhelming, because “you fight your own demons every day. To have to fight others’ is just too hard . . . to have to take on board other people’s opinions and preconceptions [of you] is just . . . ” [sighs].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312450325">
<title>Searching for the Nonaddictive Self</title>
<p>The dimension of “addict” dominated their notion of self prior to the recovery journey—a person who was unworthy of lining up with others on their journey through life; unworthy of help; unworthy of hope: “While being a drug addict, you’re told you’re useless. You’re told you’re no good. You’re told you don’t fit into the lineup.” Their self-perceptions as worthwhile people had been shattered by their lives as addicts. In their struggle to reconstruct a positive identity and credibility, they had to undergo self-reflection, equating to deep soul searching, to reach self-acceptance. This process inevitably brought discomfort as the participants moved away from the more familiar and convenient surface picture they had created in addiction, to the depth of reality:
<disp-quote><p>You have got to look deep, and you have got to find things that you’re not too fond of, and you have got to acknowledge the fact that you’re not fond of yourself—and who wants to do that? Not many people!</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312450325">
<title>Claiming the New Identity: No Room for the “Addict”</title>
<p>Accepting responsibility for their addictive lives was a necessary step toward reconstructing and reclaiming the nonaddict self. Until now, motivation to seek treatment had been defeated by the belief that they were happy with life as an addict. Self-reflection led to the growing awareness that their lifestyles were not conducive to happiness, and that they had little control over the directions their choices were taking them:
<disp-quote><p>I did not want to be feeling like that. Didn’t want to not be free, and I didn’t want to be living this existence and being so reliant on something . . . a drug to make me feel normal.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Part of the reclamation journey of the self meant a distancing from that which had earlier defined them in terms of addiction. There was a distinct need to distinguish themselves from other addicts. Social comparison served to determine the participants’ standings along a relevant dimension. By making downward social comparisons, they could maintain a higher level of self-esteem and enhance their self-worth. The following comment highlights one participant’s pride in recognizing an important part of his self-identity that he saw clearly as separate from the identity of an addict: “I never have got involved with crime . . . never robbed a house, never broken into a house.”</p>
<p>Distancing him- or herself from crime and from those who committed drug-related crimes replaced the notion of the criminal worthy of punishment with the notion of the person in need of assistance to break the cycle of addiction into which he or she was drawn—the cycle that had led to dealing drugs even though “I didn’t want to deal drugs anymore, I was sick of it. I wasn’t sick of the money, but was sick of all the scumbags [undesirable people] that go with it.” Refraining from such activity set them apart: “I had friends who were dealing; I wouldn’t do that. I had friends who were prostituting; I wouldn’t do that. You know, friends who were breaking into other people’s houses, and I wouldn’t do that.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312450325">
<title>Supported Accommodation: The Good, the Bad, and the Indifferent</title>
<p>The experience of supported accommodation was often referred to as a “sanctuary,” an “escape,” or “a refuge,” a place that addressed participants’ primary need of shelter while allowing them to “draw breath” and relax from pressures common to those who are homeless, jobless, and at their lowest point. It also allowed them to reestablish their lives, often after incarceration. Others expressed relief from anxiety and worry about where they might otherwise have ended up. This was particularly pertinent for long-term users with a history of crime: “Now the pressure is off. If the pressure wasn’t off, we don’t know where we’d be now. We might have fallen back into the crime to get the money to get back into private rent or whatever.” One participant remarked, “I got out of jail with nothing, and this has allowed me to reestablish my life.”</p>
<p>Respondents were at different stages regarding their substance use, yet what was commonly expressed was the need to be “ready” for change rather than just using supported accommodation as a place to stay. Some admitted to taking advantage of the situation, as exemplified in the statement, “I didn’t expect to quit [drug use] or nothing, just wanted a place to stay.” Yet this “place to stay” was also representative of a sense of self beyond substance use. It represented ownership, and respondents spoke of being protective of their sober environment. Referring to previous drug associates, one participant stated that he “really didn’t want them around my house . . . this is sort of like my place.” Another also seemed overwhelmed when she realized that, “Wow, I’ve got my own house.” With this sense of ownership also came a sense of responsibility and pride, because “we took care of everything; it was like our own personal things.”</p>
<p>The accommodation was indicative of only part of the story, and respondents expressed their appreciation for the supportive aspect of what supported accommodation meant to them. As one participant pointed out, the context in which this took place was beneficial because “it gets you used to how it’s gonna be when you get to your own place.” Many of the beneficial aspects of supported accommodation were attributed to the caseworkers who played hands-on, supportive roles, particularly in learning coping skills and exposure to appropriate resources:
<disp-quote><p>It was good because she [the caseworker] did provide us with heaps of resources . . . referred us everywhere. She was helpful in most things. Like she was always trying to get me to do activities or get me back into work.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Having a place to call home provided further opportunities to achieve previously unattainable goals such as being able to study, finding part-time work, and reconnecting with estranged family members. Without these, there was little chance of feeling good about life, or about oneself:
<disp-quote><p>I feel good. Yeah, I feel good. I’m doing a lot of things, and I’m achieving a lot of things, and I’ve got a lot of things for myself that I didn’t think I’d ever have. I’ve got the best relationship with my family.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Supported accommodation was not the answer to all problems, however. Negative social influences, social isolation, and a lack of enforcing the rules were all perceived as barriers to moving toward a self without addiction. It has been established that sharing accommodation with someone in a similar position to oneself provides help in overcoming common problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312450325">Rose, 2002</xref>). However, this is not always the case, and for some participants in this study, such partnerships worked against this by encouraging relapse:
<disp-quote><p>I was doing all right, but the guy they put me in [supported accommodation] with was an alcoholic. He was smoking pot [marijuana] . . . so I ended up smoking pot, went and got some speed [amphetamines]. You know [sighs], it just started all over again.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others were wary of forming attachments, felt uncomfortable about living with a stranger, and were quite often resentful about sharing their newfound “sacred” space:
<disp-quote><p>I was living with another woman and speed had been her problem drug. Even though it wasn’t heroin she was using . . . she still had dealers coming to the house. Like, if you’re going to use, go out of the house, ’cause it taints that space . . . and she didn’t respect that.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It seemed that for some participants, maintaining abstinence was not their primary goal, which undermined the supportive context in supported accommodation that others have found essential in recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450325">Heslin, Hamilton, Singzon, Smith, &amp; Anderson, 2011</xref>). Heslin et al. found that such mutual support in residences that required sobriety led to family-like relationships that provided members with an opportunity to become independent within a respectful and accepting environment that promoted personal development.</p>
<p>By far the most commonly expressed issues for those with no current employment or structure in their lives were boredom and loneliness. They spoke of often feeling socially isolated and cut off from friends and family, especially if they were living in the suburbs, away from their usual environment:
<disp-quote><p>I’ve been very lonely. I suppose growing up on the southeastern side of the city and now being here. There are not too many people I know so the only time I do have people is when she [the caseworker] comes out and has a chat with me.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They looked forward to visits from their caseworkers, but did not believe that a visit once a week was enough to keep them focused on recovery. One person commented, “It was good [the caseworker visits], but at the same time, it wasn’t enough. You know, one day out of the whole week we’d see her.”</p>
<p>Although it was often necessary to remove people from their former social and physical environments in an effort to aid their recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450325">Polcin, 2001</xref>), it seemed apparent that for the participants in this study, there was a need to put in place other forms of structured activities with which to counteract the boredom and loneliness that could lead to relapse. Activities such as occasionally getting “all the people from supported accommodation to go to the movies, or go sailing, or have a picnic or something,” might be a necessary part of supported accommodation to assist residents to establish, consolidate, and strengthen the nonaddictive self.</p>
<p>The perception that the rules were not strict enough was largely related to (a) who was allocated a place in supported accommodation, (b) the setting of boundaries, and (c) whether these boundaries were being enforced. Many of those seeking supported accommodation had a higher level of need than originally anticipated and, as such, were limited in their capacity to abstain from use. This led to some participants expressing concern that there were others who were more deserving of a place than some who had actually been allocated one:
<disp-quote><p>I think they should choose a little bit more carefully, the people they put into supported accommodation. I understand that everyone needs it, but not everyone deserves it. . . . People who are just going to admit it when they’re busted [caught using drugs in the house] . . . well, they don’t deserve it.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Those who were classified as “determined” tended to have greater financial and emotional resources. These included steady relationships, structure in their lives, employment, and positive attitudes about their future, all aspects that related to a stronger self-identity. For these respondents, stricter guidelines might not have been an issue because they were already prepared to make the necessary changes to achieve success. However, for those who were ambivalent, especially those with limited resources, a less tolerant system might have seemed overly punitive and might have hindered their long-term recovery. One participant pointed out, “It depends on the individual situation. . . . If they can get work and they can get private accommodation, that’s good for them, but that’s not our situation.”</p>
<p>Relapse was common among those with limited resources who were ambivalent to change and who were vulnerable to the influence of negative social networks. Some participants were not yet able to fully realize the potential value of the stable, supportive environment offered by supported accommodation in their journey to recovery. Others saw it as an escape from the nightmare of their substance abuse—a place to rediscover the self without addiction. The meaning and importance of this to these clients cannot be understated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to gain a deeper understanding of the journey of recovery associated with problem substance abuse in terms of the impact on a person’s sense of self. Several hallmarks were noted as commonly experienced in this journey. These included reaching “rock bottom,” acceptance of responsibility for change, recognizing the undesirable self, searching for the nonaddict self, and integration of the self within a supportive environment. The identification of the themes within the journey was important, because they provided possible signposts for recovering addicts who could explore them with a more conscious reflection as they made the journey. Whether it is valid to suggest that the journey has an ontogenic hierarchical nature, however, is something that requires investigation.</p>
<p>The importance of a positive environment within which the recovering addict made the journey of discovery and integration of the nonaddicted self was explored in detail. Although supported accommodation was regarded as an invaluable source of such support, it was found that the potential for relapse was increased in some instances, especially among those who were feeling more vulnerable and were resistant to change. Others found it a place to rediscover the self without addiction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450325">Doukas and Cullen (2009)</xref> had proffered the important question with regard to the capacity of former addicts to release themselves from the obligation of maintaining the “addict” component as part of their self-identity, a belief strongly grounded in the medical model as well as many self-help groups. By becoming aware of and understanding the journey to self, from the journeyman’s perspective, the current study offers some evidence not previously reported that there was a strong desire by the recovering addicts to struggle with the issue of self-identity, and that the notion of a self free of addiction was important. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the role of supported accommodation needs to be better defined and recognized as an important environment in which this journey to self can be undertaken.</p>
