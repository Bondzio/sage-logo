<abstract>
<p>We underscore the importance of this compilation in our response to the major contribution on the histories of the five major ethnic minority psychological associations (EMPAs). The description of the formation, mission, goals, and activities of the EMPAs will serve as a useful tool to educate counseling psychologists and other professionals about the under-examined contributions of the EMPAs in promoting psychology. There are lessons that the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP) can learn from the EMPAs in terms of fostering a sense of belonging within the organization and strengthening its involvement of students and early career professionals. We hope that the SCP can join with EMPAs on future collective social justice efforts and that SCP can serve as an ally in promoting the interest and activities of the EMPAs.</p>

<p>The authors of this major contribution on the connections between the ethnic minority psychological associations (EMPAs) and counseling psychology are to be commended. The issue underscores two critical points: (a) The Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP) continues to play a leadership role within the American Psychological Association in acknowledging the contributions of racial and ethnic minority psychologists and the need to provide culturally and linguistically relevant services to the diverse communities in which we serve, and (b) the history and development of counseling psychology is intricately entwined with that of other organizations such as the EMPAs. The authors compiled an impressive set of articles that serves to educate SCP broader constituents of the role and contributions of psychologists of color and the national psychological associations whose interests serve specific racial and ethnic groups, which surprisingly has gone relatively unexplored within our field. For example, although counseling psychologists spearheaded efforts within the APA to adopt multicultural competence guidelines and are active in each of the EMPAs discussed, in the field these voices and contributions remain under-examined.</p>
<p>There is a lot to like about the major contribution, including providing readers with an accessible brief history of each of the EMPAs. We envision the collection being assigned in professional seminars and other applied counseling psychology-related courses. In our response, we outline what we believe are the strengths of the major contributions. We also provide a discussion of contextual information we believe is missing from the text. Also, we identify additional recommendations about lessons that the SCP can learn from the EMPAs. Too often we lose sight of the ways we learn and grow from our interactions with others. These observations are based on our involvement in EMPAs as a professional (first author) and as students (second and third authors). We end with suggestions about ways that the SCP can serve as an ally organization to support the aims and missions of EMPAs while respecting the autonomy of each association.</p>
<p>A strength of this major contribution is the accessibility of the information. The writing is likely to draw in readers from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, not just people of color. All of the articles presented in this major contribution highlight their respective EMPAs as supportive, culturally responsive environments that focus on the needs of psychologists of color and the communities they serve. Each essay conveys the history of the EMPAs in a way that highlights the needs of psychologists of color; less emphasis is placed on the deficits of predominantly White associations. For example, when describing the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012441377">Wong (1981)</xref> explained the birth of the organization as necessary to address the “absence of a network for Asian American psychologists and their relatively minimal influence and representation in professional psychology” (p. 26).</p>
<p>The consistent format in which the articles are written aids in the flow of the narrative and, moreover, allows for a careful examination of the similarities and differences between the EMPAs. Each article provides a section on the historical foundation of its respective EMPA and includes a discussion of the organization’s mission statement and values. This is the only publication on this information that we know of, thus introducing the reader to multiple histories of national psychological organizations. Of course, there are articles describing the formation of individual psychological associations, but they are not compiled in one location as the authors of this major contribution have done. This provides readers with a broader view of the development of the EMPAs and allows for a comparison of the histories and activities of each association; we are provided a collective story underscoring the ways in which the histories of the associations are intertwined and, yet, are independent and distinct. The discussion of trail-blazing scholars further illustrates the ways in which people and ideas influence and are influenced by the multiple spaces of involvement. For example, Derald Wing Sue was a founding member of the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA) in 1972, and nearly three decades later, he served as president of the SCP. In this role, he was able to bring his knowledge learned in the AAPA to inform practice in the SCP.</p>
<p>Although the histories of each association were provided in the major contribution, a general discussion of the sociohistorical circumstances in which the EMPAs collectively emerged would have helped to further contextualize their development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012441377">Obasi, Speight, Row, Clark, and Turner-Essel (2012</xref>; this issue) described the context in which the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) was formed. This discussion included the political issues of the 1960s, including the independence movements in Africa. But, these facts are unique to the development of ABPsi. It is no surprise that some iteration of four of the EMPAs (i.e., AAPA, ABPsi, National Latino Psychological Association [NLPA], Society of Indian Psychology [SIP]) was formed within 5 years of one another. Each of the associations arose out of the social and political unrest within our country; they emerged on the coattails of the Black, Brown, Red, and Yellow power movements and at a time in which the country was fighting an unjust war abroad while people within the borders were fighting for equality on the home front. The formations of these associations occurred during a time in which people demanded that their bodies, ideas, and community needs were reflected in the academy. Mapping onto the social unrest in society and in higher education, discontent within psychology from people of color grew from a grumble to a roar. Thus, the non-APA EMPAs were formed during a transformative period in U.S. history, one in which space to identify multiple forms of oppression was demanded and in which increasing models for autonomy and agency emerged, allowing for institution building to meet the unique needs of specific communities. The SCP was also touched by these events; it opened the doors for counseling psychology scholars to explore issues of race and multiculturalism.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012441377">
<title>Promoting Belonging, Creating Networks: Learning From Others</title>
<p>The lifeline of our associations is the quality of involvement of students and early career professionals—they are the future! The SCP has worked hard to encourage participation by students and early career professionals. These efforts have included incorporating student voices on the executive board through the Student Affiliates of Seventeen (SAS) representatives and encouraging leadership involvement from early career professionals. However, given the size of the society and the fact that the conferences occur as part of the larger (and overwhelming) APA convention meetings, the society is fighting an uphill battle. We believe that the SCP can learn invaluable lessons from practices and initiatives within the EMPAs.</p>
<p>The EMPAs have done a good job of encouraging active participation from students and early career professionals. They have identified ways to create a professionally affirming environment that promotes a sense of “home” and belonging. One such method used to reach out to emerging professionals is mentoring and networking opportunities. For example, APA Division 45–the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues established the Links and Shoulders program in the mid-1990s as a way to address the career development needs of racial and ethnic minority graduate students and early career professionals. An intimate space is created at APA conventions in which elders and more established professionals can mentor emerging professionals; this space also creates leadership development opportunities across a range of racial and ethnic groups. Participants of Links and Shoulders speak highly of the program, and in 2011 the program received the Richard M. Suinn Minority Achievement Award.</p>
<p>The EMPAs also build community through the expression of common ethnic cultural traditions; they promote cultural pride as an essential complement to professional development, especially at national conferences. In addition to scholarly presentations, art and cultural practices are incorporated into conference activities that in turn help affirm professional identities and cultural pride. At the NLPA conferences, for example, they serve a myriad of dishes from around Latin America (e.g., <italic>pan dulce</italic> and <italic>café con leche</italic>); ABPsi and SIP honor elders through formal conference programming, and elders are a part of the decision making and functioning of the associations. The honoring of elders for some communicates the importance of traditions and notion of “place” for all members of the community.</p>
<p>The SCP social hours during the APA convention are designed to promote connection and networking opportunities. However, these social hours are often perceived by younger members as intimidating, social cliques that are difficult to penetrate. We encourage the SCP to identify additional ways to bring in new members. We believe that new practices should be established to help the SCP create a welcoming community for all of its members, a place in which emerging professionals feel like they are valued members and that they belong. Some of these new practices should consider ways in which the SCP can carve out more intimate spaces at convention to connect more seasoned professionals with students and early career professionals. We like the idea that student voices are explicitly incorporated into many of the EMPAs’ conferences. In this vein, the SCP could sponsor student and early career professional “feedback” sessions in which they have an opportunity to share with SCP leadership and members their needs and concerns. In addition, we recommend finding network and mentoring opportunities between conventions. Drawing on the role of elders in the EMPAs, the SCP could pair elders with students or early career professionals to promote mentoring; elders could be encouraged to share stories of their own professional development and provide guidance as emerging professionals negotiate their career paths. This type of intergenerational mentoring could serve to highlight the role of both elders and emerging professionals within the SCP. Other recommendations center on the creative use of new media between conventions to better serve our constituents and to demonstrate that people have a place within the society and contribute to its development.</p>
<p>Consistent with this set of recommendations is the issue of promotion of leadership development. A strength of the SCP is the investment that they continually show toward student involvement. The SAS actively promotes student involvement via a range of methods including the Program Representatives Network and their Facebook site. Also, at the more senior level, the SCP actively seeks involvement and representation of racial and ethnic minority professionals. For example, the SCP is one of the few divisions within the APA that has a dedicated council of representative seat for a racial and ethnic minority member. Having said this, there are additional ways in which the SCP can further increase the amount and quality of student and early career participation by following the EMPAs’ models for involving students in leadership opportunities. For example, the NLPA has the Mentores y Lideres program, which is a special interest group within the NLPA dedicated to leadership training of students and early career professionals. The AAPA also invests in leadership development via the Division of Students of AAPA, whose mission is to “unify and strengthen the student voice and provide important means to foster the development of future leaders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012441377">Asian American Psychological Association Division of Students, n.d.</xref>) and the Leadership Fellows program, which is designed to nurture the leadership skills of early career professionals.</p>
<p>The SCP is making headway into providing leadership opportunities to students and early career professionals, but more is needed. As part of Y. Barry Chung’s 2012 presidential initiative, he held the first SCP leadership academy in which a diverse group of students and early career professionals participated. The SCP has also partnered with the Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests (CNPAAEMI) on a leadership institute; CNPAAEMI consists of the presidents of the EMPAs and is designed to promote collaborative efforts among the EMPAs. The CNPAAEMI Leadership Development Institute (CLDI) received funding from the Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training for the inaugural year-long institute that will launch at the Division 45 biennial conference in May 2012. The SCP has been involved in the development and support of the CLDI and will participate in the inaugural institute. Building on these initial efforts, the SCP could also implement more permanent leadership training opportunities as have many of the EMPAs. We particularly like the idea of establishing a special interest group committed to the leadership of students and early career professionals. Any sustained SCP leadership effort should continue to have as one of its goals to provide inclusive leadership training opportunities to the full diversity of its members.</p>
<p>In sum, there are lessons that the SCP can learn from the excellent practices within the EMPAs that promote a sense of belonging to the organization and foster the participation and development of emerging professionals. These practices are culturally embedded for each group and help to establish a sense of cultural pride. Moreover, these activities are “best practices” in terms of involving and developing future leaders in any organization.</p>

<title>Serving as an Ally: Future Directions in Building Connections</title>
<p>The authors of this major contribution have done an excellent job of identifying future directions in terms of continuing to develop strong collaborative relationships between the EMPAs and the SCP. We agree with the author’ assertion that given the shared values on the role of social justice, intentional partnering between the SCP and the EMPAs makes sense. The difficulty is in building such alliances in which partners have equal voice in defining the collective projects and the strategies to achieve a shared goal; this challenge is exacerbated when there is unequal access to resources among the groups and there is a history of distrust based on the social location of the groups and their members. So, the key question for us is, how can the SCP serve as an ally to the EMPAs while acknowledging and respecting their autonomy and without abusing its relative privilege due to resources? We do not have an answer to this question. Many of the recommendations provided in the major contribution get at the complexities involved in answering the question. As a way to initiate these collaborative ties, perhaps the SCP can engage in conversation with the EMPAs to identify common interests. Is it possible to get on a future CNPAAEMI agenda? Is there interest in collaborating with the SCP, and if so, at what level?</p>
<p>We are drawn to the idea of finding ways that SCP can serve as an ally by appropriately using the power afforded to the profession within existing structures. For example, building on the authors’ recommendation about promoting EMPA journals as valued through highlighting the scholarship in newsletters and websites, we also recommend that the SCP promote the importance of these journals as appropriate peer-reviewed scholarly outlets to publish in. This means encouraging researchers and students to submit manuscripts to these outlets and, moreover, educating departments and colleges about the meaning of these journals to our field; this is particularly important for scholars going up for tenure and promotion. We offer a quick example to illustrate the subtle ways in which EMPA journals can be devalued within the academy. After a student completed a presentation on her thesis project, a faculty member asked the student where she planned to submit a manuscript based on her work. The faculty person encouraged her to submit the manuscript to a more mainstream counseling psychology journal outlet after she indicated that she planned to submit the manuscript to the <italic>Journal of Black Psychology</italic> (<italic>JBP</italic>). Although the person argued that the reason to submit the journal to one of the other outlets was to help counseling psychology professionals better understand the topic area, inherent in the comment was an implicit critique about <italic>JBP</italic> and its impact in psychological studies. We should strive to create a culture within our profession and our training that scholarship published in EMPA journals is also part of a cadre of acceptable journals that we identify as supporting our mission.</p>
<p>In sum, we fully support the idea of finding ways in which the SCP and EMPAs can strengthen their collaborative ties. Initiating a conversation about what these efforts may look like, and to what end, seems like an important starting point. In addition, in consulting with the EMPAs, the SCP could begin to identify ways in which it can serve as an ally in supporting the goals and missions of the EMPAs.</p>
