<abstract>
<p>The measurement of vertical gas diffusivity and permeability of compacted municipal solid waste (MSW) using an analytical gas flow and transport model was evaluated. A series of pressure transducers were buried in a MSW landfill and in situ pressures were modelled using an algorithm that predicts soil-gas pressures based on field-measured barometric pressure data and vertical diffusivity. The vertical gas diffusivity that represented the best-fit of the measured pressures was estimated at 20 locations and ranged from 0.002 to 0.052 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The vertical gas permeability ranged from 3.3 × 10<sup>−14</sup> to 4.5 × 10<sup>−12</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for the upper-most 3 to 6 m of compacted MSW. The shortfalls of applying this method to landfill conditions are also discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The gas-phase intrinsic permeability of landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW) is a key property that dictates transport of gaseous fluids, such as landfill gas (LFG) and air within a landfill. It is an input parameter for design of landfill gas collection (LFGC) systems and air injection systems for aerobic bioreactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11424592">El-Fadel et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11424592">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11424592">Kallel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11424592">Lin and Hildeman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al., 2005</xref>). Vertical wells are the most commonly used LFGC devices; they are normally designed using mass-balance models, which are based on an assumed radius of influence of a well and an estimated gas generation rate per unit MSW volume or mass. The authors have also used mass-balance models to design an air injection system for operating a landfill as an aerobic bioreactor in Florida. These mass-balance models do not account for principles that govern the LFG or air flow through MSW. The unavailability of fluid flow-based models and the associated input parameters (e.g. porosity, permeability) are the primary reasons for the use of less accurate, mass-balance approaches for LFGC system designs. Recently, flow-based analytical equations that can estimate vertical well spacing and other innovative LFGC system features (e.g. area collectors, leachate collection systems) have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11424592">Dillah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11424592">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). When using these models for LFGC devices (e.g. vertical well, horizontal trench, gas collection bed), reasonable estimates of the input MSW properties such as the waste porosity and permeability are needed. This paper presents in situ gas-phase permeability measurements at a Florida landfill.</p>
<p>Techniques developed to measure the air permeability of vadose zone soil have been applied to measure the gas permeability of compacted MSW in landfills. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11424592">Jain et al. (2005)</xref> estimated the gas permeability of MSW at a Florida landfill by conducting air injection tests to measure flow rate as a function of injection pressure and used an analytical model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11424592">Baehr and Hult (1991)</xref> to estimate permeability based on flow rate and pressure data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11424592">Cestaro et al. (2003)</xref> estimated the gas permeability of MSW at a landfill in Italy based on the pressure distribution data around the gas extraction wells. Both studies reported gas permeability in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11424592">Bentley et al. (2002)</xref> patented a method that uses observations of barometric pumping and assumptions of gas-filled porosities to estimate the permeability and the LFG generation rate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11424592">Bentley et al. (2005)</xref> used this approach to estimate the gas generation rate values at four US landfill sites and took measurements from a maximum of 29 locations at each site. However, permeability values estimated based on the barometric pumping tests were not reported; permeability values estimated based on only gas extraction tests were reported. Barometric pumping is a natural geophysical phenomenon known to occur in permeable vadose zones where air is ‘pumped’ in and out of a permeable media. It occurs when atmospheric pressure changes because of thermal and gravitational effects and/or due to local meteorological patterns. Atmospheric air migrates into the porous media during an increase in the surrounding atmospheric pressure, whereas gas in the porous media moves out to the atmosphere when atmospheric pressure decreases. The pressure within the media changes with the influx and expulsion of air in response to atmospheric pressure changes. Barometric pumping is an important transport mechanism for air and volatile organic contaminants in soil and groundwater systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11424592">Buckingham, 1904</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11424592">Massmann and Farrier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11424592">Shan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11424592">Weeks, 1978</xref>). Similar to a vadose zone, barometric pumping causes gas pressure in a landfill to vary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11424592">Jung et al. (2010)</xref> assessed the use of inverse numerical modelling to estimate the gas generation rate and gas permeability using synthetic in situ gas pressure data typical of barometric pumping and proposed its application to real data from a landfill. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11424592">Jain et al. (2005)</xref> conducted pumping tests at more than 130 well locations at a Florida site and reported that the permeability values even at one site can vary over two orders of magnitude due to the heterogeneity of MSW. The collection of real data entails the installation of multiple gas pressure transducers in the landfill during or after MSW placement to quantify the spatial distribution of the gas generation rate and gas permeability. However, the number of measurement locations needed to assess spatial variation of the estimated properties and performance of sensors buried in a harsh landfill environment should be evaluated before wider application of this method for estimating gas generation rate and permeability.</p>
<p>The main objective of this research was to evaluate this approach for estimating vertical gas diffusivity and permeability of compacted MSW and its variation within a landfill. The temporal variation of the atmospheric pressure was measured with an on-site barometer, while the pressure in the waste was measured using 39 pressure transducers buried in the waste at a Florida landfill. Inverse modelling, as presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11424592">Shan (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11424592">2004</xref>), was conducted to estimate the vertical gas diffusivity of the waste using the pressure data. The vertical gas permeability was estimated based on the gas diffusivity and assumed porosity. The results were compared with those presented in previous studies and also converted to saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity values, which were in turn compared with previous studies.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>The temporal variation in the media pressure associated with the changes in atmospheric pressure is dependent on its permeability in the vertical direction and other factors (e.g. gas-filled porosity of the media, thickness of media over the monitoring point, fluid dynamic viscosity). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11424592">Shan and Javandel (1999)</xref> developed a one-dimensional mathematical model to describe the temporal variation in pressure at any depth in a permeable media as a function of the atmospheric pressure and gas diffusivity. The model presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11424592">Shan (2004)</xref>, based on the analytical solution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X11424592">Equations (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11424592">(2)</xref>) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11424592">Shan and Javandel (1999)</xref>, was used to determine the vertical gas diffusivity with the known temporal variation of the atmospheric pressure and the gas pressure within the porous media. This model describes air movement through soil. However, using fluid-specific dynamic viscosity and media-specific porosity and permeability, the solution can be applied to the model flow of any gaseous fluid, such as LFG through a porous media (i.e. landfilled MSW). The viscosity and permeability estimates presented in the present paper are referred to as gas viscosity and gas permeability, respectively, and are associated with the non-water filled pores:</p>

<title>Site description</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the Polk County North Central Landfill (PCNCL) located in Winter Haven, FL. The facility occupies a total area of approximately 890 ha, of which approximately 110 ha are permitted for landfill use. The site receives approximately 1100 metric ton (tonne) of primarily residential MSW, 80 tonnes of construction and demolition waste (C&amp;D), and 160 tonnes of ash from a scrap tyre and wood waste burning co-generation plant on a daily basis. The estimate of the MSW density in the experimental cell was approximately 980 kg m<sup>−3</sup>; the in situ density was estimated based on the mass of waste deposited in the landfill and the landfill volume estimated by topographic surveys of the site. A mix of mulched yard waste and soil from an on-site borrow was used as daily cover at the site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X11424592">
<title>Experimental preparation</title>
<p>The experiment was conducted in an approximately 0.5-ha area of the landfill with 81 vibrating wire pressure transducers (Geokon model 4500S) buried within and surrounding three horizontal leachate recirculation trenches. The primary aim in placing these instruments was the evaluation of pore water pressure within the compacted waste resulting from pressurized leachate recirculation. However, before beginning leachate recirculation in this area, some of the pressure transducers were monitored for their pneumatic pressure changes due to barometric pumping to estimate the in-place vertical gas permeability of the waste.</p>
<p>These pressure transducers were factory calibrated to a gauge pressure range of 0 to 350 kPa with a reported accuracy and precision of ±0.35 kPa (±3.57 cm of water column) and ±87.5 Pa (±8.9 mm of water column), respectively. Each transducer was placed in a cotton bag filled with water-saturated sand to protect it from damage during the installation process, then installed in trenches excavated on the landfill surface. Once the transducers were placed surrounding a recirculation trench, the cables of all the transducers were encased in PVC conduits and routed outside the landfill. At critical points the PVC conduits were filled with polyurethane expanding foam to deter leachate from channelling through the electrical conduits. The transducers were connected to a Geokon datalogger.</p>
<p>A vibrating wire barometer (Geokon model 4580-1) was installed at the datalogger station and connected to the datalogger. The barometer was factory calibrated to a gauge pressure range of 0 to 20 kPa with a reported accuracy and precision of ±20 Pa (±2 mm of water column) and ±0.5 Pa (±0.05 mm of water column) respectively. The buried pressure transducers’ zero readings (i.e., atmospheric pressure) were corrected using the on-site barometer and local barometric data. All subsequent pressure transducer data were measured as changes in pressure from the corrected zero reading. When instruments are set up to monitor small changes in measurements, their level of accuracy (±3.57 cm of water column) is closer to their rated precision (±8.9 mm of water column) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11424592">Sellers, 2005</xref>). Every 10 min, the datalogger recorded frequency data, representing pressure, and thermistor temperature data from the vibrating wire piezometers as well as the barometric pressure. The frequency data were then converted to pore-pressure using second-order polynomial instrument calibration values provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Although pressure was logged for all the transducers, data for only some of the transducers were analysed for gas permeability estimation, as the curve fitting process was labour and time-intensive. Thirty-nine transducers, spread over the experimental area to obtain an idea of the spatial variation of vertical gas permeability in the landfill, were chosen for the experiment described in this paper. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11424592">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11424592">3</xref> present locations of those sensors used in this study.

<title>Vertical gas diffusivity and permeability determination</title>
<p>A commercially available software package of analytical solutions for subsurface flow entitled <italic>Analytical Solutions in Excel for Subsurface Transport©</italic> (ASEST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11424592">Shan, 2004</xref>) was used to determine pressure distributions at the buried transducer locations as a function of gas viscosity, media porosity and permeability, and the measured barometric pressure. The module employed is based upon the analytical solution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11424592">Shan and Javandel (1999)</xref>. ASEST uses the following inputs to determine pressure at a desired location within a porous media: barometric pressure data (upper boundary), height of the porous media above the lower no-flow boundary, location above the lower no-flow boundary of in situ pressure measurement, initial porous media pressure, vertical gas diffusivity of the media, and a time-step between data points. The model also estimates the root mean square (RMS) of the difference between the model-simulated pressure distribution and the pressure distribution measured in the field. A detailed description of the methodology and governing equations can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11424592">Shan (2004)</xref>. Vertical gas diffusivity was determined by comparing the modelled pressures to the actual pressures measured by each of the in situ piezometers. The programme was run repeatedly for different gas diffusivity values and the smallest RMS difference between the model data and actual data was taken as the best fit.</p>
<p>The model requires gas diffusivity as an input to determine the in situ pressure distribution. The pressure distribution defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X11424592">Equation (1)</xref> is uniquely dependent on gas diffusivity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11424592">Equation (2)</xref>), and not individually on waste permeability, porosity, or viscosity. The model would generate the same pressure distribution for different permeability, porosity, and viscosity values as long as these parameters result in the same diffusivity value in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11424592">Equation (2)</xref>. Thus, an optimal gas diffusivity, not permeability, is determined in this study. For each sensor, the gas diffusivity value that corresponded to the minimum RMS was determined to be the gas diffusivity of the waste above that sensor. Porosity values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 (v v<sup>−1</sup>), based on reported values, were used to calculate a range of vertical gas permeability values from the estimated gas diffusivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11424592">Fenn et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11424592">Oweis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11424592">Schroeder et al., 1983</xref>). The average atmospheric pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>atm</sub>) during the study period and an estimate of gas dynamic viscosity were used in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11424592">Equation (2)</xref>.</p>
<p>The viscosity of the LFG, which depends on gas composition and temperature, was estimated using the equations proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11424592">Findikakis and Lackie (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11424592">El-Fadel et al. (1996)</xref>. The LFG viscosity was estimated assuming a mix of 50% (by volume) methane and 50% (by volume) carbon dioxide at 52 °C.

<title>Piezometers performance and output</title>
<p>As detailed, 81 transducers were installed and the pressure was logged for ]all the transducers. However, the data for only 39 transducers which were sufficiently distributed in the experimental area were analysed for gas permeability estimation, given the labour and time-intensive curve-fitting process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11424592">Figure 4</xref> shows gauge pressure output data from one of the piezometers evaluated during the study period. Largely, the pressure measured by the buried sensors was very close to the atmospheric pressure, suggesting LFG pressure was insignificant at this location. An increase in pressure, for this sensor, was first observed during the third week in March (approximately 20 March 2006). This event coincided with the application of another layer of waste over the experimental area, which probably hindered LFG from escaping as easily and resulted in a pressure increase. As significant increases in LFG pressure were observed starting the month of March, data collected after March 2006 were not analysed for gas permeability estimation. As discussed, the analytical model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11424592">Shan and Javandel (1999)</xref> does not account for gas production by the porous media, as is the case with landfilled MSW. The presence of LFG pressure affected the measurement of subtle pressure changes caused by barometric pumping. The authors planned to assess the variations in vertical gas permeability resulting from the continuous increases in waste thickness (layers) above the experimental area (as the landfill was actively accepting waste during the study); however, the elevated gas pressure due to the LFG build-up was observed before data were collected to evaluate the impact of waste height on permeability. Therefore, only the data collected from January to March 2006 were used for diffusivity and permeability was estimated for only one layer of waste.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11424592">Figure 5</xref> shows an example of pressure data that were used in this analysis from two piezometers and the corresponding barometric pressure. The barometric pressure changed as much as 11 cm of water column pressure during the three-day period presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11424592">Figure 5</xref>. The pressure variation registered by the piezometers correlates well with the barometer data. In general, the effects of barometric pumping are more pronounced within larger barometric pressure changes over short time durations, as seen within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11424592">Figure 5</xref>. Similar observations were noticed for the entire 3-month monitoring period. As expected with barometric pumping, the buried piezometer pressure curves are dampened and lag slightly behind the barometric pressure curve.</p>

<p>The buried piezometers had relatively large rated accuracies for this type of experiment, as they were originally specified to measure larger pore water pressures. Accordingly, only one pressure change event (observed on 9 January 2006) was large enough to render insignificant the relatively large rated accuracies (±8.9 mm of water column). The outlined segment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11424592">Figure 5</xref> was evaluated as part of the 3-month study period for all 39 pressure transducers monitored. The field-measured barometric pressure change consisted of a 4 cm water column pressure change over approximately a 12-h period. The difference between the barometric pressure and buried piezometer pressure was large enough in this period that the inaccuracies or the noise of the instruments (±8.9 mm of water column) were not problematic when determining the vertical gas diffusivity with the analytical model.</p>
<p>The pressure data recorded by 39 piezometers on 9 January 2006 were analysed for estimating the best-fit gas diffusivity. The best-fit output data for two piezometers are shown along with the corresponding barometric pressures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11424592">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11424592">7</xref> (figures for other instruments are not shown). Data from 20 of the 39 piezometers showed a response to the barometric pressure change. The pressure data for these sensors were close to the atmospheric pressure suggesting the LFG pressure was insignificant and, therefore, had an insignificant impact on the diffusivity estimation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11424592">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11424592">7</xref> show the effects of barometric pumping for this relatively large atmospheric pressure change. The modelled data represent the ideal pressure response of barometric pumping for the gas diffusivity and depth of the piezometer selected, whereas the field data show the actual pressure responses to barometric pumping at the landfill. Only the barometric response of sensors on 9 January 2006 was analysed for diffusivity estimation.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11424592">Figure 8</xref> shows examples of pressure data from two of the 19 instruments that were excluded from the vertical gas diffusivity analysis because they lacked the barometric pumping signature needed for this analysis. Some of these instruments recorded pressure data consistently higher than the barometric data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11424592">Figure 8</xref>), whereas other instruments recorded erratic or noisy data that were not consistent with the barometric data. Both of these data types were not suitable to be used within the model to provide an accurate estimate of the vertical gas diffusivity. The behaviour of these instruments could have been due to a number of reasons but is probably from instrument error due to damage incurred during the installation process or the presence of LFG pressures.</p>

<p>The solution developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11424592">Shan (2004)</xref> inversely solves for the gas diffusivity of overburden waste above each installed piezometer.

<p>Values of vertical gas diffusivity used to model the best-fit curves are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11424592">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Vertical gas permeability values estimated in this study generally fell within the lower range and in some instances were lower than previous studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11424592">Jain et al. (2005)</xref> found vertical air permeabilities in the upper region of a landfill (3–6 m) to range from 3.3 × 10<sup>−12</sup> to 3.2 × 10<sup>−11</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for an isotropic case, 4.1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> to 3.9 × 10<sup>−12</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for an anisotropy of 10, and 4.9 × 10<sup>−14</sup> to 4.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for an anisotropy of 100. Given those results, the values estimated in this study are another indication that a degree of anisotropy (10–100) exists in a landfill.

<p>where ρ<sub>w</sub> is the density of water (M L<sup>−3</sup>), µ<sub>w</sub> is the viscosity of water (M L<sup>−1</sup> T<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>g</italic> is the acceleration due to gravity (L T<sup>−2</sup>), and <italic>k</italic> is the gas permeability in the vertical direction (L<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The corresponding values of vertical hydraulic conductivity (3.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>–4.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>) fall within the middle to upper range (2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>–2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>) of a previous laboratory study that measured vertical hydraulic conductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11424592">Landva et al., 1998</xref>). However, they are much greater than the reported field-measured values using infiltration ponds (3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>–4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>), which could result from multiple reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al., 1995</xref>). First, this study was only able to measure the vertical gas permeability of the topmost 3 to 6 m of compacted MSW, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al. (1995)</xref> measured the entire waste height. Bleiker et al. (1993) showed that as waste overburden increases, the hydraulic conductivity decreases, thus an equivalent vertical hydraulic conductivity and vertical gas permeability for the entire waste height is probably much less. Second, the act of wetting in-place waste in a landfill could modify the porous media structure, causing a lower actual vertical hydraulic conductivity than when calculated from measured vertical gas permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11424592">Weeks, 1978</xref>). Examples of materials within a landfill that could cause this effect are clayey cover soils, cementitious material, or any unforeseen material that would increase in size (swelling) upon moisture interaction. An example of cementitious material behavior was witnessed at PCNCL, where during the installation of more instruments in the waste, a small excavator was not able to dig beyond an ash layer within the waste, which had turned into a concrete-like impenetrable substance after it had been wetted. Also, since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al. (1995)</xref> directly measured the hydraulic conductivity of the waste, the presence of entrapped gases could have lowered the hydraulic conductivity values determined. These findings are similar to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11424592">Jain et al. (2006)</xref>, which found that directly measured hydraulic conductivities at a landfill were significantly lower than those estimated using measured gas permeabilities.</p>

<sec id="section10-0734242X11424592">
<title>Method evaluation</title>
<p>This method allows for a relatively simple estimation of in-place vertical gas diffusivity and permeability with a reasonable assumption of the gas-filled porosity. Other methods entailed active air injection or gas extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11424592">Cestaro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11424592">Jain et al., 2005</xref>,). However, several considerations should be taken into account before using the method for estimation of in situ gas diffusivity and permeability or using the permeability estimates presented in this paper.</p>
<p>First, the applicability of the model used for generating in situ pressure estimates based on media and gas properties and the measured barometric pressure should be evaluated. Even though the results of the compacted MSW permeability values obtained in this study, using the ASEST hydrogeologic analytical model, were within reported values, the validity of this model for use on a landfill is still questionable. The ASEST model was created for application to vadose zones, thus the presence of LFG is not incorporated. In this study, the pressure data from 20 transducers indicated insignificant LFG pressure. The data from 19 of the 39 transducers, however, could not be used to estimate diffusivity and permeability values as the pressure registered by these sensors suggested considerable gas pressure existed in the landfill. The magnitude of the barometric pressure change is very small compared to the gas pressure that can be encountered within a landfill, thus future studies should consider the use of a more complex model that incorporates the gas generation feature for estimating gas diffusivity and permeability of waste using barometric pumping tests.</p>
<p>Second, the impact of the sensor installation process on the accuracy of the measurements should be evaluated. As the in situ pressure measurements depend upon the gas flow in the vertical direction, the accuracy of the estimation would be compromised by an installation process that altered the gas flow in the vertical direction. In this study, the sensors were installed in horizontal trenches as the waste filling progressed. The waste layer above the installed transducers was not disturbed to install the sensors. The estimated diffusivity and permeability values, therefore, are representative of the undisturbed waste layer. However, drilling boreholes to install the sensors to measure in situ pressure would change the structure of the porous media above the sensor and could potentially introduce significant inaccuracy in diffusivity and permeability estimations.</p>
<p>Lastly, the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensors should be critically evaluated before selection. As the primary intent of the transducers was to measure pore water pressure around leachate recirculation trenches, the sensors had relatively high rated accuracies compared to the magnitude of the pressure change associated with barometric pumping. The use of instruments with smaller rated inaccuracies would allow for more atmospheric pressure change events to be used for analysis.</p>
<p>This method is fairly simple provided the field logistics involved with installing monitoring instruments have been realized. Thereafter, the effort reduces to data management and performing analytical simulations. This method allows a researcher to investigate spatial and temporal variations in vertical gas diffusivity provided multiple monitoring instruments have been installed and the site experiences large cyclical atmospheric pressure changes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The mathematical model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11424592">Shan and Javandel (1999)</xref> was employed to estimate the in-place vertical gas permeability of the topmost 3 to 6 m layer of compacted MSW at PCNCL, an active landfill, based on the barometric pumping data. The range of values estimated for gas-filled porosities between 0.1 to 0.5 was 3.3 × 10<sup>−14</sup> to 4.5 × 10<sup>−12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. These results fell in the lower range of previously reported values. The corresponding vertical hydraulic conductivities were calculated as 3.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 4.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>. These values were higher than a previous study that measured this property in the field using infiltration ponds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al., 1995</xref>), but they did fall within the larger range of reported laboratory measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11424592">Landva et al., 1998</xref>). The difference in vertical hydraulic conductivities found in this study and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al. (1995)</xref> study may have been caused by the absence of large overburden pressures on the measured waste in this study, the absence of structural changes in the porous media caused by wetting the MSW, or the presence of LFG in the waste of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11424592">Townsend et al. (1995)</xref> study.</p>
<p>This method for estimating vertical gas diffusivity and permeability has a number of advantages. Once the monitoring equipment is installed, the method reduces mainly to data management if the analytical solution is automated. If multiple instruments are installed, then multiple locations may be tested. Multiple measurements can be taken of the study area if cyclical and large enough changes in atmospheric pressure occur during the monitoring period. More of these atmospheric pressure changes can be candidates for analysis, if more accurate monitoring instruments are installed. The shortfalls of applying this method to a landfill may include the LFG pressures only allowing the measurement of the equivalent in-place vertical gas diffusivity and permeability of one layer of waste rather than the thickness of the entire landfill height, and the harsh landfill environment as well as the installation process may negatively affect the accuracies of in situ monitoring equipment. Using monitoring devices designed for rough conditions and careful installation practices could mitigate negative impacts on measurements. Future studies should focus on developing and refining analytical models that account for interactions with LFG.</p>
