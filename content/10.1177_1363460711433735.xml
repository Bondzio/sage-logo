<abstract>
<p>Lesbian mothers internationally have negotiated informal donor insemination arrangements with gay men since the earliest days of planned lesbian parenthood. In recent years, the relational status to children of these men has been subject to increasing legal and research scrutiny. In this article, based on interviews with Australian gay men, the various meanings of biological relatedness to children are explored from the men’s perspective. Of particular interest is the difference between a ‘donor’ and a ‘father’ for the men, and the extent of their complicity with patriarchal discourses about fatherhood. I argue that, on one level, it is important to distinguish between patriarchal concepts of relatedness that connote entitlement to authority, proprietoriality or legal rights over children, and the various other dimensions of affinity men revealed, including that predicated on biological relatedness. Men’s stories often indicated a strong sense of connection to children in the absence of a sense of parental entitlement. I also explore some slippage between ‘proprietorial’ and ‘connected’ concepts of relatedness which potentially have negative as well as positive implications for relationships with children growing up in lesbian-parented families and their mothers.</p>

<p>On arrival at Derrick Wittison’s warehouse apartment, one of the first things I noticed was a black and white photograph hanging among the bright abstract canvases in his living room. It was a portrait of a bare-chested, muscular man holding a baby in a very close embrace. Derrick confirmed it was of himself and child Jack (now five), who lives with his lesbian parents, Gayle and Donna. Derrick’s photo evoked a theme that later wove its way through our interview: a gay man can celebrate (what Derrick referred to as) a ‘donor/dad’ relationship as an ongoing, emotionally significant and rewarding connection to a child.</p>
<p>Australian lesbians have negotiated informal, extra-clinical donor insemination arrangements with gay men since the earliest days of planned lesbian parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460711433735">Borthwick and Bloch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460711433735">Knepfer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460711433735">Wakeling and Bradstock, 1995</xref>). There are a number of reasons for this. Historically, utilizing sperm from a known man has been a more accessible option. Until very recently, in some Australian states, including Victoria, lesbians and single heterosexual women were ineligible for clinical insemination. Other lesbian mothers believe that children have a right to knowledge about their biological paternity, and prefer to negotiate with a man they know for this reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460711433735">McNair et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, some women express a desire for the man who provides sperm to have involvement in the child’s life, which may range from very occasional social contact to his active engagement in helping them raise the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460711433735">McNair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460711433735">Short, 2007</xref>). Gay men may be preferred because of their support for same-sex relationships, and the belief that they can model for children less stereotypical forms of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460711433735">Borthwick and Bloch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460711433735">Wakeling and Bradstock, 1995</xref>). This diverse range of reasons for selecting a gay sperm provider has also been documented in discussions of planned lesbian parenthood in England, Ireland and Sweden (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460711433735">Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460711433735">Haimes and Weiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460711433735">Ryan-Flood, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, less has been written about how known gay men who provide sperm think and feel about their relationships with the children, although there is a burgeoning body of Australian research on this topic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460711433735">Riggs, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460711433735">Ripper, 2008</xref>). In this article, drawn from an interview-based Australian study of lesbian and gay parenthood, I explore the various meanings to gay men of providing sperm. Of particular interest in this article is the difference between a ‘donor’ and a ‘father’ from the men’s perspective, and the extent of the men’s complicity with or rejection of patriarchal discourses surrounding fatherhood as institution and practice. I argue that, on one level, it is important to distinguish between patriarchal concepts of relatedness that connote entitlement to authority, proprietoriality or legal rights over children, and the various other dimensions of affinity or connectedness men revealed, including that predicated on biological relatedness. I also explore some slippage revealed between ‘proprietorial’ and ‘connected’ concepts of relatedness which potentially have negative as well as positive implications for relationships with children growing up in lesbian-parented families and their mothers.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460711433735"><title>A note on language</title>
<p>While it is customary to refer to the men discussed in this article as ‘sperm donors’ or ‘known sperm donors’, these terms have become very politicized within lesbian and gay communities, in keeping with recent contestations over socio-legal definitions of family and relational rights among lesbians and gay men (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460711433735">Riggs, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2004</xref>; Kelly, 2002). For this reason, it is important to preface this article with some commentary about both the inadequacy of language and its contentiousness when describing this domain of relational experience. Throughout the article, I use the term ‘sperm provider’ rather than ‘donor’ when referring to the men in general (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460711433735">Daniels, 1998</xref>) because it seems more neutral with regard to the social content of the relationship between the man and the child. Although ‘provider’ is not ideal in that it has paternalistic overtones of breadwinning, it does, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460711433735">Agigian (2004)</xref> suggests, leave more open the question of motivation and the status of negotiated relationships with children than the connotation of socially detached giving drawn from Christian notions of altruism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433735">Layne, 1999</xref>) and implied by the term ‘donor’. Although most lesbian mothers refer to their children’s genitor as a ‘donor’ others do not on the grounds that this minimizes his contribution to the child’s upbringing. Similarly, while some gay men are comfortable with the term ‘donor’, others feel this detracts from their participation in a relationship that is, to them, more akin to conventional social fatherhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460711433735">Dempsey (2006)</xref> documents this phenomenon in far more detail than is possible in an article of this length.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1363460711433735"><title>Gay sperm providers in lesbian-parented families</title>
<p>Paul Van Reyk is one of the few gay men to have written about his motives or experiences as a sperm provider to lesbian parents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433735">Van Reyk (1995)</xref> indicates the decision to give sperm in the early 1980s, initially without the expectation of involvement in the women or children’s lives, was motivated by the convergence of some anti-patriarchal Gay Liberation and lesbian feminist ideas. Support for women’s reproductive autonomy and their freedom from male authority rather than a personal interest in a relationship with a child was the rationale for him and his peers:<disp-quote>
<p>Each of us comes from a background of Gay Liberation informed by feminism. That framework means we see ourselves as involved in combating patriarchy and its structures through the way we choose to live our lives. Becoming donors was not only about supporting the right of women to control their reproduction, but also a challenge to the construction of patriarchal relations through the heterosexual nuclear family. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433735">Van Reyk, 1995</xref>: 82)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidently, a blurrier distinction between sperm provision and a more conventional kind of fatherhood exists for men like Derrick, whose story opened this article. Derrick only agreed to give sperm on the condition that he could be openly acknowledged as ‘dad’ and have regular and ongoing contact with the child. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460711433735">Ripper (2008)</xref> found that contemporary gay and bisexual men registering their profiles on the Australian Sperm Donor Registry expressed a stronger preference for social contact with the children, or an active parenting role, in comparison to the heterosexual men who also offered their sperm to lesbians and single heterosexual women via this site.</p>
<p>Kath Weston first proposed in <italic>Families We Choose</italic> (1991) that gay men in the USA were becoming more interested in having active social relationships with children because of the cumulative effects of living with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Weston’s suggestion was that having children symbolizes generativity and continuity, or, ‘counters representations of homosexuality as sterile and narcissistic, by courting life, establishing new family ties where critics expect to find only tragedy, isolation and death’ (1991: 185). In this view, the cultural influence of HIV/AIDS on urban gay male communities has been a far-reaching confrontation with mortality, counter to which children represent hope, renewal and a sense of the future. Although Weston’s argument is a difficult one to evaluate empirically, in the light of the enormity of the losses of friends and lovers many gay men over 40 have experienced, it certainly has intuitive appeal.</p>
<p>The prominent discourse, children’s right-to-know their biological origins, has also influenced how Australian gay men view sperm provision and the kinds of relationships with children that follow on from this practice. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433735">Van Reyk (1995)</xref> describes how he and some other men he interviewed, who had provided sperm through ‘go-betweens’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460711433735">1</xref></sup> to lesbians in the late 1970s and early 1980s, came to view their politically motivated anonymous donations differently over time. Some of the men went on to form relationships with the children, at the child’s or the children’s mothers’ request. For example, ‘Andy’, one of Van Reyk’s informants, described how it became apparent to him that adults’ political beliefs could not diminish the significance of biogenetic identity to children:<disp-quote>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s we thought about children growing up in a non-patriarchal society … But in another 30 years it won’t be much different from what it is now. Much as we might have beliefs about this, the fact remains that children will become adults in a society where it matters who your father is … That will force a whole range of questions for those children about their own identity, about who they are and what they are made of. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433735">Van Reyk, 1995</xref>: 83)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as stories about children lamenting the inability to have knowledge of their paternity have been influential among some lesbian mothers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460711433735">Donovan, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460711433735">Haimes and Weiner, 2000</xref>), some of these men came to believe over time that children with unidentifiable fathers were disadvantaged by the, in hindsight, idealistic political convictions of their parents.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis in the literature on the positive dimensions of known-sperm-provider relationships for the men, women and children involved (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460711433735">Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460711433735">Ryan-Flood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460711433735">Van Reyk, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460711433735">Wakeling and Bradstock, 1995</xref>), in the past few years, there has been a tendency towards emphasizing the more problematic legal and social dimensions of these relationships. This is understandable given that internationally there have been a number of well-publicized, emotionally fraught family court cases between lesbian couples and gay men, predominantly over the social and legal status of the sperm provider’s biological paternity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460711433735">Arnup and Boyd, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2004</xref>; Kelly, 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460711433735">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460711433735">Millbank, 2008</xref>). The sperm provider–lesbian parent relationship may be a very difficult and complex one, given the uncertainties, fears and risks that lack of legal recognition as parents poses for lesbian couples, particularly the non-birth mother (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460711433735">Arnup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460711433735">Short, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently too, scholars have drawn attention to the pervasiveness and influence of ‘Fathers’ Rights’ discourses in the era of high heterosexual divorce rates. One theme in this literature is the undue sway a notion of Fathers’ Rights has over judges in cases involving lesbian mothers and the known men providing them with sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460711433735">Dempsey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460711433735">Kelly, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460711433735">Millbank, 2008</xref>). Another is the influence of this discourse on gay men themselves. Counter to the ‘anti-patriarchal’ flavour of Gay Liberation era accounts of sperm donation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">Riggs (2008b)</xref> contends there is now a discernible influence of Fathers’ Rights discourse on gay and bisexual men providing sperm to prospective lesbian parents. Some of the men Riggs interviewed, for his qualitative study of gay men’s motives for becoming a sperm provider, expressed the belief that children raised in lesbian-parented families needed fathers, and viewed the women’s decision to have minimal involvement from the sperm provider as ‘separatist’ in a negative rather than politically legitimate way. Furthermore, Riggs claims that a desire for ‘genetic immortality’ was central to some men’s motivations for sperm provision although he provides little explanation of what this concept meant to the men concerned, and how it is or could be connected to a notion of Fathers’ Rights.</p>
<p>Against this contemporary backdrop of controversy, apprehension and concern about the appropriate political and social place of sperm providers in lesbian-parented families, and growing evidence that men’s and women’s socio-legal interests in these relationships may be very different, it is important to explore with due complexity the understandings of relatedness gay men bring to and develop within these relationships. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460711433735">Riggs (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">2008b)</xref> suggests, this stands to provide better decision making clarity for gay men considering sperm provision, and the prospective parents to whom they make their sperm available, in addition to furthering the best interests of children in lesbian-parented families.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460711433735"><title>About the study</title>
<p>This article draws on data from a larger study of concepts of family and kinship among Australian lesbian and gay parents and prospective parents. The study is informed by and extends a burgeoning literature on the rise of so-called <italic>families of choice</italic>: complex configurations of significant intimate relationships that reveal considerable change from orthodox, western nuclear family models (e.g. Stacey, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460711433735">Weeks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460711433735">Weston, 1991</xref>). It also engages with numerous anthropological investigations into how assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as donor insemination and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) expose hitherto taken-for-granted western assumptions about the relational bases on which family and parental relationships rest, while at the same time adapting, undermining and transforming these (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460711433735">Carsten, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460711433735">Dumit and Davis-Floyd, 1998</xref>; Franklin, 1997; Hayden, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460711433735">Strathern, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The research questions informing the study were as follows: How do lesbian and gay parents’ understandings of family and kinship intersect with and/or reject dominant Australian legal and popular notions of these concepts? How is this reflected in the manner in which lesbians and gay men co-operate and collaborate in having children? How is biological relatedness implicated in decision-making about having and raising children? In order to explore these questions, I conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 lesbians and 15 gay men (birth mothers and non-birth mothers/co-parents, co-parenting male couples, and known sperm providers or ‘donor/dads’ with varying degrees of social contact with biological children). Prospective parents at various stages of attempting to conceive were also included. Participants’ ages ranged from 23 to 58 and their children’s ages ranged from newborn to 17. At the time of the interviews, all were resident in metropolitan Melbourne or regional Victoria. In keeping with the conventions of theoretical sampling, and informed by my initial reading of the relevant literature, participants were chosen in order to maximize diversity in assumptions about relatedness and family type, rather than diversity based on socio-economic status or other demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>The in-depth interviews were designed to elicit what Ken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460711433735">Plummer (2001)</xref> calls <italic>short, topical life stories</italic>. I sought subjective meanings and experiences of family and kinship, given my interest in how women and men conceptualized, understood and negotiated procreative and parenting relationships as a politicized and historically new population of would-be or current parents or sperm providers. Interviews were analysed longitudinally through the writing of detailed thematized case histories of each interview. These were structured around a short biography of the participant, the themes that informed the initial interview schedule and emergent themes from the ongoing interviewing and analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460711433735">Dowsett, 1996</xref>). The interviews were also coded thematically across the data set with the assistance of the N-Vivo package.</p>
<p>The analysis that follows is based on four case histories: those of Terry Page, Phillip Radford, Michael Meagher and Derrick Wittison. Names and other details have been changed to protect the identities of the participants, their children and their children’s mothers. Terry has no contact with or knowledge of the children born from his donation. Phillip, Michael and Derrick all have some degree of social contact with the children aged eight, five and two. I chose to present a small number of sperm providers’ stories in sufficient detail to illustrate the breadth of men’s preoccupations and concerns about relatedness to children, without making any claim about how common these various scenarios are, or that they are exhaustive of all possibilities. Foremost, the four stories emphasize how meanings and social enactments of connections formed through known donor insemination are complex and dynamic, both within and across individual lives.

<list-item><p>The sperm donor</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Terry Page 39 is a health professional working in private practice. At the time of the interview, he lived alone in an inner Melbourne town house and was trying to decide whether or not to move in with Dan, his boyfriend of two years. Terry explained he had been a ‘regular sperm donor’ to a clinic that used to advertise on his university campus throughout the 1980s. He also remembers giving sperm in the early 1990s to a lesbian couple he was friendly with at university. Although Terry distinguished between his reasons for the two activities – giving sperm to Kim and Michelle was ‘just about providing something for friends’, whereas giving sperm to the clinic was primarily ‘a money thing’ – in both cases, Terry recalled no sense of attachment to or involvement with the outcome. Just as he never knew whether the anonymous donations he made to the clinic resulted in the birth of any children, it had not been important to him to stay in touch with the lesbian couple after the birth mother told him she was pregnant. He commented:<disp-quote>
<p>Ah, you lose track of people, don’t you? I don’t think me or the women thought it was a priority to stay connected once Kim got pregnant. We weren’t really close friends, and we kind of just drifted apart.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Terry does not regret giving sperm to either the clinic or the women he lost touch with as a younger man, he sometimes wonders ‘whether children were born and what they are like’. He revealed he would be ‘very open’ to meeting with the children born from his donations ‘if they turned up on my doorstep someday’ but was not interested in trying to find them himself. He thus expressed a mild curiosity about rather than a strong emotional attachment to the idea he could have one or more biological offspring.
<list id="list2-1363460711433735" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The ‘kindly uncle’</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Phillip Radford is a 46 year-old pharmacist who has lived alone since the death from AIDS of his partner Bob. Phillip’s biological child Ryan was 8 at the time of the interview and lives with his mother, Angie. Angie, a friend of many years, approached Phillip to contribute sperm and be known in what she called a ‘kindly uncle’ capacity. Single at the time, she is now in a cohabiting relationship with a man. Phillip explained that his arrangement with Angie came into being because he knew that she really wanted a child and would be very capable of raising that child:<disp-quote>
<p>I had no desire to initiate a child in order to care … Like if it was my choice to create a person, I didn’t want to, you know. But Angie wanted to and I just thought I know what she’s like and I know that child will be so well-loved and so well looked-after and so well-raised and that was my judgement.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The only condition Phillip insisted on initially was that any child born be told the identity of the biological father, once he or she was old enough to ‘start asking questions’. This request was central to Phillip’s conviction that ‘information about origins is important to children’. He did not define origins in a narrow, biogenetic sense. They represented the web of historic connections and relationships, social, symbolic and geographic, into which he perceived every child is born:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Phillip:</bold> It’s about having some sort of context of where you’ve come from … There’s a big reason why you came from these people. You know, this is your father and this is your mother … This is where you were brought up.</p>
<p><bold>I:</bold> Are origins about biology?</p>
<p><bold>Phillip:</bold> Not necessarily, they’re about culture as well. I’m interested in Irish Gaelic. I found out about all my ancestors. A lot of them were from Ireland … My parents’ families have been here for three generations, but then when I found out that there are traditions in our family from the old country. I discovered this particular form of music and I really liked it even before I knew what it was about.</p></disp-quote>A child’s origins, for Phillip, were enmeshed with stories about people and places in his own family past. Anticipating that a child may feel drawn similarly to such connections, before Ryan was born, Phillip put together a collection of old family photographs in a special folder he gave to Angie, so the child could have a visual record of paternal ancestry if he expressed interest.</p>
<p>Phillip’s relationship to Ryan was conceptualized initially as a familial relationship, although not as a fatherly one. Phillip found it helpful to think of himself as an ‘uncle’ because the connection implicit in this claim is an unconditional life-long connection, yet flexible with regard to social and emotional proximity:<disp-quote>
<p>I always said I’m happy to help and that’s why I think of myself as an uncle. An uncle is someone who is biologically related and he can be very close or very distant. He’s a family member. He can always get in touch. An uncle might look after them [the children] but ultimately it’s the parents that have the yes or no say on what happens. That’s how I define my relationship to Ryan and I’m always happy to do things for him.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the foregoing quotation, although Phillip draws on the language of helping that is often associated with clinical gamete donation, he uses the word ‘help’ more in the sense of ongoing social support. As an uncle, Phillip’s promise to help is not a one-off gift of sperm; it is an ongoing and permanent relational state. Positioned within a network of kin relations, uncles have a legitimate claim to keeping ‘in touch’; however, they ‘look after’ children rather than bring them up.</p>
<p>Phillip continually emphasized his love for and sense of connectedness to Ryan throughout the interview, despite the fact that they had never shared a conventional, resident father/child relationship. This continued to develop as Phillip watched Ryan grow up. He recalled many occasions on which Ryan’s behaviour and emotional reactions to events reminded him of his own reactions at a similar age. Phillip was quite captivated by this evidence he attributed to the material effects of the genetic connection. It was an unexpected and extra dimension to his sense of belonging to Ryan:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like that quite a lot [as he grows up]. It must be because your brain’s hardwired in the same way or something and that is really astonishing to see. There’s something a bit more than just social … I think it’s just a genetic thing … I think that emotionally makes you think, oh my god … I really am connected to this person in ways I hadn’t realised.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Phillip’s story also revealed how the status of the relationship with Ryan had slowly changed and developed over time. According to Phillip, Ryan asked Angie who the biological father was when he was four. He has initiated more visits and contact with Phillip since he turned six. Although Ryan initially knew him as a close family friend he saw every month or so, Phillip now sees Ryan about once a week, often taking care of him when his mother works or wants some time to herself, and they have more frequent contact by email and telephone. They have discovered shared interests in cooking and drawing.</p>
<p>Phillip revealed that Ryan began calling him ‘daddy’ when he was five. At Ryan’s request, he has started going along to his school concerts and participating in Father’s Day projects and events:<disp-quote>
<p>It was really interesting because I always called myself Phillip and he goes Daddy, but that’s fine. Since he was about six, I’ve had a bit more involvement … He rings more now and that sort of thing, although I’ve always told him he can ring anytime. He’s just started emailing me, which is nice.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the foregoing quotation, Phillip reveals he has gradually altered his self-perception as an uncle known by his first name to accommodate Ryan’s growing perception of him as ‘daddy’ without any ostensible confusion or contradiction. His description of the process by which he has transformed from Phillip into ‘daddy’ portrays it as a gradual one very much initiated and sustained by the child. This represents an interesting inversion of conventional patrilineal assumptions, in which the child creates a daddy when and if having a daddy becomes important to the child. Although Angie, the child’s mother was not interviewed, there was no suggestion in Phillip’s story that these developments in the relationship between Phillip and Ryan had been problematic for her or a source of conflict.

<list-item><p>‘A father rather than a sperm donor’</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>To return to the man whose story launched this article, Derrick Wittison is 47 and owns an inner-city bar. Derrick met Gayle and Donna, whom he described as ‘Jack’s birth mother and co-parent’ at a party some years ago. Although Derrick had never considered having children or becoming a sperm provider for a lesbian couple, the opportunity Donna and Gayle presented him with sparked his interest because ‘we all got on so well’. According to Derrick, he and the women have maintained an amicable relationship since five-year-old Jack was born. Derrick sees Jack at least fortnightly, sometimes for overnight stays at his apartment, although sometimes up to a month passes between visits. He also looks after Jack when work permits, and recently took him on holiday without the women for the first time. Derrick, Jack and his mothers occasionally take holidays together and have a number of mutual friends. At the time of the interview, they were in discussions about a second child.</p>
<p>Whereas Phillip Radford agreed he would only become ‘dad’ if Ryan expressed interest in knowing him as dad, Gayle, Donna and Derrick all agreed Derrick would be introduced to Jack as ‘dad’ from early infancy. At the same time, the women are, by mutual agreement, Jack’s resident parents although Derrick is included in discussions about major decisions affecting Jack in the long term. Circumcision, vaccination and choice of schools were the three he emphasized. Derrick also makes a financial contribution to Jack’s education and has made him a beneficiary in his will.</p>
<p>The arrangements Derrick has with Gayle and Donna regarding Jack’s care ‘suit him ideally’ as he does not believe full-time responsibility for children fits into what he called his ‘gay lifestyle’. He works long hours, likes to travel during his rare weeks off and also find time to socialize. Derrick was perfectly frank he enjoyed what he called ‘the emotional benefits of fatherhood’ without the full-time responsibilities of ‘being a parent’. Despite this, Derrick considered himself ‘a father rather than a sperm donor’, indicative that a ‘father’ was not necessarily the same to him as a ‘parent’.</p>
<p>This sense of himself as a father had not only grown out of the social relationship he had established with Jack; it was linked to his very strong sense of location within the continuum of his family of origin. Although not a conscious motive initially, Derrick’s father’s illness and death soon after Jack’s birth had sparked strong feelings about the symbolic importance of generational continuity. When I asked him to consider what it meant to be a father, Derrick invoked the traditional western concept of genealogical descent, telling me the story of how Jack’s birth fitted in with his own sense of place in a family continuum. It had meant a lot to Derrick that the timing of Jack’s birth allowed for no time gap in which his parents were both dead without a grandchild to ‘carry on’. The sense of continuity of life within his family of origin appeared to represent spiritual sustenance that carried him through the grief of the loss of his father:<disp-quote>
<p>When one parent goes it really is very hard but when two parents go, no matter what age you are, it’s a totally different thing and you suddenly become an orphan. And it was the first time I realised I’ve carried on the line with Jack. Now I’ve moved up in the hierarchy of the family … Jack is there carrying on the line, it didn’t sort of finish. If my dad had died before Jack was born and just left me on my own even if a year or two later I had a son well there would have been a gap. So there is that wonderful flow, if you like, of birth and death right through that period of time which was enormously supportive to me. To know that my dad knew I had a son and he had a grandson before he died.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Derrick, there is a kind of existential comfort in having someone beneath you in the vertical family line when the parents above you die. Derrick reinforces a very conventional conviction that blood flows downwards and affirms one’s place and obligation to care in a generational order of things (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460711433735">Edwards and Strathern, 2000</xref>).

<list-item><p>‘More of a sperm donor than a father’</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The last of the four case histories belongs to Michael Meagher, 29, travel consultant and biological father of two-year-old Max. Michael and his partner Jason Burke 31 have what he described as ‘some involvement’ with Max, who is being raised, as agreed, by lesbian couple Avril and Catherine. Michael met the women after he answered their advertisement in the classifieds of a Melbourne lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender newspaper. The men have seen two-year-old Max about once every three months since he was born, generally visiting him at the women’s home in their presence. They have occasionally cared for Max for a couple of hours here and there ‘so Avril and Catherine could go out together’, but this has never been at their own home or included overnight stays.</p>
<p>Michael answered the women’s advertisement because he ‘had always wanted to be a father’, although he admitted this was not how the women saw him. Thus far, he professed to feeling that his relationship with Max was in accordance with the women’s wishes and ‘more like a sperm donor than a father’. He made this distinction based on the fact that he ‘had no say’ in how Max was being brought up, had agreed to see him only on an intermittent basis, and was known to Max as ‘Michael’ rather than ‘dad’. Despite this, it was apparent Michael’s sense of connection to Max encompassed a number of different familial and explicitly paternal dimensions. The child was a beneficiary in his will. Michael also expressed a keen interest in genealogy and has traced his family tree back several generations, commenting that his interest in this hobby had intensified ‘now he had a son of his own’.</p>
<p>Max also represented the possibility for what Michael called ‘father/son stuff’ in the future. He and Jason often took their nephews out on weekends to various sporting events. Michael looked forward to doing the same ‘only more so’ with Max when he was a bit older although he realized this would depend on Avril and Catherine’s wishes. Michael explained that even though the relationship he agreed to ‘was not really what I wanted’ he didn’t believe he had had other options at the time. He looked to the future in which he believed it inevitable that Max would want to spend more time with him, and hoped the women would come around to thinking this was appropriate. He explained: ‘I think Avril and Catherine will realize that once he becomes a boy he will need me for male involvement. Boys do. At the moment, he’s just a little kid.’</p>
<sec id="sec5-1363460711433735" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The case studies presented here give an indication of the variety of meanings men providing sperm may attribute to their relationships with children at different points in their own and the children’s lives. Each is discussed in this section, individually and in comparative terms in order to draw out their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>Terry’s story indicates that there may be strong parallels between the motives of extra-clinical known donors and men donating their sperm to clinics. In his case, becoming a known donor as a younger man represented a one-off gift of biogenetic substance, as is customary in much clinical insemination practice. Terry’s sentiments echoed the motives of detached altruism and financial gain often expressed by men who donate their semen anonymously to clinics, indicating that both groups of men may think very similarly about the meaning of giving sperm. Ken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460711433735">Daniels (1998)</xref>, writing about clinical rather than informal known donor insemination, argues that men’s motives in providing semen depend on whether or not the transaction in semen is construed by the clinic as a donation or an act of commerce; the dualism he invokes is that of ‘gift’ versus ‘goods’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460711433735">Tober, 2001</xref>). Beyond commerce, the other dominant understanding has been that providing semen as a third party should be a pure altruistic act in which a donor has no expectations of return or recompense (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460711433735">Novaes, 1989</xref>). The kind of altruism assumed appropriate in clinical models of gamete donation is thus drawn from Christian, or self-effacing ideals about giving. Gifts should be free or disinterested, with no strings or expectations attached (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460711433735">Layne, 1999</xref>). In other words, gifts are not given with the primary intention of creating an ongoing relationship of obligation, connectedness or belonging, as may be customary in other non-western traditions of gift-giving.</p>
<p>Conversely, for Phillip, Derrick and Michael, providing sperm had given rise to some form of ongoing social relationship with the children, and a strong sense of emotional connection to the children involved. Although the amount of contact, the status of the relationship and the meaning of the biological connection was expressed quite differently in each of their three stories, some similarities are also apparent. All three men were very interested in and aware of what Jennifer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460711433735">Mason (2008)</xref> calls ‘tangible affinities’ between themselves and the biological children. Mason defines these as ties or connections that people imagine between themselves and those they consider to be kin, which explain the distinctive, special, emotionally charged or fascinating character often attributed to these relationships. Tangible affinities, for Mason, encompass sensory dimensions, such as some kinds of physical resemblances, or more ethereal dimensions, such as more spiritual ways in which people experience their closeness and belonging to each other. Mason argues that tangible affinities are very compelling in most people’s ordinary daily lives, and the extent to which they are deeply entrenched in western culture is evidenced by the extent of contemporary enthusiasm for practices such as tracing family histories and spotting family resemblances.</p>
<p>One manifestation of the men’s preoccupations with tangible affinities was in their discussions of various dimensions of patrilineage. By this I mean that becoming a known sperm provider who subsequently developed a relationship with the child had in some way intensified, for the men, the sense of connection to an ancestral or family ‘line’. For Phillip this was expressed through his interest in the characteristics of his Irish ancestors in whom he anticipated Ryan might also take an interest; for Derrick through the references to the unexpected comfort taken after his father’s death in generational continuity; for Michael in the intensification of his interest in tracing his family tree since Max’s birth. In these men’s stories, despite the different levels of social contact they had with the children, it was taken for granted that the child was connected to past lives within the paternal family of origin, and that the child also represented the fact that these links and connections carried on into the future. In other words, there was a strong conviction that the child belonged in some way to the past and the future of their paternal family of origin, and intensified their own sense of emotional engagement with family of origin.</p>
<p>In Michael’s and Phillip’s stories there was also a strong interest in the sense of connectedness to children that followed on from the physical resemblances they perceived between themselves or other family members. Michael took great delight in comparing Max’s photos with those of his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, looking for resemblances in facial features and expressions. Phillip additionally speculated about the inheritability of temperament, wondering if this could be evidence of ‘hardwiring’ or genetic programming. The dynamic quality of physical resemblances, in that they may only become apparent once children reach a certain age or level of development was also evident in Phillip’s story.</p>
<p>Some may argue these preoccupations with patrilineage and genetic connection displayed by these men are patriarchal in the sense that there is a fine line between understanding that a child belongs to or is connected to a paternal family line, by virtue of the biological/genealogical tie, and the sense of patriarchal ownership or entitlement to rights that may follow on from this. A notion of descent through the male line is included in the Macquarie dictionary definition of ‘patriarchy’. However, it is important to distinguish in their effects, the aforementioned kinds of preoccupations with connectedness and belonging that led these men to take a strong interest and even delight in the children, from authoritarian understandings of relatedness to children, predicated on the idea that fathers should have rights and power over women and children. Carol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460711433735">Smart and Bren Neale (1999)</xref>, elaborate these in their discussion of the progressive and regressive elements of contemporary heterosexual fatherhood discourses and practices.</p>
<p>According to Smart and Neale, patriarchal understandings of fatherhood rely on the idea of shoring up male power and control in families, as well as unsubstantiated beliefs in deep-seated gender differences between women and men’s contribution as parents. Patriarchal beliefs may include the view that children must have fathers in order to model masculinity. This may reinstate the assumption that men as fathers are legitimately authoritarian and should exercise power over women and children. Patriarchal fatherhood rhetoric may also emphasize men as carriers of rights in respect of children, no matter what their level of participation in childrearing responsibilities or care, a stance that may be self-interested rather than oriented to what is good for children or their mothers. Internationally, Fathers’ Rights activists often draw on such discourses in airing their grievances about purported unfair or unequal treatment for men in custody disputes when heterosexual marriages end in divorce (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460711433735">Kelly, 2005</xref>; Rhoades, 2006).</p>
<p>An important consideration is how the stories of Phillip, Derrick and Michael resonate with these more authoritarian patriarchal preoccupations. Of the three men, Phillip appeared the least influenced by such considerations. At one point in the interview, he expressed distaste (and amusement) at the very idea he could serve as an entity known as a ‘male role model’. This was understandable when considering his and Ryan’s shared interests in cooking and drawing: activities not valued conventionally for their typically masculine qualities. These are pastimes Ryan enjoys and cannot share with his mother or her partner who have no particular talents or interests in those areas. Phillip did adhere to a notion of gender ‘balance’. Reflecting on Ryan’s increasing interest in him, he commented: ‘there seems to come a time when boys need men in their lives. Ryan’s got a lot of women in his life and he probably just wants a bit of balance.’ Phillip’s suggestion here was that it was not his distinctiveness as a man or father Ryan sought. More so, that if there is an overabundance of one sex in their personal networks, children may feel interested in investigating the greater gender symmetry they observe in the population through the connections they choose to create with adults in their social circle.</p>
<p>Michael Meagher, by contrast, displayed very patriarchal understandings of father–child relationships, and indeed his story gives some inkling as to why considerable conflict can ensue in relationships between lesbian parents and sperm providers. Notably, he was very influenced by the idea that mothers perform the daily bodily care babies and toddlers need, and fathers direct and play with children once they are beyond needing constant feeding and toileting attention or close supervision. When asked about what kind of relationship he imagined with Max in the future Michael said: ‘I want more of a proper father–son relationship’. When asked to elaborate on ‘proper’ he explained: ‘It would be about having him over to our house on the weekends. Doing things like bike-riding, playing football.’ He also commented: ‘it’s about having more say in directing the way I’d like him to be brought up. Where he goes to school, how he dresses, that kind of thing’. Michael’s concept of the ideal father–son relationship thus revolved around increased opportunities for having Max to stay in his and Jason’s recreational time, boisterous play, and having more authority over decisions affecting the child’s daily life and comportment.</p>
<p>Michael’s story indeed is congruent with the insight from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">Riggs (2008b)</xref> that very conservative understandings of the substance and meaning of father–child relationships may feature in sperm providers’ stories and that these have the potential to create conflict in the future. Although in Michael’s telling of the story, the relationship with Max’s lesbian mothers was to date amicable, and he was going along with their wishes, it is easy to see how this could change, depending on how Michael chooses to act over time on his feelings about Max’s intrinsic need for a father, coupled with his sense of strong biogenetic connection to Max. Of the four stories, told, Michael’s most clearly expresses the potential overlap between notions of biogenetic connection and a sense of paternal rights or ownership. By his own admission, Michael is hoping that in the near future, Max will begin to express more interest in him that will in turn influence the way Avril and Catherine view his status and amount of contact as biological father.</p>
<p>Despite Michael’s desire for a closer and more parental relationship with Max in the future, it is just as easy to imagine that Max may not articulate a desire to know his father’s identity while he is very young, or for more time and contact with Michael if he does find out he is his father. Children of lesbian mothers are known to express variable degrees of interest in their sperm providers, and this may or may not occur in early childhood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460711433735">Vanfraussen et al., 2001</xref>). There is also the possibility that if Max does express interest in spending more time with Michael, this will not be in accordance with his mothers’ wishes or their perceptions about the best interests of the family relationships. Should Michael choose to renege on his agreement to keep his paternity confidential, or to initiate more contact with Max because of his views about Max’s needs, there is the clear potential for social or legal conflict with Max’s mothers, and disruption to their view of the status of family relationships.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363460711433735"><title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>Despite the potential pitfalls exposed by Michael’s story, it is important not to completely conflate an interest in genetic relatedness with a desire for power and control over parenting relationships, as some previous research on this topic insinuates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460711433735">Riggs, 2008b</xref>). The relationships the men in this study described tended to accentuate the creative ways in which various symbols of affinity could be enjoyed, in the absence of a sense of entitlement to authority over children’s lives. Notably, while a sense of pride in the relationship to the child because of the biological connection featured in most men’s stories, there was negligible evidence of a conviction that this should confer rights to legal custodianship, greater social access, or to dictate how children would be raised. Rather, the stories also demonstrate a range of distinctively non-patriarchal ways in which children can ‘belong’ to and be loved by a non-resident biological father who has no formal legal rights or entitlements.</p>
<p>Although some men saw becoming a known sperm provider as negligibly different from giving sperm to a clinic under conditions of anonymity, for most men in this study, the relationships with children they described evoked a sense of affinity based on some conventional symbols of paternal relatedness without a more patriarchal assertion of father-right. That said, some men were also clearly influenced by quite gender essentialist assumptions about father–child relationships, for example, the view that children need and should have fathers to teach them how to be men. In a qualitative study of this kind, there is no way of knowing how widespread these views are among gay men, and further research attention to this issue would certainly be warranted.</p>
<p>It is clear that some gay men have had little exposure to lesbian feminist ideas about family relationships, and have few women or lesbians in their social networks when they embark on these relationships. Given known sperm provider negotiations beyond the clinical setting may assume or reject the conventions of detached altruism hegemonic in the legal and clinical construction of a sperm donor, it is in the interests of all parties, particularly the children born of these arrangements, that contested assumptions are, as far as possible, exposed and interrogated prior to conception. Foremost, an agreement made by a man to be introduced to a child as ‘dad’ from the child’s infancy is very different from the idea that he may gradually transform from a ‘sperm donor’ or ‘kindly uncle’ to a more socially connected person over time, but only if and when that child expresses more interest in ongoing contact.</p>
<p>A long-standing feminist argument dating from the 19th-century work of Friedrich Engels – indeed the one with which some 1970s Gay Liberation era donors implicitly engaged – is that patrilineal concerns are crucial to the control of women’s sexuality and maintenance of women’s subordination within the western nuclear family. In this view, there is a fine line between maintaining a sense of belonging based on biological relatedness and the issues of ownership, entitlement or control that may follow on from this. Internationally, a number of family court judges have certainly held this view when cases between lesbian mothers and gay biological fathers have come before the courts, in (very unfairly) overlooking the more substantial parental role of the non-birth mother.</p>
<p>However, it can equally be argued that lesbian mothers often choose known sperm providers precisely because they believe there is something meaningful for their children about the paternal biological tie, even if to them it does not represent the basis for a parental relationship. These men’s stories also indicated symbols of patrilineage do not necessarily take on oppressive power dimensions for family relationships, particularly in the absence of a heterosexual relationship between biological mother and father. On a more positive note, they play a large part in assisting men to feel connected and responsive to children in the long term, in the absence of the opportunity for the daily contact and nurture their resident lesbian parents can take for granted. This sense of connection cannot help but the set the scene for children receiving a warm reception from the sperm provider if and when they exercise their much-lauded ‘right to know’.</p>
<p>Despite the recent attention given to real and potential conflict between lesbian mothers and gay known biological fathers, men participating in this study primarily expressed deep respect, admiration and care for the women and children in their lives. Lesbians and gay men have long supported each other to achieve parenthood in the face of continuing and false beliefs that homosexuality robs women and men of their fitness to parent, and evidently, they continue to do so. The dynamic and complex nature of the families they create, and the agency of the children involved, needs to be respected and anticipated in the interests of harmonious and mutually rewarding relationships.</p></sec>
