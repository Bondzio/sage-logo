<abstract>
<p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) immunotherapy is currently used in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to transmembrane-bound and soluble TNF-α. Previously, a discoid lupus erythematosus-like eruption linked to its use was rarely reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We present a case of rheumatoid arthritis which developed such an eruption after treatment with infliximab. The lesions resolved after the discontinuation of infliximab. In the present case, the clinical, serological and immunohistochemical features of our patient are discussed with the literature.</p>

<p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) agents include monoclonal antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, and the soluble TNF-α receptor antagonist, etanercept. These are available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313479423">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>TNF-α is a significant regulator of apoptosis and an important proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313479423">1</xref></sup> It has been shown to play a key role in many T-helper (Th)1-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313479423">2</xref></sup> Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody, composed of the variable region of a murine anti-human TNF-α antibody fused to the constant region of a human IgG1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313479423">1</xref></sup> However, during the treatment of this agent for each specific disorder, various paradoxical adverse reactions may be observed which include systemic lupus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313479423">3</xref></sup> sarcoidosis and psoriasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313479423">4</xref></sup> Previously in the literature, only one case of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) associated with infliximab has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313479423">5</xref></sup> Hereby, we report a rheumatoid arthritis patient who developed DLE during anti-TNF-α agent therapy, infliximab.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313479423" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 41-year-old man presented to our clinic with well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques on his face that appeared within 10 days after his sixth injection of infliximab. He had a long history (&gt;10 years) of inadequately controlled RA despite consecutive and combined treatment with salazopyrin, methylprednisolone, hydroxychloroquine sulphate and methotrexate. Therefore, he was treated with both leflunomide 20 mg daily and infliximab 5 mg/kg of body weight: following which he experienced an almost complete response. However, 10 days after the sixth infusion, the patient developed a mildly pruritic erythematous rash on his face. Topical steroid treatment was given due to contact dermatitis diagnosis. After topical steroid therapy the lesions disappeared and the patient received a seventh infusion. Similar lesions appeared again within 10 days on his face after the seventh injection of infliximab. On dermatological examination, the patient had well-demarcated, erythematous, sometimes scaly, confluent plaques predominantly localized on the forehead and malar region of the face associated with a mild itching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313479423">Figure 1(A)</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>A skin biopsy was performed and the histology showed that the epidermis was parakeratotic with follicular plugging. In addition, perivascular, periadnexal and inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313479423">Figure 2</xref>) were found. Also, periadnexal vacuolar degeneration was seen at the dermoepidermal junction. Direct immunofluorescence demonstration was not performed.

Hematoxylin and eosin ×40.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203313479423-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) screening was negative. Full blood count, complement components C3 and C4, immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, creatinine, urea and electrolytes were normal. Urinalysis was negative for blood and protein.</p>
<p>Clinical, serological, and histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of infliximab-induced DLE. There was no evidence of systemic involvement, and the findings did not meet criteria defined by the American Rheumatism Association for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Infliximab was stopped and plaquenil and methylprednisolone were administered at a dose of 400 mg/day and 4 mg/day consecutively. On discontinuation of treatment with infliximab, the skin lesions resolved over the following four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313479423">Figure 1(B)</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313479423" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Infliximab is used in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, such as RA, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet’s disease and Crohn’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313479423">6</xref></sup> It has also been used successfully to treat several cutaneous diseases. Many studies have shown its efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous and articular psoriasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313479423">7</xref></sup> Infliximab is generally well tolerated, with rare adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313479423">6</xref></sup> On the other hand certain untoward reactions have been documented, namely, opportunistic infections, reactivation of latent tuberculosis, lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disease and heart failure. Definite associations were demonstrated for infusion/injection site reactions, whereas psoriasis and psoriasiform lesions, lupus-like syndromes, vasculitis and cutaneous infections were found to be strongly associated with anti-TNF-α agents. A moderate association was apparent between anti-TNF-α treatment and eczematous reactions, lichenoid reactions and granulomatous diseases, whereas cutaneous lymphomas, non-melanoma skin cancers and melanoma, mainly described in case reports, were poorly linked to anti-TNF-α treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313479423">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The development of lupus autoantibodies has been also reported with both infliximab and etanercept therapy and appears to be a common finding in treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313479423">8</xref></sup> When considering all anti-TNF-α agents, the prevalence of ANA induction ranges from 23% to 57%, and the prevalence of anti-dsDNA antibody induction ranges from 9–33%. Despite frequent induction of autoantibodies, development of lupus-like syndrome with anti-TNF-α agents is rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313479423">9</xref></sup> The prevalence in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors is estimated to be between 0.5–1%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313479423">10</xref></sup> although a French study described a lower rate of 0.19% with infliximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313479423">3</xref></sup> Two important studies describe a lupus-like syndrome only in 5/2292 treated and 6/1372 cases, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313479423">11</xref></sup> Other studies have reported prevalence rates from 0.1–0.6% for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and up to 1.6% for patients with Crohn's disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313479423">9</xref></sup> Specifically, Shakoor et al. described four female patients who developed symptoms and signs of systemic LE during treatment with etanercept.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313479423">12</xref></sup> One of the cases developed an extensive rash on the face, arms and thighs that was histologically diagnosed as DLE. The eruption was associated with high titers of ANA (1:640) and anti-dsDNA antibodies and resolved six weeks after the withdrawal of etanercept. DLE-like lesions have also been described in two separate case reports of etanercept-treated patients, manifesting either as a diffuse papular eruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313479423">13</xref></sup> or as scattered erythematous patches with follicular hyperkeratosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313479423">14</xref></sup> In addition, Stratigos et al. reported the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed a discoid lupus erythematosus-like eruption after treatment with infliximab. The rash consisted of diffuse scaly erythematous plaques on the face, trunk and extremities, and occurred in the context of elevated anti-nuclear and anti-double- stranded DNA antibody titers. The lesions resolved completely after the discontinuation of infliximab and with the use of anti-malarial therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313479423">8</xref></sup> In our case, both ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies were negative. This case is similar to the report of Stratigos et al. as the patient’s lesions resolved completely after the discontinuation of infliximab and with the use of plaquenil.</p>
<p>Previously in the literature, several different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of lupus or lupus-like syndromes in patients treated with anti-TNF-α therapy. The ‘cytokine shift’ hypothesis proposes that pharmacological systemic blockade of TNF-α suppresses production of Th1 cytokines, thereby driving the immune response towards Th2 cytokine production, Interleukin 10 and Interferon alfa. This change in cytokine balance would then induce a cascade of downstream events ultimately resulting in production of autoantibodies and a lupus-like syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313479423">15</xref></sup> Another hypothesis is based on the assumption that systemic inhibition of TNF-α could interfere with apoptosis, affect the clearance of nuclear debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313479423">16</xref></sup> and thus promote autoantibody production against DNA and other nuclear antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313479423">17</xref></sup> Similarly, TNF-α-induced apoptosis of mature cytotoxic T cells is an important mechanism for termination of T lymphocyte-driven responses. Anti-TNF-α therapy may interfere with this process and thereby promote autoantibody formation against nuclear antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313479423">18</xref></sup> Alternatively, inhibition of cytotoxic T cells by anti-TNF-α therapy could reduce the elimination of autoantibody- producing B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313479423">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we present a case of infliximab-induced DLE. Physicians should look out for signs of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus in patients receiving anti-TNF-α therapy. In these patients, ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies may be found negative. In the present case, the symptoms improved as soon as the drug was discontinued and the specific treatment was initiated.</p>
