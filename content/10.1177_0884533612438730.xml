<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Impaired early protein intake in very preterm infants contributes to early growth failure and may affect long-term neurocognitive development. The authors have previously shown that a standardized concentrated neonatal parenteral nutrition (scNPN) formulation can improve the efficiency of early protein administration. They recognized that very early protein intake could be improved further by modifying the original scNPN regimen and starting PN within 4 hours. <italic>Aim</italic>: To demonstrate that the new scNPN regimen could improve very early protein intake in infants &lt;29 weeks’ gestation without causing clinically important PN intolerance and complications. <italic>Methods</italic>: All eligible infants &lt;29 weeks’ gestation, receiving the modified scNPN regimen and born between October 2009 and December 2010, were studied (group scNPN2). These were compared with previously studied infants, &lt;29 weeks’ gestation and receiving the original scNPN regimen and born between June 2006 and December 2006 (group scNPN1). Infant details, actual nutrition intake, and metabolic/infection data were recorded. <italic>Results</italic>: Thirty-eight infants &lt;29 weeks’ gestation (group scNPN2) were compared with the 38 infants previously studied (group scNPN1). PN was started earlier in group scNPN2, leading to increased mean (95% confidence interval) total protein intake (first 7 days) of 15.3 (14.5–16.1) g/kg in group scNPN2 vs 11.8 (11.0–12.6) g/kg in group scNPN1. There were no differences in calorie, lipid, and carbohydrate intake. Infants receiving insulin for hyperglycemia fell from 20 (53%) in group scNPN1 to 10 (26%) in group scNPN2. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Increasing early protein intake is associated with a reduction in insulin-treated hyperglycemia in infants &lt;29 weeks’ gestation.</p>

<p>Early postnatal growth failure is common in very preterm infants. This is recognized as an important and potentially reversible risk factor for neurocognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612438730">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612438730"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612438730"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612438730">4</xref></sup> as well as having implications for long-term growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612438730">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612438730">6</xref></sup> Postnatal growth failure is usually associated with negative early energy and nitrogen balance despite the use of early parenteral nutrition (PN) in these very preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612438730">7</xref></sup> The inadequate protein and calorie intake can be partly explained by PN protocol, formulation, and administration failings. This inefficiency means that increasing the protein content of a PN formulation does not necessarily result in the expected increase in actual protein intake, particularly in individualized PN prescribing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612438730">8</xref></sup> We have previously shown that a standardized, concentrated neonatal PN (scNPN) regimen can deliver 20% more protein in the first 14 days of life when compared with a nutritionally identical individualized neonatal PN prescription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612438730">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated improvements in early nitrogen balance by starting higher amounts of protein immediately after birth without evidence of intolerance to the increased amino acid load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612438730">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612438730"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612438730"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612438730">13</xref></sup> Improving protein intake in the first few days may have long-term implications for neurodevelopment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612438730">14</xref></sup> First week protein intake has been shown to correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected gestational age (CGA) in a large cohort study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612438730">15</xref></sup> We noted that our original scNPN regimen, scNPN1, still delivered suboptimal protein in the first week because the protocol design allowed a gradual introduction of protein, with many infants not receiving protein until after 24 hours and only achieving the maximum on day 6 of life. We developed a second scNPN regimen, scNPN2, to introduce protein within 4 hours of birth and to achieve maximum intake within 4 days. We hypothesized that the scNPN2 regimen would increase protein intake by 4 g/kg in the first 7 days of life when compared with the scNPN1 regimen. The secondary outcomes include measures of PN intolerance (hyperglycemia and insulin usage, metabolic acidosis and bicarbonate usage, hypertriglyceridemia and intravenous [IV] fat emulsion reduction) and PN complications (line infection and extravasation). We hypothesized that the secondary outcomes would be unaffected by this change.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612438730" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was prospectively approved by the Liverpool Women’s Hospital (LWH) Audit Committee. Routine monitoring data were collected to measure the improvement in protein intake following the change from the scNPN1 regimen to the scNPN2 regimen. Details of the scNPN1 regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612438730">9</xref></sup> and the scNPN2 regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612438730">16</xref></sup> have already been reported. In brief, both PN regimens are standardized formulations comprising an 85-mL/kg/d aqueous PN component (containing the amino acids), a 15-mL/kg/d lipid component, and a 50-mL/kg/d supplementary dextrose infusion. The latter allows fluid restriction, supplementary drug infusions, and changes in dextrose concentration without affecting the rate of amino acid infusion, thereby “protecting” protein delivery.</p>
<p>The scNPN1 regimen started after 24 hours and delivered 1 g/kg/d protein for 48 hours, increasing to 2 g/kg/d for 48 hours and then increasing to 2.8 g/kg/d. The scNPN2 was started within 4 hours of birth, delivering 1.8 g/kg/d protein. This was increased to 2.4 g/kg/d within 24–48 hours and to 2.8 g/kg/d within a further 48 hours. This difference in aqueous PN administration was the only protocol change and did not alter the fluid regimen overall (thus maintaining same IV glucose intake). This would be expected to increase protein intake by 3.5–4.0 g/kg/wk in the first week of scNPN2 administration only. There were no changes to the IV fat emulsion infusion protocol. Enteral feeds were introduced and incrementally increased in accordance with the LWH feeding policy under the supervision of the consultant neonatologist. PN was incrementally decreased as enteral feeds were increased as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612438730">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612438730">16</xref></sup> Mother’s own milk was used where possible, with donor milk used if maternal milk was unavailable (preterm formula was used only when consent for donor milk not given). Breast milk was routinely fortified once full enteral feeds (150 mL/kg/d) were achieved.</p>
<p>This study was a quality improvement project to evaluate a change in clinical nutrition practice using historical control subjects who were also the subject of a previous change in clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612438730">9</xref></sup> that was also approved by the LWH Audit Committee. All infants born &lt;29 weeks’ gestation and after the introduction of scNPN2 in September 2009 were identified using the electronic data management system. Patients eligible for study had to be born at LWH or transferred within 48 hours between October 2009 and December 2010. Patients surviving &lt;12 days or permanently transferred before 12 days were excluded. There were no other exclusion criteria except those infants recruited to the SCAMP (Standardised, Concentrated, Additional Macronutrients, Parenteral Nutrition) nutrition study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612438730">16</xref></sup> Patients recruited to the SCAMP nutrition study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612438730">16</xref></sup> were excluded as the investigators were blind to the scNPN2 nutrient content in these infants (explaining why 15 months were required to repeat the same-size study previously completed in 6 months). In the previous study (infants receiving scNPN1), data were collected from consecutive patients born between June and December 2006 using the same eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>All data were collected retrospectively using the electronic data management system (DMS) where possible. Routine demographic data and main diagnoses were recorded from electronic patient admission and discharge summaries. Detailed hourly fluid volume and drug infusion volume data were collected for the first 14 days using the electronic DMS and paper intensive care charts. Actual daily scNPN2 and dextrose volumes received by the patient were calculated. This allowed actual daily IV glucose (from all sources), protein, lipid, and energy intakes over this period. Enteral intake was also measured and daily enteral carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and energy intakes calculated using average estimates for donor or mother’s breast milk and manufacturer’s data for formula milk and breast milk fortifier.</p>
<p>Interventions to manage PN “intolerance” were also recorded. These are protocol based and include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0884533612438730" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Hyperglycemia</italic>. An intravenous insulin infusion (standard protocol with sliding scale) when 2 consecutive blood sugars &gt;12 mmol/L (216 mg/dL). Reductions in glucose intake are avoided unless hyperglycemia is uncontrollable with maximum dose insulin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Metabolic acidosis</italic>. Bicarbonate infusions to correct base deficits &gt;5 mmol/L and maintain pH &gt;7.25 (measured by blood gas analysis) once all other potentially contributing factors (eg, circulatory compromise) have been corrected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reductions in aqueous PN if measure (1) or (2) is unsuccessful (rare).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypertriglyceridemia</italic>. The IV fat emulsion infusion rate is reduced when serum triglycerides &gt;2.8 mmol/L.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Recording intervention allowed the calculation of the number of infants requiring at least 1 intervention (any duration) for hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, or hypertriglyceridemia during the 14-day study period. It also allowed the calculation of the number of patient days each intervention was required (eg, insulin days) and at what dosage. The detailed protocols for managing PN intolerance were available electronically at the bedside and did not change between the 2 study periods. The electronic DMS was used to screen for protocol violations by recording all blood gas analysis data (including blood glucose measurement) and triglyceride levels. Bacterial infection (septicemia) and extravasation injury (causing permanent scarring/deformity) were considered further potential PN complications, and daily C-reactive protein (CRP), blood culture, and wound management data (photographic evidence and nursing care record) were also recorded from the DMS for the first 14 days of life. Infection was defined as an infant with 1 or more positive blood cultures and/or 1 or more daily CRP &gt;20 mmol/L. All interventions and investigations were part of routine clinical care.</p>

<title>Blood glucose levels and insulin treatment</title>
<p>The pattern of insulin-treated glucose intolerance was the same in both groups, showing a sharp rise around day 5 (coinciding with maximum carbohydrate being reached) and then falling sharply after day 10. Although the groups are too small for detailed subgroup analysis, this pattern appears to be replicated at all gestations and in infants who had received no or minimal enteral feeds. Each patient had all blood glucose tests reviewed to identify violations of the insulin treatment protocol. No clinically important violations of the hyperglycemia protocol were identified in either group, although 2 minor violations were noted. One patient (group scNPN1) had 2 consecutive blood sugars marginally above 12 mmol/L (216 mg/dL; this subsequently recovered without intervention) and never received insulin: a protocol violation if the hyperglycemia definition is strictly applied. Another infant (group scNPN2) had 2 blood sugars marginally above 12 mmol/L (216 mg/dL), but it was decided not to start insulin because a decision to reduce total fluids (and therefore carbohydrate intake) had already been made because of renal failure.</p>
<p>The review of blood glucose results enabled mean daily blood glucose levels to be calculated for each infant on days 1–14. This, in turn, allowed mean daily glucose levels to be calculated for each group on days 1–14 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0884533612438730">Table 5</xref>). This confirms that the scNPN1 group had poorer glucose control that preceded the peak in insulin use. This difference in glucose control persisted for several days despite higher insulin use in group scNPN1.</p>

<title>Enteral feeding</title>
<p>The speed of enteral feed introduction was relatively slow in both groups, with a median (interquartile range) enteral intake the first 7 days of life of 10 (0–43) mL and 29 (5–55) mL in groups scNPN1 and scNPN2, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .19). This confirms that differences in protein intake were due to parenteral protein and that virtually all carbohydrate intake in the first week was as IV glucose. Group scNPN2 was fed more rapidly in the second week of life: 404 (45–738) mL vs 158 (24–402) mL in group scNPN1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). A high proportion of infants (92% in each group) received at least some of their mother’s own milk in both groups. However, in the 3 infants in whom mother’s milk was not available, donor breast milk was the alternative choice (group scNPN2) rather than formula (group scNPN1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study confirms that the primary aim was achieved: the scNPN2 regimen improved actual protein intake in the first week of life compared with the original scNPN1 regimen. The magnitude of this improvement (3.5 g/kg, days 1–7) was close to the predicted calculation, providing further evidence that the scNPN method of PN administration is efficient in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical environment. More unexpected was the associated large reduction in insulin-treated hyperglycemia in group scNPN2. Insulin administration is an indicator of clinically important hyperglycemia. The daily mean blood glucose data also suggest that early blood glucose control was poorer in group scNPN1 compared with group scNPN2. Insulin use is an important clinical outcome itself, given the practical difficulties with administration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612438730">17</xref></sup> the limited evidence of benefit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612438730">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612438730">19</xref></sup> and the potential risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612438730">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this study associates the increased early protein intake with the fall in insulin usage, there are some limits on the interpretation of a study designed to evaluate a change in clinical practice. The most important of these is the use of a historical comparison and the possibility of confounding factors due to other changes in clinical practice over this time. There were no differences in the hyperglycemia protocol or its implementation. The small (and statistically insignificant) increase in early lipid intake in group scNPN2 was likely to have aggravated rather than reduced hyperglycemia, given soy-based lipid was the IV fat emulsion used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612438730">21</xref></sup> There were no differences in the relevant demographics of the 2 groups, particularly the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction and the use of postnatal inotropes and hydrocortisone. Early sepsis rates were similar in both groups. The pattern of insulin-treated hyperglycemia was the same in both groups, consistent with a metabolic phenomenon. The deterioration in blood glucose control after day 4 coincided with the peak in carbohydrate intake (almost all IV glucose). The superior glucose tolerance in group scNPN2 at this time would be consistent with a metabolic change preceding it, such as the early introduction of protein. There was a difference in enteral intake in the second week, but again this was well after the temporal rise in hyperglycemia. The consistent reduction in the number of infants with glucose intolerance after day 9 suggests metabolic adaptation.</p>
<p>Although the study is small, this reflects the narrow gestational band (&lt;29 weeks’ gestation) in the inclusion criteria and allows effective case matching. This is the highest risk group for early nutrition deficit and PN intolerance, especially hyperglycemia (rare for &gt;28 weeks’ gestation). Indeed, this study is larger than any of those used as the basis for insulin treatment of hyperglycemia in preterm neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612438730">18</xref></sup> The limited exclusion criteria also minimize selection bias.</p>
<p>Hyperglycemia is a common complication of extreme prematurity (rare for &gt;28 weeks’ gestation) and is associated with an increased risk of long-term complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612438730">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612438730">22</xref></sup> Although there is evidence from other intensive care populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612438730">23</xref></sup> that tight blood glucose control is beneficial, there remains a lack of evidence for either the prevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612438730">24</xref></sup> or treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612438730">18</xref></sup> of hyperglycemia in the very preterm infant. Nevertheless, insulin treatment of neonatal hyperglycemia is routine in most NICUs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612438730">25</xref></sup> and is included in international PN guidelines and recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612438730">17</xref></sup> The mechanism of hyperglycemia in preterm infants is not fully understood, but both relative insulin resistance and defective islet β cell function are implicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612438730">26</xref></sup> The former may be more important in the small for gestational age infant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612438730">27</xref></sup> whereas the latter accounts for the high proinsulin levels seen in the hyperglycemic very preterm infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612438730">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612438730">28</xref></sup> Hepatic insulin resistance may also increase the risk of hyperglycemia because this results in failure to suppress gluconeogenesis despite glucose infusion in the early neonatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612438730">29</xref></sup> It is also recognized that the islet β cell population undergoes rapid remodeling in the postnatal period and that prematurity and growth restriction lead to a reduced β cell mass, further increasing the potential for hyperglycemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612438730">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have shown that positive nitrogen balance can be achieved in very preterm infants from day 1 if protein is introduced as soon after birth as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612438730">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612438730"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612438730"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612438730"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612438730">14</xref></sup> Our study suggests that relatively short periods of complete protein deprivation immediately after birth also interfere with optimal metabolic adaptation in very preterm infants for several days after birth. The mechanism for such a sustained action is unclear and the available scientific evidence limited and contradictory. Amino acid infusion has been shown not to affect gluconeogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612438730">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612438730">32</xref></sup> or glucose oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612438730">33</xref></sup> Early protein has been shown to stimulate endogenous insulin production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612438730">34</xref></sup> with an effect demonstrable at 48 (but not 24) hours after the infusion is started. Early introduction of amino acids (without fat emulsion) increases hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612438730">35</xref></sup> In these studies, infants were mostly &gt;29 weeks’ gestation, and more recent studies have reproduced the findings in infants &lt;29 weeks’ gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612438730">11</xref></sup> However, none of these studies introduced protein immediately after birth (average time 24 hours) or evaluated insulin levels or blood glucose control beyond day 3. It is therefore not known whether these early protein effects on insulin levels persist even after the differences in protein intake cease. Whether the mechanism of increased insulin secretion involves more effective conversion of proinsulin by islet β cells, changes in β cell mass, or other factors is also unknown. Effects of early protein on potassium metabolism in very preterm infants are also consistent with increased insulin secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612438730">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early protein may produce a sustained effect on glucose metabolism by altering insulin-like growth factor−1 (IGF-1) concentration. IGF-1 lowers blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis as well as suppressing hepatic glucose production and is stimulated by insulin. The IGFs and their binding proteins are nutritionally regulated in the fetus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612438730">37</xref></sup> IGF-1 activity is directly altered by postnatal nutrition intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612438730">38</xref></sup> Postnatal IGF-1 levels remain low in very preterm infants for several weeks when compared with term infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612438730">39</xref></sup> Evidence suggests that IGF-1 concentration is positively correlated with neonatal protein intake and nitrogen balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612438730">38</xref></sup> However, recent evidence suggests that protein and calorie intake does not correlate with preterm IGF-1 levels during early postnatal growth failure, only in the catch-up phase of growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612438730">40</xref></sup> No randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effect of protein intake on insulin and IGF-1 activity immediately after birth.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates a clinically important reduction in insulin-treated hyperglycemia associated with the introduction of protein within 4 hours of birth in very preterm infants. This may have important implications for the quantities and timing of early protein and glucose administration and the role of insulin treatment. However, as this is not a randomized controlled trial, further study is required to establish causation and understand the metabolic mechanisms.</p>
