<p>In 2000, a year after he was elected Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid offered a personal apology to the victims of the 1965–66 violence in which approximately half a million alleged communists were killed and hundreds of thousands imprisoned without trial. A year earlier he had proposed the formation of a truth and reconciliation commission and invited all political exiles to return to Indonesia. To Wahid, who had a strong commitment to democratic principles, taking these steps to address the historical injustice of the Suharto regime seemed logical and necessary in the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic form of government. Yet when he went so far as to suggest lifting the ban on communism, in place since 1966, many Muslim groups in Indonesia, including those within his own constituency of Nadhlatul Ulama (Awakening of Religious Scholars), responded with outrage. Commenting on white Australian attitudes to historical injustices against indigenous Australians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11431313">Chakrabarty (2007)</xref> notes that it takes a particular social consensus to achieve recognition of ‘historical wounds’, and once achieved they ‘live precarious lives, for the mainstream social consensus that sustains a sense of historical wound may come under attack from quarters that want to dissolve it’ (p. 78). The case of 1965 in Indonesia illustrates the difficulty of achieving a social consensus even in a period of democratic transition. But what are the particular triggers that motivate societies or groups to address historical injustice, and why do social consensuses come about at particular points in time?</p>
<p>In Indonesia the passage of 35 years had produced social forces that, on the one hand, were more conducive to opening the past due to the increasing emphasis and acceptance of discourses of human rights and democracy and, on the other hand, posed barriers to addressing this particular case of historical injustice including the continuing dominance of the Indonesian military and the increased emphasis on religion. Some within the military and Islamic organizations have continued to defend the Suharto period justification of killing of alleged communists as necessary for the protection of the nation and its commitment to religious belief. This discourse persists due to the firmly entrenched historical orthodoxy that the military created during the Suharto regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11431313">McGregor, 2007</xref>), but also due to underlying fears about the possible prosecution of those who took part in the violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X11431313">McGregor, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, in the period since the fall of Suharto in 1998 there have been many competing claims to victimhood amongst alleged communists, the first victims of the regime, through to Muslim, Acehnese, West Papuans and ethnic Chinese victims of military and societal violence. Mirroring patterns elsewhere, in Indonesia the democratic transition propelled victims and civil society groups to demand past injustices be addressed, yet at the same time dominant versions of history, concerns about accountability and competing claims to victimhood diminished a commitment to a social consensus. By 2011 there was still no truth and reconciliation commission and no formal apology or other forms of government directed redress.</p>
<p>In taking steps to acknowledge past injustices, President Wahid was responding to a well-established pattern of national leaders making apologies and attempting to draw a line between the past and the present. From the late 1980s onwards governments and other groups responsible for violence began to issue apologies, endorse truth commissions and even pay reparations for multiple cases of historical injustice around the world, including settler violence, war crimes, racism and political persecution and murder. This string of apologies and other efforts to confront historical injustices suggested an important temporal shift had taken place across the globe. But why did this occur at a particular point in time and why did the trend continue?</p>
<p>The demise of the Soviet Union and associated political alliances commencing in the 1980s triggered a rethinking of the world order and the need for closer attention to historical injustice. Country to country relations assumed increasing importance for the purposes of both politics and trade. In this context governments felt increasingly compelled to acknowledge injustices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X11431313">Barkan, 2000</xref>). At the same time, the end of the Cold War sparked greater attention to previously concealed human rights abuses ‘either side of the Iron Curtain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11431313">Torpey, 2009</xref>: 23). The most significant early precedents for these processes of national reckoning and the definition of crimes against humanity were the Nuremberg Trials of 1946, the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the Luxembourg agreements of 1952. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11431313">Hazan (2010)</xref> notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The West’s handling of Nazi crimes was the womb from which the concept of transitional justice was born. It provided transitional justice’s legitimacy, constructed its moral and legal arguments, and outlined what would become, decades later, the institutions, values, and practices of transitional justice (p. 1).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>During the Cold War and as colonialism continued, these examples of the alleged primacy of human rights in the Western world were put aside due to political and economic expediency. From the end of the Cold War, however, the world increasingly looked back to these postwar measures to address historical injustice as important models. In the post-Cold War transitions from authoritarian to democratic rule in Eastern Europe, South America, South Africa and parts of Asia, including South Korea and eventually Indonesia, governments or civil society groups made a concerted effort to examine and address historical injustices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11431313">Adler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11431313">de Brito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431313">Lewis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11431313">Brauchler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking to the past was a crucial means of nation building in societies undergoing transition in the post-Cold War period. Following the model of postwar West Germany under American tutelage, many countries mirrored ‘the same ethical insistence on assessing the full extent of crimes committed, the same political will to rework the national ethos through policies of commemoration, and the same need for “normalization” by acquiring the certificate of respectability in the international community through reparations and big gestures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11431313">Hazan, 2010</xref>: 22–23). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11431313">Torpey (2009)</xref> believes that, in a process also connected to the end of the Cold War, the reason for the recent ‘avalanche of history’ and the emphasis on ‘reparation politics’ in the contemporary world is due to the shift away from an emphasis on ‘utopian futures’ and an associated ‘collapse of the future’ (pp. 27–29). For him there is now so much emphasis on historical justice because, with the demise of utopian ideologies such as communism, the past is all that nations have left to hold on to.</p>
<p>Others have stressed the important contributions that an increasingly globalized world has made to the impulse to acknowledge historical injustices. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X11431313">Morris-Suzuki (2005)</xref> advances in technology have made it far easier for victims to publicize cases of historical injustice via the internet or other social media, thus compelling governments and others to more readily acknowledge such injustice. In a related argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11431313">Olick (2007)</xref> suggests the current emphasis on regret is not due to historical precedents such as those set in the context of World War Two or to transitions from authoritarian to democratic regimes. Instead the explanation lies in a much broader historical process. For Olick the reason for ‘the recent rise of regret is a historical-sociological one that sees regret as part of broader transformations tied up with the decline, rather than the triumph of the nation-state’ (p. 137) and that it is ‘a form of consciousness particular to our moment’ (p. 138). It is due to the very weakness of nation states that their leaders feel compelled to address historical injustice.</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War produced greater receptiveness amongst many nations to confronting past injustice. At the same time, however, sustained campaigns by aggrieved groups also compelled some governments and perpetrator communities to address historical injustices. Dating back to World War Two, many colonial subjects had ‘dared to imagine the defeat of Nazism might herald the new era of racial equality and self-determination that wartime propaganda had alluded to’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X11431313">Olusoga and Erichsen, 2010</xref>: 346). Instead they were faced with the resumption of colonial rule. Commencing in the 1960s, minority or oppressed groups drew inspiration from anti-colonial movements in Asia, Africa and the Middle East on the basis of recognition that many of the present injustices they suffered were, like the case of colonialism, due to past discrimination and oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11431313">Chakrabarty, 2007</xref>: 75).</p>
<p>The rise of identity politics in the 1960s led to increasing assertions from indigenous, ethnic, religious, sexual and other political minorities for equal rights and for recognition of group identities. In the United States, black Americans led the civil rights movement, in South Africa black groups demanded an end to apartheid and in Australia and Canada indigenous groups escalated campaigns for political and land rights. At the same time historians began to write the histories of these previously marginalized groups. Without pressure from many of these groups and from new groups of victims arising from authoritarian regimes in power between the 1960s and the 1990s in South America, Asia, Africa, Portugal, Spain and Eastern Europe, it is doubtful if the governments of many nations would have acted to address these injustices. For these activists, earlier models of campaigning for historical justice have also been influential: ‘[t]he universalization of the Holocaust provided the victims of many different crimes and injustices with a vocabulary for articulating their claims and grievances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11431313">Berg and Schaefer, 2009</xref>: 7). By means of protests, commemorations, lobbying of governments and NGOs, information campaigns and the use of transnational networks, harmed communities raised awareness about their particular suffering and demands for redress. In doing so they were inspired by the achievements of other redress movements around the world.</p>
<p>The culmination of long-standing activism, increased emphasis on human rights and democracy and trade relationships, and the decreased relevance of nation states and utopian emphases on historical change in the post-Cold War world have provided broader stimuli to movements and governments around the world to demand and address historical injustice. In each specific case, however, there are other important triggers and logics for choices to either confront or ignore historical injustice. In this special issue of <italic>Time &amp; Society</italic>, six contributors offer their reflections on why at particular moments in time, some governments, societies or interest groups have been moved to either address or escalate their demands for historical justice by means of apologies, revised national narratives, protests, transnational activism or joint commemorative initiatives. The case studies examined here cover a diverse range of injustices from settler violence and indigenous dispossession in Namibia, Australia, Canada and Chile to violence committed by the anti-colonial Greek Cypriot group, EOKA, by the Filipino state against a minority religious group and by the American state in the wartime internment of Japanese Americans.</p>
<p>In the first article, Karie Morgan offers a transnational case study of how colonial violence against a minority people has been remembered and addressed within and across minority, national and colonial communities. In the early twentieth century German settlers perpetrated a genocide against the Herero minority in German South-West Africa (which eventually became the Republic of Namibia), resulting in 60,000 to 100,000 deaths, forced labour, dispossession and loss of land for the survivors. The crimes in South-West Africa featured in the deliberations at Versailles in 1919, but by the postwar period had been largely forgotten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X11431313">Olusoga and Erichsen, 2010</xref>). Morgan argues, however, that over the next 100 years the Herero kept memories of the violence alive in oral traditions and through commemorations. Meanwhile, this violence was marginalized in Namibian national histories of resistance against both the Germans and South Africans, and the government made few efforts to demand justice for this crime. The Herero remained a minority group in Namibia comprising around 8 per cent of the population alongside the major ethnic group, the Owambo, for whom colonialism was a shared story of oppression. After independence from South Africa in 1990 there was intense focus on reconciliation which, according to Morgan, ‘effectively meant adopting a Namibian identity and “moving forward” rather than debating the historical responsibility of various groups.’ This attempt to homogenize society, however, served to further fuel an assertion of Herero identity and demands for redress for the genocide. In unison with global self-determination movements, the Herero became an increasingly political community demanding the return of ancestral lands taken from them and occupied thereafter by German settlers.</p>
<p>The rise of indigenous rights movements from the 1960s onwards increased pressure on societies around the world to confront settler violence. These rights movements drew attention not only to historical injustices, but also to the ongoing effects of settler violence. For Germans, the Herero assertion that the war of 1904–1907 culminated in a genocide, involved confronting not only colonial violence, but also the potential precedent this case of genocide had set for the Holocaust. Amongst German Namibians there was resistance to re-examining the colonial past, with some preferring to hold on to the narrative of settler violence as ‘defensive’.</p>
<p>The momentum to address the historical injustice of the Herero genocide reached a peak with the centenary of the genocide in 2004 when the German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development offered a formal apology to the Herero and to Namibians generally. Morgan signals that the apology was triggered in part by a recent lawsuit filed by the Herero in a US court in the District of Columbia against the German government and three German companies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11431313">Jamfa (2007)</xref>, the apology was also a response to fears of negative repercussions for German Namibians if Germany made no concessions. Black Zimbabweans, also a majority population with far less wealth and land than white Zimbabweans, had recently led attacks against white farmers following attempted land reforms. There was thus a sense that if past injustices were not addressed they might impinge on both the wealth and security of German settlers and German companies. Although Germany continues to provide substantial aid to Namibia as an indirect means of addressing the colonial exploitation, it is significant that this is not formally labelled reparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11431313">Jamfa, 2007</xref>: 213–214). While Jamfa views the lack of reparations as indicative of an ‘ambiguous apology’, Morgan argues that the centenary not only led to the symbolic act of an apology, but it also ‘became a historical turning point’. For the first time in 2004 Germans and Namibians jointly commemorated the genocide in Namibia at a cultural and tourism centre founded on land donated by a German settler in the spirit of ‘remembrance and reconciliation’. In line with the commemoration of the genocide, Herero narratives about their experiences also received increased coverage and validation both in Namibia and internationally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11431313">Barkan and Karn (2006)</xref> note that apologies have the capacity to ‘amend the past so that it resonates differently in the present for those who feel aggrieved by it or responsible for it’ (p. 8). There is evidence that the 2004 apology had this effect. In response to the apology, Morgan notes Herero leader Chief Riruako reasoned that ‘merely speaking a historical truth leads to forgiveness which in turn leads to re-humanizing both Germans and Herero’.</p>
<p>Although there were specific factors that drove the 2004 apology, Morgan’s analysis prompts the question to what extent anniversaries, as particular markers of time, can provoke increased attention to historical injustices. In Australia the bicentenary of the landing of the First Fleet, commemorated on 26 January 1988, led to a large march for freedom in Sydney by indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Aboriginal communities that converged in Sydney for the protest declared 1988 a Year of Mourning for Aboriginal people. The Australian government did not, however, issue a formal apology, and instead dual and competing narratives arose, with some celebrating the arrival of the First Fleet and others mourning the beginning of indigenous dispossession. This was indicative of the broad and continuing divide within Australian society about interpretations of the white settler past and indigenous experiences of this past. In response to increased indigenous activism and international pressure the Australian and Canadian governments initiated inquiries into assimilation policies and the forced removal of children. Although the Australian government commenced a formal reconciliation effort in the late 1980s, sociologist Damien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11431313">Short (2008)</xref> argues that ‘far from being a genuine post-colonial exercise the political reality of Australian reconciliation was one of intense resistance to any change in the colonial structures that continue to dominate and subordinate indigenous people’ (p. 8). In an alternative reading, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431313">Celermajer (2006)</xref> has argued that the Sorry or Apology Movement, signaled popular support for a collective apology on the basis that white Australians ‘shared in this national failure and were unavoidably tainted with the legacy of shame’ (p. 157). The Sorry Movement arose in opposition to the lack of an official apology in Australia following a government report on the Stolen Generations, generations of indigenous children removed from their families and put into foster care, under the assumption that they would be better assimilated and cared for in white families. In Australia and Canada the momentum of indigenous movements continued and resulted in official apologies in 2008, but alongside these formal steps to address injustice there has always been debate about the appropriateness, genuineness and adequacy of such responses.</p>
<p>Through a comparison of debates about versions of ‘national’ history presented in the National Museum of Australia and the Canadian Museum of Civilization, in this volume Amanda Nettelbeck argues that in the 1990s there were marked shifts in the way official institutions like museums began to represent settler or contact history. Museums were once important sites for the justification of the colonial project because they promoted particular views of evolution and history, which positioned white western societies as the apex of human achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431313">Bennett, 2004</xref>). Challenging the ‘orthodox foundational story of peaceful occupation’, indigenous activists and a handful of white historians in settler and former colonial societies put forward new interpretations of settler histories as violent. In response, museum curators were forced to rethink benign versions of settler histories. Reflecting a new commitment to the inclusion of indigenous people in museum practices, the National Museum of Australia and the Canadian Museum of Civilization emphasized previously marginalized indigenous versions of history. Yet these new versions of the past provoked strong reactions from white Australians and Canadians who, according to Nettelbeck, sought to preserve ‘conventional forms of historical knowledge’. Central to these disputes was the idea of the need for a positive national image and an argument that crimes from the past cannot be inherited by subsequent generations. Both these views were promoted repeatedly by former Australian Prime Minister, John Howard.</p>
<p>But there is another reason why settler histories will continue to be contested. Efforts to ‘revision’ (Nettelbeck) the national past have the potential to undermine not only a positive sense of national identity, but also to challenge the continuing basis of settler societies including the occupation and continuing exploitation of lands that were illegally taken. Underpinning fears of historical revision thus are fears about claims that may be made on the basis of acknowledged injustices, in particular the take-over of sovereign lands. In 1992 the High Court of Australia, following a case brought by plaintiffs from Murray Island in the Torres Straits, including Eddie Mabo, handed down a decision (the ‘Mabo decision’) recognizing native title, thereby acknowledging indigenous ties to the land prior to white settlement of Australia. The ruling overturned the assumption of <italic>terra nullius</italic>, that Australia was uninhabited prior to Cook’s arrival in 1770. It also prompted widespread panic amongst the broader population and the mining lobby that indigenous people would begin to claim residential and mining lands.</p>
<p>In Chile, the indigenous Mapuche people, who are also continuing to fight for recognition of their land and economic rights, have similarly had to contend with the obstacle of dominant narratives of national identity in which they are either invisible or demarcated as a threatening ‘other’. Commencing with their ‘conquest’ of the Americas, Europeans tried to abolish indigenous cultures by means of either assimilation or marginalization of allegedly ‘barbaric’ people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X11431313">Maybury-Lewis, 2002</xref>). The Mapuche comprise around 5 per cent of the Chilean population and have waged resistance, not only against the Spanish, but also against the independent republic of Chile before, during and after the Pinochet dictatorship (1973–1990). During the Pinochet years Chile became emblematic of American-supported ‘dirty war dictatorships’ in South America on the one hand, and the galvanization of international human rights organizations on the other hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431313">Stern, 2010</xref>: xxvii). The trial in Spain of Pinochet was heralded as an extraordinary international precedent, yet for all the attention it received scholars often characterized Chile as promoting ‘a culture of oblivion’, accentuating the preference for forgetting the past. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431313">Stern (2010)</xref> alternatively argues that instead of forgetting there has been a process of selective remembering in Chile such that ‘social actors behind distinct frameworks are seeking to define that which is truthful and meaningful about a great collective trauma’ (p. xxiv). Within this process of selectively remembering the dictatorship, indigenous Chileans have fared poorly.</p>
<p>In her article, Gilda Waldman argues that the transition from Pinochet to a more democratic government produced expectations amongst the Mapuche of a break from the long history of oppression commencing with Spanish rule. In the new democratic era the <italic>Concertación</italic> governments encouraged the commemoration of suffering under the Pinochet regime, but with little recognition of Mapuche suffering. Moreover Mapuche interests continue to conflict with those of the new government due to the emphasis on economic projects that require ongoing use of Mapuche lands. In line with indigenous movements around the world Mapuche people have increasingly agitated for their political and economic rights, but a stumbling block to achieving these rights has been negative attitudes to the Mapuche in the wider population based on a persistent national narrative in which there is no place for the Mapuche. Waldman argues that Chilean national identity has long been premised on the idea of Chile as a white nation. Unlike the case of Australia and to some extent Canada, historians in Chile, with the exception of José Bengoa, have not paved the way for a broader acceptance of indigenous histories of oppression. The case of the Mapuche highlights the consequences of invisibility in national narratives and the fact that political transitions do not always produce a thorough re-evaluation of the past. Further to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11431313">Hazan (2010)</xref> argues that in periods of transitional justice there is an impulse to diminish the state’s influence and create a competitive sense of victimhood due to the new emphasis on victims, versus the state, as sacred (pp. 151–155). The case of the Mapuche is just one example of how in such contests certain victims are always prioritized over others.</p>
<p>Following the achievement of independence from Britain in 1960, there have also been clear limits in efforts to address historical injustices committed in the failed struggle for Cyprus’s unification with Greece between 1955 and 1959. Most Greek Cypriots remained disappointed with this outcome, whereas Turkish Cypriots desired unification with Turkey. Continuing dissatisfaction with this political outcome culminated in the 1974 Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus and the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The violence during and after the Turkish invasion including the disappearance of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, to some extent subsumed memories of earlier violence and became the focus of claims for historical justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11431313">Sant Cassia, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In their article Kathleen Ireton and Iosif Kovras explore why, alongside a global trend towards apologies, the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA), comprised of Greek Cypriots who initiated armed struggle against the British with the aim of achieving union with Greece, have never apologized for violence they committed against both left-wing Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The authors emphasize that in the context of post-1974 Cyprus it has been increasingly important to stress national unity rather than a history of divisions in order to promote the cause of reunification. Furthermore, Greek nationalism, on which EOKA draws heavily for legitimation, is premised on the idea of a continual struggle against national traitors. Members of EOKA fear that by apologizing for violence, especially against Greek Cypriots, they may be labelled traitors, with potential political ramifications. EOKA rely for legitimacy on their own claims to being victims of an anti-colonial struggle against the British. Underpinning this dispute, as in the case of disputes over settler versus indigenous histories, are thus fears about the political consequences of an acknowledgment of past wrongs. In Cyprus, civil society groups have, however, acted as pressure groups to encourage acknowledgement of this historical injustice, especially in the lead up to the failed referendum of reunification (based on the 2002 Annam plan). Although it was not ultimately successful, the historical juncture provided by the proposed reunification acted as a temporal stimulus for revisiting past injustices.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the peace process negotiated between Southern Filipino Muslims and the state in the 1990s produced a similar stimulus for revisiting historical injustices. Here, as in the case of the Mapuche minority in Chile, Muslims have also been negatively depicted in national histories, largely because of their exclusion from, and indeed resistance to, inclusion in the Philippine nation. During their colonial rule the Spanish began to refer to numerous tribes of Muslim Filipinos concentrated in Sulu and Mindanao in the southern Philippines as ‘Moros’, from the Spanish word for Moors. Both Spanish and American colonialists classified the Moros as a minority or ‘wild’ people who should be integrated with the dominant ‘civilized’ Christian majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X11431313">Amaroso, 2003</xref>: 121). It was due to this very view of difference that the Americans placed the southern Philippines under a separate system of military rule until 1914, which in turn enhanced a separate sense of identity and resistance to centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X11431313">Abinales, 2010</xref>). During his dictatorship of 1965–1986 President Marcos sought to further integrate Mindanao into the nation, resulting in the beginning of clashes between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). In the context of the Philippines’ claim to Sabah (part of the island of Borneo), which the British and Malays had proposed to integrate in the postcolonial nation of Malaysia, members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines began training Muslim recruits in preparation for an attempt to reclaim Sabah by force. In the course of training, members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines killed the Muslim recruits who had attempted a mutiny. Critics of Marcos temporarily drew attention to the Jabidah Massacre as a way of attacking his regime, but in the transition from Marcos to a more democratic system it was crimes against the people more broadly that were remembered alongside a triumphant narrative of how all Filipinos had joined together in a ‘people power’ movement to overthrow Marcos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431313">Claudio, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Rommel Curaming and Syed Muhammad Khairudin Aljunied trace how the 1968 assassination of Muslim military recruits became a symbol in Moro political campaigns for justice and greater independence from the Philippine state and why from the late 1990s this incident received increased national and international attention. After some initial interest in the incident, the so-called Jabidah Massacre remained obscure to non-Muslim Filipinos for several decades. Meanwhile, self-identified Moros commemorated Jabidah as an important chapter in their struggle for autonomy. In an attempt to fuel claims for a Moro nation, Moros promoted a ‘myth of the eternal resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X11431313">Abinales, 2010</xref>: 120), which is in fact inconsistent with more complex patterns of both collaboration with, and resistance to, the American and post-colonial regimes. A key shift towards greater acknowledgment of the injustices against Moros, Curaming and Aljunied argue, occurred in the late 1990s as civil society groups began to react against the increasingly aggressive hawks within the Philippines military. These hawks were seeking to advance their careers by means of a successful military solution to the conflict. There was a growing consensus amongst Christian Filipinos that the Moros could be incorporated peacefully into the nation and that the war was draining the national economy. At the same time there was increased international support for this process in the context of the developing War on Terror and the perception that the Southern Philippines, because of its disgruntled Muslim population, was a strategically important zone. Curaming and Aljunied argue that ‘the main driving force behind both forgetting and remembering is neither simply the pursuit of, nor the outright denial of, historical injustice, but the common interests of political stakeholders’. For them ‘the potency of the Jabidah Massacre as a political symbol primarily rests on it being an exemplar of state violence and injustice’, which means that commemorating the Jabidah Massacre and pushing for a peace settlement provided an opportunity for broader critiques of state violence. When long running peace talks with the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) intensified and then faltered, a broader coalition of groups used the 40th anniversary of the massacre to commemorate the massacre and engender support for the peace process.</p>
<p>Two decades earlier, as the Cold War came to a close, the American government had begun to publicly address a series of injustices in American history. These re-examinations were prompted by efforts to redefine America’s global role in the post-Cold War era, but they were also the result of long campaigns and activism from African, Native and Japanese Americans. Between 1941 and 1946, 110,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans were detained in camps in the United States due to fears about their loyalty. From the 1960s onwards, Japanese Americans had begun to challenge dominant narratives of wartime internment as a wartime mistake pushing the far more radical interpretation of internment camps as the equivalent of concentration camps and relating them to a longer history of racism based on ideas of white superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X11431313">Murray, 2008</xref>: 232–237). The movement for redress escalated in the 1970s, with many survivors providing testimony, signing petitions and lobbying the public and government officials, and culminated in the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.</p>
<p>Drawing on the speeches of members of Congress during debates over the Civil Liberties Act, Cathleen Kozen analyses why in 1988 the US government not only apologized to Japanese and Japanese Americans, but also awarded reparations. For Kozen the congressional debates reveal a newly emerging national American narrative concerning American exceptionalism. Kozen argues that by passing the bill Congress attempted to perpetuate the long-standing narrative of the Second World War as the ‘good war’, but to also promote a narrative of Japanese internment as an aberration in American history, an injustice based on racial prejudice which should never be repeated. Congress attempted to achieve a ‘moral triumph’ and ‘national redemption’ by means of this bill because of the particular historical moment the United States faced in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Japan had been a crucial Cold War ally for the United States commencing with the initial occupation of Japan in the postwar era. The end of the Cold War prompted ‘a significant restructuring of relations between the United States and is Cold War allies in Asia, which in turn set in motion new interpretations of the wartime past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11431313">Jager and Mitter, 2007</xref>: 5). At the time the bill was being debated, the United States had a large and increasing trade deficit with Japan and Japan was the largest international creditor in the world. Kozen notes that the floundering US economy provided an economic motive for the bill, and increasing clashes between black and white Americans provided an incentive for symbolic racial politics. Even as the bill was passed, members of Congress raised concerns about potential future claims from African Americans for slavery or Native Americans for dispossession. Although there were subsequent apologies in 1993 to Native Hawaiians and in 2009 to Native Americans and African Americans, no reparations were paid. Kozen reflects on the fact that a decade after this bill the US was again targeting ‘foreign’ citizens and residents on the basis of race – this time of Arab and South Asian background – for screening and detention in the name of America’s ‘war on terror’. For her, debates surrounding the bill represent a lost opportunity for a much broader re-examination of the history of American racism.</p>
<p>Across these six articles authors variously consider when and why there have or have not been shifts in narratives about historical injustice over time and why apologies and reparations have been made at certain points in time. While each article deals with a different context, they share common themes. In almost all the case studies there have been contests over national narratives about past injustice. At the heart of every conflict is a struggle over historical memory and over the extent and form in which events or people are recorded in national histories. In settler societies such as Namibia, Australia and Canada, a key source of contention is how settlement is represented and what implications these representations have for particular groups of people. For indigenous people recognition of settler violence and harm validates their suffering. For many settlers, however, historical revision raises questions not only about their own identity as a group, but also about their ongoing rights.</p>
<p>Many of the contests over memory are underpinned by concerns about the economic implications of historical revision in terms of not only claims for reparations, but also claims for the return of land either occupied or designated for lucrative economic projects. In a neo-liberal age, in which economic considerations are paramount, these concerns dictate the responses of governments. This is especially true in developing economies such as that of Chile, but also in resource-rich settler societies like Namibia, Australia and Canada. In Cyprus and Australia, resistance to historical revision is also a product of concern about the ongoing ramifications for either a particular political group such as EOKA or for national identity.</p>
<p>In national contexts there are often clear hierarchies of victims, and choices are sometimes made to gloss over or exploit the suffering of one group as part of a unified story of national suffering or redemption. This is evident in the case of Namibian national narratives of colonial resistance and suffering in which the genocide of Herero was largely overlooked and in the exclusion of Mapuche from Chilean narratives of suffering under Pinochet and the broader and related othering of Mapuche in dominant discourses about non-indigenous Chile. In the case of Cyprus, national narratives of the anti-colonial struggle provide a direct impediment for any acknowledgement of the crimes of Greek Cypriots, and pressure from civil society has not been sufficient to overcome this barrier. In the Philippines, however, where the post-colonial state has tried continuously to incorporate Moros into the nationalist project, civil society groups joined together with the MNLF to commemorate the Jabidah massacre, primarily as a means of exposing state violence more generally and hoping to end the escalating violence in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>In the United States, Japanese Americans achieved a privileged position alongside a string of other contenders for reparations and apologies due to the fact that there was only a relatively small number of potential claimants, but also because of the importance of the Japanese economy to the United States and the need to re-negotiate that bilateral relationship as the Cold War ended. Here an effort to address historical injustice became a basis for national redemption and a re-articulation of American nationalism. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11431313">Short (2008)</xref> has argued that in Australia reconciliation has also served to some extent as a ‘nation building agenda that appeared to offer post-colonial legitimacy via the inclusion of previously excluded Aboriginal peoples, but which actually served to weaken Aboriginal claims based on their traditional “separateness” from settler culture’ (p. 7). Hence, despite the tendency to herald the 1990s as the beginning of a new era in dealing with past injustice there are many reasons for scepticism with regards to the sincerity of these movements and the extent to which they address the grievances of harmed groups. Although nations may be less important after the end of the Cold War, within each country nationalism has continued to play a key role in either enabling or inhibiting the processes of addressing historical injustice. In many cases national narratives contribute directly to injustice due to the necessity of defining who is within and outside a national community. It is in this context that historians can play crucial roles by challenging national orthodoxies and drawing attention to their hidden violence.</p>
