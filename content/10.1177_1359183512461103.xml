<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to investigate and theorise practices of appropriation from indigenous cultures among interior and accessories designers in Misiones province, northeast Argentina. In particular, the article intends to critically extend the notion of appropriation by introducing ‘overlay’ as a new concept to analytically grasp the uneven cultural traffic from the indigenous artisans to the designers and the majority society at large. It is argued that in this process the ‘meaning’ of the original Guaraní designs is suspended and ultimately short-circuited, as it is no longer available either to the Guaraní, who do not consume the final products, or to the customers, who are not provided with any information on the meaning of the patterns. However, the article does not insist on a presumed ‘loss of meaning’ for these objects. Rather, the article foregrounds notions of materiality, creativity and innovation in relation to the specific economic and working relations between Mbya Guaraní artisans and designers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The title of this article responds to specific characteristics of the design process under review here, but also owes inspiration to the title of a book by the American art critic Lucy Lippard. In <italic>Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art of Prehistory</italic> (1983: 1) she writes:<disp-quote>
<p>This book, then, is an exercise in breaking away from conventional ways of looking at the visual arts. My subject is not prehistoric images <italic>in</italic> contemporary art, but prehistoric images <italic>and</italic> contemporary art. What I’ve learned from mythology, archaeology, and other disciplines is the overlay’s invisible bottom layer. My internal method is that of collage – the juxtaposition of two unlike realities combined to form an unexpected new reality. I have tried to weave together ideas and images of very different cultures by making one a metaphor for the other, and vice versa. (emphases in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst I am not suggesting that the designers (principally from the company <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, on which more below) that I am discussing in this article share Lippard’s agenda, her working method and adoption of the concept of ‘overlay’ are nevertheless instructive for thinking through the processes of producing the design objects that I am concerned with here.</p>
<p>Overlay is understood here as a combination of two (or more) different systems of meaning, which co-exist unmitigated alongside each other – a kind of composite alterity, where one side does not immediately change the other, or indeed changes or transmutes into the other (and thus becomes the other).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359183512461103">1</xref></sup> In fact, rather than dealing with a process of cultural appropriation, as I have analysed in other instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512461103">Schneider, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512461103">2006</xref>) – which implies the taking out of context, copying or duplication of cultural material and putting it into a new context – here the process of working with the cultural expressions of the Mbya Guaraní is rationalised by the designers, as one of fusion and resignification. Whilst the working processes and commercial labour dealings of the designers with the Guaraní clearly display and reveal their position of superior economic power, the transfer of ‘intellectual property’, in the first instance, at least, does not seem to be the main issue here. The design objects are manufactured as a combination and recombination of creole, that is: white society’s design mould, form or base with indigenous design elements that are provided by the indigenous artists at their own choice. Thus the decision on which indigenous designs to use, as well as the choice of specific materials, rests within the indigenous community. Yet despite an apparent indigenous prerogative over the design patterns, the designers can try to exercise influence over the overall choice of materials even if, ultimately, the indigenous artisans also decide which material to use for the specific design pattern. Whilst the designers claim the final authority and authorship over these composite objects, and indeed the process of commercialisation, at first sight it is not entirely clear who is ’overlaying’ what, and what, in terms of meaning and signification, is concealed, revealed or, in fact, newly created in this process – a conundrum this article seeks to disentangle to some degree.</p>
<p>But can this process of manufacturing a composite product simply be described as an even, balanced contribution to the final design object, in which designers and indigenous artisans participate to equal degrees? More to the point: how are we to classify such objects, and what kinds of agency are we to attribute to designers, artisans and indeed the art objects themselves in this process? Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359183512461103">Gell (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512461103">Henare et al. (2007)</xref>, agency is understood here as a distributed phenomenon, where different ‘actors’, designers, artisans and objects are entangled in relational networks of agency.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> was founded in 2000 in the town of Aristóbulo del Valle in the centre of Misiones province by two architects, Daniela Olivera and Liliana Gerber de Closs. In Daniela’s words, after the ‘crisis of 2000’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359183512461103">2</xref></sup> they wanted to do something with their ‘identity’, that is to link Misiones’ regional identity to their design activity. As Daniela explained to me:<disp-quote>
<p>We observed that there was an absence of identity in the craft production of Misiones. When one talks of the craft of the north of Argentina [i.e. the north-western Andean provinces] or the Pampas, it is perceived to have a very strong identity. But craft from Misiones didn’t have this strong identity, or at least we hadn’t yet discovered it. So, the idea was to design objects for daily use with the artisans. At the beginning, the idea was to work with all artisans in Misiones. There are also interesting things among European immigrants, for example. But what most persists from the beginning is the traditional crafts of the Guaraní.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in my earlier work with Argentinian artists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512461103">Schneider, 2006</xref>), my research here focused primarily on the designers’ (and not the indigenous) perspective in the appropriation process (in this specific case, a kind of composite overlay). This is a deliberate choice of ‘studying up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512461103">Nader, 1974[1969]</xref>) or, in more current terms, to study primarily the agency of those who are more powerful in this process of appropriation. Of course, the Guaraní are far from passive agents in this encounter, and their long history of contact with non-indigenous settler society since the conquest, engendering concurrent processes of incorporation (e.g. into the Jesuit mission regime) and retreat during the colonial period, as well as later marginalisation, has given rise to a vast literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1359183512461103">3</xref></sup> At present, the Mbya Guaraní communities of Misiones are the most immediate indigenous other to the designers who are themselves of European immigrant descent, and it is with the community of Ka’aguy Poty<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1359183512461103">4</xref></sup> (in close proximity to Aristóbulo del Valle) that they entertain a commercial relationship for the manufacture of design objects. The most commonly accepted sub-divisions of Guaraní communities in the lowland border regions between Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil in the present are, Mbya Guaraní, Avá Guaraní and Pai Taviterã, in addition to the Guaraní in eastern Bolivia (often called Chiriguanos in the literature and by outsiders, but who call themselves Guaraní, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512461103">Gustafson, 2009</xref>). It is estimated that in 2008 about 5500 Mbya Guaraní and 1000 Avá Guaraní lived in Misiones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512461103">Bartolomé, 2009</xref>: 66). Most Mbya Guaraní and Avá Guaraní live in villages (<italic>teko’a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1359183512461103">5</xref></sup> in Guaraní; variably <italic>aldeas, pueblos</italic> or <italic>comunidades</italic> for Spanish speakers), some of them in close proximity to towns such as San Ignacio Miní (a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its Jesuit mission ruins), or Aristóbulo del Valle. Given the great mobility of the Guaraní and recent legislation that requires communities to legalise their title, the estimates of the number of communities also vary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1359183512461103">6</xref></sup> The Mbya Guaraní of the Ka’aguy Poty used to practise a mixed economy, consisting of subsistence horticulture, fishing, hunting and gathering, as well as complementary craft production for sale on roadside stalls and occasional salaried work by the men in the maté, tea, tobacco, and tung tree plantations. However, large-scale deforestation meant that more recently the Mbya Guaraní also have to live from government hand-outs (foodstuffs), as well as small salaried occupations as auxiliary teachers, sanitary agents or health aides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359183512461103">Vom Hau and Wilde, 2010</xref>: 1292; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359183512461103">Wilde, 2007</xref>). Compared to the white, creole majority society, most Mbya Guaraní live in a very marginal situation of precarious living and nutritional conditions, often characterised by extreme poverty (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359183512461103">Vom Hau and Wilde, 2010</xref>: 1284; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359183512461103">Wilde, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359183512461103">Zonta et al., 2011</xref>). Whilst it is principally the men who gather the raw materials in the forest, both men and women produce the crafts objects in the village – made of basketry and carved wood – which they then sell on roadside stalls or to governmental and non-governmental agencies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512461103">Remorini, 2009</xref>: 135, 139).</p>

<title>The work of overlay</title>
<p>For the artisans of the indigenous community of Ka’aguy Poty, the artisanal elements they contribute to the final product is work commissioned by <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, which provides them with some cash income, as their cacique,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1359183512461103">7</xref></sup> Aureliano Duarte, acknowledged in our conversation. The designers vehemently insist that they ‘do not sell objects made by the indigenous artisans’, but that they have the Mbya Guaraní ‘coating or overlaying’ (<italic>revestir</italic>) the objects according to the designers’ specifications, for which they, the designers, provide the base and on which they further elaborate.</p>
<p>A wide variety of objects are produced through the specific process of ‘overlaying’ or ‘coating’ and are later commercialised by <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>. Among these are furniture (tables, chairs, armchairs, paravents [screens]), interior design articles (lamps, mirrors, bags, boxes, basketry, cushions, bottle ‘coats’, plates and plate mats) and personal accessories (wristbands) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512461103">Figure 1</xref>). All of these will have been decorated with different Guaraní designs, mainly as basketry or wickerwork, which to the uninitiated observer, unfamiliar with Guaraní symbolism, appear as intricate geometric, abstract designs, but which for the Guaraní represent very specific mythological animals and plants.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Carlos Mordo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512461103">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">2001)</xref> fundamentally criticised earlier studies for their lack of interest in the mythological and symbolic background to the patterns of Guaraní basketry designs. He described in detail the fabrication process of the Guaraní basketry, and outlined its graphic qualities in terms of dark and light contrasts achieved through different types of plant fibres and dying techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo, 1997</xref>: 80–84, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">2001</xref>: 199–209). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">Mordo (2001</xref>: 204–206) highlighted the aesthetic value of Guaraní basketry as an art form sui generis (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512461103">Escobar, 1993</xref>) and emphasised the rhythmic patterning of the seemingly abstract geometric designs whilst clearly indicating their symbolic referents, such as certain snakeskin motifs of the most common designs (<italic>jegua mboi</italic> – ‘adornment of the viper’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo, 1997</xref>: 82). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512461103">Blanca Barrios (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">2009)</xref> has investigated in depth the meaning of Guaraní basketry designs and their production processes. Barrios, too, concluded that Mbya Guaraní basketry is a proper art form with very specific techniques and symbolic meanings attached to the individual decorative patterns. Barrios’s study included direct research with Mbya Guaraní communities in Misiones, observation of basketry production techniques and interviews with basket makers.</p>
<p>The basic materials are <italic>tacuara</italic> (<italic>gadua trinii; gadua angustifolia</italic>; a type of reed) for the basic basketry and a fibre obtained from the aerial root of the <italic>güembé</italic> plant (<italic>philodendron bipinnatifidum</italic>) for decoration, in addition to plants used for dying – <italic>isipó pytâ</italic> (liana) and <italic>catiguá</italic> (tree bark) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512461103">Barrios, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">2009</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512461103">Keller, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512461103">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512461103">Susnik, 1986</xref>: 9–21). The decorations are based on a definite number of rectangular base patterns where light and dark fibres are contrasted in the weave and which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">Barrios (2009</xref>: 79–80, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">Mordo, 2001</xref>: 199–209) lists as six ‘modules’: the point (<italic>pete í</italic>), a stepping pattern of oblique lines (<italic>richy</italic>), angular lines (<italic>karê</italic>), the cross (<italic>kuruzú</italic>), rhombic and rectangular patterns and parallelograms (<italic>korâ</italic>), the butterfly (<italic>panambí pepó</italic>), and a snake-like pattern of continuous lines (<italic>pukú</italic>). These base patterns are then joined by the Mbya Guaraní artisans to form a variety of larger combinations, which are also used to ‘coat’ (<italic>revestir</italic>) a variety of utilitarian objects, such as bottles, baskets, wristbands, round and rectangular trays, thermos bottles, maté gourds, maté straws (<italic>bombillas</italic>) and even pencils and pens. These are the objects Mbya Guaraní produce and market themselves (in contrast to the <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> design products).</p>
<p>Most of these are for sale as ethnic craft objects on roadside stalls, consisting of a simple wooden structure from which to hang objects, and a small display bench on which to place items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359183512461103">Figure 2</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1359183512461103">8</xref></sup> and at the office of the head organization of the Guaraní in Misiones, the <italic>Dirección de Asuntos Guaranies</italic> in Posadas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359183512461103">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>A number of combinations of basic patterns can be further elaborated on and express more complex mythological and symbolic meanings, most of which are only intelligible to the Mbya Guaraní artisans, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">Barrios (2009</xref>: 91) points out, or even only to the elderly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo (1997</xref>: 81–82) emphasises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1359183512461103">9</xref></sup> Specifically, certain patterns represent the rattlesnake (<italic>mboi chini pará</italic>), a harmless snake (<italic>ñacaniná pará</italic>) and the more dangerous crossed pit viper (<italic>aká kuruchú pará</italic>), respectively. According to Barrios, the rattlesnake is admired for its courage, and the pattern is used on bows and arrows to enhance their effectiveness whilst it can also have protective power on a wristband. The <italic>ñacaniná pará</italic>, on the other hand, is considered a mascot of God, and the Mbya Guaraní feel protected when they encounter one on their way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">Barrios (2009</xref>: 98) writes that women who give birth also bind them around their waist to achieve a painless birth. Variations in representation relate to various subspecies inhabiting the trees, the water and the open land. In addition, the Mbya Guaraní artisans use a great variety of creative combinations of all design elements, thus achieving new patterns. As Opyguá Rosendo Moreira, an artisan and a member of the council of elders of the village of Arandú explained to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">Barrios (2009</xref>: 106), such creative work can be called <italic>parâ etâ</italic>, or ‘embellished, or beautifully decorated (<italic>floreado</italic>) with many designs’.</p>
<p>The design products of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> are also variously coated with these patterns, but without specific reference to, or explanations of, their meanings. They are available for sale at a number of venues. Recently, the province of Misiones and the municipality of Aristóbolo del Valle have built a new building at an important road junction of the city with a number of shops promoting artisanal products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512461103">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> rents one of the shops (on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512461103">Figure 4</xref>), and the neighbouring shop is let to another ethnic art company (at the far end, right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512461103">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, just around the corner at the other side of the building, the Guaraní have their own shop (on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512461103">Figure 4</xref>). However, at the time of my visit, this shop was closed and nobody was available for interview. Yet Daniela Olivera pointed out that it is crucial that the indigenous people have their own shop in close proximity to <italic>Misiones Creativa’s</italic> outlet and that they are not in competition, but form a necessary complement to each other: ‘We could not have been here without them. We need them to be here, next to us. There is no sense of us being here, without them’, she insisted several times. The reason for this is that people would be able to see both the origins and reference of <italic>Misiones Creativa’s</italic> design work, whilst at the same time appreciating the difference between the two. The main difference, according to <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> is that they, as designers, add something new, literally a kind of ‘added value’ (also later justified and reflected in the final sales price) that transforms ethnic craft objects, or rather ethnic craft elements used on the new objects, into ‘avant-garde’ design products. As Daniela expressed it: ‘The Guaraní artisans only contribute a part to the final object. We are not selling <italic>their</italic> craft object. <italic>We</italic> make the final design object.’</p>

<title>Composite overlays and the suspension of meaning</title>
<p>The assemblage and somehow unmediated co-existence of the three shops on the outskirts of Aristóbulo del Valle are another indication of what can be called ‘composite overlays’. However, because of its research emphasis on the designers (and not primarily on the Mbya Guaraní artisans), this article does not pretend to answer the question of whether there are equivalents or indeed contrasts in the Guaraní concepts, their ways of working, imagery and symbolism to the rather ingenious processes of coating or overlay the designers are propagating. Nor can it fully respond to the question of whether there are changes of meaning and signification attached to the ornaments used once they have been taken out of their traditional context and are reproduced in the context of new design objects. Perhaps, to some degree at least, for the Guaraní these become design products ‘without meaning’, ‘suppressed meaning’ or, even better, ‘suspended meaning’. Thus, for the Guaraní their acts of mimesis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1359183512461103">10</xref></sup> (expressed in our case as an attachment or ‘overlay’ to the <italic>forms</italic> of the majority society and specifically to those provided by the designers) are arguably coupled to contemporaneous acts of forgetting, observed also in other historical instances, such as the selective appropriation of Western musical string instruments for their religious ceremonies (e.g. the five-string and three-string guitar, <italic>rabel</italic>), whilst refusing to adopt Christian religion in forest zones of refuge not occupied by the Jesuit missions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512461103">Ruiz, 1998</xref>; and more generally on religious practices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512461103">Fausto, 2007</xref>: 89–92). The geometric patterns on the <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> design objects are then best comprehended as representing a kind of closed or encapsulated meaning intelligible to the Mbya Gauraní artisans, but hidden to the white buyers, in the sense that the meaning attached to the design patterns is not revealed to the ‘white’ creole beholder or consumer of these products; nor are they returned or consumed within the Guaraní communities. Whilst the patterns are visible, meaning here remains ‘enfolded’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1359183512461103">11</xref></sup> through the process of overlay and transfer of context. Put another way, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512461103">Lippard’s (1983</xref>: 1) metaphor that opened this article, meaning has become ‘overlay’s invisible bottom layer’.</p>
<p>This is for two reasons, one being that the designers themselves, as they admitted in our conversation, ‘did not specifically investigate the meaning’, and secondly that the tags attached to the items provide no further information, other than that they are ‘made by men and women from the village of Ka’aguy Poty in the valley of Kuña Pirú, Misiones’ (see also note 4). Only the materials are further specified, for example: ‘Mbya basketry braided with fine threads of different types of <italic>tacuara</italic> reed and <italic>güembé</italic>. The <italic>tacuara</italic> can be dyed a reddish colour with <italic>isipó</italic> leaves [a kind of liana].’ However, nothing is mentioned as to the meaning of the patterns (which is actually also true of the craft objects the Mbya Guaraní sell themselves). When I probed Daniela on this she could only answer with a certain degree of specificity, without really explaining the further meaning of the designs:<disp-quote>
<p>They explained to me on some occasions what the designs signified. They told me, for example, that there were frogs and snakes. This is what they most use, designs which have to do with the vegetation, the flora and fauna. They are like codes. But there are also new designs that are very interesting. There is a background and figures, there is lots of geometry and mathematics.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, the indigenous artisans do not provide any additional information about the designs once they have delivered them as part of the new design forms. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet (2005</xref>: 117) writes, ‘objects <italic>can</italic> escape the intentions of their creators’ (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>The suspension, or short-circuiting, of meaning of these patterns once they leave the community is mirrored by other objects of the Mbya Guaraní, which although they do not change fundamentally in their appearance, have different roles to fulfil once they enter a new context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo (1997</xref>: 75–76) writes lucidly on this process:<disp-quote>
<p>Few objects maintain simultaneously their use value for the community and their exchange value for marketing. This is the case of the bows and arrows which are produced in two different versions: as functional objects used by the same artisan for hunting or fishing – their manufacture requires more time and a careful selection of material – and bows for decoration, useless for hunting, but beautiful and ornate in the eyes of the tourist. The same happens with the baskets (<italic>ajaká</italic>) produced for sale, whereas the <italic>ajaká eté</italic>, baskets used for the gathering of manioc and other foodstuffs, are produced for the <italic>paisanos</italic> of the community. (my translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The designers, on the other hand, brand the products generically as based on Guaraní and Misiones culture or roots, as identity products from Misiones, without giving any more specific information. Therefore, what, as a Guaraní pattern, has very specific symbolic and mythological meaning (as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512461103">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512461103">Barrios, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">2009</xref>, demonstrated), has been turned through the design process, literally, into a decorative coffee-table object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512461103">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know (though I do not have information on this) whether the Guaraní themselves think that the patterns still carry any meaning and, if so, what kind of meaning as part of the new objects once they leave the villages. One can perhaps surmise from Mordo’s earlier observation above that, similar to objects specifically produced for the white market (such as ornamental bows and arrows, which have lost the original function of hunting tools) the further semantic destiny of the design patterns once applied to the objects made by <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> is of no further significance and concern to the Mbya Guaraní. In addition, one might here also think of the non-symbolic cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet, 2005</xref>: 6) that are now attached to these design objects. Rather than dealing with the re-evaluation of an object/artefact implied by its move from one sphere, that of ethnographic artefact, to another, that of art object (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512461103">Clifford’s, 1988</xref>: 224, famous art-culture system), here we have an amalgam of at least two unmitigated zones of production of meaning: the design, mould or form provided by the designers, which is overlaid with an indigenous pattern. This pattern, however, which, taken on its own, has complex symbolic meaning (as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">Barrios, 2009</xref> convincingly showed; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512461103">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">2001</xref>), has now been transformed into a decorative embellishment, devoid of any specific meaning it would carry for the Guaraní.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the elements manufactured and overlaid by the Guaraní, and indeed the entire final design product, do not have any meaning, but that this meaning, invariably, is of a more generic type. The objects are now being branded as inspired by ‘ancestral’ culture and expressing a ‘regional’ identity, without any further specification. On the one hand, this obliteration of meaning can be seen as a surrender of sorts in return for paid work by the Mbya Guaraní artisans. On the other hand, it also entails a more active ‘work of forgetting’, or making meaning invisible, which has been observed in other contexts of the European–Guaraní encounter, specifically in relation to religious and musical practices, which was alluded to before (see above and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512461103">Ruiz, 1998</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512461103">Fausto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512461103">Fausto and Heckenberger, 2007</xref>). In any case, even if the Mbya Guaraní collaboration with the designers might stem from what in the context of the selective adaption of musical practices has been called a ‘controlled action of appropriation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512461103">Ruiz, 1998</xref>: 192), the final result is a renewed anonymisation of their creativity. This is similar to what happens with artefacts in those ethnographic museum collections where they are generically attributed to tribal cultures without acknowledging individual authorship (despite the fact that notions of authorship might vary culturally).</p>
<p>However, rather than viewing these design objects solely in terms of creative authorship (by the designers and the Mbya Guaraní artisans), we might also think of them, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet (2005</xref>: 110), in terms of both their <italic>significative</italic> and <italic>pragmatic</italic> dimensions and especially their <italic>affordances</italic> and <italic>constraints</italic> (pp. 110–117; partly extending on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512461103">Norman, 1998</xref>). Knappet further differentiates his scheme by also investigating <italic>iconicity</italic> and <italic>indexicality</italic> (see below).</p>
<p>It is probably futile and will not entirely serve our case to just copy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet’s (2005</xref>: 111) method (which he applies to a simple, industrially manufactured coffee cup and where he advocates, for the sake of the exercise, to pretend the ‘absence of cultural knowledge’), precisely because I am interested in cultural content as an anthropologist. However, some insight might be gained nevertheless through this procedure. For instance, looking at the large plate from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512461103">Figure 1</xref>), it is clear that the rim now only serves a decorative function and is not intended for the placement of food, for which the black centre is destined. The rim also stands in stark contrast to the black centre, which creates an appealing visual effect. In terms of constraints, this is a rather flat dish so it could not be used as a soup bowl, though a salad might be eaten from it. In terms of their iconicity, the plates are similar to other artefacts, both generically to other flat plates and specifically to items from the <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> production, such as the round mirror frames. Of course, one can also think about the indexicality of the plates, and here they have meaning in terms of stylish, nouvelle cuisine-types of foods, which will contrast nicely with the black centre and the decorated rim (which, however, does not reveal its meaning, intelligible only to the Guaraní artisans). In terms of causality, it is clear that the plate, like the other products of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, stands for their particular way of producing these design objects and the specific working relations this entails with the Mbya Guaraní artisans. As regards consumption, these objects are intended for upper-middle class, white consumers. With respect to their temporal–spatial context, they are clearly localized as coming from Misiones, a subtropical province in Argentina, but they are also used by tourism enterprises, such as the Cuña Pirú Lodge (run by Daniela Olivera, on which more further on) and, to a small degree, by hotels at national and international level.</p>
<p>Following Knappet, the same analytic procedure could also be applied to all the other objects from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>; however, in all likelihood, we would end up with a similar configuration. Importantly, when investigating the different temporal–spatial contexts of these objects and shifts of meaning over time, as design objects they could have both utilitarian purposes (for use at a dinner table, for instance) as well as potentially becoming collectors’ items.</p>

<title>Beyond appropriation: The designer’s motivations and marketing rationale</title>
<p>In our conversation, Daniela Olivera vehemently insisted that their work was not an appropriation of indigenous culture, symbolic forms or artwork. Rather, she pointed out, it entailed a process of fusion and resignification. It was not her intention to appropriate the sacred designs, but just to apply them to a new form. Their main motivation as designers was to create new design objects in this particular way that would be recognisable as embodying a specific identity from Misiones. On their website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.misionescreativa.com">www.misionescreativa.com</ext-link>) the two designers describe their motivations in more detail (my translation):<disp-quote>
<p>(Who we are)</p>
<p>We initiated our activity to create avant-garde design objects that would have an identity from Misiones (<italic>identidad misionera</italic>). We started by getting to know the craftspeople of the area, first with the Mbya Guaraní who live about 10 km from the quiet town of Aristóbulo del Valle, where we live and have our studio. This was a marvellous experience, and respecting their customs, timidity, reserve, and their rules we eventually achieved a relationship beyond the purely commercial. It took us about a year to establish an attitude of responsibility for the work we commissioned, trust (a value which is very important to them) and a certain continuity.</p>
<p>Just as in our architectural work, where we use material resources, we did the same in this activity, through utilizing a range of materials of the wild forest area of Misiones, such as different types of woods, fruits, seeds and the <italic>isipó</italic> plant. Together with jobless craftsmen and carpenters we then tried to transform some ideas into design objects which we have marketed on a small scale in different tourist spots and interior design and accessories shops in Misiones.</p>
<p>We also created a line of furniture with regional characteristics.</p>
<p>(Our Concepts)</p>
<list id="list1-1359183512461103" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To increase consciousness of what is ‘our identity’ (<italic>lo nuestro</italic>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To disseminate the culture of Misiones</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To protect and respect nature and the artisans</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To design avant-garde objects, considering the usage, the forms utilizing artisanal techniques with other processes, but maintaining ‘our identity’ (<italic>lo nuestro</italic>).</p></list-item>
</list>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the website, the two designers further refer to their own background from the European ‘melting pot of races’. In this, they represent themselves as typically Argentinian and also specifically related to Misiones’ migration history, which was marked by high European migration at the beginning of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359183512461103">Rock, 1987</xref>: 205–206; more generally on Argentina, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512461103">Schneider, 2000</xref>). However, this European migration, resulting in the case of Misiones (a federal territory till 1953 and a province since) in the agricultural colonisation of countryside with production cycles of maté, tea, Chinese tung tree (<italic>aleurites fordii</italic>), quebracho and other precious woods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512461103">Bartolomé, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512461103">Schiavoni, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359183512461103">2008</xref>), also engendered specific relationships with the indigenous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512461103">Cebolla, 2000</xref>). Indigenous people often worked in dependent relations as salaried workers, day labourers or on odd jobs (<italic>changas)</italic> for the colonos (colonists), and eventually were also subject to discrimination and ethnic prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512461103">Bartolomé, 2009</xref>: 376–377).</p>
<p>Also, it is noteworthy that whilst on the website indigenous people are not described as living directly ‘in or with nature’, they are still seen, often in the same sentence, to be in close proximity to nature. An impression is thus created that the Mbya Guaraní are part of the natural environment rather than pertaining to urban, developed, and indeed national ‘white’ creole society to which the designers obviously belong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1359183512461103">12</xref></sup> Whilst the designers characterise the Mbya Guaraní and their artisanal work as being closer to nature, their own work and the design objects that are the outcome of the composite ‘overlaid’ design process are represented as ‘avant-garde’. In this context something can be garnered perhaps from the analysis of objects that originally only had utilitarian value, but in a later stage of their object histories are appreciated as collectors’ items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512461103">Knappet, 2005</xref>: 117–122). Knappet (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512461103">Bonnot, 2002</xref>) comments on the intriguing case of late-19th- and early-20th-century mass-produced stoneware bottles and pots from the Saône-et-Loire region of France, which in recent decades have become highly prized collectors’ items and are featured in the collections of the Ecomuseum of Creusot-Montceau.</p>
<p>That the designers term their products ‘avant-garde’ is noteworthy in other ways, too. For one, ‘avant-garde’ refers here to a modern international style of design works, having its roots in the functional design of the Bauhaus school of the 1920s. In the strict sense, the <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> objects do not fall into this category, although the base forms (later coated and overlaid by the Mbya Guaraní artisans) are broadly part of the functionalist tradition. However, in the Argentinian context, the objects could be interpreted as avant-garde in the sense that they go beyond the art deco styles or modern functionalist interiors that most hotels in Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil adapt. In more general terms, <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> is not part of a movement, but a diffuse current of designers and visual artists (film-makers, painters, sculptors, photographers, etc.) who since Argentina’s return to democracy in 1983 have experimented with appropriations of indigenous cultures and challenged dominant art forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512461103">Schneider, 2006</xref>). The designers of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> thus make a strong claim to creativity and innovation, measured against their own cultural traditions. With their aim to ‘root’ their products through the contribution by Guaraní artisans in a regional, ‘ancestral’ Guaraní-inspired identity, they go beyond the hegemonic identity paradigms of the Argentinian national state, and Misiones province in particular, which are marked by histories of Spanish colonisation and later European mass migration. Yet, we might ask, at whose expense is this movement of creativity and innovation achieved, or put otherwise: by relegating Guaraní artisans to express <italic>their</italic> creativity within a pre-given frame or module, have the designers short-cut the autonomous development of Guaraní art?</p>
<p>The utilitarian objects Mbya Guaraní coated and sold on their own account (see above) are invariably perceived as craft – with the only exception of scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512461103">Mordo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512461103">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512461103">2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512461103">Barrios (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512461103">2009)</xref> who attribute the status of art objects to them. However, the same or similar patterns, once they are applied (coated or overlaid) onto the objects of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, are then understood and marketed by the designers as <italic>avant-garde design</italic> objects, a different category, which emphasises the creative and final authorship of the designers. The artisanal part coated and overlaid by the Mbya Guaraní thus gets incorporated and absorbed into a dominant and hegemonic design concept over which they have no more influence or control. Even if the design objects by <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, once they enter into the commercial circuit of the creole majority society, do not seem to carry intentional Guaraní agency any longer, we could still ask how far and where precisely design arrangements have changed (or been employed) in the majority society as a result of these objects.</p>
<p>In fact, with its design products, especially furniture and interior design, <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> is targeting an upper-middle and upper segment of the market. In the past, the company also sold objects to the Sofitel hotel in Buenos Aires<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1359183512461103">13</xref></sup> and to the Buzios hotel chain, another indication of the brand’s upper-middle-class pretensions. Although these hotels do not presently feature design from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, one can obtain a good idea of how a touristic site or hotel with the design objects from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> looks like from the example of the Cuña Pirú Lodge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cunapirulodge.com">www.cunapirulodge.com</ext-link>), which one of the partners in <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, Daniela Olivera, runs. I had a chance to visit the Cuña Pirú Lodge since our conversations took place there as well as in the architectural studio in Aristóbulo del Valle. At the Lodge, the great entry hall of the main house contains many objects from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>, and the individual rooms are designed with objects from <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> as well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1359183512461103">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1359183512461103">7</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, contact with indigenous communities of the area is not just mediated through the design objects, but tourists are also offered excursions to the communities, and Cuña Pirú Lodge is described on the website as an environmentally friendly and socially committed project of eco-tourism with ‘low environmental impact’. The context of tourism, environmentalism and relations of tourists to the indigenous communities is beyond the remit of this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1359183512461103">14</xref></sup> However, in terms of the subject matter that concerns me here, Cuña Pirú is another site of white appropriation of both subtropical forest and indigenous craft designs, incorporated through the specific process of overlay into the design objects. Beyond the individual objects, it also functions as a total ensemble of design and architecture representing the ideology of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>.</p>
<p>It is useful to view <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic>’s work in the broader context of craft production and the promotion of artisanal products in Misiones. In general terms, the company seems to be following exactly the business model propagated by <italic>Artesanías Misioneras</italic>, an NGO based in the provincial capital of Posadas and partly sponsored by the provincial government, which seeks to promote the work of artisans from Misiones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1359183512461103">15</xref></sup> The board member and treasurer of <italic>Artesanías Misioneras</italic>, Alicia Freaza, explained to me that, in order to be successful, artisans and designers had to deliver products that, following demand, can be produced and reproduced on a larger scale. Whilst they could differ individually in their design, in their principal forms and measurements they had to be standardized. This requirement also differentiates the artisan and his or her standardised design products from individual artistic work.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The artisan who wants to live well and grow with his or her work has to think of products of a certain quality and conditions, and which are representative of the region, which can be made in a minimum quantity [like the print-run of a book or copies of a CD, etc.]. At least, when the artisan designs a product he or she should be able to say: ‘I have this product.’ Obviously, for artisans’ products we say it’s a unique piece, but it has to have certain standardised characteristics. If I make a little box, all these boxes need to have the same measurements. So that when somebody comes, the artisan can say: ‘I have this product, it has this diameter and these characteristics and this quality. And, I am able to make 5 per month, 10 per month, 100 per month.’ We, the NGO, will not put a limit. So that when somebody comes and wants to buy an institutional or company gift, I can say to them: ‘Yes, this artisan can make this product.’ For instance, one artisan was selected to make picture frames for an important congress of rural buildings that will take place in Puerto Iguazú at the end of September [2010]. So the artisan was commissioned to make 300 pieces. Obviously, they will not all be the same, but the size of the frame, the space one needs to leave for the photograph to be inserted, all of this has to be the same, it cannot vary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is clear from this statement that <italic>Artesanías Misioneras</italic> is interested primarily in standardised reproduction (not to say potential mass production), or at least production in numbers, and not in individual artistic creativity expressed in singular distinctive pieces. <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> has also been confronted with this dilemma of how to produce <italic>en masse</italic> whilst allowing (admittedly restricted) creativity in its objects, produced to replicable specifications but with varying designs. Daniela Olivera commented on plates coated by Mbya Guaraní artisans:<disp-quote>
<p>So these plates – all the same size but with different designs – can look very interesting on a table. But some customers demanded the same designs. This is very difficult to obtain, because the artisans do what they want. I cannot ask them to do the designs all in the same manner. Amongst other things, this depends on the type of <italic>tacuara</italic> reed, on whether, for instance, it is of coarser or finer structure. The material depends on the artisans. What I can ask, for example, is that the fibres of the <italic>güembé</italic> plant be darkened. Sometimes they are very reddish, and I can ask that they should be darker, which the artisans achieve by soaking the <italic>güembé</italic> fibre in water for some time, so that it becomes dark or even black. But on the design, I have no say whatsoever.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the very reason that the designs stay in the community, and the artisans do not deliver finished pieces, Daniela maintains that she can agree a price with the Mbya Guaraní artisans. When, on the other hand, the artisans deliver finished pieces (for example, wooden animal sculptures), <italic>they</italic> will set the price that she has to accept. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512461103">Bartolomé (2009</xref>: 315), income from craft production can be claimed by the individual artisan who carried out and sold the work, in what otherwise is an economy informed by communitarian and collective values. Daniela Olivera explained the process of price setting and recompense for labour rendered by the artisans in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>After the artisans see the final object, they understand that I added work to the object which they brought. If I pay 15, I can maybe sell for 40, because I determine the base structure and underlaying design. This pricing is nothing they interfere with. There are various things we had to learn and the Guaraní explained to us. For instance, if they make an entire object according to my specifications, I have to pay what they say. This was very clear, this was the first concept that was very clear. Secondly, they understood that I did not sell <italic>their</italic> work, but that I am adding more things to it. Thus I can charge for the final price whatever I want. I have nobody looking at me if I charge cheap or expensive because we already have an agreement about what I pay to them. So my relation with them is fine. And the fact that they come to my architect’s studio to look for commissioned work makes us think that they agree with this price. If not, they wouldn’t come any longer. Another thing is, if I don’t achieve a mutual agreement on the price, if I start to argue with the artisan, the artisan makes just one piece and will not return to work for me, and I have lost him. So it is really this mutual agreement. It’s for real that I have to pay what he asks me, because otherwise I cannot ask him for the work. So it is for real that we are working together. Or at least, that is what we, the designers, understand. They, the Guaraní artisans, are also competitive. I could not pay a different price in every village. I could not pay one artisan more than another just because I like his work or craftsmanship better. I couldn’t do it, because they tell each other everything. Everybody knows what I am doing and what we do when we pay them. If it happened [i.e. a disparity in payments] our relationship would end. We haven’t had conflicts in all these years.</p>

<p>Whilst Daniela seems to put forward a logical and fair argument concerning the recompense paid to the artisans and the final sales price, the fact remains that she could not sell anything, that in fact her brand would collapse, were it not for the creative contribution of the Mbya Guaraní artisans. Daniela maintains that, at present, <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> is not making any profit from the sale of the design objects, but just breaking even. I saw her architect’s studio, which also functions as a storehouse, and large numbers of finished but unsold pieces were stacked up there (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1359183512461103">Figure 8</xref>) – a clear indication that the company sits on a considerable amount of stock. However, if and when sales pick up, one could foresee a possible profit for these products. In such a scenario, the question remains of how exactly, beyond mere basic remuneration, the Mbya Guaraní could benefit from it.</p>

<p>On their website, <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> makes a strong claim that their production process is based on ethical and fair work. Whilst I could not assess independently the working conditions of the Mbya Guaraní artisans in the villages, having had only access through and in the presence of Daniela Olivera, I did speak to the <italic>cacique</italic> of one the villages, Aureliano Duarte. He confirmed that the relationship with <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> was an important source of income for his community, and he did not seem to object to the specifics of the design process, where the artisans coat or overlay the objects and retain control over the design patterns. However, I did not raise the pricing policy with him nor did I have the opportunity to ask individual artisans regarding this matter.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have seen in this article how in the composite, overlaid design objects, produced jointly, but in an uneven process by designers and Mbya Guaraní artisans, there are at least two notions of creativity present. The one held by the designers propagates the design objects as ‘avant-garde’, going beyond received notions of European and internationally inspired functionalist design in Argentina. Creativity, however, as expressed by the indigenous artisans through the application of varying design patterns, is developed within a space clearly marked and prescribed by the designers. Arguably, we could see the artisans’ contribution as a kind of modern-day inlay or intarsia work, which leaves more advanced creative work to the individual artisan or artist, but severely frames and restricts his or her <italic>space</italic> of expression. In a more general sense, it can also be said that the agents in this creative encounter put certain limitations on each others’ creativity, which have both constraining and enabling effects: the designers by specifying the spaces of expression for the Guaraní artisans, and the artisans by making this overlay-inducing appropriation possible in the first place (as withholding their consent would end the collaboration instantly).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1359183512461103">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for the original mythological and symbolic significance of these patterns, we have seen that, whilst they are potentially still intelligible to contemporary Mbya Guaraní, once overlaid in the composite design product, they have become generic decoration to the white creole customer – intriguing and appealing only because of their intricate geometries. Appropriation then, in this case, has mutated through an underlying commercial transaction where indigenous design patterns were consensually sold and acquired in an unequal process of co-designing the final object. Overlay rather than appropriation, which in its extended sense of cultural transformation also implies a hermeneutic understanding of the other as I have emphasised earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512461103">Schneider, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512461103">2006</xref>), is the apposite term since there is no aim to understand the Guaraní patterns or to disseminate this knowledge. Yet the designers determine the overall design or form of the final object, and the artisans work within the space allocated to them. In this sense, overlay now also conceals the acquisition of indigenous design, which in the process also changes its function from symbolically meaningful to the Guaraní to purely decorative ornament for the white customers.</p>
<p>However, rather than just viewing this process as contributing to ‘loss of meaning’, it might be more useful to finally interrogate these compound objects with respect to the social and cultural relations they encapsulate. Recent anthropological writings on things, partly inspired by phenomenology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512461103">Empson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512461103">Pedersen, 2007</xref>), understand objects as indices for social and other relations not otherwise visible to ethnographic subjects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512461103">Pedersen (2007</xref>: 141), in his research on paraphernalia used by shamans in northern Mongolia, writes that these objects make ‘relations visible which are otherwise hidden or unknown’ and that knowledge is ‘embedded in artefacts’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512461103">Empson (2007</xref>: 114), too, in an article on the Mongolian household chest, ‘intends to discover relations between visible and hidden things’ and argues further that ‘relations come into existence though the creation of these things [i.e. through the objects constituting the chest]’.</p>
<p>Whilst in those two Mongolian cases we are dealing with things embedded in and part of clearly circumscribed social and cultural relations of specific ethnic groups, different principles seem to operate for the designers and Mbya Guaraní artisans reviewed in this article. The ‘things’ produced consist at once of a usually standardized base form provided by the designers (e.g. a plate mat, box or mirror) and an overlaid pattern executed by the Mbya Guaraní to their own design, but within the specific parameters set by the designer. The decoration (consisting of what for the indigenous artisans can still be mythologically and symbolically meaningful patterns) in its new context does not so much reveal as conceal relations of the Guaraní conceptual universe. Whilst these patterns could still have meaning in the case of craft objects entirely produced by the Guaraní (which also exist, see above), in the design objects these have become decorative elements devoid of specific meaning, no longer intended to be consumed by an indigenous Guaraní audience. It is rather the new ‘composite’ design object which now visualises a specific set of social relations, which are the ones negotiated and maintained between the artisans and designers on unequal terms. Thus for these co-designed objects the social co-participation they entail does not signify equal shares of authorship, creativity and remuneration, but they stand more specifically for, and make more visible, the specific and unequal social relations between designers and artisans.</p>
<p>Hence, in a sense, the reverse process is at work here when compared to the examples provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512461103">Empson (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512461103">Pedersen (2007)</xref>. Rather than making visible or revealing social relations, at least when applied to the indigenous design element, the <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> objects now occlude mythological, symbolic, and indeed relational, reference. Only as composite objects, and unintentionally for those who buy them, but perhaps discernible to the analyst, do they tell us something about the asymmetric relations between society at large (here the designers in particular) and the indigenous Mbya Guaraní.</p>

<ack><p>I am grateful to Øyvind Fuglerud as well as to two anonymous reviewers for comments on an earlier draft. An earlier version of this article was delivered as an invited lecture at the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut, Berlin, on 23 June 2011. I would like to thank the Institute’s director, Barbara Göbel, for having invited me, as well as thanking her and the audience for their comments, especially Joachim Görlich. A later version was presented as a paper at the Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Montréal, on 20 November 2011. Fieldwork was carried out in August and September 2010 in Misiones province (especially the provincial capital, Posadas) and the city of Corrientes, Argentina. I am grateful to the European Science Foundation for support of the fieldwork and research time for writing up as part of the Foundation’s HERA project, Creativity and Innovation in a World of Movement (CIM), directed by Maruška Svašek, School of History and Anthropology, Queens University Belfast. I am also grateful to the Department of Social Anthropology, University of Oslo, for providing financial support for transcriptions of interviews, and to my research assistant, Jonathan Delgado, for meticulously carrying out this task. In Argentina, I thank Daniela Olivera of <italic>Misiones Creativa</italic> for generously showing me round the company’s premises and making time for interviews, as well as <italic>cacique</italic> Aureliano Duarte for his time at the <italic>Direccíon de Asuntos Guaraníes</italic> in Posadas. I am also grateful to Leopoldo José Bartolomé and Ana María Gorosito Kramer at the National University of Misiones for further advice. Special thanks are due to Blanca Barrios, who made her research on Guaraní basketry available to me. I also have fond memories of the late Carlos Mordo who talked to me about Guaraní art in 2000.</p></ack>
