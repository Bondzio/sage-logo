<bold>Purpose:</bold> This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of music therapy in reducing anxiety in hospitalized psychiatric patients.</p>
<p>
<bold>Methodology: </bold>The authors used a randomized clinical trial design and randomly allocated the 24 enrolled participants to the experimental or the control group. Patients in the experimental group received music therapy in a therapy room at a set time for 30 min each morning for 11 days. The authors administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and measured skin temperature and brain waves to determine anxiety level before, during, and after music therapy. <bold>Results:</bold> Experimental group participants had lower scores on the BAI than control participants, after the music therapy (<italic>z</italic> = −2.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and at 1-week follow-up (<italic>z</italic> = −2.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that they were experiencing significantly less anxiety. The mean BAI anxiety score fell in the experimental group from 23.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.9) at baseline to 13.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.8), after music therapy, and 12.7. (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.5) at follow-up. The experimental group demonstrated a significant elevation in the average alpha electroencephalographic (EEG) percentage (from 38.1% to 46.7%) and a reduction in the average beta EEG percentage (from 61.9% to 53.4%) after the music therapy. After adjusting for change in patient finger temperature on the first day, mean change in finger temperature did not differ significantly between the experimental and control groups. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Music therapy can relieve anxiety in hospitalized psychiatric patients and help them achieve a state of relaxation.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411406258">World Health Organization (WHO, 2001)</xref>, mental disorders account for 12% of the global burden of disease, with schizophrenia and major depression the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses. Researchers estimate that mental health problems occurred in 20% of the adult population in the United States, or more than 43 million individuals, in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411406258">Price, Kinnison, Dake, Thompson, &amp; Price, 2007</xref>). Patients with mental disorders often exhibit symptoms of emotional disturbance, most commonly anxiety. Previous studies have shown that alternative therapies, such as music therapy, have been adopted as nonpharmacological methods of managing anxiety in psychiatric patients. Music therapy has been widely applied in diverse patient groups with promising effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411406258">Bulfone, Quattrin, Zanotti, Regattin, &amp; Brusaferro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411406258">El-Hassan, McKeown, &amp; Muller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411406258">Smith, 2008</xref>). Studies in Western countries on the effects of using music therapy for patients with mental disorders have shown a reduction in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411406258">Bulfone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411406258">El-Hassan et al., 2009</xref>). However, researchers have made limited use of physiological indicators of anxiety such as finger temperature and electroencephalography (EEG) in previous studies on the effects of music in patients. In the present study, we used both psychological and physiological indicators to examine the effects of music therapy in psychiatric patients in an Asian culture.</p>
<sec id="section1-1099800411406258">
<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1099800411406258">
<title>Music Therapy</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411406258">Bruscia (1998</xref>, p. 29) defined music therapy as “a systematic process of intervention wherein the therapist helps the client to promote health, using music experiences and the relationships developing through them as dynamic forces of change.” The therapist uses a variety of musical activities targeted to the client’s individual needs and capabilities. Music therapy might achieve a number of psychological goals, including stress relief, emotional balance, and increased ability to concentrate. Music may reduce anxiety by acting as a distracter, changing the focus of the patient’s attention from negative stimuli to something pleasant and encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411406258">Nilsson, 2008</xref>). As a way to respond to differences among patients and treatment goals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411406258">Bruscia (1996)</xref> divided music therapy into the following four types: listening or receptive, re-creating, improvising, and composing. The characteristics of anxiety-reducing music include a simple, repetitive rhythm, predictable dynamics, low pitch and consonance, and no percussion instruments or vocal component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411406258">Stouffer, Shirk, &amp; Polomano, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411406258">Chlan (2000)</xref> further described music suitable for therapy as that which has calming properties, such as slow tempo, euphonic melody, and an absence of heavy beats or percussive timbre. In a systematic review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411406258">Nilsson (2008)</xref> found that successful interventions in clinical practice used slow and flowing nonlyrical music having approximately 60–80 beats/min and played at a maximum volume level of 60 dB.</p>
<p>Physical rhythms can affect a person’s level of stress or relaxation by acting on the sympathetic nervous system, as revealed through such indicators as skin temperature and EEG. The musical rhythm’s ability to cause a physiological reaction is related to the strength of its signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411406258">Lee, Chung, Chan, &amp; Chan, 2005</xref>). The sensation of relaxation, which is the primary goal of music therapy, is an anxiety-reducing physiological and psychological reaction to the body’s rhythmic movements. Finger temperature is associated with the level of emotional stress, especially anxiety. In an anxious patient, the subcutaneous arterioles contract to reduce peripheral blood flow, which leads to low finger skin temperature and coldness of the extremities. The alleviation of anxiety, then, leads to physiological responses such as a rise in finger temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411406258">Nilsson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that the mechanism behind music therapy is the direct induction of physical and mental changes by different types of musical stimulation. From the perspective of neurophysiology and electroencephalography, music can produce alpha waves in the brain, resulting in complete relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411406258">Mok &amp; Wong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411406258">Wang, Kulkami, Dolev, &amp; Kain, 2002</xref>). According to the U. S. Institute of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411406258">Joy, Watson, &amp; Benson, 1999</xref>), alpha waves are brain waves in the frequency range of 8–13 Hz. They make up 15–57% of brain activity, or an average of 33%. Beta waves occupy the frequency range of 12–30 Hz. An appropriate level of alpha waves helps a person to relax and broadens the mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411406258">Batty, Bonnington, Tang, Hawken, &amp; Gruzelier, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Evidence of Physical and Psychological Changes With Music Therapy</title>
<p>Music therapy for hospitalized patients has generally involved 4–16 sessions, conducted individually or in groups, that involve listening to music (passive methods) and/or musical activities (active methods). According to a systematic review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411406258">Nilsson (2008)</xref>, investigators have defined passive music interventions as the playing of prerecorded music on a cassette or compact disc (CD) player. In 12 of the 24 studies reviewed, the music intervention significantly reduced anxiety scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411406258">Evans (2002)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis evaluating 12 randomized clinical trials and concluded that music therapy consisting of prerecorded music played via a tape recorder or CD player effectively reduced preoperative and postoperative anxiety in patients, standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) [−0.9, −0.4]. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411406258">Gold, Solli, Kruger, and Lie (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411406258">Maratos, Gold, Wang, and Crawford (2008)</xref> examined the dose–response relationship in music therapy for patients with serious mental disorders. Gold and colleagues (2009) meta-analysis of two studies revealed a large and significant effect of music therapy on patients’ anxiety (<italic>g</italic> = 1.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411406258">Buffum et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411406258">El-Hassan et al. (2009)</xref> found that music therapy was effective in lowering State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, 0–60 points) scores from 38.6–42.2 to 32.2–35.2 in patients undergoing angiography and endoscopy procedures. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411406258">Bulfone et al. (2009)</xref> found a significant decrease with music therapy in STAI scores in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, from 46.2 to 36.3.</p>
<p>The results of evidence-based studies using patients’ finger temperature to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy are less conclusive. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411406258">Kibler and Rider (1983)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411406258">Hsu and Lai (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411406258">Chen et al. (2009)</xref>, the average finger temperature of psychiatric patients rose from 25.2°C–31.4°C to 32.8°C–33.1°C after music therapy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In other studies using normal populations (nurses working in the intensive care unit [ICU] and college students), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411406258">Wang, Chung, Wang, Ho, and Lai (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411406258">Wang, Yu, Wang, Ho, and Tseng (2007)</xref> reported an increase of 0.2–0.3°C in finger temperature after music therapy, from 30.8–32.9°C to 31.0–33.3°C. The changes in temperature, however, did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = .3). The disagreement across studies may be due to differences in the level of anxiety in subjects, patient populations, or contexts or inconsistency in room temperatures.</p>
<p>The effect of music therapy on EEG waves can be measured with a microprocessor-based biofeedback monitor. Brain waves can be analyzed and represented through the shape, amplitude, frequency, and power or reciprocal of power of the waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411406258">Chan, Han, &amp; Cheung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411406258">Gupta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411406258">Livin, 1998</xref>). One previous report suggested that listening to music for 15–30 min per session increases the alpha EEG percentage by 21 points, from 34.2% to 55.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411406258">Gupta, 2005</xref>). In another study, students’ average wave power increased from a baseline level of 15.2 ± 20.5 µV to 25.9 ± 8.2 µV, <italic>F</italic>(2, 24) = 8.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, after the music therapy intervention, and investigators reported a significant difference between the experimental and control groups, <italic>F</italic>(1, 12) = 4.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411406258">Huang, 2007</xref>). In another study involving students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411406258">Baumgartner, Esslen, and Jancke (2006)</xref> used pictures and classical music to elicit emotional reactions in 24 participants. They found that an increase in alpha EEG waves was associated with joyful emotions more often than with negative emotions, <italic>F</italic>(2, 22) = 8.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411406258">Chan et al. (2008)</xref> found elevated alpha wave activity in the left cerebral hemisphere following music therapy, but the results did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>The effects of music therapy on finger temperature and alpha EEG activity merit further exploration, and results of previous studies require confirmation. In addition, the majority of investigations of music therapy have been conducted in Western countries. Little is known about the effects of music therapy on patients’ anxiety in Eastern cultures. In Taiwan, psychiatric medication is the primary management strategy for anxiety-associated behavior in patients with mental illness, and there have been limited studies testing the effects of music therapy in this population. In the present study, we explored the effects of music therapy on hospitalized psychiatric patients’ anxiety levels using the physiological measures of finger temperature and EEG and a psychological instrument.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section5-1099800411406258">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited study participants from the acute psychiatric ward at a medical center in northern Taiwan, explained the research aims and methods to the patients, and had each patient or their legal guardian sign a consent form upon agreeing to participate. The enrollment criteria were as follows: (a) diagnosis with schizophrenia or major depression by two psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria; (b) a score of 7 or greater on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); (c) hospitalization in the acute psychiatric ward during the research period; and (d) no history of substance abuse or organic brain syndrome. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) cognitive disabilities; (b) hearing impairment; (c) inability to concentrate for at least 30 min; and (d) previous experience of music therapy. The on-site physician performed prescreening for hearing impairment before the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1099800411406258">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>The university’s Institutional Review Board and the consenting hospital approved the study protocol. Patients who met the enrollment criteria received information about the study, including its aims, duration, and the use of data. We also assured them that the study would not interfere with the outcome of their medical treatment. Throughout the research period, patients could discontinue their participation at any time upon request, and such discontinuation would not affect existing treatment and health care. We kept participants’ background information strictly confidential and used it for research purposes only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1099800411406258">
<title>Study Design and Randomization</title>
<p>We used a randomized clinical trial design with block randomization, which yielded a block size of six. We blindly and randomly allocated 24 qualified patients to either an experimental group or a control group. We collected data with repeated measurements. Patients in the experimental group received music therapy, while those in the control group sat quietly during the study intervention with no music playing.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1099800411406258">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>We measured finger temperature and alpha and beta EEG activity before, during, and after music therapy. On the first day of music therapy, we administered the BAI and Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychological Interview (MINI) to both groups to obtain pretest data. We administered the BAI again on the final (11th) day of music therapy and 1 week after treatment to collect follow-up data. In addition, we measured skin temperature and brain waves daily during the music therapy intervention on Days 1–11.</p>
<sec id="section9-1099800411406258">
<title>BAI</title>
<p>Beck developed the BAI in 1988 based on the DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria. The instrument consists of 21 questions, each of which assesses anxiety severity on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. A total score between 0 and 7 represents <italic>the normal range</italic>, a score between 8 and 15 indicates <italic>mild anxiety</italic>, between 16 and 25 indicates <italic>moderate anxiety</italic>, and between 26 and 63 indicates <italic>severe anxiety</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411406258">Fydrich, Dowdall, and Chambless (1992)</xref> reported a Cronbach’s α of 0.9 for BAI in patients with anxiety disorder. Previous studies have revealed a high degree of consistency between the BAI and patients’ self-reported anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411406258">Fydrich et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411406258">Osman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411406258">Steer, Kumar, Pinninti, &amp; Beck, 2003</xref>). We used a Chinese version of the BAI in this study to measure the participants’ anxiety levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411406258">Che, Lu, Chen, Chang, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1099800411406258">
<title>Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychological Interview (MINI)</title>
<p>MINI is a structured interview scale based on the DSM-IV. This scale can be used to diagnose 17 diseases including manic episode, hypomanic episode, and major depression. It is regarded as simple, easy to use, and precise. Investigators assessed the validity of MINI by comparing its diagnostic concordance with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnoses (SCID) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Generally, the sensitivity of this scale is at least 0.7 and the specificity is more than 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411406258">Adewuya, 2006</xref>). The Chinese version of MINI has a sensitivity of 0.7, specificity of 0.9, and overall accuracy rate of 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411406258">Lin, Chen, Liu, &amp; Chen, 2002</xref>). The present study’s research assistant received training in administering MINI from the Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1099800411406258">
<title>EEG</title>
<p>We used an I-330-C2 + EEG monitor (J&amp;J Engineering, Inc.) to capture brain waves during each music therapy session. We set the EEG recording range at 1–64 Hz; attached electrodes to both earlobes and the left, middle top, and right aspects of the head; and conducted the recording in two channels, with EEG-B set as the beta wave frequency (13–30 Hz) and EEG-A as the alpha wave frequency (7.5–13 Hz). We processed the raw data with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1099800411406258">
<title>Finger temperature</title>
<p>We measured finger temperature using DINAMAP Dash 3000 Patient Monitors (DINAMAP DASH 3000, GE Company, Taipei, Taiwan) within a range of 15.0°C–38.0°C (60°F–100°F). We attached a noninvasive temperature sensor to the participant’s left third fingertip (middle finger) without touching the fingernail or any metallic surface and recorded data 30–40 s after the setup. There were no left-handed persons among the patients. A trained research assistant measured both finger temperature and EEG. We regularly calibrated the instruments used in this study.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The isolated, soundproofed music therapy room contained an adjustable reclining chair, a stereo CD player, and two speakers on either side of the chair. We set the interior light as 110 to 140 meter candles and room temperature at 23°C. We chose the music according to the participant’s individual preferences from a selection of soft music having low pitch, slow tempo, midrange tunes, smooth and consistent rhythm, soft volume, and consonance, with no percussion instruments, vocal component, heavy beats, or sudden changes. Each participant used the same music throughout the study. We played the music for 20 min per session at a volume of 45–50 dB. We chose this volume to be slightly louder than the Environmental Protection Agency and the International Noise Council’s recommendation of a 45-dB limit for daytime noise in clinical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411406258">Stouffer et al., 2007</xref>). We considered and controlled for other noise in the environment.</p>
<p>Each participant in the experimental group received one music therapy session at the same time every morning for 11 consecutive days. In the music therapy room, the participant received a blanket, rested for 5 min in a half-reclining position, and listened to the music with eyes closed. We played the music for 20 min and followed it with another 5-min rest. Two external senior music therapy experts who were independent of the therapy component of the project monitored the music therapy intervention. They rated compliance with the fundamental principles of music therapy and adherence to one or more modules and interventions specified in the treatment protocol.</p>
<p>The research assistant brought each participant in the control group to the same room at the same time each day. Control participants received a blanket and sat on the adjustable reclining chair with eyes closed for 30 min.</p>
<p>Throughout the treatment period, we collected data from both groups using the same methods. We continuously monitored finger temperature and EEG activity in the therapy room. In both groups, data collection time points were at −5 (5 min prior to session start), 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min (after 5-min rest period at the end of the session).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1099800411406258">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed data using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows. We used the chi-square test or the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to compare age, disease duration, and comorbidity to determine differences between the two groups and confirm control variables. We calculated means and standard deviations to elucidate same-day variation of finger temperature and conducted trend analysis on finger temperature data recorded at the first time point each day. We based trend analysis for EEG data on daily average and the first time-point data of each day. We used the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to determine the differences between the two groups and the generalized estimating equation (GEE) to control extraneous variables and perform statistical tests on anxiety levels of the two groups, which served as the index for repeated measurements. The difference between groups demonstrated the trend and maintenance of treatment progress. We used the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle to analyze the data from the 24 participants and handled missing data with the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method.</p>

<p>We also observed a decrease in mean relative beta EEG percentage from 61.9% to 53.4% from preintervention to postintervention sessions for all sessions combined, with decreases of −5.1%, −8.8%, −5.1%, −7.3%, and −8.6% at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099800411406258">Figure 4</xref>
). Comparison of the beta EEG percentage collected during therapy with pretest data showed an average difference of −5.8% (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.9) in the experimental group and −1.4% (<italic>SD</italic> = 19.7) in the control group after the 11 intervention sessions. After adjusting for change in patient beta EEG on the first day, we found that the mean change in beta EEG differed significantly between the experimental and control groups for 5 of the 11 study sessions. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test showed a statistically significant difference in beta EEG percentage before and after intervention between the two groups (<italic>U</italic> = 3.34, <italic>p</italic> = .0004). The correlation coefficients between BAI posttest score, finger temperature, alpha EEG, and beta EEG were 0.6, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings show that reductions in anxiety appear to be reflected more strongly in psychological parameters and alpha EEG than in finger temperature in patients with mild-to-moderate anxiety. Before intervention, the experimental group showed moderate anxiety as measured by the BAI. At posttest, after music therapy, the average score in the experimental group dropped by 10 points, from 23.9 to 13.9, indicating mild anxiety. This finding is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411406258">Gold et al. (2009)</xref> wherein they examined the dose–response relationship for music therapy in patients with serious mental disorders. Our GEE findings, in which we controlled for extraneous variables such as group differences and time points, demonstrated that music therapy was effective in reducing anxiety in hospitalized psychiatric patients, and its effect was still measurable 1 week after the intervention.</p>
<p>There are at least two possible explanations for music therapy’s relaxing effects on these patients: (a) Music therapy uses sound with a pleasant rhythm and melody to help the client enter a state of tranquility, with the ultimate goal of promoting and maintaining physical and mental health. Music is a euphonic auditory composition of pitch, speed, rhythm, and volume. Because of its psychological effects on mood, familiar music can promote mental relaxation in patients. (b) When patients are under stress, the auditory stimulation of music may distract them from unpleasant feelings. They focus on the more pleasant stimulus of music instead of their anxiety-provoking thoughts.</p>
<p>Other methods of illustrating the physiological and psychological mechanisms through which music therapy relieves anxiety include the observation of physiological signs such as finger temperature and alpha EEG percentage. From the start to the finish of individual music therapy sessions, the experimental group experienced an increase in finger temperature of 0.3°C–0.7°C. The mean skin temperature increase of 0.5 might not be clinically significant as an indicator of patients’ anxiety. Between-group comparison showed no statistically significant difference. Normal temperature at the fingertips is 34°C–36°C. A temperature of 30°C–33°C indicates mild stress. Participants in the present study exhibited a mean finger temperature range of 31.6°C–33.2°C. It may be that because of the participants’ moderate anxiety level (as measured by the BAI); the sympathetic nervous system activities that usually accompany emotional distress were not particularly stimulated. Thus, a low finger temperature resulting from peripheral vessel contraction was not prominent. Our findings suggest no clear relationship between the finger temperature and anxiety in patients with moderate-to-mild anxiety.</p>
<p>After the combined intervention sessions, the experimental group in the present study had an increase of mean relative alpha EEG percentage from 38.1% to 46.7% and a decrease of mean relative beta percentage from 61.9% to 53.4%. This finding suggests that music therapy can increase relative alpha EEG percentage and decrease relative beta percentage and power by helping the individual attain a state of relaxation. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411406258">Livin (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411406258">Gupta (2005)</xref> in which the alpha EEG percentage increased by 21 percentage points, on average, from 34.2% to 55.1%. When we analyzed our result for power, we showed an average power increase of 10.7 µV, from a baseline of 15.2 ± 20.5 µV to 25.9 ± 8.2 V (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Our findings support the effectiveness of music therapy in facilitating relaxation. We followed Nilsson’s (2008) guidelines in selecting music for the present study, as described above. This kind of music can mitigate sympathetic nervous system reaction, resulting in decreased muscle tone and lowered sympathetic activity. Listening to music can, not only convert a person’s mood from nervous to calm, also arouse alpha waves in the brain, which are associated with relaxation.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the current study. For example, this study included subjects who were deliberately sampled to represent homogeneity with respect to a medical center, nondouble-blinded arrangement, and short duration of treatment and follow-up. Results should not be generalized to a broader population. For future studies, investigators could draw a larger and more representative sample from psychiatric patients in the community, day care centers, and chronic mental health care institutions in order to increase our understanding of the effects of group music therapy in those settings.</p>
<p>Ours is the first randomized study to investigate the effects of music therapy on anxiety, finger temperature, and EEG in hospitalized psychiatric patients in Taiwan. Our results indicate that music may significantly reduce anxiety, as it increased relative alpha EEG percentage and decreased relative beta EEG percentage in patients with depression and schizophrenia. This study supports the findings of previous research that listening to music can stimulate alpha EEG activity, increase its relative percentage, and consequently help the patient relax. Future studies on music therapy should consider mechanisms such as the alpha wave hypothesis and finger temperature in order to advance the understanding of music’s psychological and physiological effects.</p>
