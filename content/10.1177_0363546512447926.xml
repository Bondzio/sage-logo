<title>Background:</title>
<p>Whether an Achilles tendon rupture is treated surgically or not, complications such as muscle weakness, decrease in heel-rise height, and gait abnormalities persist after injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512447926">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if side-to-side differences in maximal heel-rise height can be explained by differences in Achilles tendon length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512447926">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512447926">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Eight patients (mean [SD] age of 46 [13] years) with acute Achilles tendon rupture and 10 healthy subjects (mean [SD] age of 28 [8] years) were included in the study. Heel-rise height, Achilles tendon length, and patient-reported outcome were measured 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Achilles tendon length was evaluated using motion analysis and ultrasound imaging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512447926">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The Achilles tendon length test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97) was excellent. For the healthy subjects, there were no side-to-side differences in tendon length and heel-rise height. Patients with Achilles tendon ruptures had significant differences between the injured and uninjured side for both tendon length (mean [SD] difference, 2.6-3.1 [1.2-1.4] cm, <italic>P</italic> = .017-.028) and heel-rise height (mean [SD] difference, –4.1 to –6.1 [1.7-1.8] cm, <italic>P</italic> = .012-.028). There were significant negative correlations (<italic>r</italic> = −0.943, <italic>P</italic> = .002, and <italic>r</italic> = −0.738, <italic>P</italic> = .037) between the side-to-side difference in heel-rise height and Achilles tendon length at the 6- and 12-month evaluations, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512447926">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The side-to-side difference found in maximal heel-rise height can be explained by a difference in Achilles tendon length in patients recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture. Minimizing tendon elongation appears to be an important treatment goal when aiming for full return of function.</p>

<p>A patient who sustains an Achilles tendon rupture should expect a year-long recovery with extensive rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512447926">26</xref></sup> Despite improvements in surgical and nonsurgical treatments and rehabilitation protocols, strength deficits of 10% to 30% are common and appear to become permanent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447926">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447926">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512447926">26</xref></sup> Another major complication is separation of tendon ends during healing, which is assumed to cause the disproportionate weakness in end-range of ankle plantar flexion seen in this patient group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447926">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> Gait abnormalities have also been found 2 years after injury and are believed to be associated with both strength deficits and tendon elongation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512447926">4</xref></sup> The difficulty with achieving full return of function combined with patients’ fear of reinjury are thought to be why most of these patients do not return to their previous physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512447926">13</xref></sup> To further improve treatment, both with regard to the short-term and long-term outcomes, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms for the deficits seen.</p>
<p>Basic science research has shown that mechanical stimulation improves tendon repair, which supports the idea that early mobilization and exercise following Achilles tendon rupture may be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447926">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512447926">9</xref></sup> However, it has been suggested that there is a delicate balance between the need to immobilize during the early healing phase and early loading to avoid complications such as tendon reruptures and elongations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref>,15</sup> Studies have demonstrated that in patients treated surgically, there is separation of tendon ends, with change occurring up to 4 months after Achilles repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447926">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> The degree of tendon separation has also been shown to correlate with clinical outcome but not with isokinetic strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref></sup> The degree of separation was monitored from radiographs by measuring the distance between metallic beads inserted in the tendon ends during surgery. Although accurate measures are possible using this approach, it is not practical for large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, developing and evaluating new simpler methods, to be used in larger clinical trials, is of interest.</p>
<p>A heel-rise test for evaluating calf muscle endurance is an often-used measure for evaluating function after an Achilles tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512447926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512447926">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447926">25</xref></sup> This test is simple, can be performed easily in the clinical setting, and has been shown to be responsive to improvements over time as well as to discriminate between various treatment protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512447926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref></sup> When combined with a portable device that measures heel-rise height and the number of repetitions, the total amount of work performed can be calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447926">25</xref></sup> In a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref></sup> using this device, we found that after 1 year, patients had significant side-to-side differences in all the heel-rise parameters. Furthermore, there were significant differences in heel-rise work and height between surgically and nonsurgically treated patients at 6 months after injury. It has been speculated that the deficit in maximal heel-rise height is due to tendon elongation while the work/repetition measures are more influenced by muscular strength and endurance.</p>
<p>Understanding when deficits occur and potential reasons is of importance since this affects what treatment is appropriate and when it should be applied to have a beneficial effect. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate if differences in heel-rise height are associated with differences in Achilles tendon length after an Achilles tendon rupture. It was hypothesized that patients with an Achilles tendon rupture would have a significantly longer Achilles tendon and diminished heel-rise height on the injured side compared with the uninjured limb.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512447926">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Ten healthy subjects (7 men, 3 women) with a mean (SD) age of 28 (8) years and 8 patients (5 men, 3 women) with a mean (SD) age of 46 (13) years and acute complete Achilles tendon rupture treated surgically were included in the study. The healthy subjects’ mean (SD) height was 177 (13) cm and weight 73 (16) kg, and the patients’ mean (SD) height was 176 (7.7) cm and weight 83 (13) kg. The inclusion criteria for the healthy subjects were being between 20 and 80 years of age and having no history of complete or partial Achilles tendon rupture or being limited by any other lower extremity injury. The inclusion criteria for patients with Achilles tendon rupture were having a unilateral complete rupture and being between 20 and 80 years of age. Exclusion criteria were having a rerupture, Achilles tendon injury to the contralateral side, or any other condition that would limit participation in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The patients with Achilles tendon rupture were recruited through the outpatient Physical Therapy clinic at the University of Delaware and by one of the authors. Heel-rise height and Achilles tendon length were measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Four patients were recruited within the first 3 months after injury, 2 patients between 3 and 6 months, and another 2 patients after 6 months. Consequently, 4 patients were evaluated at 3 months, 6 patients at the 6-month evaluation, and all 8 patients at 12 months postoperatively. The active ankle range of motion was measured with a goniometer with the patient in the supine position and the knee straight. The patient was asked to move the ankle into the end range of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, respectively.</p>
<p>All subjects gave informed consent before participation, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Delaware.</p>

<title>Measurement of Tendon Length</title>
<p>A noninvasive method combining video-based motion capture and ultrasound (US) imaging was used to compute Achilles tendon length. Achilles tendon length was defined as the distance between the calcaneal osteotendinous junction and the musculotendinous junction, as previously described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512447926">20</xref></sup> Two retroreflective markers were placed on the back of the US probe directly over the right and left edges of the sonogram scan area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512447926">Figure 1</xref>). The markers were used to track the position of the probe in a fixed laboratory reference frame. The marker data were sampled at 50 Hz using an 8-camera Qualisys motion capture system.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0363546512447926" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption>
<p>The 3-dimensional location of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) in a fixed laboratory reference was computed from 2 retroreflective markers placed on the back of the ultrasound probe. The markers were placed directly over the right and left edges of the sonogram scan area. The perpendicular distance (d) from a line connecting the markers was determined knowing the fixed distance (f) from the line to the bottom of the probe, and the ultrasound measured distance (u) from the recording surface of the probe to the myotendinous junction (MTJ). A similar process was used to identify the location of the osteotendinous junction in the fixed laboratory reference, and from these locations, the length of the Achilles tendon was computed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Ultrasound images were acquired using an Aloka SSD-5000 system in B-mode, 10 mHz, with a 60-mm linear transducer. The osteotendinous junction and musculotendinous junction were identified in separate images since Achilles tendon length is greater than the transducer field of view. The position of the osteotendinous junction relative to the top left edge of the US image was measured using the Aloka console measurement tools. Since the location of the probe was known in the fixed laboratory reference, the location of the osteotendinous junction was therefore also known relative to the laboratory reference. Similar measurements and spatial correspondence for the musculotendinous junction were obtained. Achilles tendon length was computed from the location of the osteotendinous junction and musculotendinous junction in the laboratory reference. Based on the 4 images, 4 measurements (each osteotendinous junction measurement was combined with each of the musculotendinous junction measurements) of the Achilles tendon length were derived, for each side, and the average was used for analysis. Both sides were measured. The patient was prone lying with the foot resting (in a relaxed position) beyond the edge of the table. The reason for using the relaxed position was to get an easily standardized position where the load on the tendon could be considered equal on the injured and uninjured side. Here, the load on the tendon can be considered to be the weight of the foot.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the method was evaluated under controlled conditions by measuring the distance between the musculotendinous junction and osteotendinous junction of a lamb shank. The lamb shank was dissected, permitting direct visualization of the tendon. The actual tendon length was determined using a digitizing wand. The wand was fitted with tracking markers, and thus, the location of the endpoint (ie, tip) was known relative to the laboratory reference. The tip of the wand was placed over the musculotendinous junction, and motion data were captured. Similarly, the osteotendinous junction was digitized and from these data points the Achilles tendon length was computed. Two Achilles tendon lengths were measured in this manner. Achilles tendon length was also computed using the hybrid motion capture and US method previously described. Two measurements were obtained. Achilles tendon length as measured using the digitizing wand was 109 mm, while the average length for the hybrid method was 108.3 mm (ie, &lt;1% error).</p>

<title>Reliability of Achilles Tendon Length Measurement</title>
<p>The test-retest reliability of the Achilles tendon measurement was evaluated on 8 healthy Achilles tendons. The tendons were evaluated on 2 different days within 1 week by the same evaluator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512447926">
<title>Heel-Rise Test</title>
<p>The heel-rise test was performed exactly as previously described in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512447926">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447926">25</xref></sup> The patients were standing on 1 foot on a 10° incline board and were instructed to perform as many heel rises as possible. The patients were allowed to have 2 fingertips per hand against the wall for balance, and they performed this activity at a rate of 30 heel rises per minute as guided by a metronome. They were instructed to go as high as possible on each heel rise and then lower the heel to the starting position. The test was terminated when the patients stopped, could not maintain the frequency, or did not perform a proper heel rise. The patients were classified as having performed a 1-legged heel rise if they were able to lift the heel at least 2 cm while keeping the knee straight. The MuscleLab (Ergotest Technology, Oslo, Norway) measurement system was used for the evaluations (which is the same as used in previous studies evaluating this heel-rise test). A linear encoder was used to measure the height and number of repetitions. A spring-loaded string is connected to a sensor inside the liner encoder unit. When the string is pulled, the sensor outputs a series of digital pulses that is proportional to the distance traveled. The resolution is approximately 1 pulse every 0.07 mm. The spring-loaded string of the linear encoder was attached to the heel of the patients’ shoe. The number of heel rises, as well as the maximal height of the heel rise, was used for data analysis.</p>

<title>Patient-Reported Outcome and Physical Activity Level</title>
<p>The Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512447926">17</xref></sup> and the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512447926">22</xref></sup> were used to evaluate patient-reported symptoms and functional ability. The FAOS consists of 5 subscales; for this study, the subscale Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) was used because this subscale is appropriate to determine the injury’s effect on function in relation to physical activity and can be seen as a complement to the ATRS.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Previous heel-rise height data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447926">25</xref></sup> was used to estimate the number of subjects needed for this study. The analysis indicated that 8 patients with Achilles tendon rupture were needed to identify side-to-side differences with 90% power (based on the use of nonparametric statistics). For comparing healthy subjects and patients with an Achilles tendon rupture for side-to-side difference in heel-rise height with a 90% power, 8 subjects per group were required (based on nonparametric statistics). All data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18 for Windows. Descriptive data are reported as mean (SD). Nonparametric statistics were used because of the small sample size. Test-retest reliability was analyzed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC<sub>2,1</sub>) and Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data. Standard error of measurements (SEM) was calculated as follows: <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0363546512447926">

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate if the side-to-side difference found in maximal heel-rise height can be attributed to tendon elongation in patients with a surgically repaired Achilles tendon rupture. As hypothesized, significant side-to-side differences in heel-rise height and tendon length were found in patients with a surgically repaired Achilles tendon at 6 and 12 months, but not for the healthy group. There was also a significant correlation between patient-reported symptoms and amount of lengthening on the injured side at 6 months. The results from the heel-rise test and patient-reported symptoms (ATRS) in this study are comparable with previously reported values for a large randomized clinical trial, suggesting the current sample is representative of patients with Achilles tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref></sup> This implies the prolonged deficits in heel-rise height after a surgically repaired Achilles tendon is associated with the tendon healing in an elongated position and not strictly due to weakness.</p>
<p>The heel-rise test has been shown to be reliable, valid for evaluating muscular endurance, and quick and easy to perform and therefore useful both in research and in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512447926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512447926">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512447926">25</xref></sup> Since the results from this study indicate a significant correlation between the degree of tendon elongation and deficits in maximal heel-rise height, it suggests that heel-rise height could be a useful measure in large clinical trials to differentiate whether functional deficits are due to tendon elongation or muscular weakness. The difference in maximal heel-rise height in this study was comparable with recently reported data for 97 patients in a randomized clinical trial comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447926">16</xref></sup> However, the patients need to have recovered enough strength to be able to perform a single-leg heel rise before maximal heel-rise height can be used as a parameter to measure tendon elongation. In the clinical setting, the heel-rise height can easily be measured with a tape measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512447926">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>In this study, the use of US imaging combined with video-based motion capture was used to evaluate tendon length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512447926">11</xref></sup> Other studies have used more invasive techniques such as roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging could also possibly be another method to evaluate tendon length. The method used in this study was shown to be reliable and takes approximately 10 minutes to perform with another 10 minutes for data analysis. For clinical use, we recommend just using the heel-rise test, but for further research, all of the above methods can be used, and the choice seems to be dependent on the equipment and funds available to the researcher.</p>
<p>Clinical outcome has previously been reported to correlate with the degree of tendon separation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref></sup> Even in this small sample, we found a significant correlation between the degree of tendon elongation and patient-reported symptoms. For this study, the FAOS sports subscale, which specifically asks questions regarding the ability to run and jump, was significantly correlated to the degree of tendon elongation at 6 months. There was no significant correlation found at the 12-month evaluation, which could be due to the small sample size or that the subjects have adjusted to the change in tendon elongation. A longer tendon would have a negative effect on the power generation around the ankle, which would negatively affect the patients’ ability to run and jump. Both the patients in this study and other patients encountered in the clinical setting report that even if they return to the same level of physical activity, they seem to have lost some of their previous ability to jump and sprint. This has also been found in professional football players, in whom a 50% reduction in performance level was found after an Achilles tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512447926">19</xref></sup> Whether tendon elongation is the main reason for the long-term deficits reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447926">18</xref></sup> after a complete Achilles tendon rupture needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>Previous studies on separation of tendon ends in patients with Achilles tendon rupture report the separation distance to be approximately 0.5 to 1.0 cm, with a progressive increase until 4 months after injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447926">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> In our study, the differences in tendon lengths are considerably larger, ranging from 1 to 5 cm, with a mean difference of 3 cm. Schepull et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> who used RSA to evaluate tendon separation, also found that beads embedded in the tendon away from the rupture site separated a greater amount than beads near the tendon ends. This might suggest the whole tendon is affected by both the injury and the subsequent treatment and that changes do not occur only at the site of the rupture. A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512447926">10</xref></sup> also found marked pathological changes at sites both distal and proximal to the rupture site in patients with Achilles tendon rupture. These data indicate that for improving the outcome after Achilles tendon rupture, the focus of treatment should be full recovery and healing of the whole Achilles tendon and not just on repairing the actual rupture site.</p>
<p>The studies on tendon separation indicate that this occurs during the first 4 months after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447926">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447926">23</xref></sup> Also in this study, where the whole tendon was measured, the main change in tendon length seems to have occurred during the first 3 months. This indicates that to minimize tendon elongation, the window of opportunity seems to be during the first 3 months after injury. How the tendon ends are tightened and sutured does not appear to be as of great importance as one might think since the separation of tendon ends has been reported to be similar regardless of whether the tendon ends are sutured or not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512447926">24</xref></sup> Rather, other aspects such as early mobilization have been shown to decrease the amount of tendon separation that occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447926">7</xref></sup> Animal research on tendons indicates that mechanical stimulation improves tendon repair, but this needs to occur during the early stages of healing to prevent permanent damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447926">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512447926">5</xref></sup> The current treatment protocols, which are aimed at protecting the rupture site through limiting early loading of the tendon, might instead have detrimental effects on the rest of the tendon. Including a measure of the tendon length as an outcome, especially during the first initial 3 months, might be of interest in future studies evaluating the effect of early loading on tendon healing after a complete rupture.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is that the patients included have been treated by various physicians and might have had differences in their postoperative rehabilitation. Therefore, no inference can be made with regard to how these results relate to the treatments. The purpose for this study, however, was not to evaluate treatment but rather to try to further understand the reason for the deficit in heel-rise height we have seen in previous studies. We have also not evaluated all our patients at the early 3-month evaluation, and therefore care should be taken when interpreting how the Achilles tendon length changes over time. Another limitation is that 2 of the patients were not evaluated at the 6-month evaluation but rather at the 12-month evaluation, which could be the reason for the differences in the results between the 6- and 12-month evaluations. Furthermore, a limitation of our results is the relatively small sample size available for the ICC calculation. A larger sample size of patients would provide for a more stable ICC analysis for reliability, and we are planning to perform this in the future in larger studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study confirmed our hypothesis that the degree of tendon elongation correlates with the side-to-side deficit in heel-rise height in patients with a complete Achilles tendon rupture that has been surgically repaired. Using a heel-rise test that evaluates both height and repetition seems to provide valuable information regarding the deficits seen in patients with Achilles tendon rupture and can be used as an outcome measure for large clinical trials evaluating treatment. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine how the heel-rise height and tendon length change over time and how the whole tendon length and mechanical properties change during the first 3 months. Based on the results from this study and the results from previous larger clinical trials, the occurrence of tendon elongation seems to be a limiting factor in achieving full return of function. Therefore, when aiming for full return of function and strength, an important treatment goal appears to be to minimize tendon elongation.</p>
