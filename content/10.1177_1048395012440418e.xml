<title>Why attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) kids do not graduate</title>
<p>A lack of focus, not hyperactivity, is the main reason students with ADHD do not finish high school. Researchers looked at data collected from the parents and teachers of 2,000 children during a period of almost 20 years. Attention problems were evaluated by teachers who looked for behavior such as an inability to concentrate, absentmindedness, or a tendency to give up or be easily distracted. Hyperactivity was identified by behavior such as restlessness, running around, squirming, and being fidgety, the researchers said. Researchers found that 29% of children with attention problems finished high school compared with 89% of children who did not manifest inattention problems. In all, 40% of the students with hyperactivity completed high school compared with the 77% students who did not demonstrate this behavior.—From <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/08/30/Inattention-Why-ADHD-kids-dont-graduate">http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/08/30/Inattention-Why-ADHD-kids-dont-graduate</ext-link></p>

<title>Anesthesia risks for very young children</title>
<p>There are new concerns about an increased risk for learning problems in very young children exposed to general anesthesia during surgical procedures. Researchers found a twofold increase in learning disabilities in children who had more than one exposure to general anesthesia with surgery before age 2. The new study adds to the evidence linking repeated exposure to general anesthesia very early in life to an increased risk for learning disabilities, but it does not prove the link. About 37% of children who had had multiple surgeries requiring general anesthesia before age 2 had learning disabilities, compared with 24% of children who had just one surgery and 21% of children who had no surgeries. Children who had two or more surgeries prior to age 2 were 3 to 4 times as likely to have been identified by their schools as needing special help for language and speech difficulties.—Flick, R.

<title>Smurks emotion app</title>
<p>Smurks is an iPhone/iPad app that lets a little face show emotions. The yellow–orange face was created by a cartoonist whose goal was to design a simple symbol of texting emotions for the general public. It has become a therapy tool for children and adults with ASD and other emotional challenges. Smurks enabled users to move a face to express their feelings via text, email, Facebook, and Twitter. It is easy to move using your fingers. By running your finger up down, across, pinch and stretch, you can change the expression to match the mood you want to convey. The app is useful for families to communicate with their children. To find out more about Smurks, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smurks.net">www.smurks.net</ext-link></p>

<title>Peer influence on language skills</title>
<p>Preschool students with poor language skills show much greater improvement if they are placed in a classroom with higher achieving children, compared with being in a class with other low achievers. The findings are important because many preschool programs in the United States are targeted to poor children, whose development of language skills may be lagging. In the United States, children who have relatively low language skills tend to be clustered in the same classrooms, and that is not good for their language development. Researchers looked at 338 children in 49 preschool classrooms and found that, among children with low initial language skills, those who were placed in the lowest ability classes tended to lose ground during the school year, whereas those placed in average-ability classes tended to improve their language skills. The researchers also found that high-ability students improved their language scores when placed in either low- or average-ability classes.—Justice, L. M., Petscher, Y., Schatschneider, C., &amp; Mashburn, A. (2011).

<title>Study: Brain size signals certain type of autism</title>
<p>In what researchers called the largest study of brain development in preschoolers with autism to date, 3-year-old boys with regressive autism, but not early onset autism, had larger brains than their healthy counterparts. The authors examined 180 children between ages 2 and 4. Of the participants, 114 had ASD; the remaining participants were 66 age-matched, typically developing control children. Of the children with autism, 54% were diagnosed with the regressive form—characterized by the loss of previously acquired language and social skills—and 46% with the nonregressive type. Using magnetic resonance imaging scans, the researchers found that accelerated head growth and brain enlargement was consistently observed only in the subset of children diagnosed with regressive autism. Specifically, total brain volume in 3-year-old males with regressive autism was more than 6% larger than that of age-matched typically developing peers. Of boys with regressive autism, 22% had enlarged brains, as opposed to 5% of those without regressive autism. Changes in brain size were not apparent in boys who did not experience a regression. Girls with autism, regardless of autism onset status, also did not show abnormal brain growth. The findings suggest that abnormalities in overall brain growth are specific to male children with the regressive type of autism and that rapid brain growth may be a risk factor for regression, the researchers said. While brain size was clearly larger at age 3, the study also determined when the precocious growth began, by examining records of head circumference that provide a reasonable estimate of brain size in young children. These analyses clearly indicated that brain growth diverged from normal at around 4 to 6 months of age. The researchers said that this finding is of particular interest because many families believe that the trigger that led to their child’s regression took place close to the time that the regression happened. But the data reported in this article indicate that the process leading to the enlarged brain, which is presumably also associated with the onset of autism, started when the child was a newborn.—Nordahl, C. W., Lange, N., Li, D. D., Barnett, L. A., Lee, A., Buonocore, M. H., . . . Amaral, D. G. (2011). Brain enlargement is associated with regression in preschool-age boys with autism spectrum disorders.

<title>Social life of teens with autism</title>
<p>Teens with autism are far less likely than other teens to have a social life outside of school, a new study reports. U.S. researchers analyzed national data on more than 11,000 teens enrolled in special education and found that among those with autism, 43% never see friends outside of school, 54% never get called by friends, and about half are never invited to social activities. For teens with autism, it appears that experiences with peers are more likely to occur one-on-one, and perhaps at home rather than in the community. Having limited or no social relationships with peers can have a harmful effect on mental and physical health, particularly during the teen years. One way to establish social relationships with peers is by participating in group activities such as sports, clubs, or scouting, but only one third of teens with autism are involved in such activities. Poor communication and conversational skills were associated with lower levels of social activity and were associated with an elevated risk for friends never calling, never being invited to activities, and having no involvement in extracurricular activities.—Shattuck, P. E., Orsmond, G. I., Wagner, M., &amp; Cooper, B. (2011). Participation in social activities among adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. <italic>PLoS One,</italic> November 14 online.

<title>Bipolar kids may focus on different facial features</title>
<p>Children with bipolar disorder and a similar condition called severe mood dysregulation spend less time looking at the eyes when trying to identify facial features compared with children without the psychiatric disorders. The researchers tracked the eye movements of children with and without psychiatric disorders as they viewed faces with different emotional expressions, such as happy, sad, fearful, and angry. In general, the children spent more time looking at the eyes, the facial feature that conveys the most information about emotion. However, children with bipolar disorder and severe mood dysregulation paid less attention to the eyes and more attention to the noses and mouths of the faces. The findings indicate the potential value of treatment programs that teach children how to identify emotions by looking at others’ eyes.—<italic>Society for Neuroscience</italic>, news release, November 14, 2011.</p>

<title>“Screen-free” play best for toddlers’ brains</title>
<p>Unstructured play is much better than TV or videos for encouraging brain development in infants and toddlers, a new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement says. Free play helps children younger than age 2 learn to think creatively, problem solve, and develop reasoning and motor skills at an early age. It also teaches them how to entertain themselves. Although a large number of video programs for infants and toddlers are marketed as educational, no evidence exists to support this claim, said the AAP. The group also said that extensive exposure to TV and videos puts children at risk for delays in language development when they start school. Even when parents watch their own programs, it distracts them and decreases their interaction with their children. The intrusion of a parent’s TV program may also interfere with a young child’s opportunities to learn from play and other activities. Overall, young children learn best from and require interaction with people, not TV shows or videos.</p>
<p>The AAP discourages electronic media use for children younger than 2 years. If parents choose to let their children watch TV or videos, they need to set limits on viewing time and have a strategy for managing use. When parents do not have time to actively engage in play with a child, they should opt for supervised independent play instead of TV or videos, the study authors said in the news release. For example, give the child nesting cups to play with on the floor nearby while a parent prepares dinner. Do not put a television in a child’s bedroom, the experts warned. Watching TV before bedtime can cause poor sleep habits and irregular sleep schedules, which can lead to mood, behavior, and learning problems.—Council on Communications and Media. (2011).

<title>Screen Media and Autism</title>
<p>Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) tend to spend a majority of their free time in front of a screen, but little if any of that time on social activities such as e-mail or chat. Researchers analyzed data from the <italic>National Longitudinal Transition Study 2,</italic> which includes more than 1,000 13- to 16-year-olds in special ed who have ASDs, speech and language impairments, and learning disabilities. While 28 percent of typically developing kids are reported as heavy TV watchers, this study found that more than twice as many kids with ASDs (60.3 percent) are reported to spend “most of his/her time” watching TV or videos. By contrast, almost 90 percent of the students with ASDs spent little time on social media such as e-mail and chat, and 64.4 percent don’t use email or chat at all. Television viewing is clearly a preferred activity for children with ASDs, regardless of symptoms, functional level, or family status. The authors say that as children with ASDs age and as their cognitive skills improve, they spend more time using social media, which helps them to further develop social skills.—Mazureck, M.O., Shattuck, P.T., Wagner, M, &amp; Cooper, B.J.

<title>Predicting Autism Risk in Infancy</title>
<p>Infants younger than a year old who are at risk of developing autism may already have telltale brain responses when another person looks at or away from them. The researchers say that the findings suggest that assessing brain responses in infants as young as 6 months may one day help predict whether they’ll develop autism at a later age. Currently, firm diagnoses of autism are made only after a child is 2 years old. The study included infants aged 6 to 10 months who had an increased risk of developing autism because they had an older brother or sister with the disorder. The researchers monitored the infants’ brain activity while they viewed faces that switched between looking at them and looking away from them. Previous research has shown that characteristic patterns of brain activity occur in a normal response to eye contact with other people, a response that’s crucial for face-to-face social interaction. Older children with autism have unusual patterns of eye contact and of brain responses to social interactions that involve eye contact. This study found that the brains of the infants at risk of developing autism already process social information in a different way than typically developing children. Not all the babies who showed these differences in brain function were later diagnosed with autism, and vice versa. Brain-function measuring would need to be further adjusted and used alongside other methods to serve as an accurate predictor of autism.—Elsabbagh, M., et al. (2012) Infant neural sensitivity to dynamic eye gaze is associated with later emerging autism. <italic>Current Biology, 22</italic>, 1-5.</p>
