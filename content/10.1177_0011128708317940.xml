<abstract>
<p>Treated initially as a social problem, elder abuse has only recently been criminalized. The criminalization of elder abuse involves penalizing offenders for actively abusing offenders as well as for violating mandatory reporting laws. Mandatory reporting laws exist to encourage professionals to report suspected cases of elder abuse. In this study, attention is given to the way that failure to report elder abuse cases are adjudicated in comparison to elder physical abuse cases. Content analysis was performed on a sample of case descriptions of elder physical abuse cases and failure to report cases. Results suggest that mandatory reporting offenses are adjudicated slightly differently than physical abuse cases, and the dynamics surrounding the two offense types vary as well. Implications including the need for broader penalties and better training of human services professionals are suggested.</p>

<p>The word <italic>elder abuse</italic> can be traced to the phrase “granny bashing” used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128708317940">Baker (1975)</xref> in British medical journals in the 1970s. It is estimated that anywhere from 2% to 10% of older persons have been victims of elder abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128708317940">Lachs &amp; Pillemer, 2004</xref>). Although researchers from different disciplines have been studying the topic for three decades, elder abuse has only recently been criminalized. Criminalization is demonstrated in two ways: the application of criminal penalties to those who abuse older persons and the development of criminal laws mandating that certain professionals report suspected cases of elder abuse. These laws are referred to as mandatory reporting laws or failure to report laws.</p>
<p>A growing body of literature has addressed the kinds of criminal penalties given to elder abusers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Cikovic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gainey, 2006</xref>), but few studies have addressed how the criminalization of failure to report elder abuse fits within the criminal justice system’s response to elder abuse—or how the crime of failure to report elder abuse compares to other forms of elder abuse. To fill this void, this study assessed the similarities and differences between elder physical abuse cases and failure to report elder abuse cases by content analyzing case reports. These reports were developed by patient abuse investigators, who have direct knowledge about all forms of elder abuse, from across the United States.</p>
<p>This research is justified on four grounds. First, experts have noted that fully understanding effective responses to elder abuse requires that policy makers and researchers understand the similarities and differences between all forms of elder abuse, including active cases of abuse and passive forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128708317940">Stein, 1991</xref>). Second, so little research has been done on mandatory reporting laws (or failure to report elder abuse offenses) that a basic understanding of the way these laws are applied can be derived from comparing mandatory reporting violations with elder physical abuse cases. Third, different criminological theories have been used to guide understanding about elder physical abuse. Comparing mandatory reporting violations of elder physical abuse cases will help to determine whether the same theories guiding our understanding of elder abuse in general can be used to guide our understanding about failure to report elder abuse cases. Finally, researchers need to determine the similarities and differences in various types of elder abuse and differences in the way the justice system responds to different elder abuse offenses to help policy makers to effectively develop intervention systems that address all forms of elder abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128708317940">Daly &amp; Jogerst, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128708317940">
<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>When the problem of elder abuse first surfaced as a political issue in the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708317940">Katz, 1979</xref>), the debate focused on the kinds of acts that should be considered as elder abuse. The lack of agreement continued throughout the 1980s. More than three decades since academic interest in elder abuse first surfaced, the actual definition is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128708317940">Lachs &amp; Pillemer, 2004</xref>). As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128708317940">Eleazer (1995)</xref> begins an article on elder abuse with a quote by J. Callahan: “Abuse, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.” This ambiguity makes it more difficult to study, respond to, and prevent elder abuse. Indeed, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128708317940">Daly and Jogerst (2006)</xref> identified 27 different definitions of elder mistreatment.</p>
<p>In an effort to bring together these varying definitions, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128708317940">National Research Council (2003)</xref> developed the following definition of elder abuse: “(a) international actions that cause harm or create a serious risk of harm (whether or not it is intended) to a vulnerable elder by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust relationship to the elder or (b) failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder’s basic needs or protect the elder from harm” (p. 40). The five variations of elder abuse recognized by the National Center on Elder Abuse include physical abuse, financial abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Physical abuse refers to actions such as hitting, striking, kicking, or otherwise assaulting an older person. Financial abuse occurs when individuals commit theft or fraud against an older person. Emotional abuse, while typically not criminally illegal, includes actions such as yelling at or verbally assaulting an older person. Sexual abuse is the least commonly reported form of elder abuse and it entails the range of sexual victimizations such as rape, exhibitionism, harmful touching, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Neglect is perhaps the most commonly committed form of elder abuse. Several variations of neglect exist. Most broadly, researchers have identified active (or intentional) and passive (or unintentional) neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128708317940">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some experts refer to the phrase “elder abuse and neglect” to distinguish between the crimes of commission (e.g., abuse) and crimes of omission (e.g., neglect). Although these various definitions have been developed, it has only been since the early 1990s that elder abuse has been criminalized. The criminalization of elder abuse involved the passage of different laws requiring the police and courts to formally respond to accusations of elder abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128708317940">Morgan, Johnson, &amp; Sigler, 2006</xref>). This criminalization focused on crimes of commission (physical, sexual, and financial abuses) and crimes of omission (neglect).</p>
<p>Part of the initial efforts to criminalize elder abuse involved the passage of mandatory reporting laws. These laws dictate that certain professionals must report suspected cases of elder abuse and neglect. Failure to report cases of elder abuse, a form of neglect, could result in criminal or civil penalties, or both. Although a handful of states have voluntary reporting laws (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128708317940">Ehrlich &amp; Anetzberger, 1991</xref>), 43 states have mandatory reporting laws that aim to protect the older person’s rights and welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128708317940">Zborowsky, 1985</xref>). Sixteen states mandate that any person who suspects abuse must report it (in comparison to states that specify that only certain types of professionals are required to report abuse; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128708317940">Stiegel, 1995</xref>). As written, the laws provide immunity to individuals who make reports in good faith if it is determined that the abuse did not occur.</p>
<p>In theory, mandatory reporting policies (a) help identify elder abuse cases, (b) encourage professionals who otherwise would not report to do so, (c) relieve the ethical burden of deciding whether a report should be made, and (d) have the potential to deter violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128708317940">Macolini, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708317940">Moskowitz, 1998</xref>). The success of the laws is indirectly illustrated in research showing that higher elder abuse investigation rates exist in states with mandatory reporting laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128708317940">Daly, Jogerst, Brinig, &amp; Dawson, 2003</xref>). Proponents further justify mandatory reporting laws because of the perception of “a culture of fear and intimidation in some parts of the aged care sector” that prohibits reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128708317940">McCredie, 2006</xref>). In fact, mandatory reporting has been described as the most common elder abuse policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128708317940">Rodriguez, Wallace, Woolf, &amp; Mangione, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As with any type of legislation, critics have described a number of concerns about mandatory reporting laws. Some critics of mandatory reporting laws note that the laws are not empirically based. These critics point to the lack of research supporting the need for the laws prior to the passage of the laws. Drawing parallels to the weaknesses of child abuse mandatory reporting laws, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708317940">Katz (1979)</xref> notes that if much of the abuse was truly caused by stress—as was the widespread belief at that time—then laws should be directed toward preventing the pressures leading to stress. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128708317940">Crystal (1986)</xref>, people already know the acts are occurring and reporting would not necessarily stop an abusive situation.</p>
<p>Another problem that calls into question the effectiveness of these laws has to do with the problem of defining elder abuse. Ever since policy makers, researchers, and advocates first began to discuss elder abuse, there has been debate about how elder abuse should be defined. The fact that individuals are not able to agree on what constitutes abuse makes reporting problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128708317940">Anetzberger, Korbin, &amp; Tomita, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128708317940">Ehrlich &amp; Anetzberger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128708317940">Faulkner, 1982</xref>). For instance, some might define elder abuse as “intentional harms committed against an older person,” whereas others might offer a broader definition suggesting that “all violations against an older person” are forms of elder abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gray, 2002</xref>). Those basing the definition on intent may decide not to report certain harmful actions if they believe that the aggressor did not intend the harm. Alternatively, those basing their definition of elder abuse on the existence of harm might be more prone to report a larger number of suspected elder abuse cases.</p>
<p>Some have also criticized elder abuse mandatory reporting laws for their ageist undertone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128708317940">McCredie, 2006</xref>). Vehemently opposing these laws, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128708317940">Crystal (1987)</xref> argues, “the implication is that because [a person] is officially ‘elderly,’ she is by definition unable to choose to request, or not to request, outside involvement” (p. 60). Having different definitions of <italic>elderly</italic> across the states means that reporting requirements are somewhat arbitrary. Some states define the age of 55 as elderly, others use the age of 60, and still others use the age of 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>). Regardless of the age used to define <italic>elderly</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708317940">Katz (1979)</xref> argues that the laws are ageist because they assume incompetence on the part of the victim. If a state’s definition of <italic>elderly</italic> is 65, and a doctor suspects that a 64-year-old woman is being abused by her husband, there is no legal duty to report the abuse; however, once that woman turns 65, the doctor would have a legal duty to report the abuse.</p>
<p>Concerns about patient–physician confidentiality also exist with mandatory reporting laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128708317940">Burg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128708317940">Ehrlich &amp; Anetzberger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128708317940">Faulkner, 1982</xref>). Legally speaking, reporting laws take precedence over confidential communications that have been recognized between patient and physician for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128708317940">Burg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128708317940">Faulkner, 1982</xref>). Patient–physician confidentiality is a value indoctrinated into members of the health care field. Interviews with doctors found that mandatory reporting policies were seen as influencing physician–patient rapport and the physician’s ability to make appropriate decisions about what is best for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128708317940">Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>). Physicians are trained to keep health care information about their patients private, and they interact with patients under this umbrella of confidentiality. To maintain this confidentiality, physicians may interact in such a way that they are unable to determine if abuse is occurring (e.g., they simply may not ask about it because they do not want to have to violate the patient’s confidentiality). For some health care providers, it is not that they fear the outcome of the case, as mandatory reporting laws grant them immunity; rather, the lawsuit itself could be time consuming and costly to battle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128708317940">Medical Economics, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Opponents of mandatory reporting laws also say that more harm than good could come from reporting acts, many of which victims may not want reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708317940">Katz, 1979</xref>). Criminologists use the word <italic>revictimization</italic> to describe the way that the criminal justice system harms victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128708317940">Doerner &amp; Lab, 2006</xref>). Revictimization is not limited to younger victims. In fact, older victims may encounter different forms of revictimization. Being treated in ageist ways, having physical problems getting to court, and facing the risk of being placed in a nursing home are just a few examples of revictimization experiences that are likely more typical in elder abuse cases than in criminal cases involving victims from other stages of the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gainey, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another criticism of elder abuse mandatory reporting laws centers on the inconsistent reporting or discretion given to mandated reporters. With regard to discretion, unless those who are involved in responding to and dealing with crimes against elderly persons agree with the law, it really does not matter what the law says. The laws will be effective only to the extent that mandatory reporters choose to report suspected cases of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128708317940">Ehrlich &amp; Anetzberger, 1991</xref>). Arguably, one could suggest that mandatory reporting laws are ineffective either because mandatory reporters are unaware of the reporting requirements or they disagree with the philosophy of the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128708317940">Anetzberger, Lachs, O’Brien, Pillemer, &amp; Tomita, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128708317940">Tilden et al., 1994</xref>). Nearly two decades ago, only one in three physicians who suspected abuse reported it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128708317940">Campbell, 1988</xref>). By the mid-1990s, many physicians still failed to respond to elder abuse cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128708317940">Lachs, 1995</xref>, p. 11). Surveys of 156 Alabama doctors, a group of mandated reporters, showed that half were not familiar with the procedures for responding to abuse and three fourths were not aware of the procedures to report abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128708317940">Daniels, Baumhover, &amp; Clark-Daniels, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708317940">Clark-Daniels, Daniels, and Baumhover (1990)</xref> point out that professionals do not understand the intent of the law or when they should report abuse</p>
<p>Although researchers have considered how much different human services professionals know about mandatory reporting laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128708317940">Daniels, Baumhover, Formby, &amp; Clark-Daniels, 1999</xref>), no researchers have considered how this form of elder abuse, as a crime of omission, is distinguished from other forms of elder abuse. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128708317940">Daly and Jogerst (2006)</xref> note, because elder abuse and elder neglect (e.g., failure to report is a form of neglect) have similarities and differences, understanding the ties and differences between the two types of offenses will help to determine the most effective prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
<sec id="section2-0011128708317940">
<title>Theoretical Perspective</title>
<p>Three different criminological theories are useful in gaining insight about the similarities and differences between failure to report elder abuse cases and elder physical abuse cases: deterrence theory, subcultural theory, and conflict theory. The very notion of having criminal penalties as a punishment for not reporting suspected cases of abuse is tied to deterrence theory. In Alabama, for example, those who do not report when they had reason to do so could be assessed a $500 fine or 6 months in jail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708317940">Clark-Daniels et al., 1990</xref>). Based on ideals of deterrence theory, these laws promote the use of criminal penalties so that professionals realize the protective services system’s desire to be made aware of elder abuse cases. For the laws to be effective, then, criminal penalties must be imposed to reflect disdain for failing to report elder abuse. Indeed, sanctions that are not applied will have limited deterrent potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128708317940">Zimring &amp; Hawkins, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of subcultural theory, past research on different forms of elder abuse including theft in nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128708317940">Harris &amp; Benson, 1998</xref>), crimes in the home health care field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gray, 2002</xref>), and violence in nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Appel, 2007</xref>), suggests that certain aspects of the occupational subculture working with older persons is related to the occurrence of abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128708317940">Harris and Benson (1998)</xref> found that subcultural values prejudicial toward the elderly contribute to abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128708317940">Payne and Gray (2002)</xref> found that fraudulent cases committed in the home health care field typically involved subcultural groups working together to carry out their offenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128708317940">Payne and Appel’s (2007)</xref> research on violence in nursing homes found that certain elements of the nursing home subculture may foster violence. Although research shows that subcultural explanations address some forms of elder abuse, it is not clear whether these explanations address failure to report laws.</p>
<p>Conflict theory can also serve as a guide in understanding the similarities and differences between failure to report elder abuse and elder physical abuse cases. Tenets of conflict theory can be used to address different aspects of elder abuse. For example, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128708317940">Quinney’s (1970)</xref> <italic>Social Reality of Crime</italic>, one could question whether the source of elder abuse statutes as well as the resources devoted to enforcing the statutes are influenced by political ideals. On one hand, the fact mandatory reporting laws are so widespread suggests that those with power (in this case, legislators) have defined the behavior as inappropriate. On the other hand, if the laws are rarely enforced or enforced with minimal penalties, then support for conflict theory would emerge. As well, comparing the penalties in failure to report cases with the penalties in other types of elder abuse cases will shed some light on whether the political motivation driving the laws was based on “looking good” by passing laws or “doing good” by passing laws that work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>No studies, however, have considered how failure to report elder abuse cases and the response to these cases compares to other forms of elder abuse. To fill this void, this study addresses the following questions: (a) What are the characteristics of the failure to report cases prosecuted by fraud control units? (b) What types of penalties are given to violators? (c) What are the similarities and differences between failure to report elder abuse cases and elder physical abuse cases? and (d) How do the penalties in failure to report cases compare to the penalties in elder physical abuse cases? Addressing these questions will provide a baseline from which one could assess how capable the laws are of deterring elder abuse cases.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To address these questions, cases of elder physical abuse (<italic>n</italic> = 337) and mandatory reporting violations (<italic>n</italic> = 46) were selected from the <italic>Medicaid Fraud Reports</italic>, an official publication of the National Association of Attorneys General. The fraud reports provide a qualitative description of cases being investigated or prosecuted by Medicaid Fraud Control Units. As state law enforcement agencies, Medicaid Fraud Control Units are responsible for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting cases of patient abuse that occur in health care practices receiving Medicaid funding (e.g., nursing homes, home health care agencies, medical facilities, hospitals, physicians’ offices, and so on).</p>
<p>Published 10 times a year, the <italic>Medicaid Fraud Reports</italic> includes descriptions of ongoing patient abuse cases. Individuals from the specific fraud control unit provide a general overview of the case, typically written in the form of a press release. The National Association of Attorneys General compiles the case descriptions and publishes them together with the other case descriptions. The elder physical abuse case descriptions typically include information about the offender (identity, occupation, gender as inferred from the name), crime (type of act was committed), stage of criminal justice processing (arrest, indictment, adjudication, or sentencing) and sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Cikovic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gainey, 2006</xref>). The mandatory reporting violation case descriptions include similar information. Here are three examples of how cases are described in the fraud report:</p>

In exchange for a plea of guilty to the above offense, **** was fined $100 and ordered to pay court costs of $78.50. (National Association of Attorneys General, November/December, 1997).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attorney General **** announced on February 9 that [the defendant], a CNA, was charged with one count of failure to report the abuse of a vulnerable adult. [The defendant] witnessed CNA [name] repeatedly kick a resident of Rolling Hills Nursing Home, in the back and buttocks region. [The defendant] denied seeing anything. [The defendant] was sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and was sentenced to thirty days in the county jail, of which 30 days was suspended (National Association of Attorneys General, July 1999, p. 12).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The cases were content analyzed using standard rules of manifest and latent content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128708317940">Berg, 2006</xref>). Manifest content analysis entailed counting and coding specific words or phrases (such as the gender of the offender, their occupation, their sentence, and so on). Latent content analysis entailed a consideration of the underlying meaning of phrases and words and labeling these underlying meanings within a theme developed by the researcher. If, for instance, the case description indicated that an individual hit an elderly person but was prosecuted for failure to report rather than assault, this case was coded under a theme labeled <italic>self-abuse</italic>. The case descriptions did not necessarily use the labels used by the researcher; rather, the researcher developed these themes and labels as a way to demonstrate patterns in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128708317940">Berg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>All mandatory reporting cases (<italic>n</italic> = 46) described in the fraud reports between 1993 and 2004 were included in the sample. A sample of elder physical abuse cases (<italic>n</italic> = 337) reported between 1997 and 2003 were selected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128708317940">2</xref></sup> Because mandatory reporting violations are prosecuted much more infrequently than elder physical abuse cases, it was necessary to select those cases from longer time frames to gather an acceptable number of cases that would allow comparisons to be made and conclusions to be drawn. Uneven sample sizes are not in themselves a large problem for the analyses used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128708317940">Knoke, Bohrnstedt, &amp; Mee, 2002</xref>). Others who have compared elder abuse to different forms of domestic violence have also used different sample sizes for different offense categories.</p>
<p>Cross tabulations and <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to assess for differences between failure to report and elder physical abuse cases. The same types of analyses were used to assess for differences between the kinds of penalties imposed in the two types of cases.</p>

<p>In terms of the types of abuse the defendants failed to report, neglect (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and physical abuse (<italic>n</italic> = 14) were the two most frequently types of abuse of which defendants were accused of failing to report. One interesting, albeit rare, use of mandatory reporting laws entailed the prosecution of offenders who failed to report their own harmful activities. These cases are referred to as self-abuse in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128708317940">Table 1</xref>. Just five of the mandatory reporting cases were identified as self-abuse cases. Here is how two of the self-abuse cases were described in the fraud reports:</p>
<list id="list2-0011128708317940" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Attorney General **** announced that on December 28, 1999, a complaint was filed charging [defendant] with . . . failure to report the maltreatment of a vulnerable adult. [Defendant] worked as a night coordinator at REM, an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded. When the staff came to work in the morning, they had noticed that he had bruises. [Defendant] was the only staff on duty the previous evening. The police questioned [defendant] three times. The third time, [defendant] admitted to making contact with the victim by putting his hands up when the victim came toward him and again as he put his foot out and made contact with her and made scrape marks on the victim’s breast and thigh . . . [Defendant], a mandated reporter, knew or had reason to know the victim had been maltreated and failed to make the report of the maltreatment as required by Minnesota statute . . . [Defendant] signed a petition to enter a plea of guilty (National Association of Attorneys General, 1999, p. 15).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The investigation focused on [defendant’s] employment as a CNA. During an evening in June 2004, [defendant] was assigned to transfer a male resident from a chair to his bed. Some difficulty occurred during this process, which resulted in the resident receiving a laceration. [Defendant] did not report the matter and did not obtain aid for the resident. [Defendant] simply left the elderly man with a laceration on his forehead. (National Association of Attorneys General, 2004, available online).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These offenders were prosecuted for failure to report elder abuse but were not prosecuted for physical abuse.</p>
<p>Cross-tabulations were conducted to compare the dynamics of the mandatory reporting violations with elder physical abuse cases. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128708317940">Table 1</xref>, two significant differences were uncovered. First, with regard to occupation, in mandatory reporting violation cases, defendants were much more likely to be nurses or directors than they were in physical abuse cases. In fact, more than one third of the mandatory reporting cases involved directors or supervisors, whereas less than 1% of elder physical abuse cases involved directors or supervisors. As well, aides were more likely to be accused of physical abuse cases than mandatory reporting cases. Nearly 9 of out 10 elder physical abuse cases involved an aide as the offender, as compared to approximately 1 of 5 mandatory reporting cases involving an aide.</p>
<p>Second, mandatory reporting violations were more likely to involve collaborators than elder physical abuse cases were. This means that mandatory reporting cases were more apt to involve situations in which more than one defendant was charged for a specific incident. Just over half of the mandatory reporting violations involved cases in which multiple defendants were charged. Alternatively, less than 1% of the elder physical abuse cases involved cases in which more than one defendant was charged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study show interesting patterns regarding the dynamics of mandatory reporting cases and the way the justice system punishes offenders in these cases. Those charged with mandatory reporting violations tended to be directors or administrators and nurses, whereas those changed with elder physical abuse tended to be aides. Mandatory reporting offenders were frequently charged along with other codefendants. In addition, in a small subset of cases, mandatory reporter offenders were prosecuted for not admitting their own occupational misdeeds. In terms of sentencing, mandatory reporter offenders received less severe sentences than physical abusers in general. Fines were the most common sanction for mandatory reporter offenders. Although mandatory reporter offenders were no more likely than elder physical abusers to be fined, the average fine given to mandatory reporting offenders was significantly higher than the average fine given to elder physical abusers. Some sanctions, such as community service and jail, were rarely used in mandatory reporting cases. Taken together, these findings have implications for policy, legal studies, theory, and future research.</p>
<p>Several policy implications arise from these findings. First, one can suggest that investigations and prosecutions of mandatory reporting violations be done in a comprehensive way, focusing on potential offenders rather than a specific offender. The basis for this suggestion is the fact that so many of the mandatory reporting violations involved situations in which several defendants were charged and prosecuted for failing to report a specific incident of elder abuse. Investigators and prosecutors should make sure that their investigations are wide enough to encompass all of the potential witnesses who failed to report the maltreatment. By its very nature, elder abuse, as an unreported crime, is an offense type that generally has witnesses who fail to share information with the authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Cikovic, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, because research shows that so many cases of elder physical abuse cases are unreported—by some estimates just 1 in 14 cases are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708317940">Payne, 2006</xref>)—finding that so few mandatory reporting cases are prosecuted suggests that practitioners and policy makers must increase the use of mandatory reporting laws to make them more effective. Typically, when individuals consider undetected elder abuse cases, they focus on unreported acts of physical, sexual, or financial abuse. However, the rarity of failure to report cases suggests that these are offense types that are frequently unreported and invisible to the justice system.</p>
<p>Third, all individuals involved in detecting and responding to elder abuse must define failure to report as a type of elder mistreatment. Those providing care to older persons, criminal justice officials, human services professionals, researchers, and policy makers must come to agreement that failing to intervene in elder abuse cases is, in and of itself, a form or mistreatment. Some might even go as far as to suggest that not reporting a crime is as bad as actually committing the crime in question in some cases. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128708317940">Harris and Benson (1998)</xref> suggest that financial abuse of the elderly can potentially be seen as worse than physical abuse because financial abuse is premeditated whereas many cases of physical abuse are spur-of-the-moment decisions and behaviors. The act of failing to report—like financial abuse—requires a degree of conscious effort. In fact, mandatory reporter offenders have long periods to report the suspected abuses before the failure to report actually becomes criminal. Another way to suggest it is that it takes just a few seconds to commit a physically abusive act, and such actions may be reactive in some instances. Failure to report offenses takes hours, days, or even weeks to commit. Imagine parents who tell their children that they are not allowed to go out and play until someone tells them who broke the cookie jar. The longer the children wait, the angrier the parents will become because they see that element of time as making the children’s behavior particularly troublesome. At some point, the parents may actually become angry about the children’s reluctance to communicate and not about the cookie jar.</p>
<p>Fourth, and on a related point, judges and policy makers should consider broadening the kinds of penalties given to mandatory reporter offenders. The sanctions do not have to be more severe necessarily. Instead, certain sanctions, like community service, appear to be underused with this group of offenders. Most mandatory reporter offenders have skills that could be put to use in some form of service to the community (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Gray, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, tying all of these implications together, it is important that practitioners understand the tenets of mandatory reporting laws as well as strategies to adhere to the laws. For example, research shows that mandatory reporting among doctors increases when doctors (a) ask direct questions about mistreatment, (b) have office protocol detailing reporting mechanisms, and (c) have knowledge about mandatory reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128708317940">Oswald, Jogerst, Daly, &amp; Bentler, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Experts have suggested other mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of mandatory reporting laws. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128708317940">Wolf and Pillemer (1989)</xref> note that because the laws were passed without funding, the laws were destined for failure. They suggest that increased funding to educate about the laws would lead to increases in reporting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708317940">Moskowitz (1998)</xref> calls for a number of programmatic and legislative changes to increase reporting. First, he argues that reporters must be better trained in identifying abuse. Second, he argues that civil penalties need to be imposed more regularly on professionals who fail to report elder abuse. Third, he suggests that institutions that employ professionals who fail to report abuse should be held accountable and sanctioned. Finally, he points out that professional sanctions can be imposed on those who fail to report.</p>
<p>In terms of implications for legal studies, legal thought needs to be directed toward considering whether punishing an individual for failing to report his or her own behavior is a violation of an individual’s right against self-incrimination. Although such cases were the exception among all of the mandatory reporting cases, that they exist at all seems to suggest that the laws are potentially broadened beyond the scope of the policy makers’ intentions. This, in and of itself, is not surprising given the disconnect between what policy makers say should be done and what practitioners actually do in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128708317940">Tonry, 1996</xref>). However, for mandatory reporting laws to be respected and effective, practitioners must make sure that the laws are applied fairly across offenders.</p>
<p>These findings and the utility of the recommendations stated above can be best understood through an application of three theoretical perspectives—deterrence theory, subcultural theory, and conflict theory. The ties to deterrence theory are clear. For laws to be effective, offenders must be punished swiftly, with a degree of certainty, and with a degree of punishment more severe than the offense that was committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128708317940">Beccaria, 1764/1963</xref>). The application of mandatory reporting laws fails to meet any of these three ideals of deterrence theory. Regarding swiftness, the very design of the laws—allowing time to pass between the initial incident and the time at which not acting actually becomes a crime—makes it difficult to gauge the point at which too much time has passed for a punishment to be effective. Regarding certainty, the high unreporting rate of elder abuse in general suggests that these offenses are easy to commit without being punished. With regard to severity, the fact that so few offenders are punished for these offenses suggests that their general deterrent power is minimal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128708317940">Piquero &amp; Paternoster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128708317940">Stafford &amp; Warr, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of subcultural theory, the finding that so many of the mandatory reporting offenses involved multiple defendants points to the group nature of this offense type. That group behavior influences juvenile delinquency is well accepted in the juvenile delinquency literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128708317940">Ericksen &amp; Jensen, 1977</xref>). Drawing parallels to the understanding of other forms of violence, it is plausible to suggest that subcultural influences potentially contribute to various forms of elder abuse. This is likely to be true for failure to report cases. Drawing an analogy with crimes occurring in neighborhoods where the neighborhood subculture does not trust the police is illustrative of this pattern. If a particular neighborhood subculture stresses that residents should not trust the police or communicate with the police, then those residents will be less likely to report information about known crimes to the police. It would not be just one or two neighborhood residents who do not communicate with law enforcement; rather, such a value would be a part of the neighborhood subculture. Just as a culture of fear and intimidation keeps individuals in crime-ridden neighborhoods from talking with the police, these same concerns may keep professionals from reporting elder abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128708317940">McCredie, 2006</xref>). Taking this a step further, if a health care setting discourages individuals from looking for or reporting elder abuse, then it is likely that failure to report will be common. It would not be just one or two employees failing to report abuse; rather, an entire group of offenders would be involved. Understanding how the value of silence in a subculture perpetuates failing to report offenses should help to break down reporting barriers.</p>
<p>One can also see shades of conflict theory in these findings. On one hand, the relatively minor penalties given to mandatory reporting offenders (many of whom are in higher occupational classes such as directors and nurses) as compared to the penalties given to aides suggests a degree of favoritism for the workers coming from a higher status. That certain individuals receive preferable treatment from the justice system is the foundation of conflict theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128708317940">Reiman, 2007</xref>). Of course, from a consensus model, one could note that the sentences between classes are based on offense type and access to older persons. Basically, aides interact more with older persons and based on this degree of interaction would be more prone to be abusers than those who have less contact with older persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128708317940">Payne &amp; Cikovic, 1995</xref>). Alternatively, directors and bosses are more prone to receive information about nursing home abuses from their workers (e.g., if an aide or resident witnesses abuse, he or she will be more likely to report it to the individual in charge than to another type of worker). Receiving more reports about elder abuse potentially places directors at a higher risk of engaging, or at least being accused of engaging, in failure to report cases. In addition, directors are responsible for the nursing home as a whole and thus may be more easily identified as culprits in failure to report cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128708317940">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Related to conflict theory, patriarchal theory can be used to interpret the way that mandatory reporter offenders are fined for their offenses rather than sentenced to community service or even jail. Based on the premise that most elder abuse cases involve older women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128708317940">National Center on Elder Abuse, 2006</xref>), one could argue that using a fine as the most common penalty for mandatory reporting violations (and elder physical abuse cases for that matter) at least tacitly implies that the offenses have harmed societal property and the most appropriate response to these offenses involves a monetary penalty. That failure to report cases involves higher fines than physical abuse cases strengthens this assumption in that the underlying assumption is that vulnerable victims (e.g., unreported cases) need more ownership (e.g., a higher monetary penalty) than cases in which witnesses are available. Alternatively, it could be that physical abusers were fined a lower amount because they received other criminal penalties and the fines would have been unnecessary. The reason for differences in fine amounts should be addressed in future research.</p>
<p>Future research should also address the degree to which the application of these laws varies across jurisdictions and states. There is certainly reason to believe that different agencies hold the laws in different regard. In addition, future research should consider whether characteristics of the victim (race, age, gender) in failure to report cases influence case processing. As well, researchers should focus on mandated reporters not captured within the scope of this research (e.g., bank employees, social services, law enforcement) to determine how well these groups adhere to reporting requirements. As the cornerstone of elder abuse legislation, for mandatory reporting laws to be effective, they must be empirically tested and adapted as needed.</p>

<p>Elder abuse is known to occur in all settings. Some authors use the phrase “domestic elder abuse” to refer to abuses occurring in the community. The phrase “patient abuse” is used to refer to abuses occurring in nursing homes and other long-term-care settings. This article focuses primarily on abuses occurring in nursing homes.</p>

<p>An earlier study focused on the varieties of elder abuse prosecuted by fraud control units between 1997 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708317940">Payne and Gainey, 2006</xref>). The current article used that data set for the physical abuse cases. If the same years were used for the failure to report cases, the sample size would have been too small for any meaningful analysis. The years for the failure to report cases were expanded to include 1993 to 2003. To make sure that the failure to report cases from 1993 to 1997 were not different from the 1997 to 2003 time frame, cross-tabulations were conducted, comparing failure to report cases between the two time frames. No differences were uncovered. Although there are potential problems with using two different time frames, given that the failure to report cases has similar characteristics between the two periods, the themes that emerged did not seem to be conditioned by year.</p>
