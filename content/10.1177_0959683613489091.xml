<p>This unique book was co-written by two hydrologists, Eric Wood and Justin Sheffield, who are both associated with the Hydroclimatology Group at Princeton University. The idea for the book developed from Sheffield’s doctoral dissertation, which explored the occurrence of drought over the last 50 years and the potential for future changes in drought occurrence. While the book is in part a compilation of the scientific findings and knowledge of decades of research from the Princeton group and their collaborators, it also includes nearly 800 literature references on very diverse aspects of drought. The subject treatment is non-mathematical and the book is written at a level that would make it comprehensible to undergraduates and to researchers in diverse disciplines. Some 70 figures and 25 colour plates are included. The book is relevant to readers of <italic>The Holocene</italic> particularly because of its extensive chapter on palaeo-drought.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the authors is to fill a gap in the literature on global drought and its past and potential future occurrences. This theme carries through the book’s nine chapters. As further motivation for the book, the authors underscore the shortcomings in our current knowledge of drought. They identify the need for better observations, a clearer understanding of why droughts occur, and improved monitoring and forecasting methods.</p>
<p>The book consists of two main parts. The first (Chapters 2–4) provides background material concerning drought impacts, the processes leading to drought, and the tools for quantifying, monitoring, and predicting drought. The second part (Chapters 5–8) describes drought occurrence on various timescales, including future drought projections. The final, brief chapter includes a summary of several important questions and recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>The book’s first two chapters are brief, the first serving to give an overview of the book and the second serving to answer the question ‘What is drought?’ and to introduce the four recognized types of drought.</p>
<p>The third chapter, ‘The science of drought’, summarizes selected aspects of hydrology and climate and presents an overview of the causes of drought. The subject matter is important for the reader, but unfortunately this is the weakest chapter in the book. One of its shortcomings is the lack of an appropriate description of key aspects of the hydrologic cycle: the water storage reservoirs that provide the basis for evaporation and transpiration and the movement of water on the Earth’s surface and within the ground. Later in the book terms such as ‘baseflow’ and ‘interflow’ are introduced without explanation. In the absence of an adequate description of water movement and storage, the typical reader is unlikely to comprehend these terms. A second shortcoming is the oversimplification of global climate and circulation. Some specifics about this are described later in this review. A nice inclusion in the chapter is the information about climatic teleconnections such as El Niño, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and so forth. The relevant material is very up-to-date.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter is titled ‘Quantifying drought’, but the information it provides goes well beyond this. Of particular interest are the discussions of satellite methodologies and data sets for monitoring variables related to drought and palaeoclimate data for reconstructing past droughts.</p>
<p>The following four chapters describe drought occurrence during various time periods. Chapter 5 discusses drought occurrences throughout the Holocene. Chapter 6 provides an overview of drought in the 20th century and Chapter 7 provides detail on major drought events of the 20th century. Chapter 8 presents drought projections for the 21st century and the assumptions upon which they are based.</p>
<p>Overall, this book suffers from three significant weaknesses. These include technical errors, misleading statements, and a tendency to gloss over complex processes in a way that leads to inaccurate characterizations. Some examples are the use of the term ‘transpiration’ for water evaporated from the surface of a vegetation canopy (p. 17), the list of radiation bands and atmospheric windows (p. 46), and the statement that hundreds of severe droughts have occurred over the last 100 years (p. 99). Likewise, the statement appears on p. 32 that ‘previously, it was thought that overuse, in the form of overgrazing, deforestation and poor land management, was responsible’ for the Sahel drought of the 1970s and 1980s. This was never more than a hypothesis that had little acceptance in the climatological community and the hypothesis has been proven to be incorrect by a plethora of papers.</p>
<p>A particularly troubling section is the explanation of the general atmospheric circulation, which is replete with errors. Two examples are the statements that circulation cells can be explained primarily on the basis of convection and Coriolis force, and that the Gobi Desert is located near a subtropical high (p. 22). Further, the polar and subtropical jets are confused and the adequacy of the three-cell model circulation model is vastly overstated. There are also mis-statements concerning solar forcing and internal versus external variations as causes of climate (p. 23). As for the latter, the authors do refer to internal variations of the ‘ocean–atmosphere’. However, conventionally the oceans are considered to be an external forcing mechanism of climate (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613489091">Shukla, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The climate statements this reviewer finds most problematic relate to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In the meteorological community there is considerable confusion about this feature because the term is variously applied to a surface convergence zone, a pressure minimum, a rainfall maximum, or a minimum in outgoing long-wave radiation. Further, there is a growing consensus that the concept should not be used over land to explain the rainfall regime because over the continents this zone is generally ill-defined or not directly linked to precipitation. This point is made, for example, in the highly regarded climate textbook of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613489091">Barry and Chorley (2010)</xref>. For the tropical rainfall maximum over Africa, some authors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613489091">Nicholson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683613489091">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>) substitute the term ‘rain belt’ or ‘rain band’. All too often changes of climate and/or drought occurrence are incorrectly (e.g. p. 32) attributed to shifts in the location of the ITCZ. The Sahel drought is commonly linked to a weakening of the ‘rain belt’, with no latitudinal displacement.</p>
<p>This book is a very useful source on long-neglected aspects of drought. It is to be recommended to readers of <italic>The Holocene</italic>, particularly because of the excellent historical drought references. However, for information on the meteorological aspects of drought, the reader is better advised to consider basic texts, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613489091">Barry and Chorley (2010)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683613489091">Rohli and Vega (2012)</xref>.</p>
