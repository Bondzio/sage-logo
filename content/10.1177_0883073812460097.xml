<p>
<italic>Fetal Behaviour: A Neurodevelopmental Approach </italic>is a newly published text that thoroughly covers the historical development and current knowledge of fetal movements, responsiveness, and behavioral states. Because behavior provides insight into the functioning of the fetal brain, this is potentially a highly relevant topic for multiple medical specialty fields, including obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, child neurology, and developmental pediatrics. The aim of the book, as stated by the authors, is to “contribute to a standardised description of fetal behavioural patterns,” and it by all means achieves this goal.</p>
<p>The book begins by reviewing the historical evolution of methods to assess fetal behavior, which will likely provide useful background knowledge for those involved in fetal observation and monitoring. The text then proceeds with chapters detailing the development of spontaneous movements at various gestational stages, followed by a description of what is known about specific fetal behavior states (corresponding to defined behavioral states of neonates). Various types of fetal responsiveness to stimulation are then addressed, with some reflection on the implications of abnormalities in response. Last, variables affecting fetal behavior (both external exposures and inherent brain or chromosomal abnormalities) are discussed.</p>
<p>One key concept this volume conveys is that interpretation of fetal reactivity needs to take the fetus’s current behavioral state into account. This is an excellent point. Variation due to state must be considered when infants are examined shortly after birth, so logically it should also apply to at least late gestation when behavior states are relatively well developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812460097">1</xref></sup> The review of motor behavior is quite interesting and the accompanying DVD is very helpful in demonstrating the fetal movements under discussion. Given the inclusion of the excellent DVD, some of the figures in the text may be unnecessary; it is often difficult to visualize what is happening in these still pictures. In general, for better clinical relevance, many of the figures could contain more summarizing components and less detail.</p>
<p>The book provides several timelines of development for various fetal movements, forms of reactivity, and behavioral states. Although the timelines are potentially useful for understanding the sequence of events, I find myself questioning how much we can rely on the accuracy of these timelines. Throughout the book, many observations are based on information from small-case series or even single-case reports. In addition, many of the references are from several decades ago. Technology has, of course, changed drastically since the 1960s and 1970s. The book also indicates that complex general movements, thought to be the most valuable type of movement for interpretation of fetal neural function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812460097">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812460097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812460097">4</xref></sup> require well-trained observers using Gestalt perception. Therefore, the number of investigators reporting results about general movements will be necessarily limited. Also, the significance of many of the observations of fetal behavior is not yet clear. As discussed in the book’s epilogue, drastically abnormal fetuses can have apparently normal responsiveness (especially if heart rate is the primary change measured). As well, studies are lacking on either the short-term (eg, birth-related) or long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of fetuses with abnormal movements or reactivity, although neonatal and early infantile assessments of general movements do have some predictive value for cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812460097">5</xref></sup> The limited data specifically from fetal assessments impairs our ability to use any of this information to counsel families. Although this book is an excellent summary of what is known of fetal behavior, I remain uncertain about how the content can be practically applied by clinicians at this point in time.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a comprehensive and very useful reference for researchers in the field of fetal neurodevelopment. However, it is less likely to be helpful for most clinicians given our limited ability to predict outcomes based on normal and abnormal fetal behavior, let alone develop any relevant interventions.</p>
