<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Correctional heath care providers are increasingly confronted with complexities associated with the lack of adequate or accessible care for those who lack health insurance as well as an increasing number of individuals who have significant behavioral problems associated with mental illness and substance abuse. While these challenges are great, it is noteworthy that correctional health/medical programs have continued to raise the bar in not only meeting NCCHC standards of care but often surpassing community standards. In recent conversations with medical directors, wardens, and jail administrators, I have heard recognition that early intervention and access to quality care are essential elements in maintaining a secure and safe environment and in reducing long-term costs of care. Everyone agreed that good screening on intake along with frequent reviews of those who use medical services is not only preventive but also helps reduce excessive client visits, enhances the time available for physician and client interaction, and reduces the need for chronic care visits.</p>
<p> It is very noteworthy that more and more correctional systems and local jails see medical care as the key to keeping the population healthy, which allows more time to engage inmates in programs to address their needs upon release. Correctional health/medical care is at the forefront of innovation and the development of best practices that not only address the challenges within the walls but also will have practical application in the delivery of care to populations challenged by high rates of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C, social issues associated with poverty, drug/alcohol use, and mental illness. These are major challenges for both corrections and the community and both must have a seat at the table in their resolution. As a result, sheriffs and the directors of correctional systems have taken an active role in working with local health departments, hospitals, community care, and social service providers, and more recently academia by developing partnerships to address “community health care” with corrections as a major contributor and partner in care.</p>
<p> The articles in this issue, while focused on specific topics, provide some insights on interactions occurring between correctional systems and the community around reintegration of aging inmates, continuity of services for women, and reduction of HIV transmission risk on reentry, as well as bupropion diversion and misuse within facilities. Two commentaries are included. The first is about the next steps related to the community adoption of the Project START model presented in the HIV transmission risk and medication adherence article. The second was written by our colleague Dr. Joe Paris, who submitted it shortly before his death. He was very passionate about correctional medical programs moving from paper records to electronic health records. This is his perspective from his work with NCCHC.</p>
<p>I welcome your comments and suggestions.</p>
