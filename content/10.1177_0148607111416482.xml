<p><italic>Background</italic>: Home parenteral nutrition (PN) has improved the survival of children with intestinal failure. Important complications include catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion, and infection. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation in the prevention of these complications. <italic>Methods</italic>: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed of all children (0–18 years) with PN between January 1994 and March 2007 in 1 tertiary center. After introduction of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin or vitamin K antagonists in March 2007, all patients were prospectively followed until March 2010. <italic>Results</italic>: In sum, 14 patients did not receive prophylaxis; 13 switched from no prophylaxis to prophylaxis in March 2007; and 5 directly received prophylaxis. Median age of PN onset was 4 months (range, 0.1–202) in the nonprophylaxis group (n = 27) and 25 (range, 2–167) in the prophylaxis group (n = 18); 16 children received low molecular weight heparin and 2, vitamin K antagonists. Catheter-related thrombosis developed in 9 patients with no prophylaxis (33%) and 1 with prophylaxis (6%) (<italic>P</italic> = .034). Cumulative 5-year thrombosis-free survival was 48% and 93% in the nonprophylaxis and prophylaxis groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .047). Per 1,000 PN days, the nonprophylaxis and prophylaxis groups had 2.6 and 0.1 occlusions (<italic>P</italic> = .04) and 4.6 and 2.1 infections (<italic>P</italic> = .06), respectively. Cumulative infection-free survival after 3 years was 19% and 46% in the nonprophylaxis and prophylaxis groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .03). Bleeding complications did not occur. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Thromboprophylaxis significantly decreased catheter-related thrombosis and occlusion in children with PN without complications.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>At the moment, primary antithrombotic prophylaxis is not recommended in children with central venous catheters. However, the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis varies with the underlying patient population. The present study shows that in a specific patient group at risk—that is, children with home PN—prophylactic anticoagulation significantly decreases catheter-related thrombosis and occlusion and delays the time to first catheter-related infection without severe complications. These findings support current practice to use primary antithrombotic prophylaxis in these patients at risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607111416482" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PN is required when patients are suffering from intestinal failure. Most common causes of severe protracted intestinal failure include short bowel syndrome, motility disorders, and primary mucosal disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111416482">1</xref></sup> Only a small proportion of children require long-term PN, which can be administered at home. The exact incidence of children on home PN is unknown but is estimated to be 2 to 6.8 per million populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111416482">2</xref></sup> Although long-term PN has improved the prognosis for children with irreversible intestinal failure over the last decades, complications can be severe. The main complications associated with long-term use of PN are central venous catheter–related (CVC-related) thrombosis of the vessels, leading to impaired venous access, infections, and liver failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111416482">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Venous thrombosis in these patients is the result of compromised blood flow, damage to the vessel wall by the catheter and PN, and hypercoagulable states. It is associated with severe complications, including superior vena cava syndrome, pulmonary embolism, infections, and finally, loss of venous access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111416482">4</xref></sup> A retrospective cohort study in children with cancer revealed that catheter-related thrombosis is associated with a higher rate of catheter-related infection and occlusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111416482">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the measures to prevent catheter-related thrombosis is the use of systemic anticoagulation, including heparins or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In pediatric patients, only 1 study was published about the use of warfarin in the prevention of thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111416482">6</xref></sup> The efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in children with home PN has never been investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation, including LMWH, in children with home PN.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607111416482">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was an observational study. Data were collected partly retrospectively and partly prospectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111416482">
<title>Prophylactic Anticoagulant Therapy Protocol</title>
<p>From the first of January 1994 until the end of February 2007, pediatric patients with home PN did not receive prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in Emma Children’s Hospital / Academic Medical Center as a general rule. At the end of 2006, about two-thirds of the pediatric patients with home PN appeared to have been treated for at least 1 episode of symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis. At that time, adult patients with home PN received prophylactic LMWH to prevent catheter-related thrombosis in our hospital. As result of the high percentage of pediatric thrombosis, the adult anticoagulant policy was introduced in children to prevent end-stage venous loss in children with home PN. This meant that from March 2007, all known patients with home PN and a history of catheter-related thrombosis started prophylactic anticoagulation if they were not on prophylaxis already. Furthermore, known patients with home PN without a history of catheter-related thrombosis began to receive prophylactic anticoagulation at high-risk moments only, such as surgery, and long-term immobilization. Finally, after March 2007 all new patients who received their first catheter for home PN were offered to start prophylactic anticoagulation immediately.</p>
<p>As in our adult patients, the first choice was LMWH (nadroparin, once daily; starting dose, 80 IU/kg), although it has to be given subcutaneously. LMWH is preferred because VKAs demand frequent monitoring as a result of the underlying diseases seen in most patients included in this study, which result in no absorption or difficult absorption. Patients treated with nadroparin had annual measurements of anti-Xa levels, with target values of 0.1–0.3 IU/mL. As an alternative to the subcutaneous injections of nadroparin, VKAs could be used if the patient was able to take medication orally (in this case, acenocoumarol, once daily). Patients on acenocoumarol had frequent international normalized ratio measurements, with target values between 2 and 3. Annual dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in all children with home PN. Since March 2007, ultrasonography to detect asymptomatic thrombosis was performed yearly in all patients by 2 pediatric radiologists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607111416482">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between January 1, 1994, and March 31, 2010, all children between 0 and 18 years of age treated with home PN in the Emma Children’s Hospital / Academic Medical Center were included. These children were divided into 2 groups: the nonprophylaxis group and the prophylaxis group. Children who switched from no prophylaxis to prophylactic anticoagulation after introduction of the protocol were divided into the nonprophylaxis group before the switch and into the prophylaxis group after the switch. Informed consent was not obtained, as participation in this study did not involve any deviation from normal clinical practice. All patients were seen at least twice a year by 1 pediatric gastroenterologist (M.M.T.), who collected the prospective data in a database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111416482">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data about the patients before March 2007 were retrospectively collected by reviewing all medical records for age at start of PN, sex, indication of PN, PN duration, catheter type and size, catheter survival, number of catheters used, catheter-related complications (eg, thrombosis, occlusion, and infections), time to first thrombotic event, type of microorganism, and type and duration of antithrombotic therapy.</p>
<p>After introduction of the new protocol in March 2007, all patients with home PN were prospectively followed until March 2010. Clinical data forms were completed for each patient directly after each outpatient visit or hospital stay and put into a database. These data included the above-mentioned parameters, supplemented with the starting date of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, type of prophylaxis, and anticoagulant therapy-related complications, including bleeding and osteoporosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607111416482">
<title>Central Venous Catheters</title>
<p>The inserted devices consisted of subcutaneously tunneled single- or double-lumen central lines and subcutaneous ports: 2.7F for neonates and 4.2F for older children. The devices were inserted by a pediatric surgeon without guidance by ultrasonography in various veins, including jugular internal or external vein, femoral vein, saphenous vein, and subclavian vein. The tip of the catheter was placed at the junction of the superior caval vein and the right atrium, and the location of the tip was controlled by chest x-ray.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607111416482">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Efficacy outcomes were catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion, and infection and CVC survival. After developing 1 of the outcome parameters, all patients continued to be included in the study. Before start of anticoagulation, all children underwent a baseline ultrasonography of their veins. Catheter-related thrombosis was diagnosed after radiologic confirmation of clinical suspicion of venous thrombosis or during annual routine screening after start of the protocol in March 2007. Thrombosis was radiologically diagnosed when any of the peripheral veins had a noncompressible segment or there was an echogenic intraluminal thrombus or an absence of flow in the central venous system.</p>
<p>Catheter occlusion was defined as the inability to give PN due to inadequate blood flow. Catheter occlusion was considered a possible symptom of catheter-related thrombosis. If catheter occlusion occurred, an ultrasonography was performed to diagnose or exclude catheter-related thrombosis. Catheter occlusion was consecutively treated by local installation of sodium chloride 0.9%, unfractionated heparin (100 U/mL), sodium hydroxide (0.1N), or urokinase (5000 U/mL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111416482">7</xref></sup> If catheter patency was not reestablished after installation of these 4 solutions for at least 1 hour, the catheter was removed. Catheter-related infection was defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria for laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111416482">8</xref></sup> CVC survival was described as number of CVCs per 1,000 PN days.</p>
<p>Safety outcomes were bleeding complications and BMD. Major bleeding was identified as (1) fatal bleeding; (2) clinically overt bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L (ie, 2 g/dL) in a 24-hour period; (3) bleeding that was retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involved the central nervous system; and (4) bleeding that required surgical intervention in an operating suite. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was defined by either of the following: (1) overt bleeding for which blood product was administered and not directly attributable to the patient’s underlying medical condition or (2) bleeding that required medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating suite. Minor bleeding was defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that did not fulfill the aforementioned criteria for either major bleeding or clinically relevant, nonmajor bleeding.</p>
<p>BMD was measured by DXA, using the Hologic QDR x-ray bone densitometer. Before the BMD measurement, the children’s height and weight were measured; then, BMD was assessed at the lumbar vertebrae L1 to L4. The results were expressed as a <italic>Z</italic> score for age, sex, and ethnicity according to the reference data given by the Hologic software. Data are expressed as <italic>Z</italic> scores. In children, low bone mass for chronologic age was defined as a <italic>Z</italic> score ≤ –2 according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111416482">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0148607111416482">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Differences between groups were evaluated by Student <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for continuous data, depending on the normality of data, and by Fisher exact test for categoric data. Survival curves for the time to first thrombotic event, first catheter occlusion, and first catheter-related infection were prepared with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the use of a 2-sided log-rank test. Follow-up data were censored at the end of the study (March 2010), at the time of death, or at the cessation of home PN. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>In this study, 32 pediatric patients requiring PN were included. Fourteen patients did not receive prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, and 5 patients directly started with prophylaxis after initiation of home PN. Thirteen patients switched from no prophylaxis to prophylaxis, 3 of whom had already started prophylactic anticoagulation before March 2007 because of recurrent catheter-related thrombi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111416482">Figure 1</xref>). The basic characteristics of the patients in the nonprophylaxis and prophylaxis groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111416482">Table 1</xref>. There were no differences in these characteristics between the groups. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy consisted of nadroparin in 16 patients and acenocoumarol in 2 patients; these 2 patients received acenocoumarol instead of nadroparin on parents’ request to avoid subcutaneous injections. One patient had home PN because of cystic fibrosis and the other because of a chronic intestinal infection with <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> due to interleukin-10 deficiency. After March 2007, parents of 1 patient refused to start with both LMWH and VKA because of the subcutaneous injections and frequent international normalized ratio measurements. No patients were lost to follow-up.</p>

<title>Safety Outcomes</title>
<p>In this study 5 children died as result of their underlying disease. No bleeding complications occurred in patients treated with LMWH or VKA. In total, 15 of the 32 children underwent DXA scans to evaluate BMD. In 1 patient, DXA scans were performed with and without prophylactic anticoagulation. In the other children, DXA scans were not possible because of young age. In 7 of the 27 patients in the nonprophylaxis group (<italic>Z</italic> score, –2.0 ± 0.2), DXA scans showed normal BMD in 4 children and BMD reduction in 3 children. Follow-up DXA scans revealed increased BMD in 3 patients, decreased BMD in 2 patients, and identical BMD in 2 patients. The BMD was too low in 4 patients compared with their peer groups. In 9 of the 18 patients in the prophylaxis group, DXA scans were performed after a median time of 1.8 years (range, 0.4–4.2) between start of prophylaxis and first DXA scan. The <italic>Z</italic> score of these children was −2.1 ± 0.5. In 5 children with LMWH, DXA scans showed low BMD. Normal BMD was present in 3 children with LMWH and 1 child with VKA. Follow-up DXA scans showed no change in BMD in 2 patients on LMWH prophylaxis and in 1 patient on VKA prophylaxis, with all having normal BMDs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of prophylactic anticoagulation (LMWH or VKA) in children with home PN significantly decreased the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis and occlusion. Furthermore, it significantly delayed the time to a first episode of catheter-related infection. The frequency of bleeding was not increased with the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Effects on BMD could not be reliably established, because of the small sample size.</p>
<p>PN is a lifesaving treatment for children with intestinal failure. Nevertheless, complications, including catheter-related thrombosis and infection, can be severe and even life threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111416482">10</xref></sup> For this reason, it is crucial to identify measures to reduce these complications. The insertion place or the type of catheter may be of importance. Male et al showed that catheter placement on the right side of the upper venous system and in the jugular vein may reduce risk for catheter-related thrombosis in pediatric cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111416482">11</xref></sup> Additionally, the risk of thrombosis seemed to be higher with the use of external catheters compared with implantable ports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111416482">12</xref></sup> The various brands of CVCs in various periods made evaluation of complications associated with different types impossible in the present study. Many studies have shown that complication rates are lower when PN is administered at home instead of in the hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111416482">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, centralization of patients, resulting in high-volume centers, might improve care because of the presence of a nutrition support team and a great number of skilled surgeons and gastroenterologists with a broader base of experience and knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111416482">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111416482">15</xref></sup> Emma Children’s Hospital / Academic Medical Center is a specialized center with a multidisciplinary nutrition team for home PN. In the Netherlands, most patients with home PN are referred to this center for further educational counseling, guidance, and treatment.</p>
<p>Despite of intensive training and guidance by a specialized center, complications still occur frequently with home PN. In the literature, the reported frequency of pediatric catheter-related thrombosis varied from 7%–75% and was higher when systematic screening was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111416482">4</xref></sup> The efficacy and safety of prophylactic anticoagulation have been studied in adults and children with PN. Klerk et al showed that unfractionated heparin added to PN in adult patients did not reduce the incidence of thrombosis significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111416482">16</xref></sup> However, catheters were not tunneled, and the maximum observation period was 94 days. In 47 patients with HIV/AIDS and home PN, 1 mg of warfarin did not change thrombosis rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111416482">17</xref></sup> However, Bern et al gave 2 mg of warfarin to 23 adult patients on home PN, and the incidence of thrombosis was 1 in 1,617 catheter days compared to 1 in 251 days before initiation of warfarin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111416482">18</xref></sup> Veerabagu et al showed that therapeutic warfarin de-creased the thrombosis rate from 1 in 13 patient months to 1 in 184 patient months in those with home PN and 1 thrombotic event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111416482">19</xref></sup> Monagle et al revealed that in 8 children on home PN for short bowel syndrome, warfarin increased the duration of CVC patency, from 161 days before warfarin to 351 days after start of warfarin. New thrombotic events and bleeding did not occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111416482">6</xref></sup> In our center, LMWH is preferred because it needs less frequent monitoring, can be given subcutaneously, and does not need an intact gut for absorption. For children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Mitchell et al showed that LMWH may help to prevent catheter-related thrombosis in the high-risk groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111416482">20</xref></sup> However, the disadvantage of LMWH is the subcutaneous administration, which can be a burden for children and parents. In our cohort, parents of 3 children refused to give their children subcutaneous injections. Two children got acenocoumarol instead of LMWH.</p>
<p>Infection is an important CVC-related complication. In the literature, the incidence of CVC-related infections varies from 1 to 4 per 1,000 PN days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111416482">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111416482">22</xref></sup> Several pediatric studies showed that thromboprophylaxis decreases CVC-related infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111416482">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111416482"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111416482">25</xref></sup> In the present study, prophylactic anticoagulation delayed time to first catheter-related infection but did not significantly decrease the incidence of infections per 1,000 PN days. Prophylactic anticoagulation, however, significantly decreased the number of occlusions per 1,000 PN days. This meant less disruption of PN administration and fewer hospitalizations for restoration of catheter function with local instillation of thrombolytic agents or catheter replacements.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. First, this study was not a randomized controlled trial comparing prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. It was a small cohort study of 32 children, including 13 who switched from no prophylaxis to prophylaxis. These children were older in the prophylaxis group, with larger vessels that might have developed less thrombi. Second, some children with no prophylaxis were treated in the 1990s with less modern diagnostic methods, medical treatment, and surgical procedures, which might have led to more complications. Third, DXA scans were not performed in all patients, because of the young age of many patients. The effect of anticoagulants on BMD should therefore be monitored cautiously. Finally, data collection before March 2007 was performed retrospectively, causing missing data. Yet, this probably underestimated the number of catheter-related thrombi, occlusions, and infections. It is striking that none of the 5 infants who started with LMWH from the beginning developed catheter-related thrombosis after a mean PN duration of 13 months.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this cohort study showed that prophylactic LMWH or VKA prevented catheter-related thrombosis and occlusions in children with home PN and can be administered safely in children of all ages. As a result of the low number of patients with home PN, a randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings, one that is international and multicenter.</p>
