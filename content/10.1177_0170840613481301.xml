<title>Deadline for paper submissions: September 2013</title>
<p>Once a fringe concern for organization scholars, largely of interest to community and social movement scholars, the study of social networks has taken centre-stage across a range of disciplines, from physics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840613481301">Newman, Barabasi, &amp; Watts, 2006</xref>) to economics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613481301">Jackson, 2008</xref>). This explosion in popularity is perhaps nowhere more visible than in the field of management where network research has already generated a “large research tradition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613481301">Brass, Galaskiewicz, Greve, &amp; Tsai, 2004</xref>: 809).</p>
<p>Research interested in the dynamically complex nature of networks is attracting increasing attention – As seen with the special issue of Organization Science in 2008. The dynamism of social networks constitutes “the new social morphology of our societies … power of flows takes precedence over the flows of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840613481301">Castells, 1996</xref>:500). Informed by Castells, we can say that we live in a a network society, but also that it is a network society of increasingly networked organizations. With advances in technologies, networks are constantly changing and co-evolving, presenting agential properties that make them significant social actants.</p>
<p>Networks are powerful carriers of new social norms, values and practices that contribute to innovative institutionalization. In this sense, networks can be tools to influence context, corresponding to the practices of network entrepreneurs. By creating and generating new flows through networks they create and maintain a contextual situation favourable to their objectives. But even in such flows, networks are still often considered as inert and invariant diffusion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840613481301">Owen-Smith &amp; Powell, 2008</xref>). While networks are inherently dynamic, their connections are not always positive – they can become a liability, due to shifts in the environment; conversely, they can show unexpected relevance, leading to innovation and transformations, be it organizational, inter-organizational or social, as events shape their relevance and acuity. Transformation initially encouraged by an actor or actors through networks can become a threat, creating resistance and counter-resistance.</p>
<p>Networks, therefore, are not as manageable or as predictable as some organization theorists might suggest, and research on the management of network dynamics is underdeveloped. There is valid reason for this lack of knowledge: network transformation is a complex phenomenon and its measurement and analysis – let alone the challenges of collecting longitudinal network data – pose many problems, both technical and conceptual (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840613481301">Doreian &amp; Stokman, 2005</xref>). New insight can therefore be gained by considering networks as agential actors, and not only as structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613481301">Keck and Sikkink, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840613481301">Kahler, 2009</xref>). Organizations often fail in network transformations because they tend to stick to the illusion that networks are instrumental webs that provide reliable and stable access to resources and manageable and predictable innovations. They thus neglect the power of networks and their transformative force as social actants. From political resistance in totalitarian states to communities of consumers, networks have always been core in shifting the flows of power.</p>
<p>The purpose of this special issue is to understand the organizational and societal implications of social networks in action. Our goal is to publish thoughtful and provocative papers that advance our ability to conceptualize, measure, manage and advise network emergence and evolution within and across organizational boundaries, as well as to assess the impact of such networks on society. Although our aim is to be broadly inclusive, we are especially interested in papers that advance understanding of the management of network dynamics and resulting power relations within and between organizations. We invite contributions from organizational scholars, irrespective of their theoretical or methodological orientation, that cover questions such as the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0170840613481301" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How do actors (be they individuals, groups, or organizations) envision and manage the evolving agential properties of social networks to achieve desired ends?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the potential risks and rewards when managing network dynamics? Can network dynamics be managed at all?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do actors react to attempts to appropriate or alter their networks? What forms does resistance take and what are its consequences and dynamics?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the ethics in practice of network management?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the consequences of network changes at one level of analysis for outcomes at other levels of analysis? For example, what are the interaction effects of network boundaries?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does a formal interorganizational network influence the emergence and evolution of informal networks, and how do the two co-evolve over time?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do new forms of networks shift the flows of power in organizations and society? How can we better understand shifts of power and development of resistance from a network perspective?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do practices within networks, and evolving network practices contribute to organizational innovation and more broadly to the introduction of innovative practices in society?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This list of questions is clearly suggestive rather than exhaustive. Again, we welcome submissions irrespective of their disciplinary or methodological orientation as long as they are consistent with our broad goal of advancing our understanding of the management of network dynamics and its impact on society.</p>
