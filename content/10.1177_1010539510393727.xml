<abstract>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer. This study examined the prevalence of cervical HPV infection and the distribution of HPV specific types among married women in Hanoi to provide updated data for planning cancer preventive activities. Sample of 750 married women aged 15 to 69 years were interviewed and had gynecological examination. HPV infection status and HPV genotyping tests were done for all participants. Results indicated that the prevalence of cervical HPV infection in among married women in Hanoi was 6.13%. The 5 most common HPV types among Hanoi population were HPV 16, HPV 18, HPV 58, HPV 81, and HPV 45. HPV prevalence was higher among younger ages. The proportion of women infected with high-risk HPV accounted for 91.3% of the positive cases. As HPV infection is associated with cervical cancer, steps should be taken for cervical cancer screening and treatment for Hanoi population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women with about 529 409 new cases and 274 883 deaths annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510393727">1</xref></sup> Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Vietnam, accounting for approximately 6000 new cases and 2500 deaths per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510393727">2</xref></sup> The cervical cancer rate in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, has been increasing steady in the recent years, despite the government’s effort to reduce the cancer burden. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the causes of cervical cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510393727">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510393727">4</xref></sup> On average, over their lifetime, 8 of 10 women will have a chance to be infected with HPV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510393727">5</xref></sup> Most HPV infections occur without any symptoms and go away without any treatment over the course of 2 years. However, in some women, HPV infection sometimes persists for many years and may or may not increase their risk of developing cervical cancer depending on the type of HPV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510393727">6</xref></sup> Infections with low-risk types, such as HPV types 6 and 11, can cause benign or low-grade changes in cells of the cervix, genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical, anal, and other genital cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510393727">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510393727">7</xref></sup> High-risk HPV types are detected in 99% of cervical cancers, and worldwide approximately 70% of cervical cancers are due to HPV types 16 and 18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393727">8</xref></sup> Vaccines against HPV types 16 and 18 are now available in some big cities, such as Hanoi, in Vietnam. However, before implementing the HPV vaccine campaigns to prevent cervical cancer in Hanoi, we need to have updated data on the prevalence and the distribution of specific types of HPV among general women population in Hanoi. Some unpublished studies in Vietnam have revealed the HPV prevalence in women with cervical cancer, but so far, no updated data has been published for the general population. This research presents the prevalence of cervical HPV infection as well as the distribution of HPV specific types among married women population in Hanoi in 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539510393727" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The survey was conducted in Hoan Kiem District of Hanoi, among married women aged 15to 65 years. The survey sample was calculated using the formula estimating a population proportion with specified relative precision. Thus, with the anticipated prevalence of HPV of 0.9%, relative precision of 20%, and nonrespondent rate of 10%, the estimated sample size was 850. The reason for including only married women in this survey was because it was difficult to invite unmarried women to participate. At first, 850 women were randomly from the list of all married women aged 15 years or older living in the survey area (this list was generated from family planning clinics). Health workers visited these selected women at home to (<italic>a</italic>) check for exclusion criteria, (<italic>b</italic>) explain study purpose, and (<italic>c</italic>) obtain a written consent form from those who agreed to participate in this study. The selection criteria were women who (<italic>a</italic>) were not pregnant, (<italic>b</italic>) had not undergone a hysterectomy or conization, and (<italic>c</italic>) were not mentally impaired.</p>
<p>The response rate of our study was 88.2%, resulting in a sample of 750 women. The study protocol was reviewed and cleared by the Ethical Committee of Hanoi School of Public Health. Information and specimen collection was done through the following steps. First, a personal interview was done to collect information on sociodemographic variables, obstetric/gynecologic history, and sexual lifestyle. After interviewing, each participant was scheduled for a pelvic examination carried out by a gynecologist. Samples of exfoliated cells from the ectocervix were collected with 2 wooden Ayre spatulas and from the endocervix with a cytobrush. Samples of exfoliated cells were sent to the laboratory of Vietnam National Institute of Dermatology for HPV test on the same day of the sample collection.</p>
<p>The HPV genotyping protocol includes 4 steps. The first step is to receive and treat samples using cotton swab and storage solution. The second step is to extract HPV DNA using DNA extraction kit based on phenol/chloroform. The third step is to use the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit (Light Power iVA HPV PCR kit, Viet A Corporation, Hanoi, Vietnam) to detect HPV DNA using TaqMan probe. Step 4, genotype by reverse dot blot, was applied for all the HPV-positive samples detected in step 3 using the Light Power iVA HPV Genotype RDB kit. This kit allows the detection of 24 HPV genotypes by reverse dot blot (ie, low-risk, 6, 11, 42, 43, 61, 70, 71, 81 and high-risk, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 82).</p>

<title>HPV Prevalence</title>
<p>Of the 750 women in the sample, 46 women were infected with HPV accounting for 6.13% of the sample. Among 46 HPV-positive cases, 38 cases (82.6%) were infected with a single HPV type, and 8 cases were infected with more than 1 HPV type. The proportion of multiple HPV infection in women younger than 30 years was 40% whereas that among women aged 30 years and older was 20%. Most of the cases with multiple HPV infection were infected with 2 types of HPV, and only 1 case was infected with 3 types of HPV.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539510393727">Figure 1</xref> shows the prevalence of HPV infection and 95% confident interval by age group. We can see that the prevalence of HPV infection was highest among the youngest age group (&lt;30 years), and this prevalence seemed to decrease when age increased, with the exception of age group 50 years and older. However, it should be noted that as the sample size for age 50 years and older was quite small (only 68 women), the estimated prevalence for this age group may not be precise as for other age groups (95% confident interval for this age group was wider compared with that for other age groups).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The prevalence of cervical HPV infection in the general women population in Hanoi reported in this study was higher (6.13% vs 2.3%) because of 2 reasons: (<italic>a</italic>) the previous study was done in a periurban district and this study was done in a central urban district of Hanoi and (<italic>b</italic>) over 10 years, HPV infection may have become more common in Hanoi population as data also showed that the prevalence of cervical cancer in Hanoi increased significantly over time. The increasing trend of HPV prevalence over time could be reconfirmed through the difference of HPV prevalence across age groups as this prevalence seemed to be higher among younger age groups.</p>
<p>A broad spectrum of HPV types was reported in this study with the most common types being HPV 16 and 18; this finding was similar to that of previous studies in Vietnam and other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510393727">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510393727">11</xref></sup> Currently, some health organizations are considering 2 types of HPV vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (Cervarix made by GlaxoSmithKline and Gardasil made by Merck).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510393727">12</xref></sup> Cervarix protects against only HPV types 16 and 18 whereas vaccine Gardasil also protects against HPV types 6 and 11. Because among Hanoi population, no case was infected with HPV 6 and only 1 case was infected with HPV 11, vaccine Cervarix may be more suitable than vaccine Gardasil. It should be noted that none of the currently available vaccines can protect against the HPV type 58 (ie, high risk); 19% HPV positive cases in Hanoi were infected with this type. Other studies also reported that HPV 58 was among the most common types found in cervical cancer specimens in China, Thailand, and the Philippines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510393727">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The findings of this study came from one district of Hanoi and therefore, caution must be taken in generalizing these findings to all Vietnam population, especially to rural population. However, all the estimation yielded from this study should provide a representative indicator of Hanoi city because we had followed a very strict protocol to avoid biases: Women were randomly chosen, all clinical examinations and specimen collections were done by qualified gynecologists, and all the samples were examined by a national qualified laboratory. In conclusion, an increasing trend of HPV infection was observed in this study. As HPV infection has high correlation with cervical cancer, appropriate steps should be taken for cervical cancer screening and treatment in the Hanoi population.</p>
