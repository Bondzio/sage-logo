<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To evaluate the reliability and validity of a Chinese Mandarin version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Cross-sectional.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: A rehabilitation centre for adults.</p>
<p><bold>Participants</bold>: Sixty-one elderly people living in the community.</p>
<p><bold>Main outcome measure</bold>: Self-efficacy in balancing ability was assessed via a Mandarin Chinese version of the ABC Scale.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The intraclass correlation coefficients for test–retest and inter-rater reliability of the Chinese Mandarin version of the ABC Scale were 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–0.99) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94–0.98), respectively. The Cronbach’s α coefficient of internal consistency was 0.94. In the Bland–Altman analysis the mean difference in the ABC test–retest scores was −1.81, and the 95% limits of agreement varied from −10.67 to 7.03. The evaluation of inter-rater reliability showed that the mean difference was −1.13, and the 95% limits of agreement varied from −9.55 to 7.30. The factor analysis method was adopted to assess the validity of the scaled activities and two factors contributed to total variance at 52.5% and 13.6%, respectively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Falls are common in the aged population and can lead to physical injuries such as bone fractures and head injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511427748">1</xref></sup> Falls in aged people may also result in a fear of falling, a severe psychological problem that may limit confidence, mobility and social interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511427748">2</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown that fear of falling can exist in aged people both with and without a history of falling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511427748">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511427748">4</xref></sup> The reported incidence of this fear in aged people ranges from 20% to 92%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511427748">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511427748">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511427748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511427748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511427748">8</xref></sup> and may contribute to activity restriction, physical decline, depression and possible nursing home admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511427748">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511427748">10</xref></sup> The incidence of falls is strongly associated with the severity of the fear itself,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511427748">11</xref></sup> and proper psychological interventions can lessen this fear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511427748">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427748">13</xref></sup> Therefore the accurate assessment of fear of falling is of great importance.</p>
<p>The aim of the routine evaluation of fear of falling is to assess the patient’s fall-related self-efficacy, that is, the patient’s personal belief in his or her ability to engage in certain activities of daily living without falling or losing balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511427748">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427748">15</xref></sup> Fall-related self-efficacy, or balance confidence, was conceptualized as a specialized form of self-efficacy by Tinetti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511427748">14</xref></sup> Powell and Myers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427748">15</xref></sup> further theorized that reduced confidence in one’s ability to maintain balance while performing specific tasks may result in behaviour avoidance which could lead to a sedentary lifestyle, and ultimately to an increase risk of falling .</p>
<p>At present, the degree of fear of falling can be assessed by several instruments, including the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511427748">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511427748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511427748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511427748">19</xref></sup> The ABC Scale was developed in 1995 by Powell and Myers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427748">15</xref></sup> and became popular due to its rational design and customizable implementation; it assesses fear of falling by evaluating subjective balance confidence in ambulatory, community-dwelling older people. This instrument has been successfully demonstrated in Chinese populations in both Hong Kong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511427748">20</xref></sup> and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511427748">21</xref></sup> However, there has been no report of a study utilizing the ABC method for a mainland Chinese population. Given that there are significant differences in culture among the Chinese populations of mainland China, Hong Kong and Canada, the objective of the present study was to translate the ABC Scale into a Chinese Mandarin version and assess its reliability and validity with aged Chinese people on the mainland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511427748" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The Human Research Ethics Committee of our institute approved this study. Community-dwelling older persons were recruited through posters in doctors’ offices at Shanghai Ganquan Yi Chuan Community Centre, China. In all, 61 elderly people participated in the study. Criteria for inclusion and exclusion were based on those of a study that evaluated a different version of the ABC conducted by Schepens et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511427748">22</xref></sup> All participants were conscious, able to stand bipedally for 30 seconds or more and signed written forms of experimental consent. None of the subjects had postural hypotension, visual impairment, vestibular dysfunction (a balance disorder), or severe cardiopulmonary or bone diseases that could affect motor or balance functions.</p>
<p>The subjects were divided randomly into two groups, one for the test–retest reliability study (<italic>n</italic> = 31), and the other for the inter-rater reliability study (<italic>n</italic> = 30). The ABC test was taken at Tongji Hospital, in a quiet room in the rehabilitation centre. An assessor gave each subject instructions for filling out the test form, after which the subject filled in the form independently. The subjects were re-tested after three weeks. For the test–retest reliability study, a single assessor administered the ABC Scale on two separate occasions to each subject. For the inter-rater reliability study, one trained assessor administered the ABC Scale on the first occasion and another administered the scale on the second occasion. Each was blinded to the results of the other assessors.</p>
<p>The Mandarin Chinese version of the ABC Scale was translated from the original ABC Scale, with additional reference to a Cantonese version,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511427748">20</xref></sup> by three professional researchers, and included modifications based on the daily lifestyles of the mainland Chinese population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511427748">Figure 1</xref>). These versions were back-translated into English by the same professional researchers.</p>

</fig>
<p>There were major changes in three of the original items: (1) item 3 (bending over to pick up a slipper from the floor in front of a closet) was changed to item 3 (bending over to pick up a slipper from the ground), as few Chinese people store slippers in closets; (2) item 8 (walking outside the house to a car parked in the driveway) was changed to item 8 (taking a taxi); and (3) item 9 (getting into or out of a car) was changed to item 9 (taking and getting down from the bus), as taxis and buses are the common forms of transportation for the elderly in China.</p>
<p>The ABC Scale includes 16 items, based on the daily lives of aged people. Each item was scored from 0 to 100 points with a total of 11 levels. The 0 point level indicates having no faith at all, a score of 50 means generally confident, and 100 indicates having full confidence. The mean score for all items represents the final score. The time required for the questionnaire is 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for statistical analyses. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to examine the test–retest reliability and inter-rater reliability. By calculating Cronbach’s α coefficient, the reliability of internal consistency of the scale was analysed. Limits of agreement were evaluated using the Bland–Altman method for the ABC total score. This method plots differences between two measurements against the average of the two measurements. The 95% limits of agreement were calculated as the mean difference ± 1.96 × standard deviation of the difference. Construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis. Finally, the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine the validity of discrimination efficiency.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty-one elderly people were included, ages ranging from 60 to 88 years old (mean (SD) age, 76.3 (7.5) years). There were 26 (43%) males and 35 (57%) females. Ten (16%) of them needed aids for outdoor activities, 13 (21%) had a history of falling within the past six months and 48 (79%) had no history of falling. The mean (SD) score for all subjects was 74.6 (12.4). The first item (walking around the house) had the highest scores, at 94.2 points. The lowest score was 45.7 points (walking on an icy road). The scores for each item are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511427748">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Reliability of the Chinese Mandarin version of the ABC Scale</title>
<p>The intraclass correlation coefficient for the test–retest reliability of the ABC Scale was 0.98, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.96–0.99, with individual items ranging from 0.76 to 0.92 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511427748">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that our modified ABC Scale has good test–retest reliability.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that the Chinese version of the ABC Scale has good reliability. Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.94, which is similar to the original and Cantonese version. The intraclass correlation coefficient values of the test–retest and inter-rater reliability evaluations for both the total test score and that of individual items were above 0.70, suggesting that our modification of the scale preserved reliability. In the Bland–Altman analysis, good consistency of measurements was observed (only one point was out of the range of the mean differences ± 1.96 × SD, and the mean differences were both near zero), which indicated that the scale has good test–retest and inter-rater reliability.</p>
<p>In the factor analysis, two factors were extracted, accounting for 66.1% variance: the first factor included most items, with a cumulative variance of 52.5%, and the second factor included the four items with the highest scores, contributing to 13.6% variance. The original study in which the ABC Scale was developed by Powell and Myers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427748">15</xref></sup> did not include a statistical verification of validity. And for the Cantonese version of the ABC by Mak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511427748">20</xref></sup> only one factor was extracted. One possible explanation is that our study employed relatively small populations, or that there were differences among these populations. For instance, in the study with the Cantonese version of the ABC Scale, among 100 subjects 37 needed aids for outdoor activities (37%) and 17 needed assistance devices for indoor activities. In the present study, only 10 out of 61 (16.4%) enrolees needed aids for indoor or outdoor activities, and most of them could come to the rehabilitation centre independently. This may be the reason that questions regarding activities that require less balance received higher scores.</p>
<p>The current study showed that among 16 activities, walking around the house, sweeping the floor, and getting something from a shelf at eye level, scored significantly higher than the other items – more than 90 points. These three items are indoor events, which require less ability to move or balance – therefore aged people have more confidence in their ability to perform these activities.</p>
<p>In the 25th percentile analysis, the 5th, 6th, and 11th to 16th items scored ≤60 points, while the rest were ≥70. A previous study showed that subjects with scores below 67 on the ABC Scale were associated with an increased chance of falling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511427748">23</xref></sup> This suggests, therefore, that the 5th, 6th, and 11th to 16th activities of the questionnaire might be helpful in predicting incidences of falling. Peretz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511427748">24</xref></sup> conducted an ABC 25th percentile analysis that evaluated patients with Parkinson’s disease or higher level gait disorders and who had a high incidence of falls. In these patients the 5th, 6th, and 13th to 16th items received the lowest scores. This is consistent with the results of the present study. Based on the assumption that these items could most reliably reflect the incidence of falls, the authors shortened the ABC Scale into a further modified version containing only the original 5th, 6th, and 13th to 16th items. Whether this shortened version would be feasible in applying the ABC Scale to Chinese mainland populations is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In our results the aged people with a fall history had significantly lower ABC scores than those who had no fall history, which is consistent with previous reports that the occurrence of a fall has a huge psychological impact on aged people.</p>
<p>Our study may be limited by the number of participants, which was relatively small, and also because the study population was quite healthy. In the future we would add to the number of participants and recruit a greater percentage of elderly persons with limited motor activities.</p>
<p>In summary, our study showed that the Chinese Mandarin version of the ABC Scale has good reliability and validity, and is consistent with the lifestyles of mainland China. It would be suitable for assessing balance confidence in aged populations in mainland China.</p>
