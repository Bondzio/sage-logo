<p>The family is collapsing. So is community and, for that matter, civil society. Or so journalists and sociologists warn. ABC News and <italic>USA Today</italic> are quick to print stories based on such claims, beginning with those familiar anecdotes from Joe or Jane who capture our attention and validate the studies by telling us how alone and lonely they feel. A <italic>New York Times</italic> headline, picked up by many other newspapers and blog sites, trumpets “The Lonely American Just Got a Bit Lonelier.”</p>
<p>Two new books, one by Claude Fischer and one by Eric Klinenberg, both start with a set of observations that would seem, at first, to support this view of increasing isolation—in Klinenberg’s case the stunning increase in the number of people who live alone, and in Fischer’s case the reported reduction in the number of confidantes Americans turn to. Yet, for neither is the evidence quite what it seems and both wind up arguing that connections—both to family or friends—are very much with us. Both show that the apparent increase of social isolation masks a remarkable persistence of social ties. Fischer argues that Americans are still deeply intertwined with spouses and children as well as other relatives, neighbors, and friends. And, as Klinenberg makes abundantly clear, living alone is not the same as being alone or lonely.</p>
<p>Although Fischer and Klinenberg end up in similar places, they get there by different routes. Fischer emphasizes the continuing sway of family; Klinenberg emphasizes the draw of living separately. Klinenberg argues that the broad social trends—the rise in women’s employment and longevity, the decline in marriage, divorce, and fertility, as well as the spread of new technology, especially the internet—are the engines of change for social connections. In contrast, Fischer suggests that although we might expect these trends to have changed social connections, they have not.</p>
<p>The two books also use very different kinds of data and methods: Fischer’s brief book is loaded with graphs and tables. Klinenberg relies on quotes and life stories. Examining a number of national data sets collected over the last four decades, Fischer looks at the social connections with family and friends. Klinenberg, relying on the statistical reports of others, his own fieldwork, and over 300 intensive interviews—all with people in big cities—focuses on how more and more people of all ages are living alone as “singletons” (his label for those who live alone, used to distinguish them from “singles” who sometimes live with partners, roommates, or children).</p>
<p>In <italic>Still Connected: Family and Friends in America since 1970</italic>, Claude Fischer provides an account of the manifold ways in which we have remained engaged with family and friends from 1970 to 2010. In some sense he is continuing the agenda of his important 1982 work, <italic>To Dwell among Friends.</italic> But that book is comparative, highlighting the differences between the personal relationships of those in small towns to those in big cities. There, Fischer emphasized the way urban life transforms community but does so by showing the ways urbanites are more involved with loosely connected friends while small towners are more engaged with dense networks of kin. In this new book, he generalizes: social ties of all sorts persist despite many developments that might lead us to expect otherwise.</p>
<p><italic>Still Connected</italic> is insistently and admirably cautious. Fischer uses a number of national data sets to check and recheck his argument. Rather than trying to legitimate or even cover up some limit of the data, he often discusses what he calls its “thinness,” addressing the ways that better data might alter one argument or another. He writes repeatedly of problems with the survey questions he used and points out the enormous difficulty entailed in studying changes in social ties over time, given a reliance on questions whose wording and placement often changes with each new survey, on cross sectional studies separated by a number of years without reference to what happened in those years, and on survey questions that all too often combine different groups, like relatives and non-relatives, even though he wants to look at each separately.</p>
<p><italic>Still Connected</italic> is insistently descriptive. As Fischer himself writes: “The question driving this book is descriptive: how did Americans’ relationships change over forty years? Explaining why changes occurred—or did not occur—is another, more complex task. . . the focus of this book is on the ‘what’ not the ‘why’” (p. 23). For the most part, he leaves a discussion of explanations to his concluding chapter and there only devotes a few pages to them. (It is, to be sure, difficult to explain the absence of change.) Though claiming to be only descriptive, Fischer is nonetheless in some sense addressing a key theoretical issue, about the association of modern life and social integration that was also the focus of his earlier book.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his caution, Fischer quite convincingly shows that notwithstanding demographic changes and technological developments, Americans still manage to visit, talk, and help others about as much as they did before such changes occurred. Here, Fischer is continuing a debate he had in the pages of the <italic>American Sociological Review</italic> where he criticized Miller McPherson and his colleagues for suggesting that many Americans are now so isolated that they have no one with whom to share important matters. Fischer shows that the percent of social isolates is “virtually nil” and the number has remained about the same over the past four decades. Moreover, Americans now see relatives as often, maybe their mothers even a little more; they talk more to friends, both in person and virtually, than they did in the 1970s. And their feelings about these connections have changed little as well. Americans experience no more loneliness and maybe even less. They still value family life, even three-generation households which have continued to rise since Fischer wrote this book. They feel close to the same number of people. He not only looks at social supports, he also looks at connections that are burdensome. And here, too, he finds little change. To be sure there is occasional movement: for example, families do not eat together at home as much as they did decades ago, probably because mothers do not cook as much. But families eat together at similar rates—they just do it in restaurants rather than at home. And they spend less time with their spouses—albeit probably more with their children.</p>
<p>In this short book, Fischer does not address variation by class, gender, race, or even geographic location. Instead, he paints a monolithic picture of social connections. Over and over, the news he reports is that ties have stayed the same. A reader might find this astonishing given that more and more women have jobs, people live longer, delay and leave marriages, have babies outside of those marriages, use the internet—recipes, one might think, for the decline of community. Yet, Fisher tells us there has been no decline of community, no decline of connections. It is a stunning finding, convincing and broad in its implications. In this short book, Fischer has a more modest agenda than he had in <italic>To Dwell among Friends</italic>. But it is an agenda he executes effectively.</p>
<p>Eric Klinenberg’s <italic>Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone</italic>, is also in some sense a sequel—to his book, <italic>Heat Wave</italic>, where he discussed the hundreds of people who died alone in the 1995 Chicago disaster when temperatures soared over 100 degrees. Most of those who died were men, disproportionately African American, who lived alone in abandoned, decaying neighborhoods, out of contact with family and neighbors. Klinenberg was then concerned with social disaster and isolation. But this piqued his interest in broader patterns of living alone in big cities. In <italic>Going Solo</italic>, he comes to understand that most of those who live alone are neither isolated nor lonely. He emphasizes instead the ways in which these singletons have contributed to a lively public life, by volunteering, eating out, visiting and emailing friends, and refurbishing those abandoned apartments, streets, and parks.</p>
<p><italic>Going Solo</italic> is at its core comparative. Although he does not examine those who reside with others, Klinenberg portrays variation among those living alone—between women and men, blacks and whites, middle class and poor, those of different ages. The experience of living alone varies dramatically—with those younger and more affluent (who mostly populate the first substantive chapters) enjoying a “second adolescence” and reporting they chose and like living by themselves contrasted to the poor, many African Americans, and the very old (who are the subjects of the penultimate chapters) who more often suffer the costs of solo living.</p>
<p>Occasionally, as I read the early chapters, I thought Klinenberg romanticized or at least overstated the wondrous lives of young and affluent women and men who go solo, and I would have liked to see some comparison to those who share homes. But just at the point when my skepticism peaked, he would turn to some ambivalence or cost, while maintaining the general tone of positive regard for those who chose to spend their youth or middle age without others in their homes. While many have emphasized the economic and emotional benefits of marriage, Klinenberg’s middle chapter begins with the story of one divorced woman who says “marriage is fucking boring” (p. 91), even if she, like others divorced, feels an occasional pang of loneliness or worries about her future. The latter chapter on the elderly is far more measured, recounting the difficulties of getting old without someone nearby. But even here he shows us that getting old together is not for the weak. Especially for women who act as caregivers for their often older, disabled husbands, Klinenberg suggests sharing a home might even be a greater hardship than going it alone. Older solo women, until themselves seriously disabled, play bridge, meet for coffee, and go to the park with other older women and an occasional older man (who, a number told him, they have no interest in marrying); they see and visit their children—especially their daughters, although they would prefer not to have to live with them. The most isolated seem to be the older male singletons; the most dismal stories are of those who live in SROs, surrounded by other distressed male singletons who avoid interacting with each other. This is anything but the monolithic portrait we find in Fischer.</p>
<p>Still, Klinenberg only looks at residents of urban areas, and he is careful to point out this limit of his work. Given Fisher’s earlier findings about the differences between urban and rural dwellers, combined with his current argument that little has changed, we might expect that a focus on singletons in small towns or rural areas might yield findings less optimistic about ties to friends. But Klinenberg does occasionally make comparisons between the Unites States and other countries, especially to Sweden where the number of people who live alone is astonishingly high. For example, in Stockholm about 60 percent of residents live solo and are offered much support for doing so—whether from housing planners (a couple of whom Klinenberg interviewed when in Sweden) or more broadly from the generous public welfare system. That number is higher than in the United States, but the U.S. rate is higher than you would probably think before reading this book. And it is much higher here than it was a half century ago—over 30 million people live alone today, compared to only 4 million in 1950. Put starkly, as Klinenberg does, the majority of all Americans are single, spend more of their lives unmarried than married, and spend much of that time living alone.</p>
<p>A number of other scholars have suggested that singles and singletons are not necessarily without social connections. Based on analyses of national data, research shows that married people help and see less of their parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors than those never or previously married. While conservative commentators are offended by such critiques and argue that marriage is the basic unit or building block of society, research suggests otherwise. The decline in marriage might even explain why Americans are still connected. But Klinenberg does something innovative and clever, turning this argument in a more optimistic direction: he is not critiquing marriage so much as he is defending living alone. Using rich accounts drawn from his intensive interviews and observations, Klinenberg writes of people who live alone and who say they like both companionship and privacy. In doing so, he suggests, they obtain not only a more environmentally sustainable public life but also a kind of solitude that is restorative. And many of them eventually choose to marry. Living alone becomes a stage—or stages—in the life course, but not just a short one between leaving home and getting married as it was some decades ago.</p>
<p>This account should sound familiar: it is an exchange, really a disagreement that we have heard over and over again—one at the core of the sociological enterprise. It was news when farmers and small towners purportedly felt lonely and lost upon moving to urban areas in the first half of the twentieth century; it was news again when sociologists informed journalists about the march to the suburbs and growing isolation of the nuclear family post-World War II. But at those moments, while some sociologists recounted the imminent social disintegration we faced, others sociologists rebutted that account. Fischer and Klinenberg have convincingly done it again. In recent years, much has changed in American life. Much has gotten worse. But, according to these two highly readable books, Americans are still bowling together.</p>
