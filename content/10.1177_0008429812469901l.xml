<p>Written for, and about, post-1970 generations X and Y, Possamai’s very timely work will assist readers to make sense of the various new forms of believing, belonging and behaving pursued by Xers and Yers, many of whom remain unconcerned with transcendence, religious knowledge, or the salvation of the soul. Grounded in the ‘immanent’ frame of the ‘here-and-now’ experiences of young adults and with its social constructionist approach, the work analyses contemporary socio-cultural changes to understand what ‘make[s] believers and non-believers change their understanding of what religion and spirituality are’ (23).  </p>
<p>The work begins with a useful typology of religious approaches, the spectrum of which extends from the absolutist and exclusive, at one end, to the relativistic and syncretic (either fragmentation or differences) at the other. It then explores how globalised and commodified popular culture has become a ‘medium for the autodetermination of social actors,’ a central idea explored throughout the work. Hence, religious actors remain active agents who shape and construct their own personal and religious identities (26–27) and who adopt one of two styles of religious consumption: ‘hyper-consumption,’ as ‘avid and eclectic consumption of commercialised popular culture’ (28), or ‘hypo-consumption’ that is ‘guided by a religious expert or group’ (33) (new religious marketing niches). Key figures of sociology of religion are then introduced via discussions of Weber’s (universal, yet endlessly elusive) substantive approach to religion and Marx’s and Durkheim’s functional (what religion does for individuals in society) approaches. Seeking to explain contemporary social changes, Possamai then proceeds to detail a number of important theses about socio-cultural change: the secularisation thesis (Durkheim, Weber) and later post-secularisation approaches, such as the ‘multiple secularisations’ (Martin), the ‘multiple modernities’ (Eisenstadt, Casanova, Davie), and the ‘de-secularisation’ (Kepel) theses. These provide conceptual tools to better understand the changing nature of the religion of Xers and Yers, one that is no longer institution based, but which has become a more (complex) ‘spiritual’ phenomenon.</p>
<p>Consumerism and individualism are discussed at length. Both are important socio-cultural changes brought about by postmodernity (post 1960s) that remain intimately related to one another and to a globalised and commodified popular culture. Consumerism has become intrinsically related to the process of identity construction (choices made) of religious actors (Certeau, Lipovitsky). Both consumerism and individualism have led to the emergence of ‘hyper-real’ spiritual phenomena or religions (e.g., Jediism), wherein popular culture implodes as a ‘simulacrum’ (Beaudrillard) of religion, and distinctions between popular culture and religion become blurred, the internet having been identified as the main catalyst. The ‘democratised’ access to ‘esoteric’ knowledge that occurred with the rise of the New Age is then explored with a study of esotericism. This allows for revisiting Weber’s notion of ‘disenchantment’ and explaining how commodification (‘MacDonaldisation’) of the ‘mysterious’ (esoteric knowledge of all sorts) has paradoxically fostered both a process of ‘re-enchantment’ from below – the ‘hyper-real’ religions – (108) and the emergence of feelings of ‘disenchantment’ with the ‘over-proliferation of magical commodities’ (109). The latter is explored in a chapter on fundamentalism (not traditionalism or religious conservatism) where Possamai argues that Christian, Islamic and Jewish monotheistic fundamentalisms are very modern reactions to consumer culture, thus differing markedly from ‘hyper-consumer’ religions (e.g. New Age and Hyper-real religions). Faced with ‘ontological insecurity,’ uncertainty and anxiety brought about by social changes, religious actors ‘re-invent’ fundamentalist (choosing to have less choice) interpretations of religions in order to deal with that anxiety (114). The whole spectrum of fundamentalist views (often characterised by its ‘hypo-consumerism’) would fall into the three main phases of ‘passive fundamentalism,’ ‘hard-line fundamentalism,’ and ‘impositional fundamentalism’ (Pratt).</p>
<p>Discussions then turn to Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. Buddhism in the west, on the one hand, underwent an acculturation process of westernisation (and thus hybridisation) and, on the other hand, this has led to an easternisation of the west, wherein individuals (mostly converts) have turned to self-development techniques, like Buddhist meditation, but failed to embrace Buddhist ontology and eschatology. Thus, Buddhism’s acculturation has occurred through its contact with increased individualisation and the greater fluidity of contemporary (western) religious identities. As for Christianity, decline in church attendance signalled the advent of post-Christian (western) societies, some churches faring better than others, with mega churches, churches in pubs, cyber churches, and pop style music services that tap into consumer culture. Islam (here discussions are no longer focused solely on the west) produces moderate and liberal Muslims, whose confrontation with changes generates a number of interpretations compatible with the idea of ‘multiple modernities.’ In these three chapters, the complexities of the contemporary transformations each of those traditions has undergone, and is still undergoing, are not, however, quite adequately explored, especially with regards to Christianity and Islam. </p>
<p>The last part offers a ‘nine ideal-types’ grid, with axes of ‘production’ (cult movement, client cult, audience cult) and ‘consumption’ (illumination, instrumental, entertainment), to help categorise a variety of spiritualities: new religious movements, New Age and ‘prescient’ spiritualities. Then, Possamai links the cultic milieus, their ‘affinity’ (183, 191) or ‘affectual’ (180) networks and the role of the internet to illustrate how these new spiritualities remain subject to consumerism and individualism. The work concludes with a reflection on the important role of the sociologist of religion as public intellectual. </p>
<p>Possamai quite skilfully, although often too briefly, integrates the contributions and studies of quite an array of European and Anglo-Saxon sociological figures, and figures with whom he is quite familiar, to map a sociology of new contemporary (western) religious landscapes. The important, yet often neglected, role of popular culture (novels, films, video games, graphic novels, etc.) figures quite prominently, as it also does in many of our lives, in the analyses of religion espoused by generations X and Y who live in western societies and for whom ‘autorealisation,’ or ‘spiritual self-realisation’ (26), is at the heart of the shaping of their religious selves. Hence, it is no surprise that the work remains at its best when it deals mainly with the cultic milieus of new religious movements, New Age, and new spiritualities. </p>
