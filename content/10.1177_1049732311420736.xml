<abstract>
<p>Although a considerable body of research has described the implications of parental mental illness, the perspectives of children and adolescents have rarely been addressed. In this article, I explore adolescents’ experiences in everyday life, based on an action-oriented study of a Norwegian online self-help group for adolescents (aged 15 to 18) with mentally ill parents. The analysis was conducted through participant observation of the group for 2 years. The adolescents experienced a variety of difficult challenges related to their parent’s mental illness: lack of information and openness; unpredictability and instability; fear; loneliness; and loss and sorrow. However, they also discussed strategies for active management of the challenges arising from the family situation. I argue that these adolescents can be understood as vulnerable as well as active participants in managing their everyday lives. I emphasize the importance of including perspectives of children and adolescents in further research so as to improve health care for families with parental mental illness.</p>

<p>Parental mental illness has implications for family life in many different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311420736">Östman &amp; Hansson, 2002</xref>), and the challenges facing children with mentally ill parents are a subject of increasing concern in policy, practice, and research. It is well documented that these children are at increased risk for developing mental health and behavioral problems based on factors such as genetic predisposition, direct exposure to symptoms, disruptions in parenting, and environmental impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420736">Anthony, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311420736">Rutter &amp; Quinton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311420736">Smith, 2004</xref>). Children with mentally ill parents often struggle with challenges such as understanding the mental illness, additional caregiving responsibilities, difficult emotions, financial hardship, and limited social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311420736">Fudge &amp; Mason, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311420736">Gladstone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). They also live with the burdens of negative attitudes, blame, and the social stigmatization of mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311420736">Corrigan &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone, Ytterhus, &amp; Almvik, 2009</xref>). During their most difficult periods, parents with severe mental illness have a reduced capacity to take care of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311420736">Halsa, 2008</xref>); however, based on the current trend of deinstitutionalization of psychiatric services toward shorter hospital stays and provision of mental health care in the community, children are now living close to their parents during all phases of the mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone, Boydell, &amp; McKeever, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311420736">Hetherington &amp; Baistow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for decades, children with mentally ill parents have been rendered invisible and have been partly neglected in social policies and professional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311420736">Hetherington &amp; Baistow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">2008</xref>). In Norway, a lack of attention, support, and procedures from health care services for follow-up of these children has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311420736">Aamodt &amp; Aamodt, 2005</xref>). Although there is a renewed interest in improving practice in Western countries concerning parental mental illness, many children still have to manage their family situation with limited information and inadequate formal support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The extensive body of research addressing outcomes of parental mental illness has particularly focused on exposure to the parents’ pathology, the effects of risk factors, and the children’s resiliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420736">Anthony, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311420736">Beardslee, Versage, &amp; Gladstone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311420736">Rutter &amp; Quinton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311420736">Smith, 2004</xref>). There is, however, a paucity of studies examining the perspectives of children and adolescents, as well as their experiences in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>). Consequently, there is a call for qualitative studies including children and adolescents as informants to achieve deeper insights into their needs and perceptions, with the aim of developing policy and improving health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311420736">Aldridge, 2006</xref>). The perspectives of children and adolescents, which are different from those of adults, provide useful insights into their lives with mentally ill parents (Gladstone et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch, 2010</xref>). Recently, some studies have included the voices of children and adolescents; however, most have been based on retrospective data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311420736">Baik &amp; Bowers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311420736">Kaimal &amp; Beardslee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311420736">Knutsson-Medin, Edlund, &amp; Ramklint, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311420736">O’Connell, 2008</xref>). A few studies addressed current daily life experiences of living with a mentally ill parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311420736">Almvik &amp; Ytterhus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311420736">Fudge &amp; Mason, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). The strength of these latter studies is that the daily experiences of the children were related to contemporary society and the organization of health care today.</p>
<p>My aim with this article is to provide further insight into the perspectives and experiences of children and adolescents in their present everyday lives with a mentally ill parent. I highlight the value of studying their lives in their own right, an approach that is central in the “new” social studies of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311420736">Brannen &amp; O’Brien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311420736">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420736">James, Jenks, &amp; Prout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311420736">Mayall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311420736">Prout, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311420736">Qvortrup, 1994</xref>). Based on an action-oriented study, I have analyzed the communication in a Norwegian online self-help group for adolescents (aged 15 to 18 years) with mentally ill parents. In the literature addressing parental mental illness, distinctions between children and adolescents are seldom made. <italic>Children</italic> is used as a common term that refers to all individuals under the age of majority; however, I prefer to use the term <italic>adolescents</italic> when referring to the participants in this study. Although the age range of the group was restricted, I believe that the insights the study provides into these adolescents’ perspectives and experiences will be of relevance for a wider age group.</p>
<p>In this anonymous, online self-help forum, which was password protected and user directed, the participants were offered a meeting place to share experiences with peers. They were invited to introduce and discuss the themes they preferred. Based on the aim of exploring the perspectives of children and adolescents in their everyday life with a mentally ill parent, I focus on the issues and experiences these adolescents chose to introduce and discuss with peers in the online self-help group.</p>

<title>Background and Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>As mentioned, a body of research indicates that children with mentally ill parents are at risk of developing a mental illness or behavioral disorder themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311420736">Beardslee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311420736">Rutter &amp; Quinton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311420736">Smith, 2004</xref>). However, despite the risks that parental mental illness poses to children, it is also well known that many of them remain healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>). The individual attributes of children who appeared to thrive despite their life circumstances have been conceptualized as resilience. The term is usually used both to encapsulate the potential for survival and growth in the face of adversity and to identify protective factors and how they can be promoted by social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420736">Backett-Milburn, Wilson, Bancroft, &amp; Cunningham-Burley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>). The literature on risk and resilience has contributed valuable insight into elements of risk and protective factors. Based on this knowledge, the importance of early preventive interventions and holistic services to provide support to mentally ill parents and their children has been emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311420736">Orel, Groves, &amp; Shannon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311420736">Östman &amp; Hansson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311420736">Smith, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, however, several authors have criticized the dominance of the risk and resilience discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311420736">Aldridge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420736">Backett-Milburn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>). A focus on outcomes based on pathology and individual attributes has been prominent, whereas little is known about everyday social processes, various contexts, interactions, and incidental events in the lives of children (Backett-Milburn et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2002</xref>). Moreover, Gladstone et al. have pointed out that within this risk and resilience framework, children are viewed primarily as being at risk of developing mental illness themselves, and those who remain well are considered to be extraordinarily resilient. Being identified as “at risk” is a powerful label that the children cannot avoid, and that particular status follows them into adulthood (Gladstone et al.).</p>
<p>In this research on risk and resilience, childhood is considered to be a critical period of development during which children need protection because of their physical and psychological vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>). This developmental model has been criticized for presenting an image of children as passive and “unfinished” or “becoming” persons (Gladstone et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420736">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311420736">Qvortrup, 1994</xref>), and for viewing childhood as a preparatory rather than a participatory phase of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311420736">Mayall, 2002</xref>). This future-oriented assumption necessarily places the onus of importance on “that which the child will be, rather than that which the child is” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732311420736">Uprichard, 2008</xref>, p. 304), which neglects or dismisses the present everyday realities of being a child (James et al.; Uprichard). Developmental models have also been criticized for promoting universal claims about children’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior (Gladstone et al.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al. (2006)</xref> have argued that the dominant risk and resilience conceptual repertoire about children living with a mentally ill parent should be challenged and expanded by using alternative conceptualizations based on perspectives and approaches from the sociology of childhood and new studies of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311420736">Brannen &amp; O’Brien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311420736">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420736">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311420736">Mayall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311420736">Prout, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311420736">Qvortrup, 1994</xref>). In the frame of these new perspectives on childhood, the developmental notion of children as “adults-in-the-making” has been replaced by a theoretical framework that conceives of children as “beings” who are competent persons in their own right (James et al.). Here, children are viewed as social actors who actively construct their own childhood and who influence as well as are influenced by their social environments (Brannen &amp; O’Brien; James et al.; Prout; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732311420736">Uprichard, 2008</xref>). On the basis of this theoretical framework, researchers in the social science of childhood have called for a stronger focus on the construction of childhoods and their different structural conditions and inequalities, as well as the exploration of children’s own experiences, perspectives, and constructions of their daily life within these wider structural contexts (Brannen &amp; O’Brien; Prout). The view of children as competent actors with perspectives on and experiences of being a child clearly implies that children should be included as both subjects and participants in the research (Prout).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al. (2006)</xref> have underlined that little is known about how children with a mentally ill parent engage with others such as parents, peers, and health care workers, or how the structural features of this experience of childhood come into play. Similarly, little is known about how related practices enhance or inhibit social lives and their contributions to various contexts (Gladstone et al.). These authors have argued for a view of children as competent to express their views and to recount their experiences, by actively consulting the children, to increase our knowledge about questions related to their lives with a mentally ill parent. In accordance with these authors’ suggestions and the framework of new childhood studies, in this article I focus on the perspectives of children and adolescents and their experiences of living with a mentally ill parent by exploring the communication within an online self-help group for adolescents.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>In this article, I draw on an action-oriented study in which the overall aim was to explore the potential role of online self-help groups for adolescents with mentally ill parents. Action research describes a whole family of methods that are participatory, grounded in experience, and action- oriented with the aim of pursuing practical solutions to issues of pressing concern to people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311420736">Ladkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311420736">Reason &amp; Bradbury, 2006</xref>). The key objectives are improvements in practice and increased knowledge. The dual role of the researcher as both the implementer and the evaluator of a program is distinctive to this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311420736">Finne, Levin, &amp; Nilssen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311420736">Olsen &amp; Lindøe, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, an online self-help group for adolescents (aged 15 to 18) with mentally ill parents was established at the end of 2005 in collaboration with the Norwegian Centre for Telemedicine and a hospital in Norway. Since 2001, the hospital has run a Web site (in Norwegian) for children and adolescents with mentally ill parents. The Web site includes a variety of services available to everyone: information pages, an open access forum, and an interactive question-and-answer service in which health professionals respond to questions from children and adolescents. This online self-help group represented an expansion of existing services on this Web site. It was designed as an anonymous, password-protected newsgroup, and was the first online self-help group for adolescents initiated by health care delivery in Norway. Using the action-oriented study, the hospital intended to test this kind of online forum before it was established as a permanent service.</p>
<p>The idea behind the service was to improve care and support for this vulnerable group of adolescents. Teens are a particularly challenging group to reach for the delivery of health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311420736">Drost, Cuijpers, &amp; Schippers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732311420736">Suzuki &amp; Calzo, 2004</xref>), and use of the Internet is considered a promising option. Emphasizing the potential role of self-help, it was intended to offer adolescents a place to meet peers. The participants were self-recruited. Information about the study was spread through several Web sites for young people, as well as through health professionals, various media channels, and posters at schools. An adjusted version of this online self-help group was established as an ordinary, permanent service after the study period was completed at the end of 2007.</p>
<p>My involvement in the implementation of the online group included a role as moderator during the study period. As moderator, I took care of the administrative management, ensured that the communication was in accordance with Norwegian legislation, and contributed to a well-functioning service that could represent a safe space and supportive community for the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732311420736">Trondsen &amp; Sandaunet, 2009</xref>). These activities were in line with what is common in online self-help groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311420736">Sandaunet, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732311420736">Till, 2003</xref>), and they are recommended to prevent destructive discussions and harm to the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311420736">Johnsen, Rosenvinge, &amp; Gammon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732311420736">Waldron, Lavitt, &amp; Kelley, 2000</xref>). I entered into a role of “hostess,” for example, by posting friendly messages in the forum to welcome new members or to assist the participants in administrative issues; however, I did not introduce topics or contribute responses to the discussions that were raised related to their family situation, and I emphasized that “the stage is yours.” This role supported the intention of adhering to a self-help approach in which the conversation is governed by the participants. Based on experiences in the initial phase, a health professional from the hospital entered the forum as comoderator in case of clinical issues. Basically, her role was passive, but she was accessible on request from the adolescents if they wanted her expertise. She was involved a few times, when she was directly asked for clinical advice and when her professional support was given to ensure edifying discussions for the participants (see Trondsen &amp; Sandaunet).</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in Norway and Norwegian Social Science Data Services. In line with the ethical recommendations, an information letter about the study was sent to the participants. In addition, they had to sign a written consent form before they were allowed to enter the study and become a member of the group in the study period. Participants under 16 years of age also had to provide signed permission from one of their parents. As part of the effort to organize the service properly, a reference group consisting of mental health clinicians was established. If problems related to the activity in the self-help group were considered to be of a nature that required professional response, the reference group could provide support.</p>

<p>Sixteen adolescents from various parts of Norway participated in the self-help group during the study period. The group started with only 4 participants, but new members were welcomed throughout the entire study period. Nobody withdrew from the study. The participants were from 15 to 18 years old when they signed up for the group. Although the participants were self-recruited, with no restrictions on gender, all except one were girls. The preponderance of female participants resonates with observations made in other studies of visitors to online health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311420736">Drost et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311420736">Fukkink &amp; Hermanns, 2009</xref>). Girls are much more likely than boys to be information seekers and communicators on the Internet with regard to health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311420736">Lenhart, Rainie, &amp; Lewis, 2005</xref>). A corresponding gender asymmetry applies to adults in the Internet context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732311420736">Seale, Ziebland, &amp; Charteris-Black, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The parents of the adolescents in the group suffered from severe mental illnesses—for example, bipolar disorder—and some of them had been psychotic or had attempted suicide. Although not all participants knew their parents’ exact diagnoses, their parents had suffered from mental illness for years, were incapable of working, and were receiving drug treatment, psychological therapy, or were hospitalized. None of the participants were living alone with a mentally ill parent; they were living in dual-parent families, in single-parent families with the healthy parent, or on their own. All the participants had access to a computer at home.</p>
<p>In line with ethical considerations of online research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311420736">Bar-Lev, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311420736">Flicker, Haans, &amp; Skinner, 2004</xref>), I have concealed prominent biographical details about the adolescents and their parents in the quoted material because the participants discussed highly sensitive and personal matters in the group. To ensure confidentiality for the boy, I also refer to all the participants as girls. The connection between the findings and the demographic variables needs to be addressed in studies with a greater number of participants, and will not be discussed here based on this explorative study.</p>

<title>Material</title>
<p>During the 2-year study period, about 600 messages were posted by the group. The messages were distributed across 72 self-defined topics, or <italic>threads</italic>, which is the term used to describe activity in online newsgroups. This refers to the cyclical comment–response style where one person makes a statement and others write comments back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311420736">Denzin, 1999</xref>). The quoted messages were translated from Norwegian and made suitable for written presentation. For this article, the material was obtained through participant observation of the activity in the online group. A growing number of studies exploring health and illness experiences are based on participant observation in online self-help groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311420736">Høybye, Johansen, &amp; Tjørnhøj-Thomsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311420736">Radin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311420736">Sandaunet, 2008a</xref>). Participant observation is a crucial method for contextualizing the stories and experiences presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311420736">Delamont, 2007</xref>; Høybye et al.). Archived messages in Internet forums have considerable potential as a source of data about participants’ current experiences and concerns. The forums give participants the opportunity to decide on topics to discuss, and contain detailed accounts of health and illness issues, as well as processes and practices in the context of the participants’ own lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732311420736">Seale, Charteris-Black, MacFarlane, &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The topics that were introduced and discussed in the group by the participants offered an intake to explore the adolescents’ views on living with a mentally ill parent, and that were given priority in the group communication. My primary method was to observe the activity in the online forum, and I read all messages posted. In addition, through my role as moderator of the service, I had casual dialogues with the participants with the purpose of facilitating the communication. In accordance with recommendations to researchers who are moderating online focus groups, I was proactive in establishing a safe, relaxed, and friendly atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311420736">Fox, Morris, &amp; Rumsey, 2007</xref>). I continued gathering data until the point of analytic saturation, which was after studying the forum daily for 2 years (December, 2005 to December, 2007).</p>
<p>The interaction between the researcher and the informants through participant observation constitutes a foundation for understanding the field and makes it possible to analyze it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311420736">Høybye et al., 2005</xref>). The analytical approach used in this study relied on an interaction framework, drawing on the conception of the researcher as coconstructor of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311420736">Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311420736">Mik-Meyer &amp; Järvinen, 2005</xref>). My research material is produced in the context of an action-oriented study and my interactions with the participants in the online self-help group. The organization of the forum, the information letters, the presence of myself and the clinician as adults, the moderators, and myself as researcher in the forum, as well as our dialogues with the participants, are all aspects that are reasonable to assume influenced the online communication. In a previous article, however, I reflected on and discussed more thoroughly the advantages and challenges of my dual role as action researcher in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732311420736">Trondsen &amp; Sandaunet, 2009</xref>). A main argument was that the action-oriented approach enables the researcher to get particularly close to the sociocultural processes and contexts that are addressed, and that it thereby contributes to generating crucial knowledge about the phenomenon under study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311420736">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The framework of the analysis was issue focused, which is concerned with what can be learned from the informants about specific issues, events, or processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732311420736">Weiss, 1994</xref>). This analytical approach implies focusing on topics and not on individuals, and some informants might contribute more to the analysis than others (Weiss). The aim was to explore issues that were raised in the online self-help group rather than differences between individuals. Coding, sorting, and local and inclusive integration of the material are alternating processes that all occur throughout an issue-focused analysis (Weiss).</p>
<p>I downloaded all messages posted in the forum without selection. The threads were downloaded in their entirety to preserve the context in which they were written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311420736">Bar-Lev, 2010</xref>). In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311420736">Denzin (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311420736">Sandaunet (2008a</xref>), I first identified sequences of talk about various topics within each thread. As also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311420736">Sandaunet (2008a</xref>), on several occasions the participants addressed similar issues under different threads. By focusing on sequences of talk, I could then code and sort the material independent of the threads. I thereby linked together related sequences across the whole set of threads. Through the alternating processes of reading and rereading all archived messages, coding, sorting, and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732311420736">Weiss, 1994</xref>), I identified and categorized the issues and experiences expressed by the participants in the group. I sorted out two main topics that were given priority in the communication between the participating adolescents in the group. First, a main part of the discussions addressed the difficult practical and emotional challenges in everyday life related to their parent’s mental illness. Another main topic presented was strategies for managing the challenges arising from the family situation. Based on this categorization, I divided the analysis into two sections, which are outlined below.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732311420736">
<title>Challenges in Everyday Life</title>
<p>All the participants described their everyday lives as profoundly influenced by their parent’s mental illness, with difficult practical and emotional challenges to handle. The challenges emphasized in the communication between the adolescents comprised five subtopics: (a) lack of information and openness, (b) unpredictability and instability, (c) fear, (d) loneliness, and (e) loss and sorrow.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732311420736">
<title>Lack of Information and Openness</title>
<p>The adolescents expressed a shared experience of lack of information and openness regarding their parent’s mental illness, both inside and outside the family. They described this silence as a paradox, because the mental illness so deeply affected their family lives. In their discussions about this issue, the adolescents agreed that being poorly informed led to many unanswered questions, which they described as a source of concern, fear, and frustration. This experience became particularly obvious in a thread headed “When?” One of the girls asked the others about when they had been informed about their parent’s illness, or whether they had recognized it by themselves. Her question received prompt responses describing experiences of lack of information. One girl expressed her frustration at not yet being informed about her mother’s diagnosis, even though she had been suffering from the illness for 10 years:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There was never any discussion about HOW she was sick! I think eventually I just understood it . . . What really irritates me is that she still won’t tell me the exact diagnosis . . . I need to know it, but she won’t tell me. All I know is that she has depression anyway, and that there’s nothing manic present, but it seems like there is something else they’re hiding since they absolutely won’t talk about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of the adolescents stated the importance of being informed early enough about the mental illness in the family. Some of them explained they had observed signs and changes in their parent’s mood and behavior that had confused and worried them long before they had been informed about his or her mental health problems. Others had been faced with their parent’s mental illness for the first time through a dramatic situation in which the parent attempted suicide, disappeared, became psychotic, or was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. They described that without knowing about their parent’s illness before, they found this experience extremely frightening and painful. In the following discussion about this issue, another girl said she thought parents in general had good intentions when they did not talk about the mental illness. She pointed out, however, that “our imagination and thoughts are running wild, and constantly wondering, constantly trying to figure things out ourselves, can be much worse than dealing with the truth.” Moreover, the adolescents reported that they experienced lack of information and openness not only within their families but also in relation to other adults such as relatives, teachers, and even health professionals who were treating their parents. They described this as a sense of being “invisible” in the family situation, despite all the consequences the mental illness had in their own life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311420736">
<title>Unpredictability and Instability</title>
<p>Another difficult challenge mentioned by the adolescents was the unpredictability and instability caused by their mentally ill parent’s shifts in mood and behavior, or by exacerbations of the illness. The adolescents presented a common experience of a family life that could turn upside down from one moment to the next, as illustrated by one participant: “My mom has rapidly fluctuating depression. She has one completely normal day, and on the next she doesn’t want to talk to anyone and just cries and rants.” The experience of unpredictability was followed up as a main issue in corresponding sequences. One girl reported that a trivial matter could result in a sudden fit of temper:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the things that have been the worst about my father’s sickness is that damn temper of his! He went completely berserk about small things: if we knocked over a glass at the table, or asked for a glass of water before we were going to bed, or came inside two minutes after “inside time,” etc. A lot of minor issues that normal people wouldn’t have cared about, but he really freaked out! His face became beet red, his eyes flashed with anger . . . he almost looked “evil” . . . and then he screamed at us. . . . Sometimes he grabbed us hard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, the adolescents emphasized how such unpredictability in temper influenced the family atmosphere and their own well-being. One girl described how an episode with a sudden fit of anger from her ill father, in which he made extremely derogatory remarks about her, caused her emotional and physical imbalance for many days:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everything has just been shitty since that. I’ve barely slept, I hardly eat. I forget everything and am tired and fed up and scared. My father and I just fight and he scolds me and I cry, and I just want to hide and run far away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, others emphasized that unpredictable shifts in the mentally ill parent’s mood to more introverted behavior were also difficult to handle, and could affect their own well-being. One of the girls expressed her sadness when facing her mentally ill mother’s shift to introverted, depressive behavior:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is really hard coming home after school and unexpectedly finding my mum [mother] sitting in her chair, depressive, unkempt and tousle-headed, staring expressionless at the television, but without attention, and not saying a word. . . . I hide myself in my room, and feel deeply sad.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The adolescents also discussed that such unstable and unpredictable periods in their parent’s mental illness disrupted their ability to concentrate on schoolwork. One of the participants said, “I hate having to go to school when life is like that, and I have no concentration whatsoever, so I think it is incredibly hard to get everything in on time, and I constantly forget everything.” Finally, the adolescents discussed how the unpredictability of their parent’s behavior complicated their ability to plan their daily lives and future. Several of them mentioned a feeling of reluctance to invite friends to their home after school because they did not know what mood their parent would be in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311420736">
<title>Fear</title>
<p>In a number of messages, the adolescents highlighted a strong feeling of fear as a fundamental aspect of their lives, mainly as a consequence of the rapid emotional shifts and exacerbations of the mental illness. One girl started a thread with the heading “fear” by saying, “My father’s illness mostly makes me scared. I hate being scared, but that is probably the feeling I’ve felt most during the last 12 years.” She continued by explaining her fear of her father’s temperamental fits of anger throughout those years:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was constantly afraid of making him angry. I was simply terrified that he was going to do something that would make him blow up at me. . . . I was afraid that he was going to do something to my mom, I was afraid that he was going to do something to my siblings, I was afraid he was going to do something to me. It’s not easy to lead a normal life when you walk around and are constantly afraid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others immediately recognized her fear of angry outbursts. One of them told about a fear of violent reactions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am also constantly afraid. Afraid that my mom is going to flip out again and that this time, she’s going to throw something heavy at me, so that I will get badly hurt. You know, I’ve heard many times lately about people with mental problems who have killed family members. My mom isn’t that bad now, but you never know, suddenly something snaps.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, the adolescents expressed they were afraid of an exacerbation of their parent’s mental illness, particularly regarding suicide. The majority of them had experienced suicidal parents: some had a parent who had attempted suicide, and one of them had lost her parent to suicide. They told about their frightening memories such as finding suicide notes, searching for their suicidal parent who had disappeared from home, or visiting a parent in a psychiatric hospital after she or he had attempted suicide. These adolescents expressed a common experience in being afraid that their parent could be suicidal or attempt suicide again. One participant expressed that she rapidly became anxious if she did not know where her mentally ill parent was, and another girl stated, “You become afraid that people are dead, if they’re only five minutes late.” A girl whose parent had attempted suicide reported that her fear that this could happen again had influenced her afterwards:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was scared that I one day would come home and find him dead. I was too afraid to go into the storage room, because I was afraid that he would have hung himself there. I was too afraid to go into his and Mom’s bedroom, because I was afraid he might be lying dead in his bed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the adolescents also described how they were afraid of being or becoming mental ill themselves:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am still terrified of one thing: turning out like my father! I am so scared that I too will get that disease. Some people think mental illnesses are hereditary; others do not think so. Whether it is hereditary or not, my difficult childhood could lead to me becoming depressed, you know. . . . I probably sound like a real pessimist now, but I think about it a lot, and am so afraid of it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They knew well that they represented an at-risk group for developing mental illness themselves, and expressed the fear of inheriting a genetic mental disorder or developing mental health problems because of their burdensome family situation. For instance, if they felt extraordinary sadness, they were afraid that it could be a sign they were developing depression themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732311420736">
<title>Loneliness</title>
<p>The adolescents presented a common experience of finding themselves in a lonely situation. Even though they had someone they could talk to, they still had to struggle by themselves with practical challenges, heavy thoughts, painful emotions, and difficult situations. One girl said that she felt her situation was mostly overlooked by the family. She experienced that her parents talked to her about practical details such as the ill parent’s treatment, but there were no questions about “where do I stand in the middle of this?” She received support from others in the group who recognized her feeling of being invisible in the family situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the adolescents discussed how they found it particularly challenging to confide in someone about family issues and personal experiences themselves. The lack of similarity and mutuality in family situations was presented as one barrier to sharing their experiences with friends:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some of my best friends say that I can talk to them when I need to, and that is certainly a good thing, but regardless of how much I tell them, they will never really understand. I feel very alone in the middle of all this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The adolescents also emphasized how the process of establishing trust was long and hard. One girl reported that she still kept her sadness to herself, although she had friends she trusted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I try to be strong, but am often very sad, even though I don’t show it to the rest of the family. Fortunately, I’ve got myself a good girlfriend who I can talk about it with, and I also have a good boyfriend who is very helpful. But it’s still often very difficult, and I notice that I keep a lot inside me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She continued with reflections on why she felt it was difficult to talk about her problems:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In general, I feel like I’m bothering people when I begin talking about my problems or what’s wrong. I have a sort of feeling like it’s not a good enough reason to be sad, even though other people say it is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The others shared her fear of bothering friends and discussed their concern about abusing friendships, especially if they were the only ones who spoke about problems and needed emotional support. This imbalance of being the suffering party in a friendship was emphasized as a dilemma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311420736">
<title>Loss and Sorrow</title>
<p>A final recurring theme that the participants discussed as challenging was feelings of loss and sorrow in not living a “normal” family life as others did. They felt sorrow at having parents who were periodically incapable of performing their role as parents through involvement in schoolwork or leisure-time activities, or being attentive in conversation, for example. One girl expressed sorrow at not having a mother who could take part in trivial everyday matters, and said further, “I lack a mother. . . . A mother who says something enthusiastically over the dinner table or asks and offers OPINIONS, not just sits there and stares stone-faced into space.” Others expressed their sorrow at not having a good relationship with their mentally ill parent: “When I see that my friends have good relationships with their parents, it kind of stings inside, and I think about how it would have been if my parent hadn’t been sick.” Many of the adolescents expressed that the mental illness had led to a strained relationship and ambivalent feelings toward their parent. Although they felt compassion for their mentally ill parent, they still were marked by the range of burdensome experiences and painful emotions caused by the family situation. Some of the participants agreed that, paradoxically, they could be filled with an intense longing for their ill parent, even though he or she was living with them:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I often miss my dad so much that it hurts, even though he lives with me and I see him almost every day. The problem is that I see the man, but not my father. I see the man who threatens, and screams and yells and fumes with anger, or the man who sits on the sofa and just stares out in space and says that life isn’t worth living anymore. That kind of man isn’t a father.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By distinguishing between the person and the parental role, she illustrated the complex sense of sorrow at not having a family life with parents who were always capable of carrying out their roles as mother or father.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311420736">
<title>Strategies for Managing the Challenges</title>
<p>Aside from how the mental illness affected their everyday lives, another main category of issues discussed in the group concerned how to manage the practical and emotional challenges. A number of threads started as questions asking for specific advice about what to do, which were followed by supporting responses about several strategies to handle the challenges. In the sequences below, the adolescents’ crucial strategies are presented as: (a) taking responsibility, (b) being in “emergency alert mode,” (c) taking a time-out, (d) seeking support from professionals, and (e) moving away.</p>
<sec id="section14-1049732311420736">
<title>Taking Responsibility</title>
<p>The adolescents expressed that one strategy they used to manage their parent’s mental illness was by taking responsibility in the family for household work, cooking, carrying out practical tasks, and caring for siblings and parents. Several of them described themselves as an extra adult in the family, particularly during their parent’s bad periods. One girl characterized this as reversing roles between herself and her father: “Sometimes it’s more like I’m the one who is the parent, and he is the child. I feel like he’s my responsibility, and that I have to take care of him.” The adolescents described being pleased to be useful in difficult family situations, but they also commented that the responsibility sometimes could be a heavy burden. The adolescents emphasized the carer role as periodic. During good periods, the parents took care of the family tasks. However, the adolescents commented that deciding when and how they should take on this role presented a dilemma because of the instability in their parent’s mental illness. To leave behind one’s sense of responsibility in more stable periods was also described as a challenge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732311420736">
<title>“Emergency Alert Mode”</title>
<p>Another strategy described by the adolescents was that they made adjustments and performed activities aimed at avoiding difficult situations, particularly those that made their parents angry or depressed. By considering their parent’s mood, adjusting their own behavior, doing housework, taking care of younger siblings, and avoiding saying anything provocative, they tried to contribute to creating a good atmosphere at home. One girl referred to this strategy as “emergency alert mode”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I get into “emergency alert mode.” Everything from not leaving crumbs on the floor, forgetting to clean the counter or make coffee, breaking things, opening things that should not be opened. Often I do things to try and be nice and help, but she just gets angry and scolds and yells, and that just makes me nervous and afraid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She wrote that she was also “on the alert” regarding her younger siblings, to prevent their noise or boisterous play from setting off negative reactions. Another girl said that she “walked around on tiptoes” at home, in fear of making her mentally ill parent angry. She also tried to take precautions and be prepared for the worst. The adolescents expressed that always having to be on guard to avoid doing something wrong at home was exhausting. Thus, it was an important issue for the adolescents to be active in controlling their life as much as possible by being “on the alert.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732311420736">
<title>Taking a Time-Out</title>
<p>In a thread headed “What helps you?” a girl asked for advice for when difficult family situations arose, or when heavy thoughts and painful emotions were overwhelming. She immediately received responses with several suggestions for taking a time-out as a crucial strategy. Some commented that they preferred to retreat alone to a special place, such as their own room, outdoors in nature, or a café. Others said they chose to spend time with friends to get time out, whether the aim was to confide in someone about their difficulties, to get a feeling of being appreciated by someone, or to just have a pleasant time to restore their humor. One girl stated that she constantly had plans and was staying at home as little as possible during her parent’s difficult periods. Another girl chose various activities based on what mood she was in:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I usually go and work out, listen to loud music and just shut everything and everyone out, or go for a long walk/run. If I work out, I get out my frustration and anger much easier, sort of utilize it in a positive way. . . . But if I am more sad or scared, and think everything seems hopeless, I think it’s best to just shut my self in my room and listen to loud music. If I am just really depressed, I take a run. I just run as far as I can, preferably in the woods or on a country road so I don’t have to meet anyone. Normally, I sit down somewhere after having run for about an hour, cry and scream. Even if it doesn’t solve anything, it still helps me in the moment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>No matter what kind of “time-out” strategy the adolescents chose, they were agreed on the value of finding strategies to establish physical and emotional distance from challenging situations. They experienced that it enabled them to vent their feelings and fill up on positive experiences to restore their energy and strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732311420736">
<title>Seeking Support From Professionals</title>
<p>Although the adolescents had friends they could talk to, they described finding it difficult to confide everything about their family situation to them. In several threads, the opportunity to seek support from professionals as a strategy for handling their painful emotions and difficult experiences was discussed. However, few had been in contact with health care services because they experienced it as a difficult threshold. One girl commented that “I have tried to talk to a psychologist, but can’t do it, have tried many times. I think it’s really difficult to sit in front of a total stranger and unfold all of my problems and thoughts.” Those who had received health care support pointed out their vulnerability in this process. They found it difficult to establish trust when there was insufficient time, and felt it was uncomfortable to share their stories with many different persons. Stability and predictability in the relationship with the health care worker were emphasized as important:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My problem when it comes to talking to people is that as soon as I just start trusting someone, they disappear again. People move, pass me on in the system, misinterpret all of my hints and statements and forget me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, those with positive experiences in having a professional to talk with recommended that others try this strategy. One girl described how a health care worker had been of great value to her in earlier years:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She really helped me in increasing my self-confidence and reducing the demands I put on myself. And it was incredibly nice to have an adult I could call when I wanted, and when extra painful things happened, she often came and picked me up and took me out or home to her place so that I could have the chance to talk with someone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another girl appreciated her consultations with a psychologist, but she experienced it as difficult to go out and face the world again:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s like I don’t want to go back to the real world. It’s tiring to sit over there and talk about thoughts and experiences and painful things, and then have to go out and smile and pretend I’m happy again, like nothing has happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though she said it was hard to confront her own difficulties, she pointed out the positive outcome these consultations had for her in the longer term. All the adolescents highlighted finding someone to talk to—a trustworthy and available person—as an important strategy in managing their challenging family life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732311420736">
<title>Moving Away</title>
<p>The last strategy discussed by the adolescents was moving away from the family situation. Some of them were already living alone or together with friends. When they took this step, they had to face practical, financial, and emotional challenges. Some of the adolescents had moved away without conflicts with their parents by strategically using the possibility to get their education far away from home, which gave them an excuse to live on their own or at a boarding school. Others had been through a conflict with their parents in taking this step. One girl described difficult confrontations with her mentally ill mother, who did not agree to her moving away from home. Her mother became angry, cried, and blamed her for making the mental illness worse. The girl tried twice before she finally made the move away. Despite her parent’s reluctance, she experienced it as a necessary step for both of them: “What needed to happen was me moving out, you see, so that she could begin to take proper care of herself. This is something she does now. But she wanted to have me there, like a sort of nurse.” In any case, the adolescents reflected that through a strategy of moving away from home they could achieve a physical and emotional distance from the family situation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The above analysis of the communication in this online self-help group has provided insights into these adolescents’ own perspectives and experiences on their family situation, which were given priority in the communication within this particular context. By exploring the issues and experiences presented and discussed by the adolescents in the online self-help group, I identified two main topics. First, it became apparent that the circumstances of their parent’s mental illness influenced the adolescents’ everyday lives. When addressing their peers in the group, they emphasized a variety of difficult and complex challenges to handle. Second, I found that these adolescents had extensive discussions with their peers in the self-help group about finding crucial strategies for managing their challenging lives. They were active in asking for advice, proposing various strategies, and sharing their own attempts to cope with difficult and challenging situations. I discuss these two main topics in more detail below.</p>
<p>When discussing consequences and challenges, the adolescents focused mainly on the heavy emotional implications of their family situation. They expressed intense, painful, and partially overwhelming feelings such as uncertainty, fear, loneliness, loss, and sorrow, which I consider as illustrating their vulnerable position. Nevertheless, they said they had few people or even no one to talk to about these painful feelings. The lack of information and openness about their parent’s illness was experienced as intensifying their difficult feelings, as well as increasing their struggle with handling both the practical and emotional consequences. This aspect directs attention toward structural matters, in particular the importance of openness toward and information for children and adolescents who have a mentally ill parent. It is well documented that children who are knowledgeable about their parent’s mental illness are better able to interpret their parent’s behaviors as being indicators of their illness, which in turn contributes to less uncertainty and makes their painful emotions less intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The adolescents in the online self-help group expressed their need to be informed early enough about their parent’s mental illness and to be involved in important conditions and decisions that affected them. However, they experienced a lack of information and openness about the mental illness both inside and outside their family, which was emphasized as a source of concern, fear, and frustration. This aspect gives association to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311420736">Barnard and Barlow (2003)</xref> concerning parental drug dependence, in which the children experienced being locked into a burdensome silence about their family secret. Similar to what was mentioned by the adolescents in my study, the parents tried to hide and protect them from their drug problems, but the children had noticed far more signs and details about their parents’ problems than their parents believed.</p>
<p>Lack of information and support from health care services during a parent’s treatment, hospitalization, or subsequent recovery has also been documented in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311420736">Almvik &amp; Ytterhus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311420736">Hetherington &amp; Baistow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311420736">Knutsson-Medin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311420736">Meadus &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch (2010)</xref> found that children of mentally ill parents had received few factual explanations about the mental illness, and that the limited information caused undue hardship for them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311420736">Darlington and Feeney (2008)</xref> reported a range of structural, organizational, and cultural barriers in mental health and child protection services to achieve best practice in cases with parental mental illness. They concluded that substantial structural changes are necessary to facilitate seamless collaboration across sectors to develop more integrated services for follow-up of children with mentally ill parents.</p>
<p>The adolescents’ own high threshold for confiding in friends, family, or health professionals about their difficulties also underlines the importance of information and support. It is a contextual barrier to openness that families suffering from mental illness run the risk of living with shame, blame, and social stigmatization, which causes them to keep their problems hidden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311420736">Corrigan &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone et al., 2009</xref>). Children learn at an early stage to keep their family situation secret to protect their family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>). Fjone et al. found that children with mentally ill parents struggle hard to present themselves as “normal” and equal among their peer group, to avoid stigma and stigmatizing situations. Together these structural barriers might then reinforce the experiences of being invisible, which was expressed by the adolescents in the online self-help group. Moreover, it is reasonable to suggest that these aspects intensify their feelings of loneliness in handling the practical and emotional consequences of their parent’s mental illness.</p>
<p>The second main topic identified from the analysis of the adolescents’ communication was that the adolescents not only used the online self-help group to share their experiences of suffering but also actively discussed solutions and strategies for handling the challenges. The adolescents explained how they actively tried to deal with the family situation. Nevertheless, they also emphasized the difficulty of always being required to handle the consequences of the mental illness, especially when acute, difficult situations arose. They expressed in the group that sometimes their painful feelings were too overwhelming, they felt helpless, and it was hard to manage under the circumstances.</p>
<p>In light of new childhood studies, however, which view children as active, competent actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420736">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311420736">Prout, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311420736">Qvortrup, 1994</xref>), the adolescents’ use of the group to ask for advice, as well as to discuss both the opportunities for action and the challenges in coping with the situation, can be considered as an active, crucial strategy in itself. The adolescents also acknowledged how the group discussions about strategies inspired new reflections on how to handle the situation. Based on these aspects, I find it reasonable to argue that the adolescents did not just passively experience their challenging everyday lives, but were active and competent actors in their efforts to manage their respective family situation. They were active participants in handling their family life by taking responsibility for the household, caring for younger siblings, or taking a time-out when their own difficult emotions were too overwhelming. Through their discussions, mutual support, and sharing of experiences in the self-help group, it can be considered that they took on roles as “competent advisers” to their peers.</p>
<p>Some of the strategies the adolescents actively used to manage their family situations—such as taking responsibility, being in “emergency alert mode,” and taking time out—resonate with practices identified in other studies of children living with parents who have physical or mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311420736">Almvik &amp; Ytterhus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420736">Backett-Milburn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311420736">Evans &amp; de Souza, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). Almvik and Ytterhus found that children used two types of strategies for coping with their parent’s mental illness: strategies of adjustment, where they tried to take responsibility to help the family achieve balance, and strategies of avoidance, where they withdrew from the situations at home. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch and Hall (2008)</xref> have demonstrated that to avoid being engulfed by their parents’ problems, children and adolescents managed their experiences by both “finding a rhythm” and trying to “maintain the frame.” Through monitoring and adjusting themselves to their parents’ behavior, they sought to find a rhythm with their parents to maintain the family stability. In addition, they used the strategy of maintaining the frame in trying to create a safe distance from their parents without disrupting their relationships with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). Despite the variations in categorizations of practices for managing everyday life with a mentally ill parent, findings from these studies give reasons to emphasize children’s and adolescents’ efforts to take active roles in the family, and their repertoire of strategies to handle their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The adolescents’ experiences of the consequences of their parent’s mental illness presented in the self-help group also indicate the importance of considering the context of their situation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311420736">Harden (2005)</xref> has suggested, the experiences of those who care for someone with a mental health problem must be contextualized in terms of gaining a wider understanding of parenting, childhood, and the nature of mental health problems. In my study, the adolescents’ experiences of the emotional consequences were influenced by the context of a lack of information and openness in their environments, and the taboos and stigma attached to mental health problems in society. The experiences discussed in the self-help group also reflected the complexity of the adolescents’ everyday lives in having a mentally ill parent, and the tension between suffering and active management of the family situation.</p>
<p>One example underlining this contextual complexity is the adolescents’ experience of taking responsibility in the family through a periodic and unpredictable role as carer. This aspect illustrates the complexity in the relationship between children and parents, which provides insight into parenting in families with mental illness. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420736">Backett-Milburn et al. (2008)</xref> have highlighted the importance of understanding the carer role of children and adolescents as not a simple story of “deparented” parents and “parentified” children, but as a complex of permeable, shifting boundaries between parents and children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311420736">Aldridge (2008)</xref> has argued for the need to move away from simplistic representations of children with caring responsibility so as to understand the complexity in their needs and caring experiences. In a study of maternal chronic pain, the children’s experiences were described as being both a source of stress and an opportunity for growth and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311420736">Evans &amp; de Souza, 2008</xref>), which illustrates the complexity of this issue.</p>
<p>In light of the two main topics identified in this online self-help context, I find it reasonable to argue that these adolescents can be considered as suffering and vulnerable because of their experienced emotional and practical consequences of the family situation, as well as competent, active participants in managing their complex and challenging life situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al. (2006)</xref> have suggested that children with mentally ill parents should not be situated only as victims, but also as active participants in their family life. However, based on the body of literature about severe outcomes of parental mental illness on children and these children’s increased risk for developing a mental illness themselves, there are well-founded reasons for concern about the conditions in which they grow up. The difficult challenges experienced by the adolescents in my study, particularly their painful feelings along with the lack of information and openness, support this concern. However, I also suggest that their active discussions and practices of strategies to handle their everyday lives are illustrative of a need to make visible the competence and activity of children and adolescents with mentally ill parents.</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone et al. (2009)</xref>, however, I argue that the adolescents’ roles as active participants in managing their challenging lives must not become an excuse for health care services to avoid their responsibility to support these families. Even though the adolescents are active and competent participants in finding strategies to handle difficult emotions in challenging family situations, it is also necessary to be aware of their vulnerability in such actions. The need for strategies to help themselves is an indication of their lonely position; therefore, such strategies should be assessed as to whether they are constructive or unhealthy. The strategy of being in “emergency alert mode” is one example. The adolescents’ active responsibility for their own well-being, as well as that of their family, can certainly also become too heavy a burden (Fjone et al.).</p>
<p>Bearing these considerations in mind, my main argument in this article is that to increase the knowledge about parental mental illness it will be useful to supplement the existing risk and resilience research with studies that explore children’s and adolescents’ own perspectives and experiences in their everyday lives. Taking their voices into account provides valuable insights into perspectives that differ from those of parents or health professionals. I also suggest the importance of immediate attention to the context of family situations and the complexity of children’s and adolescents’ everyday lives with a mentally ill parent.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to increase knowledge about the perspectives and experiences of children and adolescents living with mentally ill parents. It is based on an exploration of the online communication in a self-help group between adolescents living with a mentally ill parent. Explorative research has limitations. For example, in this study the material was obtained in the context of an action-oriented approach. Consequently, there is a need to account for that, as it is reasonable to assume that the communication in the group was influenced by this context. The participants were also self-recruited, with no restriction on gender, and only one boy chose to participate. I suggest that the gender issue should be explored in future research about participation in online and offline self-help groups, and when addressing the everyday experiences of children and adolescents with mentally ill parents.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the study findings provide important insights into the complex and challenging lives of these adolescents, which were experienced as profoundly influenced by their parents’ mental illness. In particular, I suggest the importance of directing attention to the emotional experiences of living in such family situations, which the adolescents emphasized as a heavy burden. Additionally, their troubled emotions were made worse through the lack of information and openness given about their parent’s mental illness. However, it became apparent that the adolescents were also active in finding strategies to manage their challenging family situation, and they can be regarded as both vulnerable and active participants in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>In accordance with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420736">Fjone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420736">Gladstone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>), I argue for the importance of including the perspectives of children and adolescents in research on parental mental illness. Taking their perspectives into consideration will make their experiences more visible and provide important means to improve health care for families living with mental illness. These adolescents’ experiences of lack of information and openness about their parent’s mental illness support a body of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311420736">Hetherington &amp; Baistow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311420736">Knutsson-Medin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311420736">Mordoch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311420736">Mordoch &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>), and indicate that information must be a main issue in the follow-up of families with parental mental illness. Moreover, these adolescents’ experiences of being alone with their difficult emotional challenges add an important dimension that must be taken into account in further efforts to improve health care services for children and adolescents living with mentally ill parents.</p>
