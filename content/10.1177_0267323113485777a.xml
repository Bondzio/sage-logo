<p>When I started writing this review (mid-December 2012), a number of important developments concerning the Internet were taking place. The World Conference on International Telecommunications convened in Dubai to decide whether to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations and hand the International Telecommunication Union (a UN specialist agency) a role in Internet governance. In Britain, the House of Commons warned that the government’s proposed Defamation Bill could adversely affect online freedom of expression, and separately two Parliamentary Committees strongly criticized the unjustifiably wide scope of the draft Communications Data Bill (so-called ‘Snoopers Bill’). These developments are not surprising. As Internet penetration and significance grow, calls to regulate it increase.</p>
<p>Mansell’s book is therefore extremely timely and welcome. It focuses on policy questions and its principal contribution is the elaboration of a clear multidisciplinary framework through which one can make sense of the policy issues and debates surrounding the Internet. She is not interested in the nitty-gritty of a specific policy topic, though in her analysis she discusses several policy debates and problems.</p>
<p>The book builds on Mansell’s extensive and distinguished contributions to academic research and actual policy. Mansell draws on a very different set of disciplinary perspectives, including media and communication, philosophy, economics, cybernetics and science fiction. She offers a refreshingly comprehensive and historically informed account of the choices that influence the way the communication system is mediating people’s lives.</p>
<p>The book is structured into three main parts. Chapters 1 and 2 set out the aims and context. Chapters 3 and 4 detail the analytical framework which the empirical part then uses to examine the social imaginaries of the information society from different perspectives (Chapters 5–7). The concluding chapter summarizes the main arguments.</p>
<p>Mansell’s interest is in the way people imagine their social existence through visions of the information society. She adopts Charles Taylor’s concept of ‘social imaginary’ (elaborated in Chapter 3) to refer to ‘the deeper normative notions and images’ (p. 5) of those engaged with developments in the information society in order to assess how these shape the way digital technologies are used and the way they mediate people’s social existence. She sets out to ‘unmask’ the interests and fallacies behind the two prevailing visions of the information society: one focusing on economic growth and favouring market exchange and private ownership of information, and the other emphasizing non-market relations and an information commons. Her aim is not to test the validity of one against the other but to explain them and propose an alternative reconciling social imaginary that can simultaneously promote economic growth as well as social justice and equitable distribution of information.</p>
<p>Mansell argues that despite the different emphasis, both contending social imaginaries neglect two paradoxes: the paradox of information scarcity (digital information is costly to produce but virtually costless to reproduce) and the paradox of complexity (the intrinsic benefits from the emergent complexity of the communication system associated with decentralization and loss of human control, and the simultaneous search for enhanced control through behind-the-screen programme options).</p>
<p>At the heart of both imaginaries rests an understanding of technological change. The exogenous model understands change as an external shock to society, economy and culture and thus it cannot explain it. Innovation relates to improvements in information processing such as increased speed of producing and transmitting digital information. Research focuses on quantifiable changes in the economy and society such as measuring the impact of technological change on economic growth and productivity (instrumental research). Technological change is ‘autonomous to the social system’ and at the same time technological improvements provide the answer to various social and economic problems. Since technological change is exogenous, it is the unfettered market (not policy intervention) and strong private intellectual property rights that are best able to spur innovation and empower individual users.</p>
<p>The endogenous model treats technological change differently. This model is often more critical and focuses on the interactions and interdependencies within a complex system. It takes into account dynamic power relationships and human agency. For this model, innovation in a complex system is best left to human agents (communities of online participants) on the basis of information sharing and commons-based peer production.</p>
<p>In order to explain the genesis of paradoxes and their implications, Mansell proposes a critical systems framework building on systems theory and endogenous economic perspectives (Chapter 4). She argues that ‘the social imaginary can be regarded as a set of rules and norms through which relationships of power are organized and “evolve”’ (p. 78). Put differently, contradictions and the origins of paradoxes are ‘understood as being generated by different positions in a hierarchy of power relationships’ (p. 81).</p>
<p>Mansell uses the next three chapters to explain the genesis of paradoxes. Chapter 5 discusses the role of the communication system in everyday life. It examines the social imaginaries of the interactions ‘in front of’ the screen (e.g. people’s interactions with computer, mobile phone, etc. screens and associated narratives) and ‘behind’ the screen (e.g. the underlying infrastructure, hardware and software). The aim is to reveal ‘differences in what is being assumed about human choice and control over the mediated environment’ as well as to offer ‘insights into the differing interests of participants in the evolution of the communication system’ (p. 95).</p>
<p>Mansell, for instance, is sceptical of the social imaginary of the information society that perceives everyone as a content creator and emphasizes the enormous potential for plurality, participation and deliberation. She explains that critical research offers a different interpretation of these developments: it explores how software and hardware developers, state and corporate interests shape the online experience, delineate the ‘empowering’ potential of communication, and often capitalize on the online activity (e.g. state surveillance for security reasons, collection of personal data for profit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323113485777">1</xref></sup>). This interpretation also differs from the dominant social imaginary where much of the responsibility rests with empowered individual users who, for instance, control privacy settings, or the vision of openness and transparency in the political sphere and the rise of new forms of accountability through wikis, (micro)blogs, social networking sites, citizen journalism, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323113485777">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The book makes a strong case against technological determinism, the view of technology as neutral and empowering. Mansell emphasizes the frequent disregard by instrumental research in particular of what goes on ‘behind the screen’ and how hardware and software influence ‘people’s tastes and aesthetic values, similar to the conventions in the mass media era’ (p. 103).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323113485777">3</xref></sup> She argues that ‘online interactions involve managed forms of activity that constrain the diversity of productive forms of online engagement’ (p. 103).</p>
<p>Mansell also reminds us of the mere enabling role of ICTs and the need for them to be linked to other public policies (like training and financing) in order to begin to make a real beneficial difference, and the risk that digital technologies may end up creating new hierarchies.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 assesses how the conflicts between the opposing social imaginaries manifest themselves in disagreements over the development of the communication system behind the screen. She uses two examples (the enforcement of copyright on the Internet and a European initiative for an open digital system) to show that, contrasting the assumption of the dominant social imaginary, the communication system is not self-organizing and the users in-front-of-the-screen are not merely information processors. Rather, power rests with human beings (and not a neutral self-evolving system) and the wider power relationships of the complex system (paradox of complexity) manage to subvert the values of collaboration and openness which threaten the economic interests of companies that rely on online environments that support information scarcity.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 investigates how the conflicting social imaginaries of the information society manifest themselves in debates about the goals for public (Internet) policy and looks at, amongst others, the ICANN, the IGF, ACTA, the ITU and WSIS, and network neutrality.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter, Mansell suggests a way forward towards a new social imaginary of the information society, an imaginary that can help minimize the harms and maximize the benefits. For her, the solution lies in acknowledging the presence of the paradoxes and in recognizing the inevitability of conflict among stakeholders with different interests and the persistence of asymmetric power relations in a multi-level complex system. This will facilitate adaptive action (as opposed to curative action) and will lead to a reconciliation of conflicting interests so that neither prevailing imaginary is the absolute winner, if one ever could be.</p>
<p>Mansell identifies three urgent areas for adaptive action which can foster a new social imaginary. This is a call for action for all stakeholders. First, regarding monopolies of knowledge, Mansell maintains that instead of emphasis on investment in hardware and software to stimulate economic growth and democratic values, action should start by distinguishing among – as opposed to conflating – ‘tools, information, and knowledge’, understanding that information is a component of the multiple knowledges that are essential for learning, and aim to foster ‘the capabilities of people to make sense of their mediated environment’(p. 186).</p>
<p>Second, adaptive action to facilitate online creativity should aim at serving the values of the market exchange model as well as the information commons model and thus offer incentives for both the production and the sharing of digital information.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to action to augment the human mind, Mansell calls for a new social imaginary which would consider more comprehensively how much surveillance for commercial, policing or security reasons is justified, how excesses might infringe human rights, and how action to curtail such excesses is possible and necessary. Finally, a new social imaginary would address the question of accountability of the various stakeholders in front of and behind the screen, be they the state, hardware developers, software programmers, ISPs, but also hacker and other online communities, etc.</p>
<p>In sum, Mansell’s book is about the historic, profound and enduring conflicts over norms, values and accountability in the field of mediated communications (focusing on the Internet) and how these have been informing policy positions and (non-)actions. This makes the book timely and essential reading for a variety of audiences interested in Internet (policy) studies: academics, students but also policy makers and stakeholders. Her clear and rigorous analysis of the broader questions aims to offer a solid critical analytic, and yet realistic, framework for contributions to policy debates and possibly interventions which will transcend the false dichotomy between the two prevailing social imaginaries and help promote the Internet’s potential for economic and human prosperity.</p>
