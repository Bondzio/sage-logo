<p>A discussion about the current state of special education, more specifically the field of emotional and behavior disabilities (EBD), in Australia cannot take place without first providing an overview of the Australian education system. Education comes under the jurisdiction of state and territory responsibility. The federal government coordinates education and funding for students with disabilities, including EBD, but does not provide any direct services or dictate how services must be provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451211423810">Conway, 2006</xref>). Schools in the states and territories are either public (i.e., government) or private, with the private sector made up of religious (mostly Catholic) and independent schools. Schools in both categories charge fees and receive government funding, but private schools receive less and therefore charge higher fees than public schools. All three types of schools (public, private religious, and private independent) provide education for students with special learning needs, but how these services are provided varies by state, region, and school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451211423810">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451211423810">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Most public education providers in the different states and territories offer student support through the use of a needs-based system. This is often done without categorizing students with high-incidence disabilities. Many use the term “learning difficulties” to describe any difficulty in learning, academic or behavioral, and provide services to each student on an individual basis through the use of learning-support teachers, behavioral specialists, and/or teacher aides. Proponents of this noncategorical system contend that providing services in this manner enables them to bring assistance to more students and more quickly than if they were tied up in the red tape of eligibility requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211423810">Graham &amp; Bailey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, the label “special education” has ceased to exist in many state education jurisdictions in Australia, as the educational systems strive for inclusivity. Important federal legislation such as the Disability Discrimination Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451211423810">Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department, 1992</xref>) and, later, the Disability Standards for Education 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211423810">Commonwealth of Australia, 2006</xref>) provide a framework to ensure that students with disabilities can access education on the same basis as other students. The standards apply to all schools in Australia, public and private, at all levels from preschool to higher education and adult education. Although the standards require all education providers to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are treated equally with their typical peers, the guidelines are broad and leave the specifics of interpretation and implementation up to the states and local education agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1053451211423810">
<title>The Problem of Definition</title>
<p>There are currently several definitions of disability in Australia, each defining disability broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451211423810">Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department, 2010</xref>). This causes confusion, as various definitions are applied to qualify individuals for services, such as social security or special education. Each state has varied definitions of disabilities, depending on the agency doing the defining (e.g., health, education, government). The terms <italic>emotional disorder</italic> and <italic>behavior disorder</italic> not only have no agreed-upon definitions but also are not universally accepted as categories. Additional terms that are commonly used are (a) <italic>mental health disorder</italic>, (b) <italic>mental health concerns</italic>, (c) <italic>disruptive behavior disorder</italic>, (d) <italic>conduct disorder</italic>, and (e) <italic>socially unacceptable behaviors</italic>. To make things even more confusing, there is often a lack of distinction between students with behavior problems in regular classes and those receiving the majority of their education in a special setting. In New South Wales, for example, the term <italic>behavior disorder</italic> is used in mainstream settings, whereas the term <italic>emotional disturbance</italic> is used in special classes and schools.</p>
<p>This lack of agreement of definitions and terms makes it difficult to determine the actual prevalence or incidence of EBD in the population. Prevalence rates are usually determined using mental health figures, the most current indicating that 14% of Australian children and adolescents experience mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451211423810">ABS, 2007</xref>). Prevalence rates in schools show that behavior disorder is the most represented disability category in all states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451211423810">Conway, 2006</xref>). Boys are twice as likely to be referred for special behavior services than girls, and age does not seem to be an influence, with the number of students receiving services remaining consistent from primary to secondary school levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451211423810">Conway, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451211423810">
<title>Eligibility and Placement</title>
<p>Because all students begin in regular education settings, it falls on the general education teacher to initially identify students with behavior problems. Once identified, a formal process is initiated. This process may vary from region to region but usually involves a placement panel consisting of district-level behavior specialists, parents, special school teachers/principal, and the child’s regular education teacher/principal. There are no laws or regulations in any state or territory that mandate an individualized education program (IEP), functional behavior assessment (FBA), or behavior intervention plan (BIP). The general feeling among Australian educators seems to be that following a legal process does not automatically produce successful outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451211423810">Conway, 2006</xref>). Most educational authorities have implemented the parts of these processes that they feel are most advantageous to the students they serve, without being held to an inflexible process mandated by law. Parents ultimately have the last word about where their children are placed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451211423810">
<title>Resources and Supports</title>
<p>Available placement options throughout the country are as varied as terms and definitions. Some educational providers are very much inclusive, educating students with EBD in the mainstream setting with support, whereas others offer a range of settings, from an in-class teacher’s aide to a residential placement. Many students with EBD are receiving their education in Australian schools without any disability label. This is mostly due to the lack of a universal definition for emotional and behavioral disability. Rather than identifying and labeling students with EBD, schools may assign a <italic>learning support teacher</italic> (LST), who usually has graduate-level special education training, for students who display difficulty learning, either academically or behaviorally. These LSTs can consult with the regular classroom teacher, coteach, provide intensive one-on-one tutoring, or assist the student with behavioral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211423810">Graham &amp; Bailey, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211423810">Graham and Bailey (2007)</xref> mentioned that the advantages of this “at-risk” model for intervention include that it (a) identifies students who are at risk, rather than students who have a particular label; (b) provides the ability to give students assistance immediately, rather than waiting for them to complete an eligibility process; (c) supplies valuable professional development to the general education teacher; (d) minimizes time-consuming bureaucratic procedures; and (e) pays close attention to the needs and progress of the student. Examples of available supports in each state are summarized below.</p>
<sec id="section5-1053451211423810">
<title>Australian Capital Territory</title>
<p>Students with EBD in Australian Capital Territory receive support and services under the category of mental health condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451211423810">Australian Capital Territory Education and Training, 2008</xref>). Once eligible for services, each student must have an individual learning plan (ILP) to identify individual needs, goals, and priorities. Placement options appear to be very similar to those offered in the Northern Territories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451211423810">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>New South Wales</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451211423810">NSW Department of Education and Training (2007)</xref>, there are several resources and settings available to serve students with EBD. Tutorial centers provide short-term intervention for students who are having difficulty maintaining appropriate behavior in an inclusive setting. These centers are attached to a mainstream school. Behavior schools support students with severe disruptive behavior who have exhausted all other regional support provisions, or for whom a risk assessment indicates that placement is required. The aim of these schools is to develop appropriate attitudes and behaviors so that students can be returned to mainstream settings or transitioned to other educational or employment opportunities. Emotional disturbance schools, classes, and programs offer a variety of support based on student need and require students to have confirmed mental health problems and/or disorders. As of this writing, NSW had the greatest number of special schools and centers, with 24 tutorial centers and 35 schools for students with EBD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451211423810">
<title>Northern Territories</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451211423810">Department of Education and Training (DET) Northern Territories (2010)</xref> described a number of supports that are available to students with EBD (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451211423810">Table 1</xref>). This continuum is very similar to the continuum of services available in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451211423810">
<title>Queensland</title>
<p>A visit to Queensland’s Department of Education website revealed that EBD is not included as a category of disability under the Education Adjustment Program (EAP) and is therefore not subject to the identification process used for students with other categories of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451211423810">Queensland Government Department of Education and Training, 2010</xref>). All schools are required to have an approved <italic>responsible behavior plan for students</italic>, which includes a range of responses, including whole school, targeted, and intensive behavior support. Behavior support staff members are also deployed to schools based on each region’s enrollments and need. Students who display severe behaviors that interfere with their own or others’ ability to learn may access their studies in a <italic>positive learning centre</italic> (PLC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451211423810">
<title>South Australia</title>
<p>The Government of South Australia Department of Education and Children’s Services (2010) also does not list EBD as a category of disability on its website. Support for students with behavioral issues is available through interagency behavior support coordinators, who (a) develop and present professional development programs on behavior management, (b) assist in the development of behavior change plans, (c) support teachers in providing skill development programs, (d) manage referrals of students to out of school support programs, and (e) assist with reintegration after exclusion. Another available resource is Adolescent Services, which is an interagency venture between the Department of Education, Training, &amp; Employment and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Two services are provided, a day program for students with primary emotional or behavior disorders, and a hospital-to-home transition team that works with young people who have severe mental health issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451211423810">
<title>Tasmania</title>
<p>Students with EBD in Tasmania may receive services under either Generalist Services Category B, which are services provided noncategorically for students with high-incidence disabilities, or under the psychiatric disability category of the Register of Students With Severe Disability, which provides more intensive services for students who have a confirmed psychiatric diagnosis from a qualified psychiatrist and have highly significant educational implications resulting from the identified disorder. Students receiving services based on Category B eligibility are usually educated in inclusive environments with supports. Many times these students will have an IEP to guide their studies. Students receiving services based on the Register of Students With Severe Disability are educated in inclusive or special schools, depending on the extent of their need for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451211423810">Tasmania Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451211423810">
<title>Victoria</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451211423810">Victoria Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (2010)</xref> website details services available to students with severe behavior disorders. These students are supported in either their mainstream home school or a special school, depending on their individual needs. To be eligible for services, students are required to have a statement of clinical opinion from a psychologist, a statement from the school principal regarding student progress, and a specific and detailed Student Management Plan that outlines required supports. Funding for support can be used to provide specialist staff, professional development for teachers, special equipment, or teacher aides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1053451211423810">
<title>Western Australia</title>
<p>Statewide Specialist Services provide support for students with EBD through teams of visiting teachers and support officers working from the Centre for Inclusive Schooling and Hospital School Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451211423810">Department of Education Western Australia, 2010</xref>). The Centre for Inclusive Schooling provides direct services to students in inclusive settings as well as professional development to staff and online research, information, and resources. Hospital School Services provides support to students whose mental health prevents them from participating in a more inclusive educational setting, as well as assisting with reintegration to an inclusive setting.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1053451211423810">
<title>Current Initiatives</title>
<p>Some states have begun the process of implementing <italic>school-wide positive behavior support</italic> (SWPBS) in some of their schools. As a “decision making framework that guides selection, integration, and implementation of the best evidence-based academic and behavioral practices for improving important academic and behavior outcomes for all students” (Office of Special Education Programs [OSEP], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451211423810">Queensland Government Department of Education and Training, 2010</xref>), SWPBS emphasizes data-based decision-making and evidenced-based practices. It is based on a three-tiered continuum of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, where students experience different levels of support based on their response to academic and behavioral intervention. If a student’s behavior is not responsive to primary level prevention, more intensive supports are provided via specialized group contingencies (second tier) or intense individualized plans (third tier).</p>
<p>Many schools in NSW list themselves as SWPBS schools on their websites. More formally, the University of Western Sydney in partnership with the NSW DET (Greater Western Sydney) is implementing SWPBS in eight high schools and eight primary schools as part of an Australian Research Council (ARC) linkage grant. Tasmania and Queensland have formed an interstate partnership to support SWPBS in both states, under the direct support of the OSEP Center for Positive Behavioral Interventions &amp; Supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451211423810">Queensland Government Department of Education and Training, 2010</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451211423810">Northern Territory DET (2010)</xref> website lists eight schools that have implemented SWPBS in 2010. Queensland hosted a SWPBS conference in 2010; hopefully, it helped to raise awareness and increase implementation of the SWPBS philosophy.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Australian Government passed the Australian Curriculum, Assessment, and Reporting Authority Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451211423810">Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department, 2008</xref>), which formed the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). ACARA is tasked with creating a national curriculum from kindergarten to Year 12, a national assessment program to measure students’ progress through the curriculum, and a national data collection and reporting program. Meeting the needs of all students while developing and implementing a national curriculum is proving to be a challenge. The first drafts of the proposed <italic>National Curriculum</italic> made no mention of the 20% of Australia’s students who have been identified as having special education needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211423810">ACARA, 2010</xref>). They have since rectified this by creating a committee to assist in correcting this oversight. One of the hopes is that this will lead to an Australia-wide definition of disabilities that will include established categories such as emotional and behavioral disorders, since lack of agreement on definition affects funding and the reporting of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451211423810">Thomas, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1053451211423810" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Due to the disparity of definitions and services across Australia, it is difficult to determine if students with EBD are receiving suitable educational supports. Both the current literature and state educational agency websites reveal that some states do not recognize EBD as a disability category and that often the onus is on the parents/guardians to provide evidence of eligibility for services. This situation could be limiting the educational support that students with EBD receive. A national definition of emotional and behavioral disabilities would provide some uniformity in identification and, hopefully, improvement in available services.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what other positive changes will occur nationally. With the proposed <italic>National Curriculum</italic> also comes a set of <italic>National Teacher Standards</italic>. It is expected that these standards will mandate much needed inclusive education training for preservice teachers across the country. This training is necessary to provide students with EBD in inclusive settings with the evidence-based practices imperative to their success. It is the hope of special education stakeholders that these national initiatives will produce a universal definition, mandatory special education training for all teachers, and uniform reporting and data collection, resulting in better provisions of service and outcomes for students with EBD in Australia.</p>
