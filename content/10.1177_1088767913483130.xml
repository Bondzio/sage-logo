<abstract>
<p>This article describes homicide-suicide among those aged 65 years and older in the United States using archival data from 1968 to 1975. Comparisons were made between 184 homicide-suicides and 400 randomly selected victims of all other types of homicide. The findings indicate that homicide-suicides occurred predominantly in the family unit, especially involving female spouses, and among White victims and offenders. Handguns and other firearms were the weapon of choice in homicide-suicides.</p>

<p>Homicide-suicide is defined as an incident or event whereby a person commits a homicide that is then followed by the person’s suicide. Homicide-suicide is a rare but serious form of interpersonal violence. It involves the death of the suspect, but also the death of one or more victims, frequently spouses and/or family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767913483130">Barraclough &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767913483130">Brock, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767913483130">Liem (2010)</xref> provides a description of four generally discussed types of homicide-suicides: (a) intimate partner, (b) child homicide-suicides, (C) familicide-suicides, and (d) extrafamilial homicide-suicides. Extrafamilial homicide-suicides include school and workplace homicides characterized by the killing of a number of classmates/fellow workers, friends, and acquaintances in school or work settings.</p>
<p>Homicide-suicides have received much less attention in research and theory in comparison to homicides or suicides. One reason is that there is no national count of homicide-suicides (although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767913483130">Marzuk, Tardiff, &amp; Hirsch, 1992</xref>, estimated between 1,000 and 1,500 homicide-suicides per year). Better empirically based counts, although not national, are found in the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wisqars.cdc.gov:8080/nvdrs/nvdrsDisplay.jsp">http://wisqars.cdc.gov:8080/nvdrs/nvdrsDisplay.jsp</ext-link>). For 16 states from 2005 through 2009, the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) file recorded information on 901 homicide-suicides (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html">http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>According to the seminal article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767913483130">Marzuk et al. (1992)</xref>, a short time span between the suicide and homicide is needed to suggest a causal connection. For the present study no data were available for the time interval between the death of a homicide victim and that of a suicide suspect. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767913483130">Marzuk et al. (1992)</xref> required that the suicide should follow the murder within 1 week to distinguish homicides that are linked to the suicide from violent events in which individuals with a history of violence commit suicide for other reasons. In a review of the homicide-suicide literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767913483130">Riedel (2010)</xref> found that nearly all studies conducted since the Marzuk et al. publication followed the 1-week requirement.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of earlier studies in which the numbers of elderly homicide victims and suicide suspects are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767913483130">Berman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767913483130">Bourget, Gagné&amp; Whitehurst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767913483130">Brown &amp;Barraclough, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767913483130">Malphurs &amp; Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767913483130">West, 1965</xref>). Of these, most were considered to be “mercy killings” and the result of suicide pacts or altruistic homicide-suicides among older and ailing spouses. However, things may be changing with regard to elderly violence given reports in Florida where rates seem to be increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767913483130">Bourget, Gagné, &amp; Whitehurst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767913483130">Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767913483130">Cohen, Llorente, &amp; Eisdorfer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767913483130">Malphurs, Eisdorfer, &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>). What makes the problem of elderly violence an emerging public issue in the United States is the projected large increase in the elderly population. One major source of the increase is the first of the baby boomers (born between 1945 and 1965) turning 65 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767913483130">Brookings Institute Metropolitan Policy Program, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767913483130">Frey, 2007</xref>). This is on top of the increase produced by the World War II generation (born between 1936 and 1945) becoming part of the 65 years and older group. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767913483130">Frey (2007)</xref>, there is expected to be a 15% increase in the over 65 population from 2000 to 2010 and an over a 35% increase in the decade that follows (i.e., 2010 to 2020). The projections are that the elderly population increase will finally start to decline in the decade 2020 to 2030.</p>
<p>Despite the projected large increase in the elderly population, the state of knowledge and policies pertaining to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation are sadly lacking. There are no comprehensive national data, definitions of elder abuse vary, and state statistics vary as there is no uniform reporting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088767913483130">National Research Council, 2003</xref>). Compared to the child abuse movement that prompted extensive investigation and publicity, elder abuse has received relatively little attention in the medical and legal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767913483130">Shields, Hunsaker, &amp; Hunsaker, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are four interrelated problems with the knowledge base on homicide-suicides. More recent studies have addressed some of the methodological shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767913483130">Liem, Postulart, &amp; Nieuwbeerta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088767913483130">Logan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767913483130">Stack, 1997</xref>). While the preceding focused on all types of homicide-suicides and compared them to both homicides and suicides, two studies have researched intimate partner homicide-suicides, the most frequent type, but have compared their results only to homicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767913483130">Dawson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund &amp; Smorodinsky, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, homicide-suicides fall between the typical boundaries of two disciplines, public health and criminology, and have been studied independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767913483130">Liem, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767913483130">Riedel, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767913483130">Stack (1997</xref>, p. 435) indicated, “Research on homicide has tended to neglect suicide and the research on suicide has neglected homicide.” Falling between the boundaries of areas of inquiry has left the topic of homicide-suicide with no national data, serious methodological shortcomings, and finally the absence of a theoretical approach that explains homicide-suicides.</p>
<p>Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767913483130">Liem (2010)</xref> reviewed theories of strain, the stream analogy for lethal violence, psychodynamic theories, social integration theories, and psycho-evolutionary theories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767913483130">Liem (2010</xref> p. 159) concluded: “Each of these theories alone, however, is unable to provide a full understanding of the homicide-suicide phenomenon.” It seems unlikely that theories reviewed by Liem can explain the homicide-suicides of this highly diverse group. Other than involving males and imputed mental illness, what do “going postal” workplace homicides have in common with intimate partner homicide-suicides? What is particularly problematic about including both workplace and school shootings is the apparently random selection of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767913483130">Newman, Fox, Harding, Mehta, &amp; Roth, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A fourth problem is that much of the research has relied on small samples. Prior to the emergence of the NVDRS, most of the research on homicide-suicides had to rely on data extracted from medical examiner case records, and each homicide and suicide had to be linked together manually. This has meant that many studies of homicide-suicides are limited to local data sites, primarily cities or counties, without comparison groups, with very small samples, and a heavy emphasis on description. To avoid the latter limitations, some studies used newspapers to help corroborate homicide-suicides or supplemented their analysis with data obtained from the newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767913483130">Malphurs &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767913483130">Riedel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, research on elderly homicide-suicides has been sparse and historical studies of elderly homicide-suicides have been rarer. The present study addresses this issue by analyzing a nationwide data base of homicide-suicides using data from 1968 to 1975. Finding a contemporary comparison was difficult. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767913483130">Cohen et al. (1998)</xref> used a data set of 171 homicide-suicides from seven Florida counties from 1988 to 1994. However, reporting of characteristics and comparison with homicides and suicides was highly descriptive and broken into two geographical regions that mean little to a general audience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767913483130">Malphurs et al. (2001)</xref> compared older married male perpetrators who committed suicides with those who committed homicide-suicides, which limits comparisons because the data set used in the current study focuses only on victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767913483130">Malphurs and Cohen (2005)</xref> completed a statewide case control study of 20 spousal homicide-suicides of Floridians aged 55 years and older and compared the results to suicides rather than homicides which, in addition to the small numbers, limited the comparisons with homicides. From 1992 to 2007, researchers using data from coroners’ files identified 27 cases of homicide committed by an older spouse or family member aged 65 years or older in Quebec, Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767913483130">Bourget et al. (2010)</xref>. The findings from the current article are compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky’s (2001)</xref> research comparing intimate partner homicides and intimate partner homicide-suicides in California.</p>
<sec id="section1-1088767913483130" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In a nationwide homicide research project that covered the period 1968 through 1978, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088767913483130">Riedel and Zahn (1994)</xref> analyzed the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088767913483130">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of changes in the SHR in 1976, there were no data collected for homicide-suicide after 1975. Riedel and Zahn’s data files were subsequently filed with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. These ICPSR files were downloaded and data on homicide-suicides were separated from all other types of homicide from 1968 through 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767913483130">Bridges &amp; Lester, 2011</xref>). Between 1968 and 1975, there were 2,215 homicide-suicide events out of 123,467 homicides among persons of all ages.</p>
<p>The research question in this study asks: “What factors distinguish elderly homicide victims in homicide-suicides from older victims of all other types of homicide?” Variables examined include sociodemographic characteristics of the victims such as age, race, and gender, the type of weapon used (i.e., cause of death), and the circumstances surrounding the deaths. The original data consisted of 6,703 elderly homicides and 184 elderly homicide-suicides, defined as aged 65 years and over. However, to avoid any statistical problem created by having such a large number of homicides to compare with such a small number of homicide-suicides, a random sample of 400 homicides was selected and merged with the file of 184 homicide-suicides.</p>
<p>With older data from the SHR, there is little evidence of reliability from other studies. While there may be omissions or other forms of error, it could be argued that homicide-suicide events are so rare that they appear in the data as a result of curiosity of law enforcement. Of course, with a dead offender, the offense is easily cleared. To determine some measure of the accuracy of the data, the literature was searched for research to compare datasets with a different origin such as police departmental records or medical examiner records.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767913483130">Block (1987)</xref> used a dataset created from police departmental records and reported on homicides in Chicago for the 1965 to 1981 time period. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767913483130">Stack (1997)</xref> used these data for analysis of 16,245 homicides (all ages) in Chicago from 1965 to 1990. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767913483130">Stack (1997)</xref> reported a total of 265 homicide-suicides of all ages in Chicago between 1965 and 1990. Of these 265 homicide-suicides there were eight victims who were 65 years of age and older. This is in exact agreement with the number of Chicago victims aged 65 years and older who were extracted from the dataset used here.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767913483130">Berman (1979)</xref> used data from police department death investigation reports and/or medical examiner files for all certified suicides for the years 1974 and 1975. He reported a total of 972 completed suicides for three cities—Washington, DC, Philadelphia, and Baltimore—during the 2-year study period. Of these nearly 1,000 completed suicides, Berman determined which of those met his criteria of “dyadic deaths” (i.e., homicide-suicides). He identified 15 cases of homicide-suicide in the three cities. The dataset used here includes 13 cases of homicide-suicide for the same cities. With that kind of agreement, limited though it may be, it seems logical to have some confidence in the estimated number of elderly homicides and homicide-suicides from 1968 to 1975 used in the present study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One of the major problems in this historic study was finding another study for comparing characteristics of elderly homicides to those of elderly homicide-suicides. One California study was found which compared characteristics of victims and perpetrators of intimate partner homicide and intimate partner homicide followed by suicide<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088767913483130">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund &amp; Smorodinsky, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767913483130">Bridges and Lester (2011)</xref> reported that of all the circumstances surrounding the deaths of victims (of all ages) in a homicide-suicide, the most common circumstance was “spouse killing spouse.” In their study, the circumstance “spouse killing spouse” accounted for 56% of homicide-suicides. However, this same circumstance only accounted for 11% of all homicides including homicide-suicides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1088767913483130">
<title>Age</title>
<p>The mean ages of the 400 homicide and 184 victims of homicide-suicide were 72.9 and 72.8 years, respectively; the SD for homicide victims was 6.6 years and for homicide-suicide victims it was 6.1 years (MS = 72.92 vs. 72.80; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>582</sub> = .197, two-tailed <italic>p</italic> = .844).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky (2001)</xref> provided a detailed breakdown by age for victims of intimate partner homicide and homicide followed by suicide. There were a total of only 11 victims of intimate partner homicide and intimate partner homicide followed by suicide among those aged 70 years and older in their California study. Only one (9.1%) of these was a victim in an intimate partner homicide, whereas 10 (90.9%) of these were victims in an intimate partner homicide followed by suicide. In contrast, the present study reports that for those aged 70 years and older 244 were victims of homicide and 119 were victims of homicide-suicides.</p>

<p>Approximately 122 (72%) of elderly homicide-suicides involve a spouse killing a spouse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1088767913483130">Table 4</xref>). Children killing their elderly parents accounted for 17 (10.0%) of the homicide-suicides.

<p>For the present statistical analysis, homicide-suicides were coded “1” and all other homicides were coded as “0.” Victim age was entered as a continuous variable. Males were coded “1” and females “0.” Victim race was coded “0” for Black and “1” for White. Weapons were coded into dummy variables for handguns, other firearms, cutting instruments, blunt instruments, and other weapons (the reference category). Similarly, victim/offender relationships were coded into dummy variables for spouses, parricide, family conflicts, other arguments, and other (the reference category).</p>
<p>As the binary logistic regression in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088767913483130">Table 5</xref> indicates, the age of victims was not significant. The race of the homicide victim was significantly related to the odds of homicide-suicide. Deaths in which the victim is an elderly White person are 4.355 times more likely to be a homicide-suicide. The gender of homicide victims was significantly related to the odds of homicide-suicides. Homicides in which a male is the elderly victim decreased the odds for homicide-suicide 0.098 times.</p>
<p>Weapons like handguns and other firearms were significantly related to the odds of elderly homicide-suicide; however, cutting instruments and blunt objects were not. The odds of a homicide-suicide increased 7.931 and 10.420 times for homicides involving a handgun and other firearms respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088767913483130">Table 5</xref>). Homicides in which an elderly spouse is the victim increased the odds for a homicide-suicide 92.235 times compared to homicides involving other circumstances. Parricides were 31.76 times more likely to be homicide-suicides compared to those involving other circumstances. Incidents involving family conflicts were 20.818 times more likely to be homicide-suicides and those involving other arguments were 16.12 times more likely to be homicide-suicides compared to incidents involving other circumstances.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Elderly homicide and elderly homicide followed by suicide have different characteristics and perhaps distinct causes. More research is needed to identify and clarify specific risk and protective factors in this population. Due to the complexity of these events a mixture of intervention approaches may be needed, including those prevention strategies that identify persons at risk for impulsive violent acts and persons at risk for planning another’s death and/or their own.</p>
<p>Homicide-suicide was least likely when elderly victims were Black and most likely when elderly victims were White. The same results for intimate partner homicide followed by suicide were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky’s (2001)</xref> once Hispanics and other victims were omitted from the data prior to analysis. Victims in their study were various ages to include those 70 years and older.</p>
<p>For comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky (2001)</xref>, the numbers of handguns and other firearms were pooled and relabeled “guns.” Similarly, the data for cutting instruments, blunt objects, and other were pooled and relabeled “other weapons.” Upon reanalysis homicide-suicide was most likely when the modus operandus or cause of death was a gun, that is, handguns and other firearms, and least likely due to the use of other weapons, for example, cutting instruments and blunt objects. These findings support those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky’s (2001)</xref> for intimate partner homicide followed by suicide. Other studies have concluded that homicide-suicides are a White man’s crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767913483130">Riedel, 2010</xref>). In general, the results of the present study and others support the view that homicide-suicides are for the most part the result of intimate partner violence, especially involving spouses. In addition, there is general agreement in the research literature on the use of handguns and other firearms as the weapon of choice in homicide-suicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767913483130">Bridges &amp; Lester, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767913483130">Liem, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767913483130">Riedel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767913483130">Cohen (2000</xref>, p. 6) reported that “predisposing risk factors include advanced age and a long-lived marriage where one or both members of the couple have real or perceived multiple health problems, as well as depression and other psychiatric problems in the perpetrator.Others reported risk factors for elderly homicide-suicides also included caregiver stress, living arrangements, desperation, depression, and other psychopathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767913483130">Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767913483130">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767913483130">Hiroeh, Appleby, Mortensen, &amp; Dunn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088767913483130">Paveza et. al., 1992</xref>; Stack, 2007).Still another Canadian study reported that several homicide victims had pre-existing mental illnesses as well as their perpetrator caregivers who were mentally ill with depressive disorder and who later committed suicide (Bourget, 2010).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088767913483130">Milroy (1995b)</xref> reported that most cases of elderly homicide-suicides were not related to violent relationships but to declining health and financial difficulties. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767913483130">Bourget et al. (2010)</xref> reported that elderly homicide in the context of spousal violence accounted for only 15 percent of the elderly homicide followed by a suicide. This finding for spousal violence in Quebec, Canada was not indicative of results reported for homicide-suicidein the United States.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767913483130">Cohen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767913483130">Malphurs et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund and Smorodinsky (2001</xref>, p. 459) reported that “Routine screening of this population to identify these problems may provide the opportunity for elderly couples coping with chronic disease, disability, depression, or financial strain to benefit from appropriate medical care and mental health services.” The American Medical Association has recommended that physicians and other health care providers routinely screen for domestic violence and abuse. In addition, physicians could perform lethality assessments and along with health care professionals perhaps refer batterers to treatment programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767913483130">Lund &amp; Smorodinsky, 2001</xref>). Identification of these services in the community and a willingness to refer patients to them would be important.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study is not without its limitations. Limited information was available by gender for suspects (offenders) of homicide-suicide events, that is, three were female and 15 were male with the gender being unknown for 166 out of the remaining 184 suspects. Likewise, extremely limited information was available on the gender of suspects (offenders) involved in all other types of homicide, that is, 56 were female and 224 were male with the gender being unknown for 6,423 out of the remaining 6,703 victims. Although the historic data contains in-depth and rarely available information on homicide victims involved in homicide-suicide events, the presence of additional information on the suspect and offense characteristics would have improved the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767913483130">Bridges &amp; Tankersley, 2010</xref>). Older married persons may face a lower risk of suicide than those widowed or divorced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767913483130">Kposowa, 2000</xref>). Perhaps, some marriages involving physical illness and caregiving may create such strain over time that the risk of homicide-suicide increases regardless of the age of the couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767913483130">Bourget et al., 2010</xref>). Homicide-suicide has been reported as a product of multiple ‘biopsychosocial and environmental antecedents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767913483130">Malphurs &amp; Cohen, 2005</xref>). These researchers suggested that “the additive and multiplicative relationships between these many factors remain to be identified.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767913483130">Malphurs &amp; Cohen, 2005</xref>, p 216) Homicide-suicide seems to be the synergistic result of the interaction of these factors. In the future multidisciplinary research may help to clarify the roles these factors play in homicide-suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767913483130">Marzuk, Tardiff, &amp; Hirsch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767913483130">Milroy, 1995</xref>).</p>

The data were organized into a standardized format in order to obtain consistency and comparability of observations and variables over time. Their data set is available from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan. More specifically, reformatted variables included information on the reporting agency, type of weapon used, the circumstances of the incident, and the characteristics of the victim and suspect (murderer). Data are available for the variables of population and city size and the victim’s and the murderer’s age, race and sex. One of the circumstance indicators, OCIRCUM2, is a variable indicating special circumstances relating to the homicide victim, but it was used only for the years 1968 through 1975. The special circumstances of this variable were described as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = murder by a juvenile, 2 = murder followed by suicide and 9 = murder by an insane person. No “murder followed by suicide” data were available for 1976 to 1978 (or later).</p>
