<italic>Pragmatics of Human Communication: A Study of Interactional Patterns, Pathologies, and Paradoxes</italic> (2011) is the theoretical contribution of Paul Watzlawick, Janet Beavin Bavelas, and Don D. Jackson to the systemic therapeutic paradigm regarding their schematics of human communication. The first two authors published a synthetic version of this work titled Some Formal Aspects of Human Communication (Paper) in <italic>The American Behavioral Scientist</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712449802">1967</xref>, the same year in which <italic>Pragmatics of Human Communication </italic>(PHC) first appeared.</p>
<p>In PHC, the authors explained that instead of introducing a complete theory of human communication, they were introducing premises about human communication. Although it remains unclear how they came upon these premises, they posited that following these premises/corollaries to their logical conclusions provided a pragmatic understanding of interactional patterns, pathologies, and paradoxes of human communication.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712449802">
<title>Interactional Patterns of Human Communication</title>
<p>Both in PHC and their Paper, the authors explained that interactional patterns of human communication comprised all human interactions and the contexts in which they occurred. That is, both speech (digital communication) and behavior (analogical communication) convey meaning between/among two or more individuals. This “meaning” that individuals exchange may be either verbal or nonverbal messages and their environments and time periods also influence what these messages may mean. Human beings always communicate with one another. This ability to engage in meaningful interactional patterns renders the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> species unique among mammal primates. Human history has demonstrated that individuals have developed intelligible, linguistic systems (that require the use of phonemes and grammar) and their behaviors are interpreted within these tongue-based (linguistic) expressions of meaning. Yet finding coherence between analogical and digital communication modes has been a great challenge not only for individuals but also for therapists.</p>
<p>The PHC’s authors also explained that human beings interact with one another in a circular manner. This is based on the presumption that when person A communicates with person B and person B responds to person A, this forms a feedback loop, and their communication follows a cyclic pattern—but only if person A also reacts to person B, thus closing the cycle. The authors further presumed that this communication may go on ad infinitum, while its origin may be also ad infinitum. However, communication regression ad infinitum is not possible because at some point in time communication must have originated. Hence, the cyclic pattern of human communication remains unsound. This same challenge applies to groups or systems of more than two individuals where communicative patterns must have originated at some point in time. This point of communicative departure remains conclusive regardless of the complexity of systemic interaction patterns.</p>
<p>The authors explained that relational communications are “contingent upon the punctuation sequences between the communicants.” This is simply true because digital and analogical modes of communication complement one another—and yes, they also have the power to distort one another. For example, a person may say something, but imply something else either by intonation, facial gestures, or any other behavioral expression.</p>
<p>Punctuation sequences also include symmetrical or complementary communications. If symmetrical, the partners share a sense of mutual equality in their relationship. If complementary, the partners share a sense of difference among them in their relationship. In the end, the partners define what works for them. Unless they face pathological or paradoxical exchanges from which they cannot escape. At this juncture, therapeutic interventions may be useful only if they may bring about a sense of balance (homeostasis) to the relationship by emphasizing complementarity to compensate for symmetry and by emphasizing symmetry to compensate for complementarity.</p>

<sec id="section2-1066480712449802">
<title>Pathologies of Human Communication</title>
<p>Pathological communications comprise rejection of communication by another, acceptance of communication by another, and disqualification of communication by another. For example, these forms of symptomatic communication are present in instances of schizophrenia where the “identified patient” distorts the meaning of communication and thus perpetuates a cycle of pathological interpretation and within which the nonschizophrenic parties emulate the identified patient and fail to positively communicate. One can speculate that in cases of pathological communication, participants perpetuate such communication “deficits” (i.e., rejection, acceptance, or disqualification), thus obfuscating the objective meaning of the systemic exchanges only for the purpose of preserving the quality of the relationship as it is. This is further possible because of individual pathologies (juxtaposed to the identified patient) that must be addressed lest pathological patterns may continue to objectify the identified patient in a given communicative context. This of course would be potentially, clinically unethical, more so if the therapist is aware of such <italic>currency of relationships.</italic>

<title>Paradoxes of Human Communication</title>
<p>Paradoxical communications tend to deconstruct the objectivity of one’s perceptions when engaged in a given communication exchange. Antimonies pertain to logical syntax, semantic antimonies pertain to semantics, and paradoxical injunctions and paradoxical predictions pertain to pragmatics of human communication.</p>
<p>Antimonies appear when linguistic inconsistencies arise in speech thus producing a logical inconsistency in the structure of language. For example, when a speaker refers to a category of things and not necessarily at the things to which it refers. Thus nominally, simply a category’s name is a member of “categories” but not a member of “things” under the same “category” just named. In this sense, if in a dyad a partner uses the name of a category to refer “by analogy” to a particular object, the other partner may think the “particular object” is what is being discussed, but it is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>Semantic antimonies refer also to language inconsistencies. For example, if a person says she is “lying,” the statement is only true if the person is telling the truth about not telling the truth. In dyadic systems, again, one can imagine how this generates even a pathological exchange when the partners must reason and often confuse themselves when attempting to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Pragmatic paradoxes or cases of injunctions and predictions, the authors argue, are truly the focus of PHC. They provide digital communication examples in PHC (pp. 172–212). And they conclude that it is impossible to communicate logically within an illogical communicative context, thus creating an untenable and not meaningful…ful relationship.</p>

<sec id="section4-1066480712449802">
<title>Applicability of Pragmatics of Human Communication</title>
<p>Both in PHC and the Paper, the authors emphasize the nature and import of human communication, emphasizing perhaps its applicability to therapeutic settings. How much of these premises can be actually useful to work with couples and families in our pluralistic society? First, we must recognize that human beings usually employ digital communication for most of their overt relationships. Yet spoken and written language in our global culture is truly contextual and limited by space and time; limited by cultures and generations. For example, what X would have meant in early 18th century Italy, did not mean the same in 18th century England. The same is true for X for the same countries when compared between the value meaning assigned to X in the early 18th century and in contemporary 21st century. So, if words and their idiomatic meaning changes contextually by time and space intraculturally and interculturally, how can we address these human communication “gaps”? Better yet, how can the premises in PHC and the Paper be utilized to address the idiosyncrasies of human language and its communication among individuals, and individuals-in-systems? Answers to these questions must certainly be complicated. However, following the nature of evolution and adaptation of human interactions, we must postulate that the premises in PHC and the Paper may not be applicable to all cultures on earth. This is also probable because there are linguistic limitations (still with respect to digital communication modalities) to languages’ syntaxes, and, more specifically regarding the value assigned to nouns. For example, a noun may be feminine and given feminine attributes in a given language, but masculine attributes in another. Would these interpretations influence paradoxical instances and thus the meaning inferred in communicative contexts for both individual and systemic clients? The answer is probably positive. And this perhaps represents the major limitation to PHC and the Paper’s postulations.</p>
<p>In 21st century America, we live in a consumerist society, and there are a myriad of self-help books to improve couples’ communications, for example, built unfortunately on simplistic stereotypes or slogans. With few exceptions, some researchers, including the ongoing research of Janet Beavin Bavelas on face-to-face communication, have produced informed results to help interpersonal relationships regarding “(a) reciprocal influence and collaboration and (b) visible actions that are integrated with speech (e.g., hand and facial gestures)” in interpersonal communication contexts (visit http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/bavelas/). For example, the conscientious and extensive works of John M. Gottman have also gathered empirical evidence to provide both clinicians and individuals and systems with information on what PHC and the Paper have premised: That it is absolutely important to find cohesiveness between digital and analogical communication. That in order to achieve homeostasis in relational communications symmetry and complementarity must be balanced, particularly regarding the patterns of pathological communications.</p>
<p>This brings me to ask yet another important question: What does multicultural competence truly mean in therapeutic terms regarding individual and systemic clienteles who are not native to or who have not immersed completely into Anglo-American societies on which frameworks and premises similar to PHC and the Paper have been developed? The fact that some institutions prefer polyglots to serve multicultural clienteles is inanely based on the presumption that digital fluency is therapeutic to all individuals who may speak a given language. However, if what PHC and the Paper’s premises are true, then meaning is contextual, and individuals and systems always communicate; hence, simple linguistic fluency does not imply soundly that polyglot clinicians may reach successfully individuals who do not share in, or who have not assimilated into at least an Anglo-American culture. Evidence to this assertion exists primarily in nonverbal cues that are delimited by time and place and cannot be ignored simply because a person may mask a given language.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that PHC in its current paper edition (2011) must be brought back to the classroom and that additional empirical evidence must be gathered to test its premises. I can only predict that the results of such undertaking will illumine the field of 21st century individual and couples and families therapeutic frameworks’ development.</p>
