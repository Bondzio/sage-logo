<abstract>
<p>Labour governments from 1997 to 2010 sought to promote joined-up thinking with the goal of ultimately improving governance and service delivery. It is within this context that this article analyses the emergence of New Labour’s Community Planning agenda in Scotland during the period 2003–2004. More specifically it focuses upon the early stages of the implementation of Edinburgh City Council’s Community Plan. An examination of the policy background to Community Planning is undertaken, presenting the key impacts of Labour’s modernisation agenda on local governance and democracy. Through the analysis of the implementation of Edinburgh City Council’s Community Plan, this article considers the extent to which the Community Planning agenda practically impacted upon public participation. It concludes by arguing that the South Edinburgh pilot demonstrated that some services can be delivered more efficiently and effectively, specifically those which are more responsive to local residents’ views and needs. This research argues that the implementation of Edinburgh’s Community Plan generated a new dynamism in local politics if only for a short period of time, most notably in local community willingness to engage with key issues which affected them. This approach resulted in tangible improvements within the public realm. There were also opportunities to use community plans to reinvigorate and restructure local governance in new and more democratically accountable ways. The case study also indicated some of the tensions and opportunities contained within the Labour Government’s modernisation agenda.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094213491691" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the election of the Labour Government in 1997 and the placing of modernisation (at both central and local levels) high on their policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213491691">DETR, 1998</xref>), public participation in local government grew in significance, particularly in the role of Community Planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491691">Abram and Cowell, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213491691">Hogg (2000)</xref> claimed that Community Planning was one way of ensuring greater impact from existing resources through promoting efficiency savings in delivering public services. Notably, however, this ‘plan of plans’ is also deemed to require <italic>significant</italic> public involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213491691">Jessop’s (1997)</xref> arguments concerning the emergence of meta-governance has some relevance in helping to explain the development of Community Planning as a tool operating at the local level, where the State organises intergovernmental relations designed to allow the centre to retain control of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491691">Abram and Cowell, 2004</xref>). Thus, while the rhetoric points towards greater local freedom and public involvement, it is altogether more questionable whether policy mechanisms have altered to reflect this.</p>
<p>At the heart of New Labour’s community engagement strategy, from 1997 to 2010, lay three key interconnected features: active citizens (motivated individuals with confidence and appropriate skills to stand up for their community); strengthened communities (who have the resources and capacity to engage with other relevant groups/institutions to help them formulate solutions); and partnerships (between local people and public bodies). While government rhetoric was large on empowering communities and boosting civic engagement, a contradiction remained, given that neither was local government really trusted to deliver on these tasks nor was it clear how best to achieve these objectives from an overly centralised state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094213491691">Atkinson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of citizen involvement and participatory democracy in land-use planning (and its more recent incarnation Community Planning) can be traced back to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213491691">Skeffington (1969)</xref> report <italic>People and Planning</italic> which emphasised the need for planners to actively allow the public the opportunity to participate in the planning system. In Scotland, local authorities were charged with fostering these ideals through the pursuit of Community Planning, which is much wider in scope than land-use planning and was designed to embrace all of the service delivery agents operating in a locality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213491691">Peel and Lloyd, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003 defined Community Planning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094213491691">1</xref></sup> as the process of planning and providing services by way of consultation and cooperation with partners and communities. Viewed as a potential solution to increased institutional fragmentation and proliferation of partnership working within Scotland, Community Planning was designed to improve local governance capacity and overall service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213491691">Lloyd et al., 2001</xref>). The introduction of the <italic>Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003</italic> gave Scottish local authorities statutory responsibilities for introducing Community Planning. Local authorities were expected to lead Community Planning in initiating, maintaining and facilitating this process and were directed to take suitable action to invite and encourage participation by partners and communities. However, in order to be involved in an open and transparent manner, they had to rely upon other bodies, such as voluntary organisations, community groups and often the private sector. The above reflected New Labour’s goal of improving public sector efficiency by reshaping the relationship between the role of the community, the voluntary sector and the State through a ‘partnership’ approach. However, this approach also raised serious issues of resource capacity and the need to reconcile institutional differences. Some such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491691">Abram and Cowell (2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094213491691">Boyle et al. (2008</xref>) argued that these are the ‘rocks’ on which Community Planning foundered.</p>
<p>It is within this context that this article has two key aims. First, to consider the early experiences and evaluation of public participation in Community Planning within the City of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">Edinburgh during 2003</xref>. An examination of the policy background to community planning is undertaken, presenting the key impacts of Labour’s modernisation agenda on local governance and democracy. Second, to analyse the implementation of Edinburgh City Council’s (ECC) Community Plan <italic>A Vision for Edinburgh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">Edinburgh City Council, 2003)</xref>, in order to consider the extent to which the Community Planning agenda practically impacted upon public participation during this period. Attention is given to opportunities provided for the public to participate in decision making. Specifically, the focus is on public participation in the monitoring of service provision and service delivery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094213491691"><title>New Labour, new modernisation, new public participation?</title>
<p>After its election in 1997, New Labour increasingly sought to ‘modernise’ local government as part of their overarching objective of public sector reform (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213491691">Stoker, 2004</xref>). While it could be claimed that this was not an entirely cohesive project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094213491691">Sullivan, 2001</xref>), the key aim was to develop ‘joined-up’ policies that deliver more efficient (and effective) services and to enable a restructured local government to reconnect with local communities they intended to serve. Given New Labour’s pursuit of joined-up government, some claimed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213491691">Illsley and Lloyd, 2001</xref>) that local authorities received something of a boost given that they were afforded a central role in the development of community plans. However, while this might have been the case, they could still be regarded in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213491691">Peck’s (1995)</xref> terms as having ‘responsibility without power’. Moreover, continual constraints in terms of finance and power, which were largely centrally determined and within which local authorities had to function, acted as a brake on their ability to ‘get things done’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213491691">Stoker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094213491691">Travers et al., 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213491691">Cowell (2002: 8)</xref> pointed out, local authorities lacked the ‘direct power to mandate other actors to get involved in Community Planning’ (especially the private sector) and that ‘consensus is a more prominent ethos than coercion’. In sum, New Labour sought to ‘re-include’ local authorities, as facilitators of local partnerships, where they were viewed as pivotal in achieving ‘joined-up thinking’. In the case of the development of Community Planning, local government, given its democratic mandate and legitimacy, was afforded a key leadership role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094213491691">Corry and Stoker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213491691">Hogg, 2000</xref>) in rationalising local partnership activity. However, as previous research has demonstrated, there are clear limitations to partnership working and the pursuit of joined-up government, especially when it comes to making tough decisions over the allocation of resources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213491691">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213491691">McWilliams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213491691">Peck and Tickell, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>A central feature of the modernisation of local government throughout Labour’s term of office (1997–2010) was the emphasis placed upon facilitating and widening <italic>community</italic> involvement in local decision making as a means of addressing the crisis of participation and democratic legitimacy in local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094213491691">King and Stoker, 1996</xref>). Thus, the then Scottish Executive rhetoric expressed the familiar aspiration that ‘effective and genuine engagement of communities is at the heart of Community Planning’, which ‘should also engage with those individuals who would not normally participate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213491691">Scottish Executive, 2004</xref>: 7–8). How participation was to be best achieved, however, was not made explicit. We have seen that since the 1960s there has been a persistent and recurring debate about the level and quality of participation in the UK planning system. However, in the early years of the 21st century the rhetoric of participation appeared to be assuming hegemonic status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213491691">Tunstall (2001</xref>: 2495) claimed that there has been ‘an explosion of enthusiasm for participatory practices over the last 15 years’, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213491691">Campbell and Marshall (2000: 321)</xref> describe the perceived need for greater public participation as ‘the cry of the age’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213491691">Lowndes et al.’s (2001)</xref> study demonstrates that the use of participatory techniques in local government had increased. They argue that the growth in all forms suggests a process of learning and knowledge sharing, as different authorities experiment with different techniques, with lessons learnt being disseminated through formal and informal networks. This echoes other research which found that different approaches can tap into different enthusiasms and motives within communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213491691">Seargeant and Steele, 1999</xref>). Thus, it seems to have become accepted within the political mainstream that improving involvement in decision-making processes is desirable and necessary, and will lead to greater levels of legitimacy, responsiveness and effectiveness. This perception is particularly strong in Scotland, where since 1999 there has been a Parliament which can pass primary legislation for a range of devolved issues. A key aspect of devolution is the on-going attempt to create more democratic, inclusive and accountable decision making at all levels of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213491691">Lloyd and McCarthy, 2000</xref>: 254). However, the participation of local communities in decision making has a long and chequered history in the United Kingdom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213491691">McWilliams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213491691">Raco, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094213491691">Wilks-Heeg, 1996</xref>). Despite the rhetoric and fanfare which normally precede government attempts to encourage greater public participation in local decision making, the actual achievements are somewhat disappointing (see Duffy and Hutchinson, 1997). The act of defining ‘appropriate’ participation and what purpose it represents have remained problematic and controversial. This involves making value judgements on issues such as: ‘who do we involve?’, ‘how extensively?’, ‘what are the best methods to utilise?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213491691">Jackson, 2001</xref>: 136). Participation is thus a rather ambiguous and elastic concept that can lend itself to wide interpretation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213491691">Sterling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213491691">Tunstall, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While government claims that important policy lessons have been learned from past policy experiments, <italic>genuine</italic> public participation has been the exception rather than the rule. At best public involvement is often tokenistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213491691">Arnstein, 1969</xref>); at worst, it has been manipulated and exploited (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213491691">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213491691">McWilliams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213491691">Raco, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213491691">Abram and Cowell (2004: 705)</xref> claimed: ‘participation became a pleasing slogan with little intrinsic definition and no specific implication for political practice’. In sum, there has been for at least four decades a large credibility gap between the rhetoric of promoting public involvement, and the reality of low levels of active citizenry effecting real political change. In this context, the goal of Community Planning, in terms of its ability to promote public involvement, has turned out to be yet another example of misplaced optimism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094213491691">Sinclair, 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213491691">Seargent and Steele, 1999</xref>) claimed that Community Planning could be viewed as a catalyst for rethinking existing practices resulting in real impacts on the ground.</p>
<p>However, local authorities tend to have vague ideas about <italic>why</italic> they want people to participate. If the purpose is vague, it is no wonder efforts do not achieve stated objectives – in this sense perhaps policy makers need to become more sophisticated in their thinking about what they are trying to achieve and define the process/technique accordingly; for example good practice suggests that clarity of purpose is a key influence on success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213491691">Lowndes et al., 2001</xref>). Further, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094213491691">Hague and Jenkins (2005)</xref> also found that authorities’ purposes tend to be complex and varied. Although overall intentions or values such as promoting citizenship or strengthening democracy are important within local authorities, and in working with partners, two key benefits of participation are first, the importance of gaining citizens’ views in leading to better quality local authority decision making and second, the recognition that participation is seen to link directly with service improvements. But the above relate to the internal workings of the council and reflect the information needs of decision makers and service providers as opposed to the real needs of the citizens they purport to serve.</p>
<p>Why then did New Labour promote such an agenda? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213491691">Cowell (2002)</xref> argues that Community Planning was intended to have a role in tackling the crises of democratic participation. Within this context New Labour hoped that lower levels of government could potentially provide improved expression of accountability and representation, helping to bridge the so-called ‘democratic deficit’, and that ultimately greater participation makes for more effective governance. Clearly, New Labour, while seeking to promote greater participation of local communities in decisions which affected them, also wanted the public to take far greater responsibility in addressing these problems.</p>
<p>The next section provides a brief description of Community Planning in the context of Scottish local governance, before turning to the key issues that emerged in the Edinburgh case study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094213491691"><title>Community Planning in Scotland: Community involvement all change?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094213491691">Cowell and Martin (2003)</xref> noted that Community Planning became something of a great institutional hope for addressing so-called ‘wicked problems’ (i.e. complex problems that require an holistic response) of governance. Within this context, Community Planning was presented as a welcome return to a more ‘Scottish style’ of governance, in that it was claimed a more strategic and multi-sectoral planning approach was promoted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213491691">Illsley and Lloyd, 2001</xref>). Thus, Community Planning, it was argued, had a key role to play in fostering community participation, as well as driving and coordinating local agendas. However, areas of contestation relates to <italic>who</italic> was best placed to drive key objectives and what was the <italic>precise</italic> role of the <italic>community</italic> in Community Planning.</p>
<p>While the rhetoric surrounding Community Planning and public involvement claims it was different from the most recent New Labour ‘urban policy’, i.e. Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094213491691">2</xref></sup> closer inspection reveals many aspects of <italic>continuity</italic> exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213491691">Johnstone and McWilliams, 2005</xref>). For example, while Community Planning stated that: ‘genuine engagement of communities is at the heart of Community Planning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213491691">Scottish Executive, 2004</xref>: 7), this is not too dissimilar from SIPs which argued that: ‘there is a need to involve communities in the decisions that affect them, and to support them to take on ever-greater responsibility for taking those decisions themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213491691">Scottish Office, 1999</xref>: 6). Looking further back at previous Conservative ‘urban policies’ reveals even more evidence of continuity. What is remarkable is the degree of cross-party political support (at least rhetorically) for putting the community at the centre of local policy making. For example, the New Life for Urban Scotland Partnership<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094213491691">3</xref></sup> initiative (an urban policy initiative devised by the Conservative Government which ran from 1988 to 1998) argued that: ‘plans for regeneration of problem areas must have the full understanding, involvement and commitment of the local community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094213491691">Scottish Office, 1988</xref>: 9). In sum it could be argued that in policy terms we have been here before. Thus, while the rhetoric supported the promotion of a greater role for the public in Community Planning, the reality of previous similar policy attempts in Scotland to put the community at the heart of local decision making failed to do just that – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213491691">McWilliams’ (2004)</xref> study of Greater Pollok Social Inclusion Partnership and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213491691">Collins’ (1999)</xref> study of Ferguslie Park New Life for Urban Scotland Partnership, as examples of unsuccessful community participation partnerships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094213491691"><title>A community involved? A case-study of Edinburgh Community Planning</title>
<p>In May 1999, the City of Edinburgh Council decided to review its decision-making processes in line with national government’s modernising agenda in preparation for the introduction of Community Planning. The key aims at the time were to reduce bureaucracy, speed up decision making and give local communities a greater say over the decisions that affect them. The Council elected its first Executive in June 2000 and set up six Local Development Committees (LDCs) covering each of the City’s parliamentary constituency areas. The LDCs were intended to be the main mechanism for decentralised participation and management in Edinburgh in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>The Council launched ‘The Vision for Edinburgh’ consultation exercise published in February 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">ECC, 2003</xref>), which sought views on the City Plan and the development of the Community Planning process. The new City Plan identified for the first time a common, shared set of goals for all the major public sector organisations and their partners in Edinburgh. The key aim of the Plan was to promote <italic>partnership</italic> working in these organisations. It was intended that this would be achieved through:
<list id="list1-0269094213491691" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>better engagement with communities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improved joint planning</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improved services/outcomes through working together.</p></list-item>
</list>The case study formed part of a wider evaluation of seven different approaches to neighbourhood management and local community planning which were tested through pilot projects in Edinburgh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269094213491691">4</xref></sup> As such, the innovations piloted formed a significant part of the City of Edinburgh Council’s developing Community Planning process and represent a rich diversity of experience and learning. In doing so, participants faced a number of challenges that are at the heart of implementing Community Planning. The case study highlights some key lessons which emerged from just one of these pilot projects which subsequently went on to inform wider debates on the Council’s developing Community Planning agenda. During the period June–October 2003, the researchers (including the author of this research) held six semi-structured interviews with key participants associated with each of the projects. Interview data was supplemented by analysis of relevant documentary evidence including reports, minutes of meetings and available quantitative data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094213491691"><title>South Edinburgh pilot</title>
<p>Prior to the introduction of Task Force Working (defined by the City Council as a partnership between designated departments), as many as six different departments shared responsibility for litter collection, grass cutting and general maintenance duties. A number of factors or conditions were in place which contributed to the effectiveness of the pilot in terms of promoting local participation. First, the pilot built on a range of previous initiatives seeking service users’ views. For example, Environment and Consumer Services (ECS) held a consultation day during October 2003, ‘Challenge for Change’, providing residents across Edinburgh the opportunity to comment on services and performance. The resultant Action Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">ECC, 2003</xref>) cut across a wide range of services and was intended to shape future provision in many areas. As such, the department was already developing a ‘culture’ of participation.</p>
<p>Second, the ECS were already in a process of reviewing ways of incorporating additional services into Task Force Working. As such, the pilot sought to extend this ‘joined-up’ approach in recognition that there was scope for further improvement. Third, it was recognised that the Council employed a range of officers that carry out duties on the streets of the city, and there was interest in exploring how these officers could be more effectively utilised in reporting or dealing with a wide range of environmental issues.</p>
<p>ECS were requested by the LDC to develop a draft plan incorporating community involvement. A project Planning Group was formed to develop a detailed Environmental Improvement Action Plan intended to ‘improve the local environment for the people of South Edinburgh’ in consultation with elected members and representatives of the local community. In addition, a short life elected member/community representative Working Group was set up to guide development of the Plan. In developing the Plan, it was recognised that there was a ‘need to allow others to contribute towards delivering a cleaner, safer environment for all’. A Joint Officers Working Group (JOWG) consisting of departmental representatives with ‘an environmental interest in South Edinburgh’ was set up to progress the Plan and ensure coordination. A senior Task Force Manager was allocated to the South area responsible for coordinating the activities of the three existing Task Forces operating within the South Edinburgh area. The Senior Manager developed a system for collating and tracking reported issues to ensure that any action taken was recorded. This helped establish an ‘audit trail’ in that work undertaken was no longer ‘hidden’ thereby enhancing transparency. Three Local Environmental Forums (each covering 3–4 wards) were set up to help refine the Plan, drive forward implementation and to monitor delivery. The forums were viewed as a means of engaging with people on a more localised basis, reflecting the diverse nature and interests of communities represented within the LDC area. The Senior Task Force Manager and the relevant Local Task Force Manager attended the forums alongside local councillors, the LDC coordinator and the People and Places Officer.</p>
<p>A number of the outcomes emerging from the Action Plan fell within the remit of the People and Places Officer who identified scope for synergies with the Green Watch scheme and ways in which the forums could link into other on-going initiatives (e.g. Beautiful Scotland in Bloom). During interview a member of the local environment forum said that the Green Watch scheme was a ‘simple and practical way for people to get involved in monitoring local environmental quality’<italic>.</italic> This included identifying and training community representatives to help monitor the effectiveness of Task Force Working using digital cameras and the Clean Index Monitoring System (CIMS), which provides a means of analysing street cleanliness on an on-going basis. In addition, community feedback forms or ‘reporting cards’ were introduced and located in Council buildings within the area. A freepost card was developed to enable people to report specific areas/problems. Local people completed a ‘score card’ assessing street cleanliness. Information is recorded and issues arising were passed onto the Task Force Manager. Environmental wardens also made available a ‘dirty map’ at each LDC meeting to allow members of the public to identify known ‘hot spots’.</p>
<p>Ward level information on the delivery of Task Force services provided an effective means of monitoring performance, while also enabling those attending to identify issues they wanted to raise. The Senior Task Force Manager reported back on activities and responded to issues raised at previous meetings, asking people whether they had noticed a difference and/or any outstanding issues. Information on issues raised that were out-with the Task Force’s remit, and which overlap departmental boundaries, was collated and referred to the relevant department. Information on action taken was then passed back from departments via the Senior Task Force Manger.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094213491691"><title>Evaluation</title>
<p>From the Council’s perspective the Action Plan was regarded as an effective means of monitoring progress towards the achievement of specific objectives. In general, feedback provided via the forums was positive and there was a perception that services were better, which was reflected in levels of street cleanliness. A comparison of CIMS scores (March 2001–2004) illustrated that the South of Edinburgh exceeded the city-wide score throughout the duration of the pilot. A corollary is that the number of complaints had declined, as officers involved adopted a more proactive approach to addressing local issues. For example, environmental wardens received 93 complaints about littering in 2003–2004 compared to 236 in 2002–2003, albeit the number of city-wide complaints also declined. The identification of appropriate performance indicators to assist participants in undertaking their performance monitoring role evolved. That said, the forums were thought to have provided a new source of intelligence regarding local priorities.</p>
<p>Respondents felt that the JOWG worked well in establishing joint working and was considered crucial to the success of the pilot. One of the key successes was in securing effective liaison and improved coordination between departments. As each of the key players was represented, it proved ‘easier to get things done’ as a line of communication evolved.</p>
<p>The forums developed incrementally and were generally viewed to have worked well. Officers and community activists viewed the forums as a means of developing better working relationships between the Council and local residents. Direct contact with Task Force Managers provided ‘a face’ to the Council and ‘made a big difference’ with issues raised normally dealt with the next day. The forums provided an arena within which people could raise issues and put forward items to be included on the agenda. However, as the forums evolved, there was the potential for them to widen their focus (e.g. consideration of landscape improvements). This was inevitable, given the interlinked nature of issues under discussion. Indeed, the Senior Task Force Manager regarded this as a positive development as citizens begin to develop their own initiatives.</p>
<p>It was felt that improved levels of cleanliness and enforcement did encourage local residents and visitors to take more responsibility for the local environment. In addition, it boosted local morale, encouraging people to take more pride in their local areas. The pilot’s contribution to addressing local stigma (of unclean streets) was particularly important to those activists involved in regenerating their local area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094213491691"><title>Lessons for community planning</title>
<p>The central aim of the pilot was to use existing resources more efficiently. The need to deliver visible improvements in service delivery at the local level (but at no extra cost) was generally viewed as ‘conflicting objectives’. The pilot involved refocusing and targeting existing city-wide resources more effectively on a specific local area. As such, replicating the model on a city-wide basis would have involved significant resource implications. The Council’s perception was that the pilot demonstrated ‘value-for-money’ in improving levels of cleanliness and enhancing public satisfaction for the same level of financial resources, although it was difficult to put a figure on this. It was acknowledged by the City Council that the pilot was resource intensive in terms of staff and volunteer time. Community activists judged this by whether ‘money was well spent’ and felt that the results were ‘there to be seen’. In particular, it was pointed out by local activists that additional funding was required to build community capacity to enable on-going monitoring and to support community engagement in the pilot. Allocating appropriate resources needed to be considered if the Council was serious about the value of user involvement. That said, the majority of improvements made were attributed to enhanced dialogue between officers and the public and as such did not involve substantial capital investment.</p>
<p>In general, respondents felt that the pilot provided communities with ‘some’ influence over service delivery. However, views were mixed as to whether the pilot provided communities/users with an influence over service planning. For specific one-off activities (e.g. removing dumped rubbish), it was felt that the Task Force was responsive. However, there was a tension between community aspirations and availability of resources, alongside the Council’s legal obligation to keep places clean as well as pressure to continually improve the delivery of local services.</p>
<p>The pilot also raised wider issues regarding the interaction of governance processes with the operational delivery of services at the city-wide and local levels. In particular, there was a tension between the Council’s responsibility for providing city-wide services and improving services locally, which cannot be easily resolved. Managing services within a context of rising expectations also creates pressures in balancing requirements to deliver services within existing budgets. For example, the pilot’s scope to influence service planning was limited leading some local communities to argue that the pilot offered consultation as opposed to <italic>genuine</italic> involvement. ECS’ Service Plan outlines service provision across the city. It was acknowledged by the local Task Force Manager that it was difficult to take components of one service to an area without losing economies of scale and therefore they are tied into the strategic operational level. Devolving services to the local level may result in a loss of strategic focus and management of demand across the city. Elected members had a key role in managing conflicting demands in deciding on key priorities. Local councillor involvement earlier in the policy cycle in setting the strategic framework which determined how resources are targeted at particular areas would help ensure that local service delivery was approached from a city-wide basis. It was felt that the forums’ ability to influence issues such as the frequency of cleaning was more difficult in that such changes to service delivery may have resource implications, which had already been determined within the Service Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">ECC, 2003</xref>). Although possible, departments were reluctant to consult on the details of the Service Plan due to the Council’s legal obligation in providing city-wide services and therefore would find it difficult to hand over that level of responsibility to communities.</p>
<p>The pilot also highlighted the importance of clear leadership and senior level commitment to taking community involvement seriously and in developing a clear vision on what the Council is seeking to achieve. The pilot complemented wider departmental priorities (e.g. promotion of sustainable development) and provided a means of developing a culture of joint working through providing space to experiment and learn from experience.</p>
<p>The JOWG was considered to be a key strength in that it provided a focus for joint working. The pilot demonstrated that officers from different departments are capable of working together and making a positive contribution in a ‘spirit of willingness’ as opposed to being coerced into joint working. The development of shared protocols helped secure joint working through building upon existing partnership working. Greater delegation of management responsibility for service planning and decision making on the allocation of budgets and the transfer of resources helped ‘empower’ managers and communities in influencing service planning at a more strategic level. This enabled those involved to plan and deliver services more effectively and respond to local needs and aspirations.</p>
<p>The benefit of having a dedicated local officer or single point of contact in the shape of the Senior Task Force Manager was identified as crucial to meeting stated objectives (ECC, 2003). Tasking such an officer with responsibility for delivering the Action Plan helped ensure sufficient local autonomy in creating an environment that ‘things get done’ and were not dependent on officer ‘good will’ and the enforcement of protocols. Similarly, replicating the personal qualities and skills involved in engaging the public was to prove more difficult as these were differentiated from ‘technical’ skills related to mainstream service delivery. The need for a positive approach and a ‘can do attitude’ were viewed as essential in inspiring confidence in the public that their complaints were being dealt with effectively. The importance of communication and honesty was highlighted. Activists felt that communication was a two-way process and that they too were learning as they received feedback.</p>
<p>The pilot highlighted the potential role of communities in taking forward their own initiatives as a means of promoting greater responsibility and ownership of local areas. That said, the forums were considered to be a ‘force for change’ within the department and provided a mechanism for feeding back information more quickly into the development of service delivery. While the pilot did not significantly impact on service planning, it has enabled those involved to focus on communities’ areas of concern and to respond more quickly. The forums were viewed as carrying out external performance monitoring and provided qualitative perceptions of levels of street cleanliness, which was valued by the department. The pilot also challenged officer assumptions that ‘just because we were out there dealing with the problem, that’s the end of it’. Thus, issues/problems were on-going and required a long-term approach to decision making.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0269094213491691" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The UK has a long, albeit chequered history, of attempting to involve the public in local decision making, stretching back to the 1969 Skeffington Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094213491691">Wilks-Heeg, 1996</xref>). The emergence of the current Liberal-Conservative Coalition Government’s Big Society and Localism agenda has a strong degree of continuity with New Labour’s recent policy initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213491691">Alderwick, 2012</xref>). Both administrations have sought to engage with citizens through a partnership approach which claimed to place people at the heart of local decision making. Prime Minister Cameron’s pursuit of his desired austerity-driven neo-liberal ‘small state’ requires by definition a ‘big society’, to take up the slack as a result of state withdrawal and shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213491691">Colenutt, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article sought to analyse the emergence of New Labour’s Community Planning agenda in Scotland and the early stages of implementation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213491691">Edinburgh City Council’s Community Plan during 2003</xref>. Attention was given to opportunities provided for the public to participate in local environmental decision making. The South Edinburgh pilot demonstrated that some services can be delivered more efficiently and effectively, specifically those which are more responsive to local residents’ views. This approach resulted in tangible improvements within the public realm. In turn, local people felt they had some, albeit limited, influence over their local environment.</p>
<p>The key lessons from the case study did contribute to the development of Community Planning in Edinburgh more generally, as participants were keen that others should benefit from their experience. For example, the introduction of key components, such as the JOWG, a dedicated ‘project manager’ overseeing the work of local managers, the establishment of community forums and mechanisms to ensure that services are monitored and ‘tracked’ were all adopted and critical to overall service improvement. The personal qualities and skills of those involved and the provision of a dedicated support team helped reverse negative perceptions of services and the Council in general at this time, as well as stimulating community-led initiatives. Nevertheless, participants were aware that Community Planning was an evolving process and there was scope for continuing improvement. The pilot, thus, raised wider issues affecting the interaction of governance and service delivery processes that are relevant to all Council departments as much then as today, the resolution of which depends upon <italic>genuine</italic> public involvement and honest open transparent debate.</p>
