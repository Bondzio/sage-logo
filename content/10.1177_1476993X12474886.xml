    <p>Contemporary biblical scholarship is changing at a rapid pace. The variety of methods for
      interpreting the Bible has increased dramatically in recent years, as is shown, for example,
      by the growing interest in literary approaches such as narrative criticism, and in approaches
      focused on areas outside both literary and biblical research, for instance, the articles on
      biblical themes as interpreted in the cinema. The past twenty-five years have seen a growing
      interest by biblical scholars in structuralist criticism, reader response criticism,
      rhetorical criticism, social-scientific criticism, feminist interpretation, ideological
      criticism, and deconstructive criticism, in addition to major advances in the work being done
      on the broader contexts within which ancient Israel and early Christianity developed.
      Long-standing methods of research have undergone substantial reappraisal, as, for instance, in
      the areas of ‘biblical’ archaeology and the history of early Israel. The ﬁeld now reaches well
      beyond the encompassing historical-critical consensus that had dominated biblical scholarship
      throughout most of the twentieth century. This increasing variety and ﬂexibility in method has
      added richness and depth to our understanding of the Bible and its contextual world.</p>
    <p>The growing variety of approaches is healthy and energizing, and indicates the vitality of
      contemporary biblical scholarship. However, this variety also makes it very difﬁcult for
      scholars, especially those who teach or write across a broad spectrum of biblical studies, to
      stay informed about the numerous recent developments in the many different areas of biblical
      scholarship. Add to this the virtual explosion in books, journals,
        <italic>Festschriften</italic>, encyclopedias and online sites, and one can immediately see
      the need for a journal to keep readers apprised of recent developments in this rapidly
      expanding field of scholarship. Given this increasing diversity of methods and interests in
      contemporary biblical scholarship, the need for <italic>Currents</italic> is even clearer
      today than it was when the ﬁrst issue was published in 1993.</p>
    <p><italic>Currents</italic> also welcomes proposals for articles relating to all facets of
      Judaism in the late Second Temple and early Rabbinic periods. This includes, but is not
      limited to, essays on recent research in Pseudepigrapha, Qumran, Mishnah, Midrash and Talmud,
      as well as studies on ancient Jewish interpreters such as Josephus and Philo. We are
      especially interested in articles that address texts and issues of interest to the ﬁeld of
      biblical studies, broadly conceived. Jonathan Klawans looks forward to hearing from readers
      who have proposals for articles for this area of interest for <italic>Currents</italic>. He
      should be contacted before any manuscripts are submitted.</p>
    <p>In addition to these developments, <italic>Currents</italic> will continue to summarize the
      spectrum of recent research on particular topics, methods or biblical books. Each article will
      provide an inclusive treatment of its subject, without in most cases being exhaustive, owing
      to the rapid publication of new books and articles. Each article will conclude with a
      bibliography that provides a basic knowledge of signiﬁcant articles and books on the topic
      being treated, and supplies sufﬁcient information to launch a thorough investigation of the
      topic. In addition to the area of recent research in ancient Judaism, as described above,
      articles in <italic>Currents</italic> will continue to cover scholarship on speciﬁc biblical
      books or clusters of books, ancillary ancient literature, archaeology, and historical studies,
      as well as new and developing areas of study.</p>
    <p>Articles are assigned by the editors to scholars well acquainted with the speciﬁc topic being
      treated. The editors also welcome proposals for articles, although no manuscript should be
      submitted unless a proposal has been discussed with one of the editors and an agreement has
      been reached. Since <italic>Currents</italic> is designed to provide summaries and analyses of
      recent scholarship in speciﬁc areas of research, proposals for articles with a different
      purpose will not be approved. Many thanks to Sheleena Rios and Austin Reiter for their
      assistance in the preparation of this issue.</p>
