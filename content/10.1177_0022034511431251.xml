<abstract>
<p>Bond-strength testing is the method most used for the assessment of bonding effectiveness to enamel and dentin. We aimed to disclose general trends in adhesive performance by collecting dentin bond-strength data systematically. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were used to identify 2,157 bond-strength tests in 298 papers. Most used was the micro-tensile test, which appeared to have a larger discriminative power than the traditional macro-shear test. Because of the huge variability in dentin bond-strength data and the high number of co-variables, a neural network statistical model was constructed. Variables like ‘research group’ and ‘adhesive brand’ appeared most determining. Weighted means derived from this analysis confirmed the high sensitivity of current adhesive approaches (especially of all-in-one adhesives) to long-term water-storage and substrate variability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, bond-strength tests are used to measure the bonding effectiveness of adhesives to tooth tissue. Such tests serve multiple purposes, ranging from initial screening of new adhesive formulations, and testing of various research hypotheses, up to quality control by manufacturers.</p>
<p>Many reviews have focused on bond strength and its predictability of clinical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022034511431251">Van Noort <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511431251">Rueggeberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034511431251">Fowler <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034511431251">Pashley <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034511431251">Leloup <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The main issues discussed in these reviews deal with the methodology used and high data variability. The solution proposed was to standardize the bond-strength protocol, hoping for better data interpretation and, in particular, inter-study comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022034511431251">Van Noort <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034511431251">Stanley, 1993</xref>). Today, however, the variety in test methodologies has never been broader, while no consensus exists among researchers regarding the most appropriate use and interpretation of bond-strength data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034511431251">Armstrong <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the amount of data currently available in literature is so vast that some relevant trends might emerge despite the high variance. This calls, however, for statistical techniques that can deal with such an exponentially growing pool of ‘noisy’ data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034511431251">Bishop, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically collect dentin bond-strength data, to identify the primary parameters that affect the outcome of bond-strength tests, and to disclose trends in adhesive performance for the different adhesive approaches available today.</p>

<title>Systematic Literature Search</title>
<p>By entering the search term ‘<italic>dentin bond strength AND “published last 5 years”[Filter]’</italic> in PubMed, we identified 1,049 studies. The search was conducted on January 17, 2009 and repeated on October 9, 2009. To identify manuscripts not listed in PubMed, we conducted a similar search, covering the same period, using the EMBASE database. Subsequently, all papers, along with the respective identifiers, were inserted into a custom-made relational database. Original articles were retrieved and appraised by four calibrated researchers (JDM/AM/AP/AVE). Studies were included when the following criteria were met: (1) bond strength of at least two commercial adhesives to dentin was measured; (2) a light-curing composite (no resin cement or glass ionomer) was used; and (3) for every relevant experimental group in each study, at least the following data were recorded: type of test, mean bond strength, standard deviation, and number of specimens, teeth, and pre-testing failures. Also, parameters regarding the test set-up were recorded, such as substrate origin and preparation, storage time and medium, adhesive and composite brand, light-curing methodology, potential aging procedure, and some other test conditions like loading geometry and interface shape (Appendix Tables 2 and 3).</p>
<p>From the PubMed/EMBASE identifiers, the number of studies present in the database for every author was calculated. In each study, the author with the most studies in the database was identified and served as the identifier for the ‘research group’ that generated the data. All adhesives were categorized according to the classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref>. Additionally, data regarding composition and mechanical properties of adhesives (pH, bonding technique,…) as well as composites (flexural modulus, composite type,…) were retrieved from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034511431251">Van Landuyt <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034511431251">Ilie and Hickel (2009)</xref>, respectively. Further, to assess the effect of progress in adhesive dentistry, we recorded the first appearance in the PubMed database for each adhesive; this is referred to as ‘adhesive age’.</p>
<p>To assess publication bias, we analyzed dentin bond-strength data produced in a single dental materials research laboratory from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven BIOMAT Research Cluster) during the period 2002 to 2010, being further referred to as the ‘BIOMAT database’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034511431251">
<title>Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analyses</title>
<p>The overall mean bond strength (in MPa) and histogram of each bond-strength methodology and adhesive class were calculated. Subsequently, these data were subjected to a first statistical analysis by analysis of variance (ANOVA). To assess the importance of several ‘continuous’ parameters on the outcome of bond-strength tests, we performed correlation analyses on more homogenous subsets. A specific subset of data was therefore prepared, in which only ‘control’ bond-strength data were included, more specifically representing data derived from specimens that were prepared according to the manufacturers’ instructions and tested between 1 day and 1 wk, without any artificial aging or mechanical loading imposed, nor involving any modifications to the manufacturer’s instructed adhesive procedure. Other subsets included bond-strength data measured upon ‘aging by water-storage’ or ‘thermocycling’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034511431251">
<title>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</title>
<p>Next, a subset was prepared containing data of only micro- tensile bond-strength (µTBS) results (61% of the data: 1,314 records). From all parameters registered, 10 clinically and statistically relevant parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034511431251">Table 1</xref>) were extracted/calculated to be included in the statistical model. A randomly chosen subset, containing 80% of the dataset, served to create multilayer perceptron neural networks with up to 40 hidden units (Statistica 9.0, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). The remaining part of the data served to train and test the statistical models by comparing the ‘predicted’ to the ‘actual’ reported bond strength. To validate the networks, they were additionally trained on 2 random subsamples. From the 1500 networks that were trained, 8 were retained electronically, and from the 8 remaining ones, the 4 providing the most consistent results were retained by hand. Training, testing, and validation performance of all retained networks, as measured by correlation between the target and predicted value, were 83%, 75%, and 73%, respectively. An important feature of neural networks is generalization, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the ability to predict the outcome of data unknown to the model. If the performance of the network is consistently good on both the test and validation samples, then it is reasonable to assume that the network generalizes well on unseen data. We used this feature to predict the performance of the 10 most common adhesives in the database, as tested by the most prevalent ‘research groups’. In this way, a homogenous dataset was created, so that different groups could be compared.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analyses</title>
<p>From the 1,049 studies identified, 298 yielded bond-strength data relevant for the current meta-analysis, from which 2,157 individual bond-strength tests were extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511431251">Fig. 1</xref>). The two main reasons for exclusion were either that the manuscript contained no bond-strength data or that less than 2 commercial adhesives were used. Six major bond-strength tests were identified, namely, ‘tensile’, ‘shear’, and ‘push-out’, each in a ‘micro’ and ‘macro’ variant. The µTBS and macro-shear bond-strength (MSBS) tests together represented 83% of all tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511431251">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, further analysis was limited to these 2 set-ups and was conducted separately, given the considerably different bond strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511431251">Fig. 1</xref>) and loading conditions.</p>

<p>Two-way ANOVA indicated that ‘adhesive class’ as well as ‘artificial aging’ significantly affected the µTBS outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511431251">Fig. 2</xref>). For the MSBS, only aging had a significant effect. Consequently, the discriminative power of a micro-tensile test appeared better than that of a macro-shear test. To substantiate this observation further, we investigated in detail the ‘control’ bond strength of two frequently tested adhesives (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray and Adper Prompt L-Pop, 3M ESPE). µTBS testing revealed a distinct and significant difference between both adhesives (p &lt; 0.0001), while for the MSBS test, the relative difference was smaller and non-significant (p = 0.3716).</p>

<p>Most correlations observed were low (highest r = 0.28) and non-significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034511431251">Table 2</xref>). For the µTBS subset, bond strength decreased significantly with increasing water-storage time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034511431251">Table 2</xref>). For the assessment of bond durability, water-storage was used in 51 of the 295 retained studies. For the macro-shear subset, bond strength also decreased with storage time, but not significantly. Thermocycling is the second-most-used artificial aging methodology (39 studies), although 16 studies did not have a control group without thermocycling. However, the number of thermocycles, varying between 300 and 100,000, did not affect bond strength (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034511431251">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The BIOMAT database contains only µTBS data, mainly testing bond strength to dentin. The methodology varied only slightly over the years, and only a limited amount of operators (&lt; 20) were involved. This resulted in a database more consistent than that obtained from the literature, but less representative of the whole spectrum of experimental conditions. Since the same inclusion criteria were used as for the literature review, only 197 out of the 969 records contained relevant data, of which the majority was short-term bond-strength to bur-cut dentin. Some relevant data regarding extended water-storage and thermocycling were gathered as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034511431251">Fig. 3</xref>, Appendix Table 1). Overall, we observed a trend similar to that in the micro-tensile subset of the literature review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034511431251">Table 3</xref>), though some differences were more pronounced. The bond strength of Adper Prompt is 37% lower than the three-step gold standard as predicted by the ANN, while in the BIOMAT database, it is 48% lower.</p>

<title>Artificial Neural Networks</title>
<p>The aim of the sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034511431251">Table 1</xref>) was to classify the meta-model input parameters according to their influence on the predicted dentin bond strength (the higher the value, the more relevant). The two variables most determining for the bond-strength outcome were the ‘research group’ and the ‘adhesive’ (2.9 and 2.81, respectively); both had almost three times more impact on bond strength than the least important variables: ‘storage time’, ‘thermocycling’, and ‘age of the adhesive’ (1.07, 1.02, and 1.02, respectively).</p>
<p>Mean bond strength was predicted for the most prevalent adhesives tested in ‘control’ conditions (<italic>per</italic> manufacturer’s instructions, bonded to SiC-paper-ground dentin, and tested within 1 wk) and as it would be measured by the 7 most productive ‘research groups’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034511431251">Table 3</xref>). The mean bond strength of the best-performing adhesive was almost twice as high as that of the least-performing adhesive. It is also noteworthy that the range of predictions is very broad, as also appears from the literature. For example, the ‘control’ bond strength reported in the literature for OptiBond FL (Kerr) and One-up Bond F (Tokuyama) ranges from 33 to 81 MPa (n = 31) and from 11 to 51 MPa (n = 20), respectively. This range is in line with the ANN-predicted range of 39 to 58 MPa and 14 to 43 MPa, respectively. Similarly, the bond strength as would be obtained after one-year water storage or when the adhesive was bonded to dentin prepared by a diamond bur (as opposed to SiC paper) was predicted by ANN. Both consistently resulted in a decrease, ranging from 5% to 39%, in comparison with ‘control’ bond-strength data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034511431251">Table 2</xref>). The magnitude of this decrease differed for each adhesive. Some adhesives were more affected by water storage, others more by bur preparation. It is noteworthy that adhesives with higher ‘control’ bond strength appeared less sensitive to aging. From the 10 most frequently tested adhesives, the highest predicted ‘control’ bond strength was recorded for OptiBond FL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034511431251">Table 3</xref>); it appeared also to be the least affected by aging and bur preparation (10% and 5% decrease, respectively). A little lower ‘control’ bond strength was recorded for the mild self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray), for which the predicted decreases were 15% after aging and 21% when applied to bur-cut dentin. The lowest ‘control’ bond strength and highest bond-strength reduction (upon aging and bur-cut preparation) were recorded for One-up Bond F. A similar tendency was noted for other all-in-one adhesives.</p>
<p>When the adhesives that were most frequently tested in the literature were grouped <italic>per</italic> ‘adhesive class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), the highest and most aging-resistant bond strength was found for the 2-step self-etch adhesives, closely followed by the 3-step etch &amp; rinse adhesives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034511431251">Table 3</xref>). Although the ‘control’ bond strengths of the 2-step etch &amp; rinse adhesives were in the same range, they were much more affected by aging. One-step self-etch adhesives were affected considerably by aging as well as by bur-cut preparation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this review, 295 bond-strength studies were included, considerably more than the 75 studies in a literature review conducted 10 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034511431251">Leloup <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, review period 1992-1996), even with our stricter inclusion criteria. In this meta-analysis, studies testing only a single commercial adhesive were excluded, while they comprised 32% of the data in the previous review. Given the enormous amount of data included, and, for instance, the fact that 7 out of the 10 most-tested adhesives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034511431251">Table 2</xref>) are, at the time of this publication, still commercially available, and that very recent “state-of-the-art” assessments of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034511431251">Pashley <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) revealed no significant advancement in adhesive technology or in bond-strength study design, it is very likely that the outcome of this systematic analysis will remain relevant for quite some time. Two major test set-ups were present in the literature, of which the micro-tensile test had a higher discriminative power than the macro-shear test. This may explain the current popularity of µTBS testing in the research community: In the period 1992 to 1996, macro-shear testing still provided 75% of the data reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034511431251">Leloup <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), while this dropped to 22% in this study (2004-2009). This is substantiated by the observation that macro-shear testing apparently has no value in the prediction of clinical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034511431251">Heintze and Rousson, 2011</xref>), in contrast to the µTBS that correlated with the two-year and five-year outcomes of Class V clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034511431251">Heintze and Rousson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of this meta-analytical review was based on ANN. This methodology is inspired by the working mechanism of the human brain, and its principles are based on crude and low-level models of biological neural information processing systems. Neural networks have a remarkable ability to derive and extract meaning, rules, and trends from complicated, noisy, and imprecise data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034511431251">Bishop, 1996</xref>). This neural network model-building technique is an alternative to more traditional statistical methods like general linear models and is becoming popular not only in research, but also in fields such as engineering and marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034511431251">Paliwala and Kumar, 2009</xref>). Recently, ANN has been used to assess meta-analysis data in clinical psychology from ‘dot-probe’ tests conducted by diverse researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034511431251">Frewen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). A similar network-building technique was used to disclose interdependencies between brain regions from functional MRI imaging data collected from more than 500 imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034511431251">Neumann <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). This demonstrates the versatility and wide range of applications for these ANN, especially for the analysis of a large amount of heterogeneous data. Generalization of the results of any of these models, <italic>i.e.,</italic> to predict the outcome of tests not available in the database, is possible if a proven methodology is followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034511431251">Kleijnen and Sargent, 2000</xref>) and when appropriate validation takes place. Therefore, in this study, a part of the data (a random subset with 20% of the original data) was masked from the model-fitting algorithm and was used only to validate the observed data. This also allows for some degree of control of over- and under-fitting of the model.</p>
<p>The most significant parameter identified by ANN was the ‘research group’, which can be regarded as an aggregate parameter for all variables that are (ideally more or less) standardized within one testing laboratory. Additionally, parameters included in the current analysis, like composite flexural modulus and substrate origin, are standardized in many research groups, which may reduce the sensitivity of these parameters; hence the reported effect is smaller than their real effect on the bond strength outcome. This is also the main reason experimental parameters, such as crosshead speed, clamping method, storage solution, specimen shape, etc., were not recorded; within each research group, all these experimental parameters are standardized to facilitate intra-study comparison. For inter-study comparison, the primary goal of this review, test variability induced by specimen preparation and testing protocols cannot be neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511431251">Rueggeberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034511431251">Betamar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034511431251">Poitevin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Different sources of variability can be identified: biological substrate variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034511431251">Shono <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and substrate processing-induced differences, as for example different kinds of smear layers, specimen sizes, and preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034511431251">Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034511431251">Ermis <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034511431251">Cardoso <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Even minute modifications of the test set-up can change the outcome considerably, as suggested by finite element analysis and practical testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511431251">Rueggeberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034511431251">Fowler <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034511431251">Betamar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034511431251">Poitevin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Given the heterogeneity of test results collected worldwide, inter-study comparison may appear useless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034511431251">Scherrer <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, from this large quantity of blurred data, we were able to disclose some trends in bonding effectiveness to dentin using an ANN approach. The parameter ‘research group’ accounted for most of the variability in bonding effectiveness and therefore appeared most determining for the outcome. As a result, our ‘predicted’ bond-strength values largely varied, similar to bond strengths published in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034511431251">Scherrer <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). But unlike the literature, our ‘predicted’ bond-strength values are equally distributed and thus mutually comparable, thereby better representing real adhesive performance. An example of this effect in the BIOMAT database is that two-step self-etch adhesives apparently do not degrade by water storage (Appendix Table 1). However, this must be partly attributed to the fact that, in the water storage group, only very few groups with better-performing adhesives (Clearfil SE and Clearfil Protect Bond) are present. Therefore, these grouped performances are less reliable, when analyzed by conventional techniques, while by ANN this poses less of a problem.</p>
<p>A major concern in any meta-analysis is bias of the retrieved data at the study level as well as the outcome level (publication bias). Unlike clinical studies, randomization and blinding are uncommon for bond-strength studies and therefore are no measure for the quality of the included studies. Therefore, a guideline such as the PRISMA statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034511431251">Moher et al., 2009</xref>), which is aimed at clinical interventions, is less applicable to the current review (Appendix Table 4). We preserved the quality of the included studies by applying strict inclusion criteria. At the study level, bias was further minimized by the fact that primarily ‘control’ data were used, and the actual experimental groups (involving experimental compositions/conditions), more prone to reporting bias, were often not included in the database. To assess publication bias, we compared data of the literature review with data obtained in a single research laboratory. Overall, the similarities are prevailing. The two best-performing adhesives are exactly the same; overall, one-step self-etch adhesives do underperform and are prone to degradation upon water storage; adhesive performance is affected by water storage, while thermocycling has a negligible effect. It is noteworthy that, in the BIOMAT database, differences induced by experimental conditions were more pronounced (<italic>e.g</italic>., 1-year water storage induced a decrease of up to 72%, while only up to 36% was predicted by ANN). This must be attributed to the attenuating effect of pooling many studies and the specific statistics used that appear to result in a more conservative outcome. So overall, the effect of publication bias is minimal, apart from a publication delay as exemplified by the non-existence of self-adhesive filling materials in the literature, while these are already available in the BIOMAT database.</p>
<p>The best performing adhesive, both short- and long-term, was the three-step etch &amp; rinse adhesive OptiBond FL (Kerr). This so-called ‘gold standard’ adhesive indeed presents with a very favorable laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034511431251">Peutzfeldt and Asmussen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034511431251">Sarr <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) and clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034511431251">Boghosian <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034511431251">Peumans <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) performance. The second-best-performing adhesive in this meta-analysis was the two-step self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray), a mild self-etch adhesive which is also noted for its excellent long-term laboratory as well as clinical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034511431251">Peumans <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034511431251">Osorio <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Major clinical concerns regarding today’s adhesive technology are technique sensitivity and bond durability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022034511431251">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), both of which were assessed in this meta-analysis. In 16% of the database records, some aspects regarding technique sensitivity of adhesives were tested, such as increased/decreased etching time, adapted hydration state of the etched dentin, application of additional layers, increased/reduced air blowing, etc. None of these adapted application protocols, however, was consistently applied by multiple authors, so a numerical appreciation was not possible. Pooling of all these modifications revealed only a very small reduction in bond strength, as compared with ‘control’ data, applied as <italic>per</italic> manufacturers’ instructions (31.3 <italic>vs.</italic> 31.5 MPa, respectively). One specific parameter is related to the way dentin is prepared prior to bonding. The most-used preparation methods identified in this review were preparation by either a carbide or diamond dental bur or by silicon-carbide (SiC) paper. Overall, etch &amp; rinse adhesives appeared less affected when prepared by a dental bur (<italic>vs</italic>. SiC paper), while self-etch adhesives appeared more affected, especially the one-step version. This is not unexpected, because a bur-cut dentin surface is covered with a thicker and more compact smear layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034511431251">Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and thus may impede the bonding effectiveness of especially (ultra)-mild self-etch adhesives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034511431251">Koshiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It should be stressed that in simulations of clinical practice, dentin is best prepared by a bur, although in many bond-strength studies, adhesives are bonded to SiC-ground dentin.</p>
<p>Regarding bond durability, more consensus in assessment methodology is present in the literature. In 92% of the durability data, thermocycling or extended water storage was applied. Therefore, both methodologies were included in the ANN analysis as well as in the correlation analysis. Because of methodological issues, the sensitivity of both parameters was not very high in the ANN analysis, but some interesting conclusions can be drawn based upon correlations as well as predictions. First, ‘thermocycling’ did not affect the outcome of bond-strength tests, as was also shown in the previous review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034511431251">Leloup <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). This may be partly due to the low number of thermocycles used in most studies (mean/median was 6,657/1,150 cycles). Simple ‘water storage’, however, has a clear bond-degrading effect; it mimics the clinically observed restoration degradation very well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034511431251">Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034511431251">De Munck <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Our correlation analysis indicated that µTBS degrades significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) upon water storage. Neural network predictions, however, do point out that different adhesives degrade differently; bond-strength reductions ranged from 10% to 35% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034511431251">Table 3</xref>). The actual composition of the different adhesives, particularly the monomers, solvents, and initiators used, may account for this observed variability. Data in the BIOMAT database appear more affected by water storage (Appendix Table 1), which is, apart from methodological issues, also related to the storage of micro-specimens (direct exposure to water) instead of the whole restored teeth (indirect exposure) in most literature. Not surprisingly, 3-step etch &amp; rinse and 2-step self-etch adhesives appear most resistant to hydrolytic degradation; they provide a separate, more hydrophobic resin layer as the final application step.</p>
<p>In summary, despite the lack of a standard bond-strength protocol, this meta-analysis allowed us, thanks to the vast amount of data available, to draw some clear conclusions with regard to the effectiveness of different adhesive approaches to dentin bonding. Moreover, there exists a definite need to measure not only the ‘immediate’ bond strength, but also ‘aged’ bond strength in predictions of long-term clinical performance. Finally, in simulations of a clinically produced smear layer, a dental bur should be preferentially used in laboratory bond-strength testing.</p>
