<abstract>
<p>In 2011, the US federal government implemented an oversight program to encourage the adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). Otolaryngologists may receive as much as $44,000 under Medicare or $63,750 under Medicaid as part of this law. To receive this full benefit, otolaryngologists must acquire a certified EHR and demonstrate stage 1 meaningful use requirements by the end of 2012. Furthermore, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT intends to advance meaningful use requirements to stage 2 (estimated to go in effect in 2014) and stage 3 requirements. This commentary discusses updated recommendations from the Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Medical Informatics Committee for implementing meaningful use of EHRs, receiving incentive payments, and preparing for potential stage 2 and stage 3 requirements.</p>

<title>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and Incentives</title>
<p>In February 2009, President Barack Obama and the 111th US Congress enacted into law the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434534">1</xref></sup> As part of this program, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will offer incentive payments of up to $44,000 per otolaryngologist participating in Medicare over 5 years (10% more if in a health provider shortage area) or $63,750 if participating in Medicaid over 6 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434534">2</xref></sup> Otolaryngologists have until the end of 2012 to enroll in this program to receive the full benefit, and those who do not implement meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs) by 2015 will be penalized a variable percentage of their Medicare fee schedule, as high as 3% in 2018.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599811434534">
<title>Receiving Incentive Payments and Penalties</title>
<p>The HITECH Act established separate incentive programs for Medicare and Medicaid. Otolaryngologists may choose to participate in one or the other (if their state is participating in the Medicaid program). The program for Medicare is federally run by CMS, specifically the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), and the program for Medicaid is run by each participating state. The Medicaid program is voluntary; as of October 3, 2011, 33 states were participating in the Medicaid incentive program. To receive incentive payments, otolaryngologists should follow guidelines in the Path to Payment Web page at CMS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms/10_PathtoPayment.asp">http://www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms/10_PathtoPayment.asp</ext-link>). Briefly, for Medicare participants, eligible professionals will need to register with the CMS PECOS system, have their National Provider Identifier number and social security number, and register at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ehrincentives.cms.gov">https://ehrincentives.cms.gov</ext-link>. Employees of large institutions may have authorized professionals register them for participation. Otolaryngologists should then acquire or upgrade to an EHR that has been certified by CMS to qualify for the incentive program, meaningfully using this EHR as defined by the ONC requirements for 90 days for the first year (if started in 2011 or 2012), and attest to this federally defined meaningful use at the same registration site. Otolaryngologists will need the certification number of their EHR for attestation at the registration site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599811434534">
<title>Stage 1 Meaningful Use Overview and Recommendations</title>
<p>The HITECH Act established 3 stages of meaningful use: stage 1 was required in 2011, stage 2 has likely been delayed for implementation until 2014, and stage 3 will probably be implemented by 2016. The final rule for stage 1 was announced in July 2010. In stage 1, otolaryngologists must complete 15 core objectives and 5 of 10 additional objectives listed on a menu set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434534">3</xref></sup> Otolaryngologists participating in the Medicare program will need to submit 3 core clinical quality measures to CMS. Otolaryngologists may supplement any of these core measures from an alternate set of core measures if the denominator is zero for any of the first 3 core measures. In addition, otolaryngologists must submit 3 more clinical quality measures from an approved list of 38 measures.</p>
<p>In the 2011 the socioeconomic survey performed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), 67% of 1364 respondents reported using EHR technology. Seventy-five percent of the EHR users reported their intention to try to obtain meaningful use incentive payments. However, anecdotal data suggest that very few, if any, otolaryngologists received incentive payments in 2011. If otolaryngologists live in 1 of the 33 states participating in the Medicaid incentive program and have &gt;30% Medicaid volume (not including CHIP, sliding scale, or free patients unless in a federal-qualified health center or rural health clinic), then they may prefer to choose to participate in the Medicaid program. Pediatric otolaryngologists represent a unique situation. Pediatricians need a minimum 20% Medicaid volume, but ultimately, the physician’s state decides whether pediatric otolaryngologists are considered “pediatricians” for the purposes of meaningful use incentives (more information can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cms.gov/apps/files/statecontacts.pdf">https://www.cms.gov/apps/files/statecontacts.pdf</ext-link>). Specific recommendations for obtaining stage 1 meaningful use requirements have been published by this committee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811434534">4</xref></sup>; however, 1 of these recommendations was incorrect. Specifically, most otolaryngologists should not use breast and colorectal cancer screening as a clinical quality measure (CQM) because this CQM requires the ability to interpret and act on screening data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599811434534">
<title>Stage 2 Requirements</title>
<p>As part of the HITECH Act, CMS signaled its intention to implement more stringent standards for meaningful use in stage 2 and stage 3. This includes increased data reporting of stage 1 requirements (not by attestation); increased thresholds for many measures; some new requirements, including structured data within physician documentation; and increased patient engagement. Currently, stage 2 appears to be delayed likely for 1 year due to a recommendation from the HIT policy committee and not required until 2014. In stage 2, all optional requirements of stage 1 are likely to become required, and yes/no attestations are likely to require percentage reporting with minimal percentage thresholds. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811434534"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> for probable increased thresholds from stage 2 requirements. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811434534"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> for changes from stage 1 requirements. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811434534"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> for probable new stage 2 requirements.</p>

<title>Future Considerations</title>
<p>There is great concern in the physician community that inflexible, overly ambitious incentive program requirements will hinder health care transition to EHRs. In addition, much of the infrastructure and the desired level of interoperability and information sharing do not yet exist. The AAO-HNS, both on its own and along with 37 other physician organizations, provided comments to the ONC expressing their commitment to significantly increasing EHR adoption, while admonishing that requirements for participation must be realistic and attainable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434534">5</xref></sup> While stage 2 requirements are still in a dynamic state of creation, it is unlikely they will be changed significantly from original policy recommendations. Stage 3 recommendations are predicted to be more stringent, with possible additional requirements including the provision of electronic self-management tools to patients and the ability of EHR systems to exchange data with personal health record services. Therefore, it behooves practicing otolaryngologists interested in receiving incentive payments to prepare for probable stage 2 and stage 3 requirements and to advocate to legislators for regulations that allow the use of an EHR that truly leads to higher quality, otolaryngologic care.</p>
