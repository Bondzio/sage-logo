<abstract>
<p>In this article, we use a new and rich longitudinal data set, the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study, which allows us to follow a cohort of girls and boys until they reach 48 years of age. We study differences in the social background and adult living conditions among men and women with different experiences of involvement in crime. It is clear that the female cohort members who have been registered for crime have experienced more disadvantaged childhoods than the males registered for offending. The results also indicate that involvement in crime seems to cost more for females, in terms of social exclusion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A long time has now passed since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085111429783">Heidensohn (1968)</xref> presented her now classic critique of criminology’s failure to illuminate the phenomenon of female offending. Since then, the research field has evolved considerably, but there are still areas where our knowledge remains limited. One such area involves longitudinal studies of female offenders and similarities and differences in the life courses of males and females, respectively. This gap in the knowledge has proved a difficult one to fill, in part because many longitudinal studies have only included males (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085111429783">Farrington, Tfofi, &amp; Coid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111429783">Laub &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111429783">Piquero, Farrington, Nagin, &amp; Moffitt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085111429783">Pulkkinen, Lyyra, &amp; Kokko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085111429783">Soothill, Christoffersen, Hussain, &amp; Francis, 2010</xref>) and in part because those studies that do include females are rarely of a size that permits analysis of the criminal careers of women (see, for example, the conclusions presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111429783">Bergman &amp; Andershed 2009</xref>, p. 175; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111429783">Giordano, Cernkovich, &amp; Rudolph, 2002</xref>, p. 1012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085111429783">Lay, Ihle, Esser, &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>, p. 47). In addition, on the basis of a review of prospective longitudinal studies which include females, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111429783">Block, Blokland, van der Werff, van Os, and Nieuwbeerta (2010</xref>, p. 75) conclude that very few of these follow women further than young adulthood. A further limitation is that few studies have broadened their analyses to include other gendered adult outcomes than involvement in crime. Thus, although it is well established that many more males than females commit various types of crime, there is much less information available on the extent to which the life courses of males and females who have been involved in crime are similar or distinctive.</p>
<p>In this study, we compare different groups of males and females defined on the basis of their registered crime at different ages. What similarities and differences can we see in their social background, criminality, drug abuse, and living conditions in late midlife? We employ a new and unique longitudinal data set, The Stockholm Birth Cohort Study (SBC), which allows us to follow a cohort of boys and girls born in Stockholm in 1953 until they reach the age of 48 years.</p>
<sec id="section2-1557085111429783">
<title>Should We Expect Gender Differences in the Causes and Costs of Crime?</title>
<p>Boys and girls share most of the risk-factors associated with juvenile delinquency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1557085111429783">Wong, Slotboom, &amp; Bijleveld, 2010</xref>). However, we know less of the existence, or nonexistence, of gender differences in the long-term consequences of criminal involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111429783">Tanner, Davies, and O’Grady (1999)</xref> use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to study the long-term impact of self-reported teen delinquency. They show that delinquency has a negative effect on life chances, since it reduces the likelihood of educational and occupational achievements in young adulthood (at ages 25-30). For males, juvenile delinquency predicted both a low academic status and a higher risk for unemployment. For females, however, it was only their educational attainment that was negatively influenced by delinquency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111429783">Tanner et al. (1999</xref>, p. 269) argue that one possible explanation is that this finding reflects the differing role played by employment among males and females, respectively.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Dunedin longitudinal study (an analysis of 1,000 males and females), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111429783">Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, and Silva (2001</xref>, p. 46) confirm that both the males and the females who presented conduct disorders in youth had worse living conditions in young adulthood. Males’ problems were more often related to the labor market, drug use, and crime, whereas females had worse outcomes in relative terms with regard to relationship problems and physical and mental ill-health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111429783">Moffitt et al. (2001)</xref> conclude that “the extant literature contains very few actual empirical demonstrations of sex differences in the aetiological factors involved with becoming antisocial, in the correlates of antisocial behaviour, or in its long-term consequences” (p. 5). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085111429783">Odgers et al. (2008</xref>) have presented a study of the Dunedin cohort where they follow the men and women up to age 32. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085111429783">Odgers et al. (2008</xref>, p. 706), their study is the first to highlight differences in adulthood between different female offender groups. One important finding is that persistent offenders experience poor outcomes across multiple domains at age 32 and that persistent female offenders experience the most severe consequences in adulthood. Their findings support similarities across gender with respect to developmental trajectories of antisocial behavior and their associated childhood origins and adult consequences.</p>
<p>The link between crime and gendered negative outcomes in later life is more clear in studies that have employed measures indicating involvement in more serious crime (registered rather than self-reported) or that have focused on samples of more serious offenders such as institutionalized individuals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson, Yahner, &amp; Dugan, 2008</xref>). Results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111429783">Bergman and Andershed (2009)</xref> indicate<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1557085111429783">1</xref></sup> that females who were officially <italic>registered</italic> for crime during adolescence were at higher risk for a wide range of problems as adults compared with male offenders (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111429783">Molero Samuelsson, 2011</xref>). Studies from the Ohio Life-Course Study (OLS)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1557085111429783">2</xref></sup> also show that the females had more negative life outcomes than the corresponding group of males (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111429783">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>, p. 1012). What offenders of both sexes did have in common, however, was low educational achievement, problematic family backgrounds, and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111429783">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>, p. 1052). In another study from the Ohio project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111429783">Lanctot, Cernkovich, and Giordano (2007)</xref> conclude that “gender differences were observed in every life domain . . . these results also indicate that previously institutionalized females face the most adverse conditions during young adulthood” (p. 148).</p>
<p>Why should it cost more to be a female offender? Even if delinquent boys and girls share the same risk factors, the considerably lower rate of female offenders indicates that the selection processes into crime may differ for men and women. There is therefore reason to expect it to “take more” to become a female offender. Studies from both sides of the Atlantic have shown that female offenders who end up being dealt with by the justice system have often grown up in very difficult home conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085111429783">Katz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111429783">Mullings, Pollock, &amp; Crouch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557085111429783">Nilsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson, 2008</xref>). These do not primarily involve resource deficiencies measured in terms of variables focused on socioeconomic status (SES) or coming from a “broken home” but instead more serious social problems, involving, for example, families characterised by long-term poverty, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental illness, child neglect, and physical and sexual abuse (for reviews of gendered pathways, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085111429783">Belknap &amp; Holsinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085111429783">Holsinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111429783">Mullings et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, it is also reasonable to expect that women will experience more negative consequences as a result of involvement in crime than male offenders. Female offenders are more stigmatized than men as they break not only the law but also the norms and expectations associated with their femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085111429783">Heidensohn, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085111429783">Kyvsgaard, 1989</xref>, p. 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111429783">Steffensmeier &amp; Allan, 1996</xref>, p. 476). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111429783">Gorman-Smith and Loeber (2005)</xref> conclude that in consequence, the powerful social sanctions directed against the delinquent behavior of girls mean “that it may take a particularly deviant family to impact risk among girls” (p. 25).</p>

<title>The Importance of Drug Abuse</title>
<p>In previous studies, we have shown that drug abuse is a factor with close links to involvement in crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111429783">Nilsson &amp; Estrada, 2009</xref>; see also, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111429783">Mullings et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1557085111429783">Torstensson, 1987</xref>) and which also has consequences for future opportunities and life careers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085111429783">Krohn, Lizotte, &amp; Perez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111429783">Laub &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557085111429783">Nilsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111429783">Sarnecki &amp; Sollenhag, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111429783">Schroeder, Giordano, &amp; Cernkovich, 2007</xref>). This is not least of the case in societies where the prosecution of the possession and use of illicit drugs is a priority in the work of the police and where the explicit goal is that of making it difficult to be a drug abuser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557085111429783">Lenke &amp; Olsson, 2002</xref>). Drug abusers risk not only convictions associated with the handling of drugs (possession or sale) but also for a range of minor offences intended to finance their drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111429783">Mullings et al., 2002</xref>). It is also well known that drug use is a key element in the so-called “Street Woman scenario”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1557085111429783">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111429783">Daly, 1992</xref>) which in the literature is seen as a central pathway of female lawbreaking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In their analysis of involvement in crime over the life cycle on the basis of Dutch cohort data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111429783">Blokland, Nagin, and Nieuwbeerta (2005</xref>, p. 936) note that the offending of the most criminal group involved a wide range of offence types, of which the majority were less serious property offences. The persistent group also tended to perform poorly in both professional and personal life-course domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111429783">Blokland et al., 2005</xref>, p. 936). One limitation of the study is that it does not illuminate the question of whether, and in what ways, the results are specific for male offenders or are also applicable to females. In their discussion of the results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111429783">Blokland et al. (2005</xref>, p. 945) argue that one possible explanation for the crime pattern exhibited by the persistent group is that the group is largely composed of drug addicts who commit offences to finance their drug abuse. Blokland et al. found it difficult to examine this question further in their own study, however, as they lacked reliable data on drug abuse among the members of the cohort. It is noteworthy that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111429783">Tanner et al.’s (1999</xref>, p.266) study, drug use was not such an important factor in predicting negative outcomes in young adulthood for either males or females. However, the study in question is based on self-report data and does not separate the more serious use of illegal drugs from alcohol use. The fact that, in the present study, we will look more closely at the significance of drug abuse for the risk for social exclusion in midlife for different offender groups of both sexes has therefore potential to be a significant contribution to the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1557085111429783">
<title>Objectives and Research Questions</title>
<p>By comparing the lives of delinquent boys and girls, we aim to increase our understanding of gender-specific and gender-neutral long-term consequences of criminal involvement. The fact that we study both sexes, thus expanding the research field to describe not only the reality of men but also that of women, is clearly one of the strengths of this study. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that are able to analyze the significance of involvement in crime, childhood circumstances, and drug abuse for living conditions up to late midlife, while at the same time including comparisons of males and females. Our main research question centers on how life turned out in late midlife for boys and girls with different levels of involvement in crime. Does it take more, in terms of childhood risk factors, and cost more, in terms of long-term negative consequences, to be a female offender?</p>
<p>Our outcome measures in late midlife focus on labor market attachment, income, and family situation. In the following section, we present the SBC and describe the way variables have been operationalized. The results section begins with a presentation of the crime, drug abuse, and social situation of the males and females, respectively, during childhood and adolescence. We then move on to describe living conditions in late midlife. The presentation of findings concludes with multivariate analysis of the associations between gender and the social exclusion of different groups of offenders in midlife, which include controls for both differences in drug abuse and in other conditions during childhood and adolescence.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-1557085111429783">
<title>Data—The SBC</title>
<p>The SBC is a longitudinal database created by combining two data sets (for a more detailed description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085111429783">Stenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111429783">Stenberg &amp; Vågerö, 2006</xref>). The first of these is the Metropolitan Study, which comprises all individuals born in 1953 and living in Stockholm 10 years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085111429783">Jansson, 1995</xref>). The Metropolitan data set includes a large amount of register-based and survey data relating to both the parents and the individuals themselves. For almost the entire length of the Metropolitan project (1963-1986), data were collected from a range of different registers. The data set includes information on, among other things, income, social welfare recipiency, social group, educational achievement, hospital treatment, interventions from Child Welfare Committees, and involvement in crime (for criminological studies that have used this data set, see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111429783">Fry, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085111429783">Kratzer &amp; Hodgkins 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1557085111429783">Torstensson, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1557085111429783">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085111429783">Wikström, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111429783">1990</xref>). The other data set, to which the Metropolitan study has been linked, is the Health, Illness, Income and Employment database (the HSIA 1980-2001). This database is composed of register data on all individuals living in Sweden in either 1980 or 1990. The data set we have been able to use for the current study includes information on, among other things, income, welfare benefit recipiency, and family type.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1557085111429783">4</xref></sup> Since both databases had been anonymized, a probability matching procedure has been employed. It was possible in this way to match a total of 96% of the observations in the Metropolitan study—14,294 individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1557085111429783">5</xref></sup> The combination of the two data sets means that it is possible to follow the original cohort of individuals born in 1953 until year 2001 when they were 48 years of age.</p>
<sec id="section6-1557085111429783">
<title>Criminality and Drug Abuse</title>
<p>The information on the cohort members’ criminality is drawn from the official police register of criminal records. The register contains information on offences that have either resulted in a conviction or, in cases involving younger offenders, been reported to the Child Welfare Committee. For each year from 1966 up to the first 6 months of 1984, that is, the year when the cohort members were 31 years of age, the data set contains information on the number and type of offences committed. These offences have been divided into seven categories: Violence, Theft, Fraud, Vandalism, Motoring offences, Drug offences, and Other offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085111429783">Wikström, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111429783">1990</xref>). We proceed on the basis of a categorization that distinguishes four different groups on the basis of their criminal activity at different ages (other longitudinal studies have employed similar classifications, see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111429783">Bergman &amp; Andershed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111429783">Eggleston &amp; Laub, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557085111429783">Farrington et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085111429783">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085111429783">Lay et al., 2005</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-1557085111429783" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>No crime</italic>: those individuals who have never been registered for crime</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Desisters</italic>: those who desist from crime prior to the age of 20</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Late onset offenders</italic>: individuals who are registered for crime for the first time after the age of 19</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Persisters</italic>: those who persist in crime, that is, individuals who were registered for crime both during their youth and as adults.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The question of typologies and classifications of offenders has been the subject of some considerable debate, a discussion that has focused on both theoretical and methodological issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1557085111429783">Skardhamar, 2010</xref>). We make no claims that our classification distinguishes homogeneous categories with distinctive careers. By means of our division of the study participants, we distinguish between those who desisted from crime before the transition from youth to adult life and those who were registered for crime as adults. Failure in the transition to adult life, a phase where occupational careers and family formation are initiated, has been shown to have a long-term negative impact on future attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111429783">Bäckman &amp; Nilsson, 2011</xref>). As will be seen below, we are also able on the basis of this rather simple division of the study participants to differentiate between individuals with very different levels of involvement in crime. The SBC includes three different pieces of data relating to the prevalence of drug abuse, which capture the situation both in adolescence and early adulthood (for a further description, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1557085111429783">appendix</xref>). Together these official sources provide us with a picture of the cohort members’ registered drug abuse from age 13 (1966) to age 30 (1983).</p>

<title>Measures of the Cohort Members’ Situation During Childhood and Adolescence</title>
<p>Our measures on circumstances during childhood and adolescence are taken from different registers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1557085111429783">appendix</xref>) and capture SES, poverty, and social problems in the family of origin. These are measures that we know to be correlated with the cohort members’ registered criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111429783">Nilsson &amp; Estrada, 2009</xref>) and also with social exclusion in midlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111429783">Bäckman &amp; Nilsson, 2011</xref>). In our final models, we also include controls for cognitive ability (results from mental tests conducted when the cohort members were 13 years old) and school performance, which is measured by school grades in year 9 of compulsory school (age 16).</p>

<title>Measures on the Cohort Members’ Situation in Late Midlife</title>
<p>Our outcome measures in late midlife relate to labor market attachment, income, social exclusion, family status, and mortality. These are all constructed from population-based register data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1557085111429783">appendix</xref>). Family formation and marital status are measured at two time points: 1991 and 2001. A common child (or marriage) is a prerequisite to be counted as a cohabiting couple. To study formal labor market attachment, we have divided the cohort into different groups on the basis of their employment status and income in 2001. As a first step, the cohort members were divided into groups on the basis of annual earnings recalculated into what are referred to as <italic>price base amounts</italic> (PBAs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1557085111429783">6</xref></sup> The category <italic>In Employment</italic> is composed of those earning at least 3.5 PBA. This threshold was set to correspond to the lowest amount on which individuals can support themselves for a year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1557085111429783">7</xref></sup> The group <italic>Unstable Labor Market Attachment</italic> includes those earning between 1 and 3.5 PBA. The category <italic>No Labor Market Attachment</italic> is composed of those with a very low income (below 1 PBA) or no income at all. We also created categories that distinguish those on disability pensions and students. With regard to income, we divided the cohort into three groups—those with the lowest 20% of incomes, the highest 20%, and the remainder.</p>
<p>Our measure of social exclusion distinguishes the proportion, who, at age 48, were either outside the labor market (those with either no labor market attachment, or on disability pensions) or were in receipt of social welfare benefit. Being unemployed is to be denied both a certain type of social relationships and access to a social institution, the labor market, of which most people of working age are members. Similarly, financial poverty denies people full access to a social activity that is taken for granted by most members of modern societies, that is, consumption. Labor market exclusion and poverty do not fully account for the multidimensionality associated with social exclusion, but it nonetheless captures two of the most important dimensions of this construct. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557085111429783">Burchardt (2000)</xref> exclusion from production activities and financial poverty appear as the most central indicators of social exclusion.</p>

<title>Crime Among Females and Males</title>
<p>As expected, we find substantial differences in criminal participation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1557085111429783">Table 1</xref>). Seven percent of the female cohort members had been registered for offending up to the age of 31 as compared with 33% of the males. These proportions are similar to those reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111429783">Bergman &amp; Andershed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111429783">Eggleston &amp; Laub, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111429783">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>, p. 214). There are approximately nine males for each female among the persisters. The overrepresentation of males is much less marked among the desisters and the late onset offenders (approximately four males for each female).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1557085111429783">8</xref></sup> A larger proportion of the female offenders were registered for their first offence subsequent to the teenage years (44% as compared with 31%) which is in line with the results of other studies, which have shown that females have a later age of onset for crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111429783">Block et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111429783">Eggleston &amp; Laub, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085111429783">Stattin, Magnusson, &amp; Reichel, 1989</xref>).</p>

<p>Almost half of the men that were registered for crime as teenagers were also registered as adults. Among females registered for crime as youths, <italic>desistance</italic> was more common; two thirds did not appear again in the criminal register as adults, which is in line with the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111429783">Moffitt et al. (2001)</xref>, for example. The three groups defined on the basis of their criminality as youths and as adults, respectively, differ substantially from one another with regard to the <italic>frequency</italic> of their registered offending. As expected, a small group of offenders account for a large proportion of the registered offences. Altogether, the group of males who continued to commit offences after their teenage years account for more than 75% of the male cohort members’ registered offences, while at the same time constituting 11% of the males in the cohort. Among the females, these individuals comprise 1% of the female cohort members but account for 54% of the females’ adult registered offending. Looking at those cohort members who committed offences as both teenagers and adults, the level of offending among the males is significantly higher than that found among the females during the teenage period. During the adult period, however, the females in the group have on average been registered for just as many offences as the males (although the number of males in the group is substantially larger).</p>
<p>The cohort’s offending, which has been described in previous studies, is dominated by theft, motoring, and fraud offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085111429783">Kratzer &amp; Hodgkins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085111429783">Wikström, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111429783">1990</xref>; see also tables in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111429783">Nilsson &amp; Estrada, 2009</xref>). The clearest difference between the sexes in the <italic>crime mix</italic> (type of crime over the life span) is that the males are registered for motoring offences to a much greater extent, whereas fraud offences account for a larger proportion of the females’ criminality. Crimes of violence constitute only a small proportion of the offences committed, irrespective of crime grouping. The individuals who continue to commit offences as adults do not distinguish themselves by being specialized in any particular type of offending. What differentiates the groups is thus first and foremost not the types of crime engaged in but rather the frequency of offending, and this is the case for both males and females. This pattern corresponds well with the findings of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111429783">Block et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111429783">Blokland et al., 2005</xref>, p. 945; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085111429783">Stattin et al., 1989</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-1557085111429783">
<title>Drug Abuse</title>
<p>A large proportion of those who continue to commit offences subsequent to their teenage years are drug abusers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1557085111429783">Table 2</xref>). This is particularly the case among the females; almost two thirds of the female persisters have been classified as drug abusers in the register data. The other two female offender groups also consist of significantly higher proportions of drug abusers by comparison with the corresponding groups of males. It is also noteworthy that most of the drug abusers are already known to the authorities as such when they are teenagers. Among the males and females who are first registered for crime as adults, however, the majority do not appear in the data as known drug abusers until after the age of 18. Another factor which shows that drug abuse and criminality follow a similar developmental pattern is found in the fact that the proportion of desisters with registered drug abuse declines substantially after the teenage years. There are clear differences as regard the registers in which the different offender groups are found and this, at least in part, can be seen as a reflection of the seriousness of the addiction problem. Both the hospital and needle-mark registers describe more serious drug problems than those found in the files from the Child Welfare Committees.</p>

<p>The SBC database also allows for an examination of the significance of childhood conditions which indicate more serious social problems. In the same way as in the case of financial difficulties, it is clear that the females who have been registered for crime tend to have experienced social problems in their childhood environments more often than the corresponding group of males. It seems as though the females who commit offences repeatedly constitute a more highly selected (poorly resourced) group than the corresponding group of males. It is important to note that it is only when we look at indicators of more direct and accumulated resource deficiencies that it becomes apparent that it takes more to become a female offender.</p>

<title>Family, Work, and Social Exclusion at Age 48</title>
<p>The final year to which we are able to follow the cohort in this study is 2001, the year in which the cohort members celebrated their 48th birthdays. However, of the entire cohort, approximately 2% had died prior to the age of 48 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1557085111429783">Table 4</xref>). The mortality rate is approximately seven times as high (at 13%) among the male and female persisters by comparison with those who have not been registered for crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1557085111429783">9</xref></sup> It is worth noting that the mortality rate is not higher among the females in the persistent crime group than it is among the males. Among the desisters and the late onset group, the mortality rates are considerably lower than among the persisters.</p>

<p>At age 48, most of the men and women were living with others either as married couples or cohabitees (with children in common). They were also in employment, with middle to high incomes, and very few were welfare benefit recipients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1557085111429783">Table 4</xref>). The living conditions of the offenders were significantly worse, however, with a large proportion living by themselves and on low incomes or no income at all. This pattern is more marked among the female cohort members. A majority of the females who had been registered for crime were registered as single at age 48, and this is particularly true among the female persisters, where only a small proportion (20%) were living with a partner. When the focus is directed at labor market attachment, we can see that among the women with no registered involvement in crime, 80% had established themselves on the labor market, which represents more or less the same level as that found among the men. Among the female desisters, the level of labor market attachment was also relatively high. However, for the female persisters, it was as common to be on a disability pension as it was to be in employment. Among the males too, the degree of labor market attachment was markedly worse among the persisters, and, at age 48, only half of them were counted among the core labor force. In late midlife, 2% to 3% of the male and female cohort members were welfare benefit recipients. Among male and female persisters, this proportion is many times greater. The same pattern is found in relation to disability pensions. There is a clear tendency among both males and females for those who had been registered for crime for the first time as adults to have living conditions that were better than those of the persisters but worse than those of the desisters.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1557085111429783">Table 4</xref>, we also present our summary measure of social exclusion (either outside the labor market or in receipt of social welfare benefit). Of the women registered for crime both during and subsequent to their teenage years, almost two thirds meet this definition of social exclusion, compared with just below 40% of the males in the same group. The corresponding proportions are much lower among those who desisted from crime during their teenage years, who are therefore more reminiscent of those with no registered involvement in crime. Those who belong to the late onset group were living in social exclusion to a greater extent at age 48, and the situation of the women was particularly unfavorable. In summary, it is worth noting that for every welfare outcome where there are clear differences between the males and females who have been registered for crime, these differences are to the disadvantage of the females. Why is this? We already know that a larger proportion of the females with registered involvement in crime were drug abusers, and it would therefore seem reasonable to examine this issue in more detail.</p>

<sec id="section14-1557085111429783">
<title>Crime, Drug Abuse, and Social Exclusion</title>
<p>It is clear that drug abuse affects the risk of social exclusion for both sexes, even after controlling for involvement in crime (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1557085111429783">Table 5</xref>). Note, for example, that drug abusers with no official criminal record are more socially excluded than desisters with no known drug abuse. After controlling for drug abuse, the higher risk of social exclusion among females only remains for the small group of persistent offenders who are not drug users. This indicates that drug abuse has particular importance for both patterns of criminality and other life-course outcomes among females.</p>

<p>The differences in childhood circumstances that have been described in the article would alone be sufficient to expect to find worse outcomes in late midlife among the females registered for involvement in crime (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111429783">Bäckman &amp; Nilsson, 2011</xref>). In addition, we have noted more extensive levels of drug abuse among females with a criminal record. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1557085111429783">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1557085111429783">7</xref> present the results from logistic regression analyses which examine how the risk for social exclusion is linked to involvement in crime and gender, given controls for both differences in drug abuse and in other circumstances during childhood and adolescence. The focus is thus directed at the interaction between sex and the different offender categories. The dependant variable is the summary measure of social exclusion. The tables show odds ratios using males with no registered involvement in crime as the reference category. To facilitate comparisons with the other groups, the tables also present confidence intervals for these odds ratios. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1557085111429783">Table 6</xref> shows that the groups who have been registered for crime as adults present a clear excess risk for social exclusion, even when controls are included for a range of circumstances experienced during childhood and adolescence, whereas the desisters do not differ significantly from the no-crime group. The table also shows that the only group of female offenders that differs from the corresponding group of males is the persisters. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1557085111429783">Table 7</xref>, we have also included a control for drug abuse. As expected, the level of excess risk then declines for both the late onset group and the persisters. The female persisters remain the group at most risk of social exclusion, but the difference in relation to the male persisters is no longer significant.</p>

<title>Concluding Discussion</title>
<p>Our main research question has centered on how life turned out for men and women with different forms of criminal involvement. Does it take more, in terms of childhood risk factors, and cost more, in terms of long-term negative consequences, to be a female offender? A finding common to both males and females is that those individuals who committed offences come from markedly worse childhood conditions. When we look at more direct indicators of social disadvantage during childhood (families marked by long-term poverty and social problems) rather than more indirect indicators (SES), we also see that the backgrounds of the female offenders are characterized by more serious problems than those of their male counterparts. In this sense, it “takes more” to become a female offender.</p>
<p>By contrast with what has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111429783">Tanner et al. (1999)</xref>, our results indicate that the situation for female offenders is particularly problematic and that drug use is of significance to this difference. Our results are therefore more in line with the conclusions drawn on the basis of the research conducted by the Ohio Longitudinal Study (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085111429783">Giordano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111429783">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111429783">Lanctot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111429783">Schroeder et al., 2007</xref>). When we look at the cohort members’ family situation and labor market attachment in late midlife, the differences between those who desisted from crime in their teenage years and those with no registered offending is quite small. For those who were registered for crime as adults, however, the situation is more problematic, and this is particularly so for the females. The literature has indicated that the stigma of being registered for crime is greater for females than for males, which for example can make it more difficult for female offenders to find conventional males to live with (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085111429783">De Li &amp; MacKenzie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111429783">Steffensmeier &amp; Allan, 1996</xref>). Our study confirms that female offenders appear to be worse off in this regard, at least in late midlife. Moreover, as adults the majority of the female persisters can be described as socially excluded; a large proportion is not in employment and are experiencing difficulties supporting themselves. Even though these things are also true of many of the men who persisted in offending into adulthood, it is important to note that in middle age, the majority of these men have some level of labor market attachment. Furthermore, a large proportion of these men are involved in stable family relationships. This is not the case for the corresponding group of females. Among the desisters and the late onset group, there is also a tendency for the situation as adults to be worse among the females. Thus it appears that involvement in crime exacts a higher cost for female offenders.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the situation of the female offenders is worse than that of the males is <italic>essentially</italic> associated with their more problematic backgrounds and their more extensive levels of drug abuse. When controls are included for differences in childhood conditions and drug abuse, female offenders do not differ from the corresponding male offender categories, which are to say that if we compare female offenders with male offenders presenting similar backgrounds and experiences of drug abuse, we see more similarities than differences between the two groups. In short, the same factors seem to produce the same long-term outcome for males and females. This is an important result because it suggests that it is the selection process that is most significant rather than the possibility that the negative consequences of involvement in crime are more pronounced for female offenders. To conclude, the existence of gendered pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111429783">Steffensmeier &amp; Allan, 1996</xref>) becomes apparent when we look at indicators of more direct and accumulated resource deficiencies and drug abuse. This fact also underscores the argument of, among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557085111429783">Farnworth, Thornberry, Krohn, and Lizotte (1994)</xref> that it is not sufficient to use broader categories such as SES as indicators of problematic living conditions. Moreover, even if both male and female drug users share the fate of social exclusion in midlife, we think that it is noteworthy that so many of the female offenders are registered as drug users. This is a finding in line with research that sees drug use as an important feature of both the causes and the outcome of persistent female criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111429783">Daly, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>) and at the same time a result life-course criminology has not paid enough attention to.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The individuals we have studied were born in Sweden in 1953 and thus lived as youths during the 1960s and 1970s. What can we learn today from their experiences? When generalizing on the basis of our findings, it is important to be aware of the fact that there are differences over time and between countries as regard the conditions that affect the prevalence of, for example, risk and protective factors, the social measures employed by a given society and also crime policy. However, we would argue that the specificity of the context of the Stockholm cohort is not a problem. To identify general processes that are not tied to a specific time or place, there is good reason to study the longer term consequences of childhood conditions, crime, and drug abuse for individuals from a society that differs from those which dominate this field of research (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557085111429783">Bersani, Laub, &amp; Nieuwbeerta 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085111429783">Savolainen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>By utilizing a longitudinal data set (the SBC), we have been able, primarily on the basis of various forms of register data, to follow a large number of males and females from childhood into adult life. This has made it possible to analyze questions that have previously been difficult to examine. Our study is limited, however, by problems which are already widely acknowledged. Our conclusions about gendered pathways and consequences relate only to those offences that are detected and registered by the criminal justice system. As has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111429783">Steffensmeier and Allan (1996)</xref> sex differences are smaller in studies based on self-report data, but these data also tend often to describe less serious forms of involvement in crime by comparison with the criminality that becomes the object of justice system interventions. Although we have been able to use indicators relating to a range of different childhood and living conditions, there remain important areas that we have not been able to examine, including for example the significance of childhood trauma and sexual abuse as precursors to offending and vulnerability to abuse from men. These have been identified as important factors in relation to the understanding of gendered pathways and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085111429783">Belknap &amp; Holsinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557085111429783">Cernkovich, Lanctot, &amp; Giordano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111429783">Daly, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111429783">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Questions that we are interested in examining in future studies focus on the within-group variation among those registered for involvement in crime: What differentiates the males and females for whom things turned out well from those for whom things went badly? What are the roles played by childhood conditions, events occurring later in life, and society’s responses to their criminality, and in what way does the significance of different live events vary between males and females?</p>
