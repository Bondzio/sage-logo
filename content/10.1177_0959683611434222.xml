<abstract>
<p>Supraglacial debris cover allows vegetation to colonize glacier surface, and whenever it is enough stable and thick, also shrubs and trees can germinate and grow. Supraglacial tree growth and distribution patterns on the glacier are closely connected with the debris-covered glacier dynamics and evolution. The aim of the research reported here was to evaluate the tree age and tree distribution patterns on the glacier tongue and the influence of ice-cliff backwasting, close to glacier terminus, on tree loss. We analysed the fragile and fast-changing environment that is present on the lower ablation sector of the Miage Glacier (Mont Blanc Massif, Italian Alps) where some ice cliffs are present and backwasting and downwasting phenomena occur. Tree features and short-term evolution were analysed with respect to glacier variations (mainly surface displacements and ice ablation) and geometry changes of the two most representative ice cliffs. The supraglacial trees’ life time resulted to be mainly controlled by glacier surface displacements and by the occurrence of backwasting and downwasting processes, whereas tree germination was associated with fine debris presence. These factors, controlling plants’ life and growth on the glacier, are an actual limit when supraglacial trees are analysed to reconstruct past environmental changes occurred on the glacier tongue. Moreover, we found that a large number of trees die under conditions of dominating backwasting inducing the loss of debris substrate (condition met especially on the northern glacier lobe). Instead, in the case of prevalence of downwasting (condition mainly observed on the southern glacier lobe), trees more easily survive and flow downvalley transported by the glacier flux.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Debris-covered glaciers (DCGs) are a common feature of different mountain chains of Asia, such as the Himalaya, the Karakoram and the Tien Shan ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611434222">Mayer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611434222">Moribayashi and Higuchi, 1977</xref>). They are also widespread in the Andes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959683611434222">Veblen et al., 1989</xref>), in Alaska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611434222">Benn and Evans, 2010</xref>) and in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611434222">Kirkbride, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611434222">2000</xref>). DCGs are also becoming important elements in the Alpine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611434222">D’Agata and Zanutta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434222">Deline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683611434222">Smiraglia et al., 2000</xref>): the transformation from debris-free glaciers into debris-covered glaciers changes the glacier classification with implication in glacier inventory production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683611434222">Paul et al., 2009</xref>) and influences the local geodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611434222">Panizza and Piacente, 2009</xref>) and the geomorphosite assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683611434222">Pelfini and Smiraglia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683611434222">Reynard 2009</xref>) especially for what regards their scientific attribute and ecological value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611434222">Garavaglia et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683611434222">Pelfini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683611434222">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The increasingly important role played by DCGs in the Alpine environment is largely due to the intensification of rock-degradation and macrogelivation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611434222">Barla et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611434222">Chiarle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611434222">Deline, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611434222">Evans and Clague, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611434222">Gruber and Haeberli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611434222">Haeberli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611434222">Huggel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683611434222">O’Connor and Costa, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683611434222">Ravanel and Deline, 2008</xref>). The debris covering of mountain glaciers is a function of the ratio between debris-producing rock walls and glacier surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611434222">Haeberli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959683611434222">Zemp et al., 2005</xref>): moreover, not only the warming-induced destabilization of surrounding rock walls plays an important role in driving glacier darkening but also the occurring glacier area reduction leads to a systematic increase in debris cover.</p>
<p>Rock falls and rock avalanches, mainly due to de-buttressing of adjacent rock walls by ice-surface lowering and permafrost degradation, are considered decisive factors that had driven the development of the supraglacial coverage in the largest Italian debris-covered glacier, the Miage Glacier, on the SW flanks of the Mont Blanc Massif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611434222">Brock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611434222">Deline, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434222">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611434222">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2008</xref>). The Miage Glacier developed the largest part of its debris cover during the last century. The debris has accumulated mostly between the glacier terminus (about 1750 m a.s.l.) and the upper ablation tongue (about 2400 m a.s.l.) on a surface area of about 4 km<sup>2</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434222">Deline, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Supraglacial debris cover is crucial in determining rates and magnitudes of buried ice ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611434222">Nakawo and Rana, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611434222">Nakawo and Takahashi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611434222">Nakawo and Young, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683611434222">Østrem, 1959</xref>) that is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2006</xref>) when the debris thickness is higher than a <italic>critical value</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611434222">Mattson and Gardner, 1989</xref>). On DCGs the larger ice losses resulting from surface ablation are mainly concentrated in the debris-free areas of the ablation zone and at the surfaces of ice cliffs and crevasses, vertical ice walls where debris coverage is thinner or absent, thus exposing bare ice to fast and rapid ablation. Supraglacial rock debris constitutes a special layer at the ice–atmosphere interface that may allow, in particular conditions, the colonization both of animals and plant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611434222">Caccianiga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683611434222">Pelfini and Gobbi, 2005</xref>) and, where the debris is enough thick and locally stable over time, also of trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611434222">Benn and Evans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some attention has been focused on vegetation growing on glacier medial moraines, and/or supraglacial debris islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611434222">Hulten, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683611434222">Negri, 1935</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683611434222">1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959683611434222">Valbusa, 1937</xref>), or on particular areas as debris cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611434222">Baroni et al., 2007</xref>). Publications related to trees and vegetation growing on DCGs include the Casa Pangue Glacier on the Monte Tronador in south-central Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959683611434222">Veblen et al., 1989</xref>), the several examples from Langtang Himalaya in central Nepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611434222">Miehe, 1990</xref>), as well as from Alaska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611434222">Benn and Evans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611434222">Birks, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683611434222">Post and Streveler, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683611434222">Stephens, 1969</xref>) (e.g. the Bering, Malaspina, Fairweather, Grand Plateau, and Martin-River Glaciers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611434222">Fickert et al., 2007</xref>). In the Alps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683611434222">Richter et al. (2004)</xref> reported of supraglacial tree vegetation on the Lang Glacier (Swiss Lötschental) and on the Miage Glacier (Mont Blanc Massif, Italy). On this latter glacier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al. (2007)</xref> analysed with further details the relations among supraglacial trees located on the lower ablation tongue and glacier flow pattern and variability.</p>
<p>In this paper we present the main results from dendrochronological and glaciological surveys performed to assess tree age and tree distribution patterns on the glacier tongue and to describe the influence of ice-cliff evolution close to glacier terminus on tree loss, thus assessing potential and limits of the use of supraglacial trees as recorders of glacier’s tongue movements over time. The glaciological investigations were performed to describe seasonal changes of two ice cliffs close to glacier terminus and their interactions with supraglacial trees. The investigations were performed in summer 2006 and 2007 to study (i) tree age and tree distribution patterns on the glacier’s tongue, with a special focus on the particular fragile and fast changing glacier areas where ice cliffs develop and backwasting and downwasting processes occur; (ii) the seasonal evolution of two sample ice cliff in relation to the supraglacial trees presence, (iii) the number of tree specimens that are potentially lost because of ice cliff backwasting, subsequently causing a loss of useful proxies for the reconstruction of the glacier-tongue dynamics.</p>

<title>The Miage Glacier: General features</title>
<p>The Miage Glacier (45°47′N, 6°52′E) is the largest debris-covered glacier in the Italian Alps (area 11 km<sup>2</sup>). The glacier drains the southwest slope of Mont Blanc in Valle d’Aosta (western Italian Alps) and shows continuous debris cover on the ablation tongue. The glacier snout terminates in two main lobes and a smaller intermediary one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434222">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The debris cover is predominantly colonized by vegetation on the lowermost part of the glacier, and by trees mainly of European larch (<italic>Larix decidua</italic> Mill.), and Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic> Karst). The rock debris has a thicknesses ranging from few centimetres (especially in the higher glacier sector) up to 1.5 m (close to the glacier terminus), mainly depending on the surface slope and the glacier flow magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2008</xref>). The Miage debris cover shows different grain sizes, from rock boulders to fine pebbles and sand and mainly consists of crystalline rocks: gneiss, micaschist and granite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611434222">Deline, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434222">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Ice cliffs are present along the largest portion of the ablation tongue and they are glacier portions with high ablation rates because of the thinner debris cover. Ice cliffs may derive from the evolution of crevasses (as is the case with most ice cliffs) or they may develop from bare ice exposure because of differential ablation on the terminal, lateral or frontal snout sectors. In the latter case the ice cliff evolution is mainly driven by backwasting and downwasting phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611434222">Benn and Evans, 2010</xref>). Ice ablation is stronger and faster at the surface of ice cliffs and in the crevassed areas located on the glacier tongue where ablation rate can be up to 14 cm/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Supraglacial tree growth on the Miage Glacier showed marked relations with the glacier-tongue surface dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>). The Miage trees have bent, deformed, twisted, bifurcated, stunted and bow-shaped stems caused by the substrate instability. Tree-ring analysis performed in previous studies revealed that ring width, stem eccentricity and compression wood production are induced by debris cover instability caused by glacier flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683611434222">Richter et al., 2004</xref>), differential ablation and by glacio-karst phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683611434222">Pelfini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of tree and tree-ring characteristics, contributes to reconstruct the glacier-tongue recent dynamics and to evaluate magnitude and rates of glacier movements in the lower part of the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>). However, such tree-ring based reconstructions are strongly limited by the presence of supraglacial trees and by tree age. Supraglacial trees move together with the debris cover and flow downvalley at the same surface velocity of the glacier until they reach the terminus where they die. When their growth starts in the upper sector of the tongue, they can record for long time in the tree rings the mechanical stress due to surface movements of the glacier.</p>
<p>Ice cliffs are glacier features particularly important in controlling (and in several cases stopping) tree growth. Ice cliffs are characterized by fast and rapid evolution due to their high melting rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2008</xref>) and to the occurrence of backwasting and downwasting processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683611434222">Smiraglia and Diolaiuti, 2011</xref>). In the case of backwasting, the ice cliff retreat intercepts trees near the scarp edge thus causing root exposure, tree tilting and then the plants’ death; in the case of downwasting the ice slope diminishes and in the meantime the debris fall progressively buries the exposed ice. In this latter case the ice cliff retreat is interrupted and trees continue to slide downvalley at the glacier surface. In the lower sector of the Miage Glacier, ice cliffs are well developed and more frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611434222">Figure 2</xref>), thus suggesting to study their short-term (i.e. seasonal) evolution.</p>

<title>Data collection and methods</title>
<p>For assessing tree age and tree distribution patterns and for monitoring the effect of ice-cliffs evolution on tree loss, we focused our attention on the Miage Glacier lobes. Here we carried out both the glaciological (2006) and the dendroglaciological (2006 and 2007) investigations. The glaciological field campaigns were devoted to describe the geometry changes affecting two large ice cliffs: the first one was located on the glacier northern lobe (named B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434222">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611434222">2</xref>) and the second one on the southern lobe (named A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611434222">Figure 1</xref>). At the same time the number of trees located at the ice cliff tops and their features were surveyed. On the southern glacier lobe the past evolution of a small ice cliff (A) has been evaluated by analysing and comparing aerial photos (1975–1976, 1991, 1997, 2003); moreover terrestrial photos (taken in 2004, 2006 and 2007) were also available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611434222">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Northern lobe (ice cliff B)</title>
<p>To evaluate the short-term evolution of the selected ice cliff, topographical surveys by a distance laser meter were carried out to reconstruct ice cliff geometry and morphology, to evaluate its surface areas and to calculate 3D models. Glaciological surveys were coupled with dendroglaciological campaigns to analyse contemporary evolution of the tree population colonizing the ice cliff top. A benchmark was located outside the glacier area and nearby ice cliff B; the benchmark position was acquired through DGPS (differential Global Positioning System) techniques and it was used as fixed reference point for performing the topographic surveys. Between July and August 2006 three topographic campaigns with distance laser meter were performed. The instrument was always located on the fixed reference point and each time at least 100 points (x, y, z obtained from slope distance (m), inclination (°) and orientation (°) measured by the laser instrument) spread on the whole ice cliff surface were acquired. We reported all the data in a local terrestrial references system with the origin of the axis in the benchmark location and the X axis oriented towards the Geographic North. The distance laser meter permitted to calculate point positions with a precision of 0.7 m for the planimetry data (x,y) and of at least 0.4 cm for elevation (z). These accuracy values, which represent the maximum errors potentially affecting our data, were obtained by studying the truncated Fourier series of the x, y, z coordinates as functions of the field data. As the ice cliff showed a complex morphology, the acquired data were processed and analysed both by considering the ice cliff as a unique ice wall and by dividing it into three main sectors (named West, Central-North facing and East).</p>
<p>To calculate the ice cliff shape and geometry a 3D analysis was applied to the entire ice cliff and to the three main sectors. This analysis was applied to the field data collected at each survey thus permitting to quantify the evolution of the ice cliff during summer 2006. A Delaunay triangulation of the data in the x-y plane and a triangle-based cubic interpolation of the z-data were applied. Then for evaluating the volume change, a TIN analysis was applied.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned 3D analysis we compared the position of some selected points of the ice cliff acquired in different surveys during the analysed summer season. Moreover, a further analysis for evaluating the magnitude of changes affecting the ice cliff top and foot were carried out. To evaluate these changes and their intensity the mean displacement of the top boundary was compared with the mean displacement of the ice cliff foot. This analysis was performed to further investigate backwasting processes, their occurrence and magnitude; moreover the rates of glacier area loss at the ice cliff top is crucial for the tree life and allow to estimate rates of tree loss resulting from backwasting.</p>
<p>In addition, the volume of ice lost at ice cliff B was evaluated also according to the method generally applied for calculating volume losses from calving glaciers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>). Then we considered not only the geometry changes occurred during each time frame but also the glacier surface velocity in the same time frame. In fact, similarly to an actual calving ice wall, the position of ice cliff B depends not only on ice losses due to melting and backwasting but also on glacier flow. Therefore, we considered the ice cliff B geometries obtained from the topographic surveys and the glacier flow magnitude and rates; these latter were evaluated by analysing recent and historic velocity data measured at the surface of the Miage Glacier. The recent data come from the DGPS (differential GPS) network installed on the Miage Glacier (for further details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">2006</xref>), the older ones are available from previous investigations performed in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434222">Lesca, 1974</xref>). More precisely, in summer 2006, the positions of some benchmarks located about 700 m far from the ice cliff and about 200 m higher were repeatedly acquired (benchmarks no. 89a, 90a, 91a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611434222">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434222">Table 1</xref>). To evaluate the reliability of the 2006 glacier velocity data we performed a comparison with data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434222">Lesca (1974)</xref> who developed a measurements network and carried out field campaigns to measure glacier velocity over a 5 yr period. For the comparison with 2006 data we selected some benchmarks surveyed in 1965 and 1970 placed where presently the ice cliff B is located (benchmarks no. 38.1, 38.2, 38.3, 39.1, 39.2, 40, 41, 42.1, 42.2 and 42.3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611434222">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434222">Table 1</xref>, data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434222">Lesca, 1974</xref>). We obtained a good agreement between previous velocity data and our measurements thus suggesting that the glacier flow in the lower sector of the tongue is quite stable. Then, the ice cliff B geometry data were adjusted according to glacier surface velocity thus allowing a more accurate calculation of the volume lost by ice cliff B. This second evaluation was performed by processing x,y,z data acquired at the beginning of the study period and adjusted according to the glacier surface velocity. The obtained Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was then compared with a second DEM calculated with the same software by processing the x,y,z data surveyed at the end of the monitoring period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>). In this way it is possible to evaluate the volume change occurred in a time frame without underestimations due to the glacier flow effect.</p>

<title>Dendroglaciological survey</title>
<p>In summer 2006 and 2007 dendroglaciological surveys were performed to describe presence, features and distribution of supraglacial trees on the Miage Glacier lobes with a particular attention to the zones where the ice cliffs A and B are located. Moreover data from previous dendroglaciological surveys on the Miage Glacier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>) were again considered for assessing the relations among tree presence and ice cliffs evolutions. During the summer 2006, 25 trees were sampled on the southern lobe, and 9 trees on the northern lobe, and they were dendrochronologically analysed to determine tree cambial age (i.e. the age at the sampling level). These data were used together with the data of 43 trees from the southern lobe and 11 from the northern lobe (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the tree distribution patterns on the two glacier lobes we performed a detailed inventory of all trees growing in 53 quadrats (20 quadrats on the northern lobe, 33 quadrats on the southern lobe, quadrat size: 15 m × 15 m). The quadrats were located on both lobes organized according North–South transects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434222">Figure 5</xref>). Tree age was estimated with dendrochronological analyses. In the case of very young larches their age was estimated in the field by counting layers of branches.</p>

<p>Data of tree height (and consequently also of tree age) were used to evaluate the relationships between tree distribution and supraglacial debris characteristics. The debris coverage was analyzed on the field during the tree surveys considering grain size and the relative abundance of fine debris in order to verify the influence of the debris characteristics on tree distribution patterns especially in correspondence of the analysed ice cliffs.</p>
<p>In summer 2006 all the glacier surface areas covered by trees were mapped by DGPS survey (fast kinematic techniques) and sorted according to four frequency classes (i.e. high, good, scarce colonization and no trees). All these data were used to describe tree distribution on the Miage Glacier tongue.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the potential tree loss close to the ice cliff B, in summer 2006 two representative quadrats were identified for deriving the tree distribution patterns dominating the area close to ice cliff (see quadrats labelled with circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434222">Figure 5</xref>) and the estimation was performed considering the glacier surface area loss. Moreover in summer 2007 we performed a further detailed counting of trees and saplings in an area 12 m wide, bordering the ice cliff B along an upper margin of about 180 m long.</p>

<title>Evolution of the ice cliff on the glacier southern lobe (ice cliff A)</title>
<p>At the southern ice cliff, downwasting processes were found to be dominant. Here the occurring ablation (up to 14 cm/day, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>) caused instability to the trees located near the upper ice boundary.</p>
<p>In summer 2004 the ice cliff was made by a unique exposed ice wall of about 90 m of length and less than 10 m high. In summer 2005 the debris accumulation caused the fragmentation of the ice cliff that was split in two separate ice walls: the first one was 17.50 m long and the second one was 70 m long. The ice cliff height was found varying between 0 and 9.90 m; the ice cliff was steep with a mean inclination of about 60°. In summer 2006 the ice cliff was not visible, it was completely covered by supraglacial debris and in this case the downwasting processes interrupted the retreat of the ice margin. Such ice cliff evolution caused the death of several trees that were involved in the debris collapse, and at the same time allowed other trees to continue their movement on the glacier surface (due to glacier flow) up to the glacier terminus. The fast cliff evolution is documented by the opening of a new ice cliff in 2007, in the frontal position of the southern lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611434222">Figure 3c</xref>).</p>

<p>The calculated values of ice cliff displacements showed that generally the top of the ice cliff retreated more rapidly with respect to the lower boundaries (these latter showed a retreat of about 0.5 m over a survey period 62 days long, from 4 July to 2 September 2006). Instead, the basal retreat resulted more evident because of thermal notching and ablation caused by the contact with the glacier meltstream: in this portion the basal retreat was of <italic>c</italic>. 8.8 m (14.6 cm/day). This means a 47% more intense retreat than on the top where the ice cliff boundary experienced a mean retreat of <italic>c</italic>. 6 m (10 cm/day).</p>
<p>As regards the West sector of the ice cliff, it was difficult to estimate here the basal retreat because of the abundant presence of debris which covered progressively the ice cliff bottom. Nevertheless our surveys identified also for this sector a faster retreat (+65%) affecting the upper boundaries (13.5 m equal to 22.5 cm/day) respect to the basal ones (8.2 m equal to 13.6 cm/day). Considering both Central (North facing) and West ice cliff sectors the mean retreat was found of about 8.2 m (equal to a mean daily value of 13.6 cm).</p>
<p>The results of ice cliff shape and geometry are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434222">Figure 6a</xref>, b and c. The volume change from TIN analysis over the analysed period was about −29,000 m<sup>3</sup> ± 10% (value without considering ice flow; see Methods). The ice flow magnitude was evaluated by analysing recent (collected in 2006) and historic velocity data measured at the surface of the Miage Glacier. All the data were highly correlated with altitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611434222">Table 1</xref>) and in particular we found that on the glacier lobes elevation (<italic>e</italic>) can be used as a proxy of the glacier annual velocity (<italic>v</italic>) (we found the following linear relation: <italic>v</italic> = 0.0634 * <italic>e</italic> −110.47 where <italic>v</italic> is measured in m/yr and <italic>e</italic> in m a.s.l.). Moreover the very regular pattern (diminishing with glacier elevation and with the decreasing slope featuring the snout areas) of all the measured velocity data (recent and historic ones), supports the extrapolation and application of the proposed empirical relation to estimate data for not-surveyed zones. Then, by applying the linear relation it was possible to calculate the ice flow magnitude at the ice cliff (located at about 1820 m a.s.l.) where compressing flow is occurring.</p>

<p>At the ice cliff top the surface velocity resulted to be equal to 4.9 m/yr; moreover since previous authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611434222">Lesca, 1974</xref>) stated that the surface velocity of the Miage Glacier is constant over the year without strong changes from summer to winter periods, we decided to divide the yearly value to obtain the daily ice cliff displacement (1.3 cm). The surface velocity in the time span July–September 2006 resulted equal to 0.81 m. This displacement was applied to the ice cliff geometry surveyed in July 2006 to calculate a DEM of the ‘expected ice cliff position’ in September 2006. This expected geometry was then compared with the one actually measured in September 2006 by distance laser meter. The difference between surveyed and expected geometries corresponds to the actual ice cliff volume change.</p>
<p>The result obtained from this second approach (both considering geometry changes and ice flow effect) was equal to a volume change of 31,600 m<sup>3</sup> ± 10%. This result is very similar to the one obtained simply considering the ice cliff geometry changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434222">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434222">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611434222">c</xref>, value: 29,000 m<sup>3</sup> ± 10%). In our case, the glacier flow in the studied area was very slow and it did not affect strongly the ice cliff position. Differently from actual calving cliffs (where the ice flow can vary from 10 to 15 cm/day; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611434222">Kirkbride and Warren, 1997</xref>) the one located on the northern lobe of the Miage Glacier is more influenced by daily ablation (up to 14 cm/day) than by ice flow (<italic>c</italic>. 1.3 cm/day).</p>
<p>Moreover, from our surveys it resulted that the upper part of the ice cliff B was mainly influenced by downwasting process; therefore we decided to calculate the volume loss firstly considering the whole ice cliff (thus including the portion subjected to debris covering due to downwasting) and second excluding the ice cliff portion subjected to downwasting. This latter approach was applied to better evaluate the weight of the two processes (backwasting and downwasting) on the ice cliff geometry changes and on supraglacial trees’ presence and distribution.</p>
<p>The volume loss was computed both for the ice cliff as a whole and for single ice cliff portions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683611434222">Table 3</xref>). The mean linear retreat of the ice cliff (calculated as the ratio between the volume loss and the ice wall surface area at the beginning of the surveys) resulted to be about 5.3 m in July, and <italic>c</italic>. 3.1 m in August. Considering the whole time frame July–September we found a mean retreat of <italic>c</italic>. 8.7 m.</p>

<title>Tree distribution (tree presence, pattern and age) on southern and northern glacier lobes</title>
<p>Tree distribution pattern revealed a higher number of trees in the quadrats of the northern lobe (a total of 154 larches &gt; 30 cm and 1024 larches &lt; 30 cm).</p>
<p>On the southern lobe the number of trees in the quadrats is lower (a total of 234 larches &gt; 30 cm and 291 larches &lt; 30 cm) but here the oldest and tallest trees are found. The oldest trees were characterized by an age typically ranging from 50 to 60 years, thus indicating that they started to colonize the glacier surface in the second half of the last century.</p>
<p>The trees close to the glacier front were mostly tilted down-valley and showed many scars, caused by the impact of the debris and blocks moved by the complex of glacier movements and differential ablation.</p>
<p>The oldest tree found was germinated some years before 1943, however it is also possible that older generations of trees have also germinated before on the Miage Glacier: in fact, the supraglacial debris cover was already present and well developed since 1880 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611434222">Deline, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>On the northern lobe tree vegetation resulted generally more concentrated along the southern side of the lobe where more complex structures made of grass, shrubs and trees were present. Trees lower than 30 cm resulted generally younger than 15 years but with a great age variability because of the ecological conditions imposed by the glacier environment. We found that on the northern lobe at the glacier snout area, saplings or young trees were prevailing and no old trees were growing along the ice cliff. Instead, in the inner portions of the northern lobe and in correspondence to its southern margin tree density was higher (and up to 500 specimens in a quadrat; see asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434222">Figure 5</xref>) and also specimens more than 2 m high were found together with young trees (&lt;10 yr).</p>
<p>The 154 larches higher than 30 cm were mostly concentrated close to the inner margins, near the lateral moraine. About 87% of the counted trees was less than 30 cm tall and more concentrated where fine debris is abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611434222">Figure 7</xref>). This relationship is not evident anymore when considering the trees higher than 30 cm.</p>

<title>Relations among ice cliff dynamics and tree presence, tree distribution and lifetime</title>
<p>By coupling data from glaciological and dendroglaciological surveys we could evaluate the effect of ice cliff evolution on tree dynamics (i.e. presence, distribution and lifetime). At the southern ice cliff, downwasting processes were found to be dominant thus causing the ice cliff burial. After the ice cliff burial only in a restricted number of cases the debris fall involved trees and determined their death. Differently, at the northern ice cliff backwasting processes resulted to be prevalent. Here, in the area close to the ice cliff we found trees only in proximity of the western and central ice cliff sectors. Instead trees were absent nearby the eastern ice cliff sector.</p>
<p>For a first estimation of the total number of trees lost in a year because of the northern ice cliff retreat, we considered the number of trees counted in two representative quadrats (see quadrats labelled with circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434222">Figure 5</xref>): here we found a mean value of about 8 trees/100 m<sup>2</sup> (including saplings). Since the Western and Central ice cliff sectors (about 100 m long) experienced a mean retreat of about 9 m (thus resulting in a surface area loss of about 900 m<sup>2</sup>), the estimated tree loss was evaluated of about 72 trees over two summer months (62 days of survey during summer 2006). Extending such estimation to a time frame of 4 months, (considering that on the Miage Glacier lobes the ablation season covers more than 2 months because of the low elevations characterizing these areas; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611434222">Masetti et al., 2010</xref> who reported the diagram of the annual temperature estimated for an elevation of 2020 m a.s.l. at the Miage site), with an area loss of about 2000 m<sup>2</sup>, we could calculate a corresponding loss of 164 trees including saplings.</p>
<p>The detailed tree and saplings counting performed in the 12 m wide buffer along the Western and Central sectors (a buffer almost corresponding to the mean retreat of the ice cliff found for the summer of 2006) revealed the presence of 108 trees that would be potentially impacted by the ice cliff retreat at the end of the season.</p>
<p>The estimation of the potential number of seasonal tree loss for a glacier surface area loss of 2000 m<sup>2</sup> caused by an hypothetical ice cliff retreat, was extended to lobes’ borders by considering the mean tree density in the quadrats bordering the northern and southern sides of the two lobes. We found that (excluding the southern side of the northern lobe) ice cliffs of similar size of the one studied in the northern lobe could cause a seasonal loss of about 159±40 trees at Miage Glacier (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0959683611434222">Table 4</xref>). An ice cliff opening at the southern side of the northern lobe and causing a seasonal glacier surface area loss of 2000 m<sup>2</sup> would impact a much higher number of trees (from 671 up to 1782 per season), given the higher tree density in this portion of the glacier and the presence of the quadrat 51 with its 500 specimens per 225 m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611434222">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Results coming from the dendrochronological and glaciological analyses allowed to evaluate supraglacial tree distribution pattern and density on the glacier tongue. Moreover, we found that the potential use of supraglacial trees at the Miage Glacier as recorders of tongue movements may be limited by the glacier flow, by the supraglacial morphology evolution and by the ice cliffs retreats. Supraglacial trees have recently been recognized to be an important source of dendroglaciological data for reconstructing glacier dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683611434222">Pelfini et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, tree lifetime is limited by glacier flow and in particular by ice cliff occurrence. The evolution of the Miage Glacier lower tongue is rapid where supraglacial debris cover is thinner than the critical thickness (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611434222">Mattson and Gardner, 1989</xref>) or absent as the case of glacier ice cliffs. Here we found the strongest ablation rates affecting tree life and growth, determining tree death and the interruption of their activity as ‘recorders’ of glacier tongue evolution. Our results also show that the substrate grain size is likely a key factor for plant germination since we found a higher density of trees smaller than 30 cm on fine debris areas. The high number of very young plants especially in the southern side of the northern lobe suggests an increasing colonization rate in recent times because of not yet identified causes.</p>
<p>Tree lifetime is limited by glacier short-term variations and in particular by ice cliff occurrence, especially when the ice cliffs are affected by backwasting processes. The tree loss estimation of about 160 trees per season because of an ice cliff retread causing a surface area loss of 2000 m<sup>2</sup> is representative of the mean conditions of Miage Glacier and represent a significant information loss from the dendroglaciological point of view. Given the higher densities met close to the southern side of the northern lobe, the potential impact of a glacier surface area loss of 2000 m<sup>2</sup> due to an ice cliff retreat would cause even higher tree loss, ranging from about 670 up to 1780 trees per season in this glacier portion.</p>
<p>As regards the glacier evolution, the volume of ice lost by ice cliff seasonal evolution (when backwasting processes are dominant) was equal to about 30,000 m<sup>3</sup> (mean value considering the volume losses calculate with both the methods). Previous authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611434222">Diolaiuti et al., 2006</xref>) had evaluated the summer loss due to ablation at the Miage Glacier surface equal to about 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. Therefore, the contribution of the studied ice cliff to the whole glacier ice loss is about 0.5%. This value is surely small, nevertheless such ablation was caused by a vertical surface area of only 3500 m<sup>2</sup> and it occurred in a very short period (62 days with ablation rates up to 14 cm/day). Differently, in the other zones of the Miage Glacier lobes, the ablation is lower (1–2 cm/day) due to the abundant debris cover that is largely thicker than the critical value, thus reducing magnitude and rates of buried ice ablation and favouring the colonization of the glacier surface by trees and herbaceous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611434222">Caccianiga et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if we did not find trees older than 60–70 years, we can not exclude the possible presence of older trees on the glacier or the presence of dead wood and rests. Nevertheless the evolution characterizing the glacier snout and in particular the presence of ice cliffs limits the tree lifetime and contributes also to the loss of dead wood and rests of ancient trees. We need also to consider that ice cliffs are abundant and fast changing at the Miage Glacier lobes (as on all the lower sector of debris covered glaciers) and they drive the highest ablation. Ice cliffs therefore could potentially impact a large number of supraglacial trees, especially if they open in high-density areas like the southern side of the northern lobe. Nowadays, however, the major ice cliffs are located on the upper glacier sectors, where they cause not negligible ice ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611434222">Mihalcea et al., 2008</xref>) but where vegetation is sparse and rare.</p>
<p>The study carried out on two ice cliffs located on the Miage Glacier lobes shows the importance of both downwasting and backwasting processes on ice cliffs evolution and consequently on supraglacial tree life. The presence of younger trees mainly in the upper portions of the lobes is probably due to the strong instability of the substratum. Supraglacial morphologies could also drive and delimit areas with different tree density beside the dominant influence of surface glacier velocity and debris thickness. On the southern ice cliff we found downwasting to be prevalent. Here, the debris fall from the ice cliff top accumulates at the ice cliff foot thus temporally causing the ice cliff burial. In this case the ice cliff slope was diminishing and trees could continue to slide downvalley. Only in a restricted number of cases the debris falling involved trees thus determining their death.</p>
<p>Concluding, where downwasting dominates, the ice cliff disappears and trees continue to be transported downvalley until they reach the glacier terminus where they fall, or until new backwasting processes occur along the glacier margin or at holes and crevasses. Differently, the evolution of the northern ice cliff showed the dominance of backwasting processes thus affecting more tree loss.</p>
<p>The distribution of active ice cliffs has influenced the choice of the areas to be investigated, however this research shows the importance of performing integrated studies by coupling biological and geographical-glaciological surveys for a more complete and exhaustive understanding of the glacier environmental evolution.</p>
<p>The ice cliffs pattern described at the Miage Glacier is not unique since it represents the areas where the main ice losses occur and characterizes also other DCGs. As regards trees evolution and their relation with glacier flow and surface processes, the Miage Glacier is an exceptional case in the European Alps. Since the ongoing warming phase will likely increase in the next years the tree presence at the debris-covered surface makes the Miage Glacier a representative site also for the complex relations among glacier changes and plant life.</p>
