<p>Music teachers often include in their lessons activities that promote music literacy, such as manipulation of icons to show high versus low or long versus short, learning note names both melodically and rhythmically, and improvising on pitched and nonpitched instruments. Additionally, our National Standards for music education address literacy specifically with Standard 4 (creating and improvising) and Standard 5 (reading and notating).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112456967">1</xref></sup> While it is good to have these activities and standards to start with, we are always looking for new ways to help students achieve the goal of music literacy.</p>
<p>If we look to our colleagues in general music education and consider theories of instruction, it is important for students to experience new skills and concepts in a variety of activities and in a way that builds on what they already know.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112456967">2</xref></sup> The Kodály Method of music teaching incorporates the sequence of preparation, presentation, and practice in an age-appropriate and developmentally sound manner; allows students to build on previously learned skills and concepts; and results in music literacy. Of course, for most music educators, the ultimate literacy goal is being able to read the symbols of music notation, but literacy can also be achieved with iconic notation. The definition of literacy includes the ability to read and write and having knowledge in a particular subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112456967">3</xref></sup> Using this definition, a kindergartener can achieve literacy with iconic notation that is developmentally appropriate. Acquiring music literacy, therefore, is <italic>not</italic> a goal that should be started and achieved only when students have reached their late elementary years; rather, it can and should be incorporated as early as kindergarten and continue throughout their formal school training.</p>

<title>The Kodály Method</title>
<p>Hungarian philosopher, educator, ethnomusicologist, and composer Zoltan Kodály believed that children have the right to a musical education. After recognizing the need for change in the music education of Hungarian children, Kodály made it his lifelong mission to provide all children with the best musical experiences possible that incorporated the music from the children’s “mother tongue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112456967">4</xref></sup> His concept of teaching music to children in a sequential manner including the three Ps—preparation, presentation, and practice—is a key component of the Kodály Method. Musical skills and concepts that are appropriate for a particular age or grade level are taught using this sequence. For example, the introduction of <italic>re</italic> in a <italic>mi–re–do</italic> pattern is a melodic concept appropriate for second grade. This pattern can be found in many of the songs used in this grade and is preceded by the presentation of the <italic>sol–mi–do</italic> pattern in the Kodály sequence of melodic skills and concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112456967">5</xref></sup> A list of songs with the <italic>mi–re–do</italic> pattern is found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432112456967">Figure 1</xref>. Although this list contains selections from the American folk genre, it is by no means a complete list of second-grade songs. Regardless of the genre, songs chosen to teach this pattern should contain the concept in isolated places and be easy for students to recognize and identify.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the preparation stage of learning <italic>re</italic>, students experience the concept in a variety of ways. This begins with singing and playing games and progresses to body signs (specific points on the body that represent <italic>sol-fa</italic> syllables), singing with known <italic>sol-fa</italic> syllables, and playing instruments. These visual, aural, and kinesthetic activities occur over several class meetings. An example of these activities and procedures can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0027432112456967">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0027432112456967">3</xref>, which are not meant to represent a full music lesson but rather a portion of one. Keep in mind that students are also practicing other known concepts labeled in previous grades as well as earlier in the second-grade year.</p>

<p>Throughout the preparation stage, the teacher asks the students questions to check them for readiness. An example of this might be to ask students if the mystery note is higher or lower than <italic>mi</italic>. Preparation activities continue, and other questions are asked: Where does the mystery note occur in our song “Frog in the Meadow”? and Where does it occur on our <italic>sol-fa</italic> ladder? Once 80 percent of the group demonstrates an understanding of <italic>re</italic> by singing, playing, showing, or verbalizing, the concept can be made conscious or presented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0027432112456967">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the presentation stage, the new concept is labeled (made conscious to students) with the correct name. The teacher demonstrates the corresponding Curwen hand sign, and the students place the note on the <italic>sol-fa</italic> ladder and staff. When presenting the new concept, be sure to choose a song in which there are rhythms and melodic elements that the students already know. The new element or concept should occur at an easily recognizable point in the song. For example, the song “Here Comes a Bluebird” has the <italic>m–r–d</italic> pattern at the end of each phrase on the words “Hey, diddledum a day” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0027432112456967">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456967-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Practice of the new concept occurs immediately after presentation by speaking, singing, playing, moving, reading, and writing. These activities are done with known songs first, and then with new or unknown songs and melodies. Once students have demonstrated their understanding of <italic>re</italic>, within an <italic>m–r–d</italic> pattern, in known and unknown songs, they are ready to work on inner hearing and part-work. Composing and improvising with the <italic>m–r–d</italic> pattern can occur after students have been successful with the activities mentioned previously (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0027432112456967">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>It is important to note that the practice stage is ongoing. Once a new concept is labeled, it is continually practiced in subsequent lessons even as a new concept or skill is being prepared. The stages of preparation and practice are continuous whereas the presentation stage is not. This stage only occurs when 80 percent of students can demonstrate their understanding and after students have been adequately prepared.</p>

<title>Engage All Students</title>
<p>The idea of presenting musical skills and concepts in a manner that progresses from simple to complex, known to unknown, and are age and developmentally appropriate aligns with that of well-known theorists Jerome Bruner and Robert Gagné in general education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112456967">6</xref></sup> As music educators, we are constantly taking age and developmental stages into consideration when planning lessons. In addition, we are always seeking new ways to engage all students in the music-making process. The process includes opportunities for performing, creating, describing, and activities for all learning styles. Using strategies and activities from the Kodály Method of teaching, all students will be engaged in making music and be able to achieve a level of musical literacy that is age and developmentally appropriate.</p>
