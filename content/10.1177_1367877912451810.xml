<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on the long history of mural painting in Northern Ireland and specifically on the changing relationship between mural painting and the state in various eras. Originally unionist murals were state-friendly, painted as part of the annual celebration of King William’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Later, murals were seen as beyond the pale, each for their own reasons; republican murals supported the armed struggle of the IRA against the state, while loyalist murals glorified the campaign of the loyalist paramilitary groups to terrorise the nationalist population. As the peace process took hold in Northern Ireland, republicans began to transform their own images; loyalists found this task more problematic, leading the state to intervene to fund the re-imaging of murals, thereby seeking to remove all offensive and military iconography. The article ends by critically assessing the outcome of the state’s Re-imaging Communities Programme.</p>

<title>Mural painting as civic duty</title>
<p>In July 1933, William Conor, a well-established painter in Belfast, wrote to a local newspaper.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While walking through the streets of our city during the week-end I was amazed at the amount of high artistic merit displayed on many of the mural decorations painted on various gables, representing King William of Orange crossing the Boyne, the Siege of Derry and other important incidents of this historic period.… It is very creditable what these obscure humble painters have accomplished under great difficulties.… I am fully aware that many of these paintings possess all the inevitable crudities of the amateur, and are gaudy in colour, smudged and, on the whole messy.… Wrongly some people who dominate the intellectual life in Belfast frown on these paintings, but a great deal of this narrow-mindedness or indifference might be brushed aside if more sympathetic curiosity were aroused as to what these unknown and obscure painters are trying to do in our midst, and the manner in which they have given themselves with enthusiasm to this embellishment of our city streets. (<italic>Belfast Telegraph</italic>, 10 July 1933)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877912451810">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conor’s liberal approach to these amateur muralists and their paintings is noteworthy. He saves his criticism for those in the art establishment who ‘frown’ on the murals. The generosity of spirit which he displays could perhaps be put down to his origins. He was not himself working class, but growing up he could not have missed seeing the working-class streets of unionist North Belfast at close hand, not least when they were festooned with murals coming up to the Twelfth of July celebrations, the annual celebration of King Billy’s victory over King James at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. His sympathy towards Belfast’s working class, and especially its unionist working class, is apparent in his representations of shipyard workers, children playing street games and women in shawls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912451810">Anglesea, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367877912451810">Wilson, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, for all that his view runs counter to that of the more refined upper echelons of ‘intellectual life’ in Belfast, it was not an anti-establishment view precisely because the murals themselves were not anti-establishment. The Northern Ireland state, dominated by the Unionist Party, had been created two decades earlier. Even before that point, each July working-class unionists had painted murals, just as they had painted kerbstones, erected bunting and dressed in their finery to march to ‘the Field’ to hear speeches condemning republicanism, nationalism and Catholicism. These practices had become embedded in unionist culture with the coalescence of forces in the north which occurred at the end of the 19th century in the face of proposed Home Rule for Ireland. Unionists were prepared to take up arms against the British state in order to stay British. But by the time the unionist state had been bedded down, these politico-cultural practices became in effect part of the civic duty of unionist citizens. Forgetting all differences of class, the unionist bourgeoisie and working class marched side by side in the Orange lodges on the Twelfth of July. It was the unionist working class, rather than the bourgeoisie, which painted the murals and in doing so displayed their identification with the unionist state.</p>
<p>Unionist murals, even if not directly commissioned or funded by the state, were pro-state murals. Thus Conor was taking no political risks in praising the murals of his day. Nor did he criticise the content of the murals; there is not the slightest hint of the nationalist critique of the marches as triumphalist festivities by an organisation exclusively reserved for Protestants whose origin is ultimately in the celebration of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland and the suppression of Catholic natives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367877912451810">
<title>Murals and violent political conflict</title>
<p>Conor died in 1968, just as Civil Rights Movement marchers took to the streets demanding equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877912451810">Purdie, 1990</xref>). The state’s repressive reaction to their demands set the stage for the re-emergence of violent political conflict. One outcome of that conflict was eventually the revival and transformation of mural painting. No artist in the North of the stature of Conor was to praise murals from that point on. Instead, art commentators, who may merely have frowned on murals in Conor’s day, now rejected them out of hand. For example, writing in 1990 the respected art critic Brian McAvera was able to produce an entire book on the subject of art, politics and Ireland, without considering murals:<disp-quote>
<p>this is not a book about Northern Irish wall murals, nor is it about party political posters … people who work in these areas in the north – unlike, say, their counterparts in the Weimar Republic – are not artists; they do not produce Fine Art. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877912451810">McAvera, 1990</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this view, for an artist to take politics as subject matter was to stray into the field of propaganda and, worse, to be seen to be siding with one or other of the armed groups which were ripping the society apart.</p>
<p>This view permeated the art establishment, that is, the set of institutions which existed to promote, display and educate about art – in particular, the Arts Council, the Ulster Museum, and the Arts College. Dependent on state funding in a one-party and politically divided state, their approach was both politically and artistically conservative. In Belfast’s Art College, students were tutored in ‘apeing internationally validated style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877912451810">McLennan, 1985</xref>: 21), which meant that ‘the problems of Belfast and the troubles of Northern Ireland stayed well outside the walls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877912451810">Adare, 1986</xref>: 36). Adare, a former student at the Art College, caught the mood of self-censorship well: ‘A sure way to get nowhere was to try to incorporate some of what was happening in one’s life outside into the work you were doing/wanted to do inside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877912451810">1986</xref>: 36).</p>
<p>The same mood permeated the more established art scene outside. ‘Reflection of Ulster’s political disorders in the visual arts has been surprisingly sparse. Many artists went on painting Donegal and Antrim landscapes as if there were no Troubles at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877912451810">Anglesea, 2001</xref>: 104–5). Those few artists who did take on the conflict as a theme tended to paint contortions and distortions of the human body – ‘self-conscious grotesquery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912451810">Long, 2010</xref>: 15). Employing a harsh expressionist form, these artists passed acerbic comment on the political violence around them. Even then, they were marginalised. As painter Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912451810">McWilliams (1982)</xref> noted, the arts establishment kept them at arm’s length, failing, for example, to mount an exhibition to examine their collective response to the Troubles. It took until the end of the first decade of the new millennium before the Arts Council belatedly recognised their contribution by gathering some of their work together in a ‘Troubles Archive’.</p>
<p>The art establishment refused to acknowledge that the muralists were artists. For example, although both the Art College and the Ulster Museum had a few photographs on file of murals, there was no serious attempt by these institutions to archive this ephemeral art form. For their part, the muralists were happy to agree that they were not ‘artists’, albeit for entirely different reasons. As the most prolific of the republican muralists, Danny Devenny, put it: ‘The word “artist” has disgusted me for a long time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877912451810">Cook, 2000</xref>). His comments have to be seen in context; as he said on another occasion: ‘Of course it’s art. We fit all the criteria of what art should be: we deal with people’s emotions, we make people think, we get a reaction to what we do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912451810">Lisle, 2006</xref>: 30). If art meant at best detachment and at worst culpable denial of the reasons for conflict, then muralists like Devenny did not want to be called artists. Instead they saw themselves as political activists who used a paint brush, just as others marched, picketed, wrote pamphlets or carried weapons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877912451810">Conway, 2010</xref>). Republicans had broken out of the cultural ghetto imposed by unionism and, in tandem with their military campaign, painted murals, first in support of the hunger-striking prisoners in 1981 and thereafter on a range of other themes – Irish history and mythology, current political grievances and demands, and solidarity with political struggles elsewhere.</p>
<p>Unionist murals meanwhile had given way to more narrowly loyalist murals; instead of claiming to speak for the whole working-class community, they became advertisements for only one section of that community. Whichever paramilitary group was dominant in a unionist working-class area boasted its prowess on the walls through endless repetition of depictions of hooded men with guns. These paramilitary groups saw themselves as an extension of state military forces, helping those forces which were supposedly required, because of the niceties of the law, to take on terrorism with one hand tied behind their back. They mimicked the British army in their structures of battalions and companies. And they borrowed liberally from British military iconography and slogans when it came to representing themselves and their purpose. From its early days the UDA (Ulster Defence Association) appropriated the motto of the British SAS: ‘Who dares wins’. The UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) on occasions in their murals used lines from a poem by James Elroy Flecker, ‘Hassan’ (1922): ‘We are the Pilgrims, Master,/ we shall go always a little further …’. These lines are inscribed on the regimental memorial of the SAS in Credenhill, Herefordshire.</p>
<p>Despite their self-proclaimed protestations of continuity, the links between the loyalist paramilitary groups and the British security forces were less than they fantasised. Admittedly, loyalists were used by British intelligence in a dirty war against republicans and nationalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912451810">Rolston, 2005</xref>), but the British state did not share the loyalist paramilitary groups’ view of themselves as simply an extension of the British army. Consequently, while in the loyalist mind their murals were an expression of civic responsibility, that view was not shared by the state.</p>
<p>The state’s opposition to murals was not even-handed, however. In line with the view that the main political threat emanated from republicans, the forces of the state were more likely to destroy republican murals. They drove by at night and ‘paint-bombed’ them, throwing bottles or plastic bags of paint which exploded across the carefully painted images of IRA (Irish Republican Army) operatives and republican heroes. And it was a republican, 16-year-old Michael McCartan, rather than a loyalist who was shot dead as he painted a republican slogan on a wall in Belfast in 1980. The policeman charged over his death claimed in his defence that he believed the paint brush carried by McCartan was a gun. He was acquitted.</p>
<p>Those were not the days, nor this the atmosphere in which mural painting could be judged by an artist of the calibre of Conor to be a valuable contribution to society. Murals were now intimately implicated in the war, mobilising local support, reaffirming beleaguered ideologies and railing against the state and its forces, in the case of republican murals, and against nationalists and republicans, in the case of loyalist murals. Murals were now seen as firmly beyond the pale of respectability as were the organisations which sponsored them and indeed the communities in which they appeared.</p>

<title>Post-ceasefire mural painting</title>
<p>In 2009 the Arts Council of Northern Ireland launched its Troubles Archive, a digital resource produced ‘in recognition of the contribution that the arts make to our understanding of the Troubles, and of the impact that the conflict has had upon the arts in Northern Ireland’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877912451810">2</xref></sup> The intention is to include works by poets, film makers, singers and of course fine artists, including those who, as was noted earlier, were marginalised by the art establishment while the conflict raged.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Arts Council has been the lead player in a programme of ‘re-imaging’, ‘a pilot programme that places artists in the heart of communities to work with local people to tackle visible signs of sectarianism and racism to create a more welcoming environment for everyone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877912451810">3</xref></sup> It would be tempting to read this as an extension of the art establishment’s new-found focus on valuable cultural forms which came out of the conflict, allowing the value of murals finally to be recognised. However, such expectations should be quickly put to rest. For example, as a first step in its Troubles Archive, the Arts Council published 12 booklets, each containing an essay on some aspect of art and the conflict – music, poetry, etc. Only one of these essays mentions murals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877912451810">Gray, 2010</xref>: 20). The essay on fine art has only one oblique reference to the conceptual terrain in which mural painting occurred; noting that the fine artists who did seek to represent the conflict in their art tended to be ‘tantalizingly indirect’, the author repeats a familiar refrain: ‘Indirectness, of course, is not indifference. And a refusal to promote one or other of the North’s rival propagandas … was not (as advocates of a more unambiguous political art alleged) a refusal to respond’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912451810">Long, 2010</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>To understand how the same arts organisation could at one and the same time (belatedly) acknowledge the contribution of formerly marginalised painters while failing to give any credence to the contribution of the even more fundamentally marginalised mural painters it is necessary to look at the sustained moves to change the content of the murals.</p>
<p>Many political commentators through the years had expressed their opposition to murals. Opposition increased with the peace process after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This was directed most pointedly at loyalist murals. Murals had constantly undergone a process of replacement throughout the conflict as new issues emerged which needed to be articulated or new developments which needed to be challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877912451810">McCormick and Jarman, 2005</xref>). Certain strategic walls, which were highly visible to large amounts of people, frequently had their murals destroyed by the very artists who painted them in order to make way for a new mural. This was most noticeable on the republican side.</p>
<p>Moreover, a major shift occurred in republican mural painting after the Good Friday Agreement; on their own initiative and without any state funding republicans removed the guns and masked men from their murals. From that point, the only guns to be found in republican murals were in memorials to dead comrades or in murals on historical themes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367877912451810">Figure 1</xref>). The situation in loyalist mural painting was different. Although loyalist murals also changed occasionally, from 1986 on there were relatively few loyalist murals which did not depict armed and masked men. After the loyalist ceasefire in October 1994 the iconography became more belligerent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912451810">Jarman, 1996</xref>). As the peace process lumbered on there were few signs of change in that respect. The loyalist groups came under criticism from without that the occurrence of such bellicose murals during a peace process was contradictory. There was also an internal debate within the loyalist groups about transformation, but for a number of years progress was slow and ponderous; there was no sudden removal of guns from loyalist murals. This lack of progress spoke volumes regarding loyalist ambivalence about the peace process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877912451810">McAuley, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877912451810">2004</xref>). Where republicans tended to see change as opportunity, loyalists tended to see it as threat, and consequently held on tightly to both sets of weaponry.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1367877912451810" position="float">

</fig>
<p>One of the problems facing loyalist muralists was the lack of choice of alternative topics to paint. For republicans there had been for 20 years a range of themes; this meant that removing the guns was less drastic as there were still other themes that could be represented. For a while loyalists looked to local heroes – most notably George Best – and to sporting achievements, especially soccer victories. There was nothing particularly loyalist about the message of such murals. The only exception to that rule was the UVF’s increasing use of images deriving from the First World War. Seeing themselves as directly descended from the original UVF, which had formed the core of the British army’s 36th Ulster Division, decimated at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, the UVF could employ these references in a way that the UDA could not.</p>
<p>Elsewhere others were working strategically to encourage loyalists to remove their more offensive murals. In East Belfast, Reverend Gary Mason negotiated with local leaders of the UVF and RHC (Red Hand Commando) for each group to remove a number of murals and replace them with non-aggressive imagery. The UDA was to have been involved also, but dropped out. Instead of hooded gunmen, local East Belfast heroes such as George Best and C.S. Lewis graced the walls. Mason was clear in his goal: ‘Now there’s peace, why should we have war on our walls? We’ve taken the gun out of politics; now we need to take it out of the murals’ (<italic>Christian Science Monitor</italic>, 14 December 2005). Despite that, Paul Hoey, a loyalist with whom he worked closely to negotiate the transformation, sounded a note of caution; as regards the paramilitary murals, he stated: ‘They won’t all come down, that is a nailed on certainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912451810">BBC News, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2007 the replacement of loyalist murals went on at a regular if unspectacular pace. Some of the finance for this mural transformation was provided by the local paramilitary groups and communities themselves. On other occasions there were vibrant organisations involved in replacing murals, including the West Belfast Athletic and Cultural Society and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912451810">East Belfast Historical and Cultural Society (2006)</xref>, which sponsored the painting of 15 murals side by side, each presenting an aspect of unionist history and culture. Such groups usually received some funding from other sources, for example, local businesses, political parties and marching bands, and the Ulster Society. The Ulster-Scots Agency, a publicly funded organisation, paid for murals on emigration and famous Americans of Ulster descent. But the biggest influence on transformation was the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) through its Community Cohesion Unit.</p>
<p>The <italic>Programme for Government</italic> which was agreed by the first power-sharing Executive set up as a result of the Good Friday Agreement voiced the ambition that Northern Ireland should become: ‘A peaceful, inclusive, prosperous, stable and fair society firmly founded on the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust, with the protection and vindication of human rights for all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877912451810">Northern Ireland Executive, 2000</xref>: 9). This led eventually to a strategy entitled <italic>A Shared Future …</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877912451810">OFMDM, 2005</xref>). Delivering on that strategy then became an issue for government and public bodies and other organisations throughout Northern Ireland. The response of the NIHE was to establish a Community Cohesion Unit (CCU) in 2004.</p>
<p>The Unit became involved with community groups on five interrelated issues: flags, emblems and sectional symbols; segregation/integration; race relations; communities in transition; and interface areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877912451810">4</xref></sup> It worked with local groups to remove contentious flags and murals. Although there had been initiatives in this regard beforehand, the arrival of the CCU meant formalisation and coordination.</p>
<p>At the same time Belfast City Council became involved in mural transformation through its Greater Belfast Mural Project, part of the ‘Brighter Belfast’ programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912451810">Belfast City Council, 2006</xref>: 19). Eventually the CCU and Belfast City Council joined forces and established a permanent team to negotiate mural replacement. They had a number of successes, including the beginning of the transformation of UVF murals in the Village area of South Belfast.</p>
<p>Finally, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland also became involved in mural replacement through its ‘Private Mural Project’. Working closely with a local arts organisation, New Belfast Community Arts Initiative, they painted 15 murals across Belfast in 2004. The obvious next step was to move to a higher level of coordination, and that occurred with the announcement of the Re-imaging Communities Programme in April 2006.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367877912451810">
<title>Re-imaging</title>
<p>The re-imaging programme emerged in two stages. In April 2007, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland announced a £3.3 million fund called ‘Place, Identity and Art’ which limited funding to groups ‘based in a Protestant working-class community’ or ‘working in partnership with a Protestant working-class community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877912451810">Thornton, 2006</xref>). The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) accused the Arts Council of openly breaking the law by excluding Catholic areas. The Arts Council withdrew the scheme, and three months later it was re-launched with the same amount of money, this time called the Re-imaging Communities Programme. The SDLP was still not happy. The scheme ‘beggars belief’, they said. ‘People shouldn’t have to be paid to take down paramilitary murals. They should be told to do it’ (<italic>Irish Times</italic>, 11 August 2006). This conclusion ignores the difficulties involved in removing murals against the will of the communities and paramilitary groups concerned, as Social Development Minister Nigel Dodds noted:<disp-quote>
<p>My officials are assiduous in trying to deal with this problem but the issue does come down in many cases in terms of workers who feel that their lives may be in danger and are subject to threats and intimidation. (<italic>News Letter</italic>, 2 July 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The official announcement of the programme stated that the ‘purpose of the Re-imaging Communities Programme will be to engage local people and their communities in finding ways of replacing divisive murals and emblems with more positive imagery’ (<italic>News Letter</italic>, 11 July 2006). The re-imaging programme was overseen by a consortium consisting of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the Department for Social Development, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the International Fund for Ireland, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the Community Relations Council and Solace, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers. Despite their involvement in funding mural transformation previously, Belfast City Council was not involved, although it continued to support mural re-imaging in its own ways and through its own funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912451810">Belfast City Council, 2009</xref>). The Arts Council was the lead player in the consortium, responsible for distributing the money.</p>
<p>Community groups could apply for funding of up to £50,000 per project, which the Arts Council measured against four criteria: ‘Shared Future’ objectives, community support, quality of arts activity, and organisational and project viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877912451810">Arts Council, n.d.</xref>: 4). The path to funding often involved protracted negotiations. The paramilitary group which painted the mural may have been highly resistant to its removal. Even if the paramilitary group decided that they wished to replace the mural, the money could not simply be handed over to them. There was a requirement for a comprehensive consultation with the community. Usually this was best handled by, and the grant most easily made, to a bona fide community group. Such a group in a local area might have no involvement with paramilitaries; alternatively, it could be a front for a paramilitary group; or, in loyalist areas, it could be dominated by members and supporters of one paramilitary group, thus excluding the other group. Then there is the question of the proposed replacement. A group could propose a theme which the funders judged to be offensive or sectarian. If the theme is dear to the heart of the local paramilitary group, they might judge the funders’ refusal to be a form of censorship and so the negotiations were further prolonged. In one case, it took almost a decade, beginning before the re-imaging programme was inaugurated, for a mural to be replaced. This was in the Village area of South Belfast, where a UDA depiction of the Grim Reaper and an armed, skeletal loyalist wreaking havoc was finally replaced with a huge oil painting of King Billy at the Boyne (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367877912451810">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367877912451810">3</xref>). One source of delay was the difficulty in persuading the UDA to affiliate with the re-imaging philosophy. The UVF locally did embrace it, and as they received funding for murals about the 36th Ulster Division, as well as a portrait of a young Queen Elizabeth II, the UDA concluded that the UVF had taken all the good ideas and there were none left for them. Later in the process, there was the difference of opinion between the UDA and the Arts Council regarding the portrayal of King Billy; for the Arts Council this was both political and potentially offensive, for the UDA it was an expression of culture and history. In the end the UDA won the battle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877912451810">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Others have complained about censorship. For example, Deirdre Mackel of the Upper Springfield Development Trust in West Belfast states: ‘Yes, we are censored. We cannot paint any flags of emblems and we have to steer clear of politics’ (<italic>Christian Science Monitor</italic>, 14 December 2005). Perhaps such developments are to be expected in a situation where an agency responsible for distributing funds is determined to avoid the risk of accusations that they are ‘funding terrorists’. But there is more afoot which can be examined by looking at the Arts Council’s approach to public art.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367877912451810">
<title>Public art, political art</title>
<p>When the re-imaging programme was initially announced in July 2007, the Arts Council stated that its goal was ‘connecting the arts and artists to areas not usually associated with them and allowing art to enrich communities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367877912451810">6</xref></sup> This ‘aesthetic evangelism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912451810">Kester, 1995</xref>) rests on a presumption that the local working-class communities of Belfast, loyalist and republican, had never experienced art nor produced artists. What these areas had was ‘mural painting’, not art, some of which could be preserved but most of which was now anachronistic. According to the Director of the Arts Council: ‘Some paramilitary murals should be in museums. They are about our troubled past. We are a society moving forwards’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877912451810">Bowcott, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a sense in which this missionary zeal of ‘bringing art to the people’ is a well-known trope in justifications of both community art and public art. Community art can play a key role in community development, regenerating marginalised communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912451810">Carey and Sutton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877912451810">Kay, 2000</xref>). Public art can drive urban regeneration and social inclusion, giving citizens a sense of place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912451810">Hall and Robertson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877912451810">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>). All these claims are central to a well-meaning liberal, even radical agenda, which is far removed from the conservatism and elitism of much that passed as art administration in Northern Ireland over many decades. ‘Justice’, ‘empowerment’, ‘inclusion’ and ‘participation’ are key promises in this approach, but for all that, the initiatives involved are top-down, involving professionals and sections of the state in helping to organise supposedly atomised and marginalised communities, helping those who cannot help themselves. But the communities in Northern Ireland could not be described thus. The community was the base for republican resistance against the larger, more powerful state. And although loyalists’ relationship with their base was more shaky, they too used community as a resource for their activities. Loyalist and republican communities could be accused of violent exclusivism but they were not atomised. Part of the self-assertion and self-empowerment of these communities was the tradition of painting murals. Both sides displayed their political identities on the walls. This was a bottom-up movement whose products did not suit the agenda of the top-down policy makers.</p>
<p>The aspiration of bringing ‘artists to areas not usually associated with them’ clearly indicates that the expectation is that the artists involved in re-imaging will be outsiders to the communities in which they work. And while it may be admirable to design in effect an employment enhancement scheme for artists, this excludes those artists who painted in their communities when it was neither safe nor profitable. They did so because they were committed to their communities and to the politics expressed in the murals. They were the mouthpieces, articulating the fears and hopes of their respective communities, prime examples of Gramsci’s notion of working-class ‘organic intellectuals’ – ‘intellectuals of a new type which arise directly out of the masses, but remain in contact with them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912451810">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 652). The external artists are not so rooted. They run the risk of repeating the experience of some art students in Belfast in the late 1970s who became ‘a fine art snatch squad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877912451810">Watson, 1983</xref>: 9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367877912451810">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more fundamental is the problem that art students and trained artists are likely to have a radically different mindset to that of indigenous political muralists. For the latter, politics is at the centre of their motivation, while for the former, this is not the priority; more, that priority does not fit well with the expectations of the funders. One re-imaging artist, Ray Henshaw, has revealed this mentality succinctly. Working in the nationalist Markets area of Belfast, he stated that ‘his plan was to re-establish a sense of history – history predating the Troubles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877912451810">Bridgman, 2009</xref>). Whether intended or not, this is not only a denial of a central experience to this community, but also in effect a rejection of the artists who painted during those Troubles.</p>
<p>The indigenous artists face other difficulties. Usually they had operated on the basis of relatively informal relationships with their communities, where agreements were verbal and payments in hand. Now they had to submit formal tenders. It was standard in such tender briefs to require the applicant to provide a ‘copy of their current curriculum vitae highlighting relevant qualifications and experience for a commission of this nature, particularly information on recent exhibitions and/or commissions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367877912451810">8</xref></sup> This privileges established artists used to the tendering process and with evidence at hand of exhibitions. Moreover, many of the indigenous artists are political ex-prisoners and therefore likely to fare badly in police checks which may be required, especially if there is collaboration with children in the design or execution of the mural.</p>
<p>In these circumstances community groups seeking funding had little authority to demand an indigenous artist they knew already and came to accept the external artist to whom the Arts Council awarded the commission. At the very least, holding out for an indigenous artist, such as happened with three murals in Ardoyne, North Belfast in 2009, required a steely determination on the part of the community group.</p>
<p>The indigenous artist who won the commission could still run into difficulties with the funders. Given his/her political commitment, s/he was more likely than the incoming fine artist to include iconography which the Arts Council, though not the community, found problematic. Thus one of the three murals in Ardoyne mentioned above, about an historical event – the Flight of the Earls in 1603 – ran into difficulty when the Arts Council demanded the removal of a sword from the right hand of one of the Irish chieftains portrayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1367877912451810">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367877912451810">9</xref></sup> It is tempting to judge this as rather ham-fisted but at the same time understandable censorship. Why should a state-funded body support contentious symbols? Yet the complexity of the situation is underlined by the fact that at the same time funding has been given freely to a number of murals in UVF areas which depict images from the First World War, replete with guns. How can a four-centuries-old sword be more contentious than a century-old gun?</p>
<fig id="fig4-1367877912451810" position="float">
<label>Figure 4.</label>
<caption><p>Flight of the Earls, Ardoyne Avenue, 2008</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367877912451810-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The answer lies in the politics which give rise to each image. On the one hand is republicanism, which has been traditionally in opposition to the British state. The sword in the hand of a long-dead opponent of British imperial rule could be seen to stand in for contemporary opposition, even if the artist does not explicitly make that connection. Paradoxically, the First World War gun is less problematic, even if the connection is made to contemporary loyalism. Thus, £74,000 of public money was spent on a re- imaging project in Kilcooley, Bangor, to provide a garden of reflection with imagery relating to the First World War. After the artwork was completed and paid for, plaques dedicated to ‘the glorious memory’ of local members of the UDA, UVF and RHC were added. This meshes well with a loyalist narrative of unbroken struggle, from the opposition to Home Rule, through the Battle of the Somme up to the more recent campaign of ‘bringing the war to the terrorists’, all seen as ultimately about being loyal and British. But more interesting is the state response. Unlike the sword in Ardoyne, the plaques have remained. And an NIHE spokesperson seemed at pains to play down the ‘offence’, pointing out that this ‘should not undermine the progress that has been made in the removal of paramilitary murals, insignia and plaques from the estate’ (<italic>News Letter</italic>, 6 October 2009). The demarcation line between militant republicanism and the state is rigid and cannot be transgressed, even artistically. But that between militant loyalism and the state is more porous, allowing official and illegal iconography to coexist, even if not acceptable to all.</p>
<p>Similarly in Belfast’s Donegall Pass, a re-imaging mural depicting the Ulster Tower at Thiepval Woods in France, along with other First World War symbolism such as poppies, was later embellished with UVF emblems and a roll of honour of the names of local UVF members who had died in the recent conflict, not the one of 90 years earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1367877912451810">Figure 5</xref>). A policy based on the de-politicisation of murals can thus support the continuing expression of loyalist sentiments while being more rigid in policing republican sentiments.</p>
<fig id="fig5-1367877912451810" position="float">

</fig>
<p>There are other critical points that can be made regarding the re-imaging programme. First, the political murals are highly popular with tourists, and it is difficult to see such people sustaining an interest in murals that are apolitical. Second, an innovation under re-imaging has been a proliferation of ‘digital murals’, designs produced on computers and printed out on Perspex or aluminium and attached to walls. They are frequently cluttered in design and often do not have the production values of the best of display boards in museums or interpretive centres. Third, for all that the best of re-imaging projects can capture some element of local community pride, more often the depictions of local heroes, children, anti-drug messages, clichéd depictions of a ‘perfect world’ (to name one such mural in the Markets area of Belfast – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912451810">Romens, 2007</xref>: 10) represent the blandness of the least common denominator. Fourth, and lastly, a remarkable number of the new murals engage in romantic nostalgia; digital reproductions of old pubs in the Markets or dance halls in Sandy Row say little about the community today, and even less about aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>Overall, the impression from viewing the range of re-imaging murals is that their sting has been pulled; they have been sanitised, de-politicised. Outside commentators have noted this, for example, commenting on the ‘unwillingness to engage in political and historical messages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912451810">Romens, 2007</xref>: 13). And insiders too have expressed concern; thus, Unionist Party councillor Bob Stoker in South Belfast, who was centrally engaged in the replacement of the Grim Reaper in the Village with a King Billy mural, argues that it is necessary to hold on to history.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m not saying we should be celebrating the violence and the murder, but we certainly shouldn’t forget it and we shouldn’t dilute it. Any community that had murals in them, it’s part of their culture, it’s part of their ethos, and the violence that was associated with it is part of that particular area and particular culture. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912451810">Burnhill, 2007</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The phenomenon of mural painting grew out of both communities and served a political purpose, that of articulating the hopes and fears, the political identity and ideology of people in those communities. That was their strength. It was also their threat; that is what led to a programme to encourage their removal. But where the programme has been more devastating is in its thrust to remove not merely <italic>those</italic> murals but political murals in general. A valuable programme of re-imaging would also involve <italic>re-imagining</italic>, encouraging local communities to say what they fear and aspire to politically in the new political dispensation, to articulate their political identity for this era as they did so successfully in a previous era.</p>
<p>De-politicisation, albeit applied differentially, is at the core of the re-imaging logic. And in so far as such logic is realised, the end result will not merely be the re-imaging of murals but possibly their demise. What has kept murals alive for decades in working-class communities has not been funding or state support, but rather the desire of local people to articulate their politics and identity on the walls. In the longer term, if that function is removed, there is no burning incentive for local communities to paint murals. In that scenario, there may continue to be murals in working-class areas, but they will not be working-class murals. If that occurs, peace and funding may end up succeeding where war and marginalisation did not, in killing the political mural phenomenon. It will not be death by obliteration, but rather death by funding.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In July 2009 a remarkable event occurred in the lower Shankill area of Belfast. This is the area where UDA boss Johnny Adair less than ten years earlier had arranged a ‘celebration of loyalist culture’. Then militaristic murals were dedicated and masked men and a woman fired shots in the air. High on the event, Adair led an attack on a nearby UVF-frequented bar. When the dust settled two weeks later, seven members of the UDA and UVF were dead and hundreds of UVF supporters had been driven out of Adair’s territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877912451810">Rolston, 2003</xref>). But in 2009, in sunny weather, local community activists led a group of people around ten new murals paid for through the re-imaging programme. At each mural there were short speeches, and the artist responsible for the new mural presented a picture of the militaristic mural which had been replaced; these pictures were later attached to the wall next to the new murals. Everyone then gathered at tables on the grass in the middle of the area, where food and drink were served. Arts Council dignitaries, representatives of statutory bodies, community workers, artists, a number of whom were Catholics, and locals mingled freely. It was a scene that would have been unimaginable in Adair’s time.</p>
<p>The themes of the new murals were undoubtedly a departure: Martin Luther’s stand in front of Catholic church representatives at the Diet of Worms in 1521 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1367877912451810">Figure 6</xref>), the blitz on Belfast in 1941 and, perhaps most remarkable of all, two murals painted in support respectively of human rights and children’s right to play (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1367877912451810">Figure 7</xref>). Many of the visitors remarked on the stark difference of these new themes compared with the old. Pointedly, during the celebrations no one referred to the fact that a number of adjacent murals had not been re-imaged. One celebrates the supposed origins of the UDA in the Ulster Defence Union (UDU) of 1893, complete with a larger-than-life masked gunman aiming directly at the viewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1367877912451810">Figure 8</xref>). Another is a memorial to Stevie ‘Top Gun’ McKeag, allegedly responsible for over a dozen murders, who died of a drug overdose in September 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912451810">Lister and Jordan, 2004</xref>: 143) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1367877912451810">Figure 9</xref>). It would be possible to conclude that the continued existence of these unreconstructed murals points to the failure of the re-imaging programme. On the other hand, their existence could signify that there is now a mixed economy of mural painting in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland state, in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, may have moved into the micro- management of areas once seen as ‘free’, even oppositional to the state and its interests – such as Irish-language schools, loyalist bonfires, Orange parades and nationalist festivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877912451810">McVeigh and Rolston, 2007</xref>) – but that is not the whole story. The sponsorship and funding of murals comes from many sources: sports clubs, community groups, bars, local councils, the NIHE, the Ulster-Scots Agency, campaign groups, international support groups, political parties and groupings, and even from spontaneous decisions. While that is the case, no one state-initiated programme of re-imaging can unilaterally determine the future of murals. And in that there is some hope, for to lose the political content along with the form of expression would be an ignominious end for this unique and lasting art form in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>We started with the sympathetic view of one artist. Let’s leave the last word, also sympathetic, to another artist, Grayson Perry, winner of the 2003 Turner Prize.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The murals are powerfully dark examples of folk art, for me a welcome antidote to the well-meaning but inane iconography of politically correct togetherness that was the staple of community wall paintings of the 1970s and 1980s.… One of the invigorating aspects of the Ulster murals was that, as well as asserting the territory, traditions, history and political messages of the conflict, they are not afraid of winding up the opposition … to suppress the lingering bitterness under a coating of paint could be counter-productive. Better another mural than more bullets.… The artist in me thinks it would be good to let the communities continue to wear their feelings on their sleeve. Maybe one day the murals will be cherished pieces of history, old pictures of faded feelings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877912451810">Perry, 2006</xref>)</p>

<p>In a scheme sponsored by the Arts Council and the Art College during successive summers between 1977 and 1981, art students were paid to paint murals in working-class areas. There were severe restrictions on what they could paint, which meant that there was a proliferation of representations of cartoon and fairy tale characters, as well as jungle scenes, rural idylls and circuses.</p></fn>
