<p>Parenting a child with type 1 diabetes involves continuous planning around the many areas associated with diabetes management, such as when the child ate last and when they will eat again, how much insulin to take, whether or not the child has enough diabetes supplies, as well as being aware of activity levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712446636">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712446636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712446636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712446636"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712446636">5</xref></sup> Fears around the child experiencing hypoglycemia can make parenting stressful,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712446636">3</xref></sup> and for parents of preschool children, irregular eating patterns can heighten stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712446636">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712446636">7</xref></sup> Despite these concerns, parents emphasize the need to provide their children with as many typical life experiences as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712446636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712446636">8</xref></sup> Throughout childhood transitions, parents and children must work together to incorporate diabetes management in a way that maintains blood glucose control without limiting participation in important activities and events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712446636">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712446636"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712446636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712446636">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712446636">8</xref></sup> Likewise, within the school environment, parents have expressed fear that teachers will not respond appropriately to hypoglycemia when management plans are not adequate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712446636">9</xref></sup> Parents have also identified a lack of support due to others being uncomfortable with needles/injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712446636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712446636">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712446636">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parenting children with type 1 diabetes has a strong emotional impact. Feelings of sadness often emerge when parents recall their child’s diagnosis with type 1 diabetes, throughout difficult transitions, or when the blood glucose is not well controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712446636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712446636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712446636">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712446636">12</xref></sup> Parents also worry about the future well-being of their child with regards to diabetes complications and the social and psychological impact the illness will have.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712446636">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the complex nature of diabetes care, parental perceptions and perceived ability to cope have important implications for diabetes management and psychosocial adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712446636">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712446636"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712446636">15</xref></sup> The importance of effective parent-child communication has been recognized as a necessary component for diabetes management and psychosocial adjustment for children with type 1 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712446636">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712446636">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712446636">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The literature, however, neglects to explore the parental sense of meaning and understanding, as shaped through the interaction with community and society and its impact on parenting practices. The purpose of the study was to explore a parent’s sense of meaning in relation to the parenting of a child with type 1 diabetes. The interpretation of the meaning that emerged from the study used an ecological model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712446636">17</xref></sup> to better understand how a parent’s sense of meaning was shaped within a historical and social context. A better understanding of the issue can help promote positive approaches to diabetes management and contribute to program planning and development.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>A qualitative collective case study design was employed in the study. Data collected through this approach includes interviews, observations, audiovisual materials, or documents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712446636">18</xref></sup> In this study, interviews were the primary source of data collection. With a collective case study, several individuals are used to explore the issue of interest across all participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712446636">18</xref></sup> Participants are chosen because they have all experienced the phenomenon of interest. The use of a case study design was suited to the study because it included a focus and description of the context of the case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712446636">18</xref></sup> A description of the participants’ social and historical contexts are important in this study because they are assumed to influence their sense of meaning and understanding.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 10 interviews were conducted with 13 parents of children with type 1 diabetes. Seven interviews were with mothers of children with type 1 diabetes and 3 interviews with mothers and fathers together. Children ranged in age from 7 to 17 and had all been diagnosed with diabetes at least 1 year prior to the interviews. The length of time the participants’ children had lived with diabetes ranged from 1 to 13 years in length.</p>
<p>Parents of children with type 1 diabetes were recruited through the Diabetes Education and Resource for Children and Adolescents (DER-CA) located in Winnipeg and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), Winnipeg chapter. An ethics protocol was prepared and approval was obtained from the University of Manitoba Joint-Faculty Research Ethics Board for research with human participants.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>In order to explore the parental sense of meaning, data collected involved open-ended interviews with parents of children with type 1 diabetes. Participants were asked about their daily experiences in parenting their children. Questions centered on issues concerning diabetes management and ways in which it impacted life for their child and families. Parents were asked how the diagnoses of diabetes affected their parenting outlook and practices. It was important to note that while each parent was asked the same core questions, specific areas of discussion were unique to each parent based on areas they identified as being most affected by the diabetes. As is common in qualitative research, questions were added as data collection progressed in response to the points of interest that emerged throughout the data collection process.</p>
<p>Transcribed interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The interview transcripts were read several times and persistent concepts or themes related to the primary purpose of the study were identified. Words, sentences, or paragraphs, related through their content and context, were placed into codes, with codes that contained related concepts being put into distinct categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712446636">19</xref></sup> A qualitative data analysis program (Nvivo8) was used to organize data throughout the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721712446636">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Interview data revealed that parenting involved not only adjustments to accommodate diabetes-related tasks but changes in outlook and interactions with family, community, and society. The following two categories described what it was like parenting a child with type 1 diabetes. In some contexts, parents did not talk about their child as having a chronic illness, while in other contexts parents spoke of their child as having a chronic illness which required special care and protection. Communication between family and others in society shaped not only the daily lived experience of parents, but also a sense of meaning related to diabetes management and care.</p>
<sec id="section10-0145721712446636">
<title>Being Like Everyone Else</title>
<p>Stories parents told about situations where their child took insulin injections in public compelled them to explain diabetes as a characteristic of the child rather than as a disease. Parents felt stigmatized when others would stare or suggest that they should not allow their child to take insulin injections in public. This happened in restaurants, during activities, and at school. For example, Dave told a story about being out in public:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well he was sitting there and I was doing his insulin and everything and I finished doing his insulin and a lady was sitting beside us, an older lady and she looked she said “Don’t you think you should do that somewhere else” and I said “Do you mind eating somewhere else?” And she looks at me and I go “Well there’s nothing wrong with him. He’s a normal child.” I said “He needs insulin. That’s all he needs.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents stressed that their children are “regular kids” who should not be treated differently by having to take insulin in private. The need to persuade others to view diabetes as a characteristic of the child rather than an illness stemmed from other people’s discomfort with diabetes. For example, Emily explained that it was difficult to send her daughter to friends’ houses, saying
<disp-quote>
<p>Um, well the one, the mom just came right out and told me she said “I’m too nervous to have Zoe.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was also evident in school. Parents explained that when children had to leave the room to engage in diabetes tasks, the children felt different. When Kayla’s teacher had her test her blood glucose apart from the class, Vicki became adamant that this should change, saying:
<disp-quote>
<p>I emailed the teacher and said she doesn’t want to do that anymore. She’s going to now give it right in the classroom. And I said if students have a problem with that then they can turn away. They don’t need to look. And so that’s just what she does.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, parents shifted between understanding diabetes as a characteristic of the child versus as an illness. In recounting times involving emergency situations, parents stressed that diabetes is a serious illness to school staff. There was a positive aspect to viewing diabetes as an illness because the children could get help, and parents felt ambivalent. Mandy explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Um, I in terms of treating him differently I had a really hard time with, when we got the paperwork for the disability tax credit. I said to Martin [her husband] I don’t consider it a disability. You know? And so I really struggled with that label. And, and then also at school, you know, being considered special needs. Yes, I want him to have the support he needs but do I consider him special needs? Well, the school does. Do I? I don’t know. I, I worry about that label and how that changes how people treat him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents did not want to define diabetes as a disability, but understood that more help would be available if their children had this label.</p>
<p>Connecting with other families in similar situations was a factor parents described as helpful to gain a sense of belonging, in light of being viewed differently by others. Participating in diabetes fundraising, connecting with other children and families living with diabetes, and sharing knowledge around diabetes were described as important. Many of the families attended diabetes-related fundraising events and made an effort to help other parents of children living with diabetes. They were happy to help other families who were affected by diabetes through formal organizations or through neighborhood connections. Not long before her interview, Mandy had met a parent through her son’s school whose child was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean obviously I’m not an expert but um, you know, I feel like I’m in a position where I feel like I can mentor this other mom at the school. Um, and that um, ah, you know, if anyone at work, I’m a first aid representative and I consider myself the diabetes expert. So anyone with diabetes at work knows they can come to me if they have any problems.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While fundraising was considered important by many parents, parents believed that participating in diabetes events gave their children the opportunity to be around other people with diabetes. Similarly, if there were other children at school or extended family members with diabetes, this was seen as helping the children feel less alone.</p>

<sec id="section11-0145721712446636">
<title>Protecting the Children</title>
<p>While the previous category represented how parents defined diabetes as a characteristic of their child rather than an illness, the category of protecting the children emphasized the seriousness of diabetes, ensuring the child’s protection from negative diabetes-related outcomes while in the care of others outside the home.</p>
<p>Parents told stories of making efforts to protect their children from being ill-treated. This involved advocating for children when others were not understanding or accommodating a child’s diabetes-related needs. A great deal of effort was put into informing school personnel in order to protect children from diabetes-related emergencies or negative social outcomes. Many of the parents went to their children’s schools and provided staff and students with information on the symptoms of low and high blood glucose and measures to take in case of an emergency. Other parents shared stories of insisting to school staff that children be able to test blood glucose at their desks, instead of being required to leave the room, or be able to leave the room accompanied by a classmate when they felt that their blood glucose was low. Parents who felt that school staff were not responding appropriately insisted that adjustments be made at school. Mandy felt strongly about the need to protect Tyler:
<disp-quote>
<p>I like, for example at the school when I felt that they weren’t educating themselves enough about diabetes and what he needed at school to get through the day, I did get kind of mama bear and I phoned the nurse educator for the school and said “You need to educate your staff. I’m frustrated.” And, um, and so I will ah, that’s where the advocate part comes in. That, you know, I when it comes to the diabetes education that maybe I can push a little more on the, but I wouldn’t ask for any other special treatment, you know, because of the diabetes, so.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mothers went along on field trips with their children when they were younger, or when they had been recently diagnosed, so that they could be sure the children would be all right while they were at school.</p>
<p>Not all attempts at making adjustments were successful. Dave and Lynn shared the story of their attempts to convince school staff to allow Jordan to have his own locker instead of sharing, since sharing meant that he had to keep his insulin in the office. Jordan missed out on time with friends and felt singled out when he had to go to the office to take his insulin. For that reason, Jordan stopped taking his insulin. This rigidity around school policy had social and physical consequences. This was an ongoing issue that had become stressful for Dave and Lynne. They felt that the school was not being accommodating because they were poorly educated about diabetes.</p>
<p>Some parents, however, received strong support from the child’s school. Some schools even had extra staff available to help monitor the children with diabetes, oversee their care plans, or maintain regular communication with parents. The level of support schools were able to give varied depending on the neighborhood where the child lived.</p>
<p>Parents expressed concern over being able to trust others to notice and respond to cues that would indicate a diabetes-related emergency. Since parents could not be with their children at all times, they had to teach others about diabetes and trust them to respond appropriately. Trust has been found to be a prominent issue for parents across a range of contexts such as school, friends' houses, birthday parties, and with babysitters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712446636">10</xref></sup> Lily expressed her concern about sending Charlie to birthday parties: “You’re leaving him alone for three, four hours, and you’re assuming that maybe the people have a little bit of a clue.” While the parents were committed to having their child participate in activities they were interested in, leaving them required taking a chance that everything would be okay.</p>
<p>Parents had to take risks when sending their children on activities and then manage their fears. Carrie described the longest trip Shane took away from home, to a camp in another province. It was planned that Shane would visit the nurse once a day to check in. Carrie was reassured that since Shane could not be easily reached by telephone, she could call the nurse to make sure things were going well. However, when she phoned she was unable to reach anyone, leaving her wondering how Shane was doing; “And then I couldn’t get a hold of them. And so I’m kind of like ‘Carrie, let it go, he’s almost 17 years old. Like you, he’s not a little kid.’ But on the other hand I’m thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!’”</p>
<p>The issue of trust was also prominent in the school context. Vicki felt that she could not trust substitute teachers being informed about Kayla’s diabetes. She shared the story of Kayla having low blood glucose while running laps during a gym class when there was a substitute teacher:
<disp-quote>
<p>But she also had a gym teacher who, who was a substitute and when Kayla asked to leave the class to go get some snacks the teacher said, “No, you can just run another lap.” And Kayla said, “No I can’t run another lap.” She [the teacher] said, “We’re not done what we’re doing. You need to finish this.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to care for herself, Kayla decided to ignore her teacher’s instructions. Situations such as these eroded parents’ trust that substitute teachers would be informed about diabetes and how to respond to an emergency.</p>
<p>Some parents were concerned not only about teachers’ underreactions, but also about their overreactions, which caused children embarrassment. Emily’s story of Zoe’s experience at school whereby she felt that teachers called the ambulance unnecessarily reflects this:
<disp-quote>
<p>They put her on a chair with wheels and they wheeled her down to the office. I thought we went over how to handle everything and we had that plan with the nurse. But they wheeled her all the way down to the office, they phoned me, I’m telling them, “Give her juice, give her juice!” And when I got finally to the office, the teacher was crying and she’s shaking and the principal’s crying. Everybody in the office is sitting there crying and they had phoned 911 by then. So when I pulled up the fire people were there already. And it wasn’t even, it wasn’t even a bad one.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This situation caused embarrassment for Zoe because she did not want attention drawn to her because of the diabetes.</p>
<p>Some parents expressed frustration that their children’s schools were not able to do more to help children with type 1 diabetes, such as administering a glucagon (an injection to raise the blood glucose level) instead of calling an ambulance if the child were to go unconscious. They speculated that it was fear that prevented school staff from responding appropriately.</p>
<p>Parenting a child with diabetes influenced parents’ trust in, and their interactions with, their children’s schools. Parents wanted their children to be integrated into school as much as possible so that they could be cared for without feeling singled out, but did not always trust that this would happen. Because diabetes is often understood as a serious medical illness, school staff may have fear around helping children with their diabetes management. School policies around administering medications and their approach toward chronic illness and children with a chronic illness was an important factor influencing parental perceptions. In schools where staff is well informed about diabetes, parents are more inclined to have trust.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-0145721712446636" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study findings indicated that the presence of diabetes brought new meaning to parenting and that such a meaning influenced the way parents responded to their child’s diabetes-related needs. Experiences of stigma related to taking insulin injections meant that others perceived children with diabetes as not only ill, but not “normal.” An implicit sense of “what is normal” for children pervaded the strategies that parents employed regarding their own children. For example, children were not perceived to be normal by others because they did not conform to conventional ideas about what it means to be healthy. Parents now had the challenge of deciding how to respond to these messages, because they may have been internalized not only for themselves but also in their children. By creating a sense that diabetes was a characteristic of the child rather than an illness, parents worked to redefine what it meant to be normal, hopefully transferring this to their children. Parents accepted the idea of “what is normal” as being important, but normal now meant that sometimes people need to inject insulin into their bodies. Parents pointed out that it is other people’s problem if they are uncomfortable with needles and insisted that children be allowed to take insulin wherever they want. This translated to strategies regarding the child’s participation in other “normal” activities that children are expected to engage in without hesitation or need for specialized care. By placing the responsibility of defining normal onto other’s view of taking insulin, parents worked to preserve their child’s identity as regular children. A process of normalization has been well documented by other authors, when families are affected by type 1 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712446636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712446636">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both themes likewise revealed an underlying tension experienced by parents. On the one hand, parents recognized that children with diabetes were not emotionally or psychologically different from other children. They were only unique in that they take insulin injections and check their blood glucose. However, parents also recognized that there could be times when the child might experience physical harm, with parents needing to take measures to protect them. Due to this tension, providing the child with typical activities and opportunities meant that parents needed to take a risk and trust others to respond appropriately in time of emergency. The amount of risk a parent took depended on his or her level of trust in those providing supervision.</p>
<p>Throughout the interviews the parents’ emphasis shifted between the two themes. This emphasis depended on the specific context and situations. For example, in situations where parents explained that their children had experienced a history whereby teachers did not respond appropriately to low blood glucose, they felt less trusting and needed to put more emphasis on protecting the children in that particular environment.</p>
<p>Findings from the present study revealed that the diabetes brought new motivation around how the parents needed to advocate for their child in the school context. Parents identified challenges that children faced at school such as teachers not being well informed about management plans, not being allowed to keep insulin nearby, or teachers overreacting to diabetes-related complications. Parents explained that they then spent a great deal of time communicating with school staff to ensure that their children could have care plans that best suited them. The education system, then, depended on parents to provide training and education to staff, rather than supporting systemic training for staff within the school system. Study findings reflect previous findings related to communication issues between parents and school staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712446636">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The way that diabetes was understood within the school system shaped the children’s daily experiences and parent-school interactions. Within the schools, diabetes was viewed as a medical condition that was not seen as a regular part of life, whereas children wanted to be perceived as normal and not have unnecessary attention drawn to the diabetes. School policies reflected the emphasis on diabetes as an illness by focusing on control over insulin and diabetes management. Some parents explained that school staff would not allow children to have easy access to their insulin, would not administer glucagon, and were not always comfortable with diabetes emergencies, and, therefore, overreacted. Parents believed these situations had a negative psychological and social impact, making it more difficult for children to manage their diabetes. As a result, parents made efforts to maintain diabetes management at school that reduced negative social consequences while at the same time ensuring that they could trust school staff to respond to emergencies.</p>
<sec id="section13-0145721712446636">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Based on these findings, several recommendations can be made to help promote positive approaches to diabetes management. Appointments with health care professionals should include a focus on the nonmedical aspects of life with diabetes in order to help pinpoint aspects of the child’s environment that are preventing him or her from achieving better control. Regular appointments with parents and children should include discussions about the child’s school context and how this impacts their diabetes management. Input from the child in this regard is crucial. Discussions about the home context as well as activities children participate in can also help educators gain insight into how diabetes management can be better incorporated into the child and family’s daily life.</p>
<p>Diabetes educators can also play a more proactive role in leading school-based discussions with principals, teachers, and school staff. It is clear that many schools may not be well informed about how to respond appropriately to diabetes-related needs and may have little understanding of the psychosocial impact of diabetes. Diabetes educators can work with schools to develop diabetes care plans that take into account the social and emotional impact diabetes has had or may have on a child. Involving the child, the parent(s), and school staff in the development and ongoing assessment of care plans will help ensure feedback from everyone invested in the care of the child with diabetes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study contributes to a deeper understanding of how our subjective interpretations shape our understanding of diabetes outside a medical realm. How family members and others in society communicate about illness shapes our daily lived experience, interactions, and practices related to management of illness.</p>
