<abstract>
<p>This study offers a method for analyzing the narrative content of television news videos. Very few scholars approach the study of visual narratives in television news editing because the technique is highly specialized and not commonly articulated by practitioners. However, cognitive experiments are supporting the importance of understanding the way the brain processes video messages; in particular, those coming from television news. Based in norms and routines theory, this study combines an unprecedented method of content analysis with in-depth interviews of award-winning local news editors in order to reveal a contemporary state of narrative production in television news.</p>

<body>
<p>While an account is a recollection of facts, a narration is the process of telling a story in such a way that the story itself takes on meaning outside of its details. People produce narratives as a way of categorizing and making sense of the society in which they live; a way of taking personally relevant context from a set of otherwise disconnected content. Narratives exist in both fiction and nonfiction stories and, as is relevant to this study, narratives are also found in local television news. News, as a form of communication, serves two functions in society: (1) to transmit information and (2) to tell us more about who we are as a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243112450008">Carey, 2009</xref>). This second function of news, the ritual function of communication, is the focus of this study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112450008">Tuchman (1978)</xref> describes television news narratives as, “a recently evolved foreign tongue we have all learned to translate but that few of us speak” (p. 107). Her observation is a comment on the irony that news narratives are simple enough for viewers to receive, while academics struggle with their analysis. The reason is twofold: First, scholars interested in news production are not always journalists themselves; fewer still are video editors. The understanding of the theoretical concepts of communication (however deep they may run) do not educate academics about which buttons editors push in order to make the videos look one way or another. Second, video editors are not good at explaining what they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243112450008">Schaefer, 2001</xref>). Practitioners learn their craft through the process of mentorship, one where terminology and technique are not uniform across the field. In other words, while all news video editors know how to produce news packages, they have little reason to think about (and subsequently to articulate) their editing choices.</p>
<p>The disconnect described here between academics and journalists results in a preference among news narrative scholars to analyze news scripts rather than news video. However, the significance of news video to the learning process and to memory retention is becoming clearer. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112450008">1990</xref>, Tom Grimes published an article showing that, when it comes to watching television, the mind is apt to retain visual over verbal information. Furthermore, Annie Lang and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112450008">Grabe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243112450008">Lang, Potter, and Grabe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112450008">Lang, Zhou, Schwartz, Bolls, &amp; Potter, 2000</xref>) describe news memory and retention as a process strongly correlated with the contemporary design of news stories. There is a reason, then, to find a common language between scholars and practitioners for the sake of better analyzing the meaning behind the visuals elements of television news.</p>
<sec id="section1-1931243112450008">
<title>Norms and Routines</title>
<p>After a half-century of research, academics agree that two stages separate occurrences from their presentation on television news programs: deciding what is news and deciding how to package it. Leading scholars in this area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243112450008">Fishman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112450008">Gans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243112450008">Molotch &amp; Lester, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112450008">Tuchman, 1978</xref>) approach broadcast news from the perspective that news is not “out there” to be discovered; rather, news is created by journalists through a series of observable and predictable norms and routines. The news, then, is not an objective representation of reality, but rather the product of newsroom decisions as to what the public needs to know and how they need to know it.</p>
<p>Through participant observation and content analysis, these scholars illustrate that news routines determine which events are termed newsworthy and which events are ignored. Moreover, these researchers recognize that routines determine which news-making techniques are used and which are considered counterproductive. Video editors, as photojournalists, are subject to their own unique set of norms and routines, selecting or rejecting, based on mentorship and experience, specific elements of the news-making process.</p>
<p>As pertains to this study, two editing routines separate the production of accounts from the production of narratives in television news. Those two routines are sometimes called “continuity editing” and “montage editing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">Zettl, 1999</xref>). An individual editor’s preference for one over the other is very telling in terms of norms and routines theory.</p>
<p>Continuity editing, like the telling of an account, explains the “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how” of an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">Zettl, 1999</xref>). When we talk about news as a “camera of record,” we refer to news footage edited through continuity techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243112450008">Monaco, 1977</xref>). News editors use continuity editing to both create the illusion that the viewer is watching “reality” and to present facts. In other words, continuity editing has become the standard for transmitting information in television news.</p>
<p>Montage editing, on the other hand, sends messages to the viewer that can be both intense and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">Zettl, 1999</xref>). Using montage techniques, the editor illustrates relationships between shots and sequences and, in doing so, creates an additional layer to the package’s written and visual information.</p>
<p>Until now, there have been very few attempts to recognize which routines are popular in most television newsrooms. In 2009, Schaefer and Martinez published the only longitudinal study comparing news video editing techniques from the late 1960s through present day. Their research combined technical understanding of video editing techniques with an academic discussion of changes in newsroom routines. With the help of Pierce’s semiotic theory and some film terminology, Schaefer and Martinez recognized an increase in the use of montage editing techniques in television news. The authors measured three features of television news: shot length, montage techniques, and transitions. They recognized that shot lengths had significantly decreased over time, speeding up the overall pacing of news stories. They also noticed an increase in dissolves and wipes; something that they attributed to the availability of newer editing technologies. Third, the authors observed that news editors are progressively abandoning traditional realism and moving toward storytelling through video. I argue that this study illuminated a shift from the transmission model toward the ritual model of communication; the development of filmic, stylized stories.</p>

<sec id="section2-1931243112450008">
<title>Editing Narratives</title>
<p>For news editors, the smallest unit of measurement in narrative construction is the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">Zettl, 1999</xref>). Sequences are shots grouped together to form meaning based on the <italic>relationship </italic>between the shots. The whole sequence, then, becomes something greater than the sum of its parts. It is through the construction of sequences, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112450008">Fiske and Hartley (2003)</xref> call “second-order signs,” that an editor can take shots of a road sign or a car and, combined with complementary or conflicting shots, narrate complex concepts such as poverty or danger. Fiske and Hartley explain that codes are, at first, meaningless, but they gain significance over time through conventionality. Photojournalists know, for example, that shooting a subject from below will signify to the viewer the importance of the subject. Conversely, taking the same shot from above will signify the subject’s inferiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">Zettl, 1999</xref>). One can see how these codes were initially meaningless but developed over years of learning to “read” television. In a study of impeachment coverage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243112450008">Baym (2004)</xref> observed that, by presenting Bill Clinton through tight shots, news editors applied an emotional and potentially sympathetic view of the president. Conversely, he found that the use of medium shots in the coverage of Nixon’s impeachment proceedings 20 years earlier did not attach the same emotion to the story (at least not in terms of photography codes). These codes are significant to the study of visual news narratives, but they fall short in recognizing the relationship between the shots in a package.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243112450008">Schaefer and Martinez (2009)</xref> recognize a significant increase in the use of montage editing techniques in news over a 40-year period, this study proposes that the trend could be taking a turn. Narrative editing is both highly specialized and time-consuming, two factors that are not attractive to an industry that suffered severe cutbacks during the recent recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112450008">PEW, 2011</xref>). In light of recent layoffs in television news and the trend toward employing one-man-band or multimedia journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112450008">PEW, 2011</xref>), it is important to map changes in news content where possible. This study recognizes which narratives techniques are employed by modern news editors, and how heavily they rely on these techniques; investigating a relationship between the state of the news industry in a given decade and its effect on news content. The purpose is to make a connection between the increasingly profit-driven structure of the news business and the likelihood that news workers are capable of creating narratives (a process that takes time and money). That is why this study asks:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This mixed methodological study of news narratives consists of in-depth interviews with award-winning news editors and a content analysis of their self-determined best work. Award-winning editors are the focus of this study because they shape the trends in the industry; awards imply a need for those who do not win awards to mimic the winners’ styles. In order to obtain award-winning candidates, I contacted the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA), known for their annual storytelling journalism competition. Mike Harrity, then chair of the NPPA, suggested three participants for this study due to their diverse ages, training, and years of experience. The award-winning editors were asked to mail in a “demo reel” of their best work on DVD. The first 10 stories on each DVD were selected for analysis based on the understanding that a demo reel is compiled in order of importance. The resulting 30 stories were analyzed for the presence or absence of each of narrative editing techniques.</p>
<sec id="section5-1931243112450008">
<title>Narrative Techniques</title>
<p>In order to analyze television news editing narratives, it is important to recognize the kinds of sequences that are employed by news editors. This study borrows the following definitions of narrative techniques in television news editing from Zettl’s <italic>Sight, Sound, Motion </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112450008">1999</xref>): (1) metric montage, (2) analytical montage, (3) idea associative montage, and (4) transitions.</p>
<sec id="section6-1931243112450008">
<title>Metric montage</title>
<p>Zettl defines metric montage as, “a rhythmic structuring device …of a series of related or unrelated images that are flashed on the screen at more or less equally spaced intervals” (p. 292). When each of the shots in a sequence is cut progressively shorter, the scene is viewed as occurring faster. Metric montage, or pacing, increases intensity by increasing the pace of the package and, conversely, numbs the mood by slowing down the pace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1931243112450008">
<title>Analytical montage</title>
<p>Zettl separates analytical montage into two categories: sequential and sectional. Sequential analytical montage means editing a scene to show cause and effect. Even though an editor may not show the actual event (such as a car accident), he or she can create a sequence of a car riding down the street, and another car cutting it off. An editor can then show an effect sequence of the dented cars and the rescue crew helping the injured. Sectional analytical montage, on the other hand, is used to emphasize a moment within a sequential montage in order to add context to the scene. Relating to the car accident example, imagine that, between the “cause” sequence and the “effect” sequence lies a third sequence cutting between Driver A and Driver B’s reactions to the impending accident.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1931243112450008">
<title>Idea-associative montage</title>
<p>Idea-associative montage is the connection of, “two seemingly disassociated images in order to create a third principal idea or concept” (p. 298). Zettl refers to this third idea or concept as a “tertium quid.” As with metric montage, Zettl breaks this technique down into two categories: comparison montage and collision montage. Comparison montage, or cross-cutting, “compares similar themes as expressed in dissimilar events” (p. 299). Comparison depicts a conflict or similarity between two subjects by presenting two points in time within one sequence. This technique is similar to the literary concepts of simile or metaphor. Zettl uses the example of a sequence cut between a hungry man and a hungry animal. Another example of this technique is the cross-cutting of two interviews: If two people who were interviewed individually give strikingly similar responses to the same question, an editor can break up the responses by cutting back and forth between them. Even though each interview occurred at a different time (and possibly a different space), the two are now associated by this third concept of similarity. Collision montage is the same technique using opposing imagery. In other words, rather than using shots of a hungry man and a hungry animal, editors can alternate visuals of extreme wealth with those of extreme poverty to suggest a third concept such as the unfair treatment of the lower class of a given country. In literature, this is closest to the concept of juxtaposition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1931243112450008">
<title>Transitions</title>
<p>Transitions can also serve to add meaning to a sequence. While a “hard cut” means placing two shots next to one another, Zettl defines a “dissolve” as, “a gradual transition from shot to shot in which the two images temporarily overlap” (p. 258). The overlapping of images can result in a separate meaning than the two shots alone, as it temporarily transposes one on top of the other. A “fade” occurs when, “the picture either goes gradually to black (fade-out) or appears gradually on the screen from black (fade-in), signifying, much like a theater curtain, a definite beginning or end of a sequence” (p. 260). Additionally, a “dip” is the pairing of a fade-out and a fade-in. Fades and dips can represent transitions in time and space as well as in narrative themes.</p>

<sec id="section10-1931243112450008">
<title>Content Analysis</title>
<p>Each of the videos in this study (<italic>n</italic> = 30) was analyzed individually for the presence or absence of each storytelling technique defined above. Presence or absence of technique was represented in an Excel spreadsheet with either a one or a zero. Because there is no evidence to suggest that more of a particular technique is somehow better, this study only used zeros and ones. Hard cuts were not included as transitions because they are considered the work of account editing routines, not of storytelling; to edit, by definition, is to cut. In many cases, I had to watch the videos several times in order to decide whether or not a particular kind of montage existed. The difference between sequential and sectional montage required the greatest number of repeat views.</p>
<p>I asked an experienced video editor to analyze 10% of the packages (<italic>n</italic> = 3) that I coded. The coder has never worked as a news editor, but his understanding of editing techniques qualified him to watch the videos with a critical eye. I trained him through a face-to-face conversation about each of the four terms and their subcategories. I used the same examples for each category as I have written in this article. For experienced video editors in particular, storytelling codes commonly used in film are easily recognizable and require little explanation. To further reduce confusion, the coder was provided a “cheat sheet” of definitions for each of the terms to be coded based on the definitions above. He was asked to watch each of the three videos as many times as he felt he needed to and then place a one or a zero in each of the four possible categories for each story. A Scott’s π calculation determined intercoder reliability at .83.</p>

<sec id="section11-1931243112450008">
<title>In-Depth Interviews</title>
<p>I conducted the interviews in Denver on May 10 and 11 of 2007. Each subject was asked to fill out a consent form outlining that they would spend approximately 2 hr discussing their professional history, editing philosophies, and perception of their role in the news-making process. The interview protocol only served as a guide for the questions asked. Each interview naturally veered off in the direction of each editor’s interest and area of experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1931243112450008">
<title>The Participants</title>
<p>When the initial study was conducted in 2007, Mike Harrity was the senior news editor at KUSA-TV, Denver’s NBC affiliate, and top ranked station. Before his departure from news in 2009, Harrity played an active role in the news editing business for more than 20 years. He worked his way up to a management position at KUSA and chaired the NPPA editing awards for 10 years. Harrity provides insight into the current state of news editing. He has the benefit of 20 years of experience from which he describes the development of the industry and offers predictions about the future of television news.</p>
<p>Eric Kehe is the Director of Photography at KUSA-TV, and, though he sees himself primarily as a photographer, is considered one of the top editors at the station, having originally trained as an editor. Kehe, like Harrity, has also worked in television news for more than two decades and offers similar insight to Harrity, only from the photographer’s perspective. Kehe travels to surrounding Colorado universities to lecture to students about photojournalism techniques. He also lectures to his peers at NPPA workshops.</p>
<p>Brian Weister is a former editor from KMGH-TV, a McGraw-Hill owned ABC affiliate. Weister is the winner of two NPPA editor of the Year awards from both 2004 and 2005. Weister has since left the news business to work at High Noon—a company of self-described “storytellers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243112450008">High Noon, 2012</xref>). Weister represents a group of editors skilled at narrative construction who can explain why his colleagues sometimes move out of news and into long-form storytelling project shops.</p>
<p>Joshua Shea is a star news editor at KCNC-TV as the 2007 winner of the NPPA title of Editor of the Year. Shea brings the perspective of the next generation of news editors to this study. KCNC-TV is the only union shop in Denver, and Shea describes his experience working there as well as his development as a storytelling photojournalist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1931243112450008">
<title>Denver</title>
<p>Conveniently, all four subjects work in Denver. While Denver was not chosen specifically due to its market size or the fact that it boasts some of the top local news stations in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243112450008">Davis, 2003</xref>), it is important to note that Denver does happen to have a long-standing tradition of storytelling journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112450008">National Press Photographer’s Association [NPPA], 2012</xref>). Although all of these local news editors currently work in the same city, they are not all employed by the same company, so their editing styles should not be attributed to one set of company training or policies. They are, however, all voluntary members of the NPPA. This proved beneficial to the study as it provided participants who have an appreciation for storytelling, so much so that they voluntarily search for peer validation in the form of the NPPA Best of Photojournalism competition. The participants were eager to share their experiences, philosophy, and wisdom as well as their expressed sense of social responsibility.</p>

<sec id="section14-1931243112450008">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Metric montage and analytical montage are the most popular storytelling techniques used among these news editors with half of the stories containing at least one instance of these techniques. Idea-associative montage, however, is notably less used with only 20% of the stories accounting for its presence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243112450008">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>When the efforts of all three editors are combined, storytelling appears to be alive and well in the newsroom. However, once the stories are broken down by generation of editor, the numbers look very different (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1931243112450008">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Again, it is clear that idea-associative montage is least used by the editors in this study. However, the technique also declines in popularity with each passing generation to the point of nonexistence. The award-winning editor trained in recent years did not use the technique in any of the work he deemed most representative of best practices. In fact, there is noticeable decline in montage editing techniques over all.</p>
<p>The “Nothing” category (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1931243112450008">Table 3</xref>) refers to the percentage of individual stories where no storytelling technique was observed whatsoever. The chart illuminates a possible change in newsroom norms and routines. The editor trained in the 1980s provided 10 stories, all of which contained at least one storytelling technique. The editor trained in the 1990s provided 20% fewer narrative works. And the editor trained in the last ten years only used storytelling techniques in half of his packages.</p>

<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243112450008">Schaefer (2001)</xref> recognized an increase in montage techniques since the 1960s, the trend could be taking a significant turn. Does this mean that contemporary television news editors do bad work? Certainly not: all three of these men are award-winning editors. What, then, explains the shift in content from narratives back to accounts? One answer comes from the editors themselves.</p>
<sec id="section15-1931243112450008">
<title>Account Editing and Profit Motives</title>
<p>Satisfying the needs of shareholders and satisfying the needs of viewers are the functions of two different sets of norms and routines. Account norms and routines ensure that facts are provided accurately and efficiently in a manner suiting the financial interests of the station. Narrative norms and routines present the human experience to the viewer in both an entertaining and an informative way. However, as the editors themselves describe in their interviews, creating packages that benefit the viewer in this way tends to impose on the needs of the shareholders. These subjects express that, when viewers and shareholders both require the attention of news makers, the viewers often lose out.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, news stations began to transition from tape-to-tape technology to nonlinear equipment. For professionals, the switch meant the possibility of having more time to complete their projects and work on individual stories. Harrity explains that it is, “…infinitely more difficult to cut a really good story, a well told story, under deadline in a tape-to-tape environment.” Nonlinear technology filled a need for increasing the speed of production. The industry, however, illustrated its priorities to suit the shareholders by pushing the capabilities of the technology to produce more of the same level of work rather than increasing the quality of the original number of stories in a newscast. The ability to produce more news not only resulted in more stories in an individual newscast but also in more newscasts. Kehe notes that, “there’s a noon, a four, a five, a six, a ten, and four hours in the morning from five until nine. That’s a lot of editing…not a whole lot of time to really develop your editing skills…You get really fast, productive, efficient, but that doesn’t always mean you’re going to get better.” News managers expect editors to develop their speed in order to create more products, which results in an increase in profits for their station, but editors are not necessarily expected to improve the quality of their work for the sake of the viewers.</p>
<p>One example of the way storytelling is compromised for the sake of money is cross-training. Nowadays, due in part to the ubiquity of production technology, and the high demands on worker productivity, managers are cross-training their reporters, producers, photographers, and even their anchors in editing. People who otherwise may have no interest in learning how to edit are now expected to possess the basic skills of continuity editing. According to Weister, the concern from the editors is that, “…they’re going to make it a skill for so many people, but it’s not their primary skill that I could see where…the quality might drop as far as editing goes.” Coincidentally, Harrity trained his anchors to edit right before his interview for this study. He “sat there and watched them cut their own VOSOT. Were they great VOSOTS? No. But appropriate for the air? Yes.”</p>

<title>Narrative Editing and Social Responsibility</title>
<p>Kehe describes an editing career as a 10-year process. The first 5 years are spent honing continuity editing skills. The second phase is something that may be on the decline:<disp-quote>
<p>…in a television station that embraces storytelling, the next five years you’re training and focusing on your storytelling and that’s a whole other area and that’s why we call them photojournalists… the best photojournalists are the photojournalists that can take an assignment take a concept and turn it into a story…</p>
</disp-quote>When Kehe teaches storytelling techniques at colleges, NPPA workshops, or to his colleagues, he does not focus on the techniques of continuity editing. Instead, he introduces editors to a separate list of editing routines; one that is influenced by social responsibility. It’s a concept that he calls ITEAM. Kehe believes that it is his role to “team up” with the viewer in order to, “Inspire, Teach, Entertain, Enlighten, Make a difference in the viewers’ lives. And that’s a standard that I try and hold to all of my stories…I’m trying to evoke some sort of emotion and elicit some sort of response in people, motivate them to make a change.” Kehe explains that if he were restricted to the norms and routines of account editors, he would have quit the news business long ago: “It’s why I can do the news. If I did it the other way, I couldn’t do it. If I just went out, shot a bunch of pictures, and couldn’t put the stories in proper perspective, I wouldn’t do this.” Kehe is not only motivated by the need to appease his bosses, he also believes that, as a photojournalist, he serves a greater social purpose.</p>
<p>Kehe is able to incorporate these narrative norms and routines into his daily work because he is in a position of authority at KUSA and ensures that storytelling is a priority for himself and his employees. Shea, on the other hand, who does not work in a storytelling station like KUSA, sees his job as having a different priority: “To me I look at it that the priority has to be the newscast. If I’m not making every VO every VOSOT every tease look as good as it possibly can then we don’t have the other stuff.” Account editing is Shea’s first priority because, as he sees it, VOs (voiceovers) and VOSOTs (voiceovers/sound on tape) are the meat of a television news program. Packages that will attract attention and are allotted extra time by the station, are what Shea calls “special projects.” For Shea, these projects are only available if the regular newscast keeps the station in business. He notes that, “…some people are more concerned about doing special projects and more than concerned about doing the show.” Shea does recognize, however, that growing up in Denver means, for him, an affection for storytelling journalism. “Denver’s a weird market,” he says, “…such an importance placed on pictures and storytelling and, even before I was aware of what that stuff was, we kind of knew that, you know, this was done well.” While Shea values the opinions of his NPPA colleagues, he prioritizes account editing norms and routines and views storytelling, in the current state of news, as the content of special projects that fall outside daily norms and routines.</p>
<p>Weister’s point of view is similar to that of Kehe. In fact, it was Kehe’s visit to Weister’s class during his undergraduate program that inspired Weister to become an award-winning editor: “I’d seen this NPPA stuff, I’d seen guys like [Kehe] and I’d seen their work and seen these NPPA tapes…and I said to myself that’s what I want to do.” Weister describes an environment in which his desire to compete in the NPPA awards meant shooting and editing on his own time. In other words, the work he was capable of producing on the clock was less likely to meet Kehe’s ITEAM standards. Weister’s personal priority was his craft, but, at work, his responsibility was, “…to stay profitable, make sure everybody keeps their jobs. Is that why I do it? No. That’s why TV stations are in business. I do it, I mean I did it, because it was my only joy in an otherwise boring job of cutting VOs and VOSOTs all day.” Weister felt he had to adopt account norms and routines where he worked. The only opportunity he had to tell stories was on his own time. He developed his craft as much as he could for his personal sense of satisfaction and then he left the business. “Really after the first time I won the award…I did as much as I ever wanted to do…I decided to leave the business because the challenge was gone and there was no more motivation and the 90% of the time that I spent cutting VOs and VOSOTs and re-tracking packages finally overpowered the 10% of the time I got to cut stories.” Weister won the NPPA editor of the year award for 2 consecutive years and then left the news business to work for a company that produces longer form projects such as documentaries. His is a crucial example of the downside of a system that prefers shareholders over viewers: eventually, those editors who wish to engage in narrative editing norms and routines can become disenchanted with the entire system and move on to other industries where they may find greater support for their art.</p>

<title>The Price of Quality</title>
<p>According to the four participants, it is very rare to find a station nowadays that promotes storytelling. Some stations, once known for their storytelling photojournalists, have now transitioned away from narratives, placing priority on continuity norms and routines. In the case of KSTP in Minneapolis, Weister recalls, the station employed a new news director whose priority it was to focus on turning a profit. As a result, most if not all of the editors and photographers either quit or were replaced. Time is money, and storytelling simply takes more time than creating accounts. Weister’s <italic>Silver Gloves </italic>package, included in this study, required several visits to the boxing club in order to establish a relationship and a comfort level with the participants, as well as seven hours of shooting on the day he captured the footage. Some editors recognize the value of narrative editing for the benefit of the viewers. The resistance coming from some news managers, however, is indicative of an industry bound by financial obligation to shareholders over its social obligation to the viewers and this resistance is creating workplace tension.</p>

<sec id="section18-1931243112450008">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Account editing norms and routines produce passable, but not necessarily memorable news packages. Effects research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243112450008">Lang et al., 2003</xref>) as well as agreement from industry professionals points to the significance of storytelling as a method for increasing understanding of information from news packages. Advertising revenue, however, is dependent upon viewer eyeballs, and not upon understanding or subsequent action. The problem is that storytelling is time consuming and, therefore, expensive. At least, it is more expensive than training editors to create accounts.</p>
<p>While there is no guarantee that narratives move people to act politically more than do accounts, there is research to support that narratives are more likely to be paid attention to and remembered. Recognizing this distinction could even prove profitable for television news stations. All stations have the same accounts, but not the same narratives. Storytelling could be perceived as financially profitable by marketing each station as a unique product of originally produced narratives. Kehe supports this arguments when he says, “…it’s gotta be different from all the other stories out there that the other stations are telling. That’s why you can’t just simply regurgitate a bunch of facts.” There are many people who, “know how to push buttons,” Weister explains, “and have absolutely no idea how to tell stories.” Editors who come up in what may be only few remaining storytelling news stations know how to get the viewer’s attention while still providing useful information.</p>
<sec id="section19-1931243112450008">
<title>Future Considerations</title>
<p>This is the first time that news visuals have been studied this way. There are, therefore, many avenues down which this research can lead. First, this study needs to be repeated with a much larger sample in order to determine more conclusively whether current business models are causing a significant decrease in narrative video editing techniques. It would then be interesting to compare the use of narrative editing techniques across countries using a political economy lens. If narrative norms and routines are stifled by American, advertising-based systems, perhaps this is not the case in systems that do not depend on advertisers. News production in public broadcasting stations, where programming is viewer-supported, may provide alternative results to the struggles of privately owned television news stations.</p>

<sec id="section20-1931243112450008">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The interviews discussed in this study reveal daily expectations placed by managers upon television news editors. As these interviews support, narrative news-editing products lie outside the conventional norms and routines that ultimately support the needs of shareholders to produce the cheapest, most efficient show possible. Mediocre editing affects everyone: viewers miss out on the rich social narratives that television news is supposed to provide; voters are less likely to remember and, therefore, depend on the political information received from television news; and shareholders risk providing a product that is nearly identical to those of other stations. Of course, the fate of television news does not rest solely upon the editors’ shoulders. News is a team effort and narratives are constructed by a combination of writers, photographers, and editors. Kehe, however, does note the following: “Stories will live and die in the edit bay…You can have great stories, you can have great moments, you can have great execution, great photography, great reporting out in the field, but when that ball’s coming in, the editor’s got to hit the homerun.”</p>
