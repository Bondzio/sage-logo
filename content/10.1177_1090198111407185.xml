<abstract>
<p>Effective early detection strategies for ovarian cancer do not exist. Current screening guidelines recommend against routine screening using CA-125 alone or in combination with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). In this study, the authors used the 2008 <italic>DocStyles</italic> survey to measure clinician beliefs about the effectiveness of CA-125 and TVS in the asymptomatic, average-risk population in the United States. To assess the need for provider education, the authors used the 2008 <italic>HealthStyles</italic> survey to examine public awareness of CA-125. Of 1,250 physician respondents, 40.4% said both CA-125 and TVS were effective screens, and 28.3% said neither was an effective ovarian cancer screen in the asymptomatic, average-risk population. Obstetrician/gynecologists [OB/GYNs] more often had responses consistent with current guidelines: 56.5% of OB/GYNs, compared with 34.4% and 29.8% of family/general practitioners and internists, respectively, said neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen. Almost one third of women surveyed reported having heard of CA-125, and about one tenth said they had the CA-125 test. These findings support the need for additional provider education. Educational efforts should include lack of evidence for, as well as the potential harms of, screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125.</p>

<body>
<p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women and the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407185">U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2010</xref>). Approximately 20,000 women are diagnosed with and about 15,000 women die each year from ovarian cancer in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111407185">U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2010</xref>). The poor prognosis of ovarian cancer is frequently attributed to the fact that the disease is often diagnosed at late stages, when it has already spread. Currently, effective strategies for prevention or early detection of ovarian cancer do not exist.</p>
<p>The use of serum markers for the early detection of ovarian cancer has been the focus of much research, and CA-125, discovered in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111407185">Bast et al., 2005</xref>), has been the main tumor marker of interest. CA-125 is generally elevated in advanced-stage ovarian cancer; however, it is elevated in less than 50% of Stage I ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111407185">Clarke-Pearson, 2009</xref>). Additionally, CA-125 has been shown to be elevated in women with a number of physiologic and pathologic conditions, including cirrhosis and congestive heart failure, benign gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111407185">Hermsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111407185">Pauler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111407185">Verheijen, von Mensdorff-Pouilly, van Kamp, &amp; Kenemans, 1999</xref>), and other malignancies such as breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, gastric, and liver cancers. Because of the low sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of CA-125, in 2004 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against its use for routine screening of the general, asymptomatic population for ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111407185">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2004</xref>), concluding that “the potential harms outweigh the benefits.” The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111407185">American Cancer Society (2010)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111407185">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2003)</xref> have similar recommendations.</p>
<p>To improve the specificity of CA-125 for early detection of ovarian cancer, several studies have investigated its use in combination with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). A large, randomized U.S. trial examining the use of CA-125 alone or in combination with TVS showed that of approximately 30,000 women screened, only 27 had abnormalities in CA-125 in the year of ovarian cancer diagnosis; however, 84% of these cases resulted in eventual diagnoses of Stage III or higher ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). Of the 19 women who had abnormalities in both CA-125 and TVS measurements, 79% of these women were diagnosed with Stage III or higher ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). These results, and those from a similar trial in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111407185">Menon et al., 2009</xref>), have led to no changes in the current recommendations against the use of CA-125 as a screen for ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Despite the clear lack of scientific evidence for routine ovarian cancer screening with CA-125, there remains extensive public dissemination of information on and direct-to-consumer marketing of CA-125 (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.privatemdlabs.com">www.privatemdlabs.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lab-test-direct.com">www.lab-test-direct.com</ext-link>) for ovarian cancer screening. Screening with CA-125 in the asymptomatic population is associated with many potential harms, including increased worry and concern among patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407185">Wardle, 1995</xref>) and the performance of unnecessary invasive surgery based on false-positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). It is important to determine physician knowledge and awareness of CA-125 screening, since several studies have linked physician knowledge to behavior. The theory of reasoned action/planned behavior has been used extensively to show that physician knowledge is directly associated with their intention to use and implement clinical guidelines in their health care practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111407185">Kortteisto, Kaila, Komulainen, Mäntyranta, &amp; Rissanen, 2010</xref>) and also influences their use of established screening protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111407185">Taylor, Montano, &amp; Koepsell, 1994</xref>). Little information exists regarding physician knowledge of CA-125 and ovarian cancer. A survey conducted in Maryland in 2002 reported that a majority of family physicians used CA-125, along with ultrasound, to screen women with an elevated or high risk for ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111407185">Brooks et al., 2002</xref>). However, information is lacking regarding physician knowledge of CA-125 in the larger, average-risk population (defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology as women with no first degree relatives with a history of ovarian cancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407185">Andersen et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we used the 2008 <italic>Styles</italic> surveys to investigate primary care physician knowledge of CA-125 as an effective screen in the asymptomatic, average-risk population. In the context of extensive public dissemination of information on CA-125, and because patient knowledge has been shown to have an effect on cancer screening rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111407185">Peterson, Dwyer, Mulvaney, Dietrich, &amp; Rothman, 2007</xref>), we also examine women’s familiarity with the CA-125 test. This assessment of women’s familiarity also helps establish the need for provider education.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were obtained from the 2008 <italic>Styles</italic>© mail panel surveys administered by Synovate, Inc., a global market research firm that collects data on behalf of Porter Novelli, an international marketing-based public relations group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.porternovelli.com">www.porternovelli.com</ext-link>). In 2008, Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC’s) Division of Cancer Prevention and Control purchased several questions to collect data from two <italic>Styles</italic> surveys, <italic>DocStyles</italic> and <italic>HealthStyles</italic>, to help inform its national awareness campaign, <italic>Inside Knowledge: Get the Facts About Gynecologic Cancer.</italic></p>
<sec id="section2-1090198111407185">
<title>DocStyles 2008</title>
<p>The 2008 <italic>DocStyles</italic> web-based survey of U.S. physicians and allied health professionals contained 140 questions, some of which were limited to specific specialties, such as those reported here which were answered only by primary care physicians and obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). The sample for <italic>DocStyles</italic> 2008 was drawn from Epocrates Honors Panel® (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epocrates.com/services/marketresearch">www.epocrates.com/services/marketresearch</ext-link>), which includes more than 134,000 physicians in 36 specialties and 425,000 allied health care professionals. At the time of panel registration, the identities of physicians are verified by comparing first name, last name, date of birth, medical school, and graduation date against the American Medical Association’s (AMA) Physician Masterfile®, an inventory of licensed U.S. physicians that includes AMA members and nonmembers. Physicians were eligible to take part in the <italic>DocStyles</italic> 2008 survey if they practiced in the United States; treated at least 10 patients a week; worked in an individual, group, or hospital practice; and had practiced medicine for at least 3 years. Sampling quotas for <italic>DocStyles</italic> 2008 were set to reach 1,000 primary care physicians and 250 OB/GYNs. In July 2008, e-mail invitations to take part in the survey were sent to 7,205 primary care physicians and 2,303 OB/GYNs who were randomly selected to match the proportions for age, gender, and region of the AMA Physician Masterfile. Per the sampling quota, completed responses were obtained from 1,000 primary care physicians (510 family/general practitioners and 490 internists) and 250 OB/GYNs. An additional 529 primary care physicians and 399 OB/GYNs responded to the survey invitation but were terminated because of filled quotas or failure to meet screening criteria. Eligible respondents who completed the survey received a $75.00 honorarium.</p>

<title>HealthStyles 2008</title>
<p>A total of 20,000 potential respondents were selected through stratified random sampling from a consumer mail panel of approximately 340,000 potential respondents to create a nationally representative sample. The main sample (<italic>N</italic> = 11,000) was balanced on region, household income, population density, age, and household size. There was an oversampling of low income and/or minority groups (<italic>N</italic> = 3,000) and households with children (<italic>N</italic> = 6,000) to ensure adequate representation and numbers of potential respondents for these groups. A total of 10,108 people completed the initial recruitment survey, for a response rate of 50.6%. <italic>HealthStyles</italic> 2008 surveys were sent to 7,000 respondents who returned the initial survey, and 5,399 participants responded to the HealthStyles 2008 survey, for a response rate of 77.1%. The responses to the survey items reported here were limited to female respondents, as they relate to gynecologic cancer awareness, concern, and symptoms. <italic>HealthStyles</italic> data were poststratified and weighted so that the sample distribution of age, race/ethnicity, sex, household size, and household income matched that of the general population according to U.S. Census benchmarks.</p>
<p>Respondents to both surveys were not obligated to answer any questions and could refuse participation at any time. The CDC licenses the results for the <italic>Styles</italic> surveys from Porter Novelli. Since personal identifiers were not included in the data provided to CDC, analyses of results were exempted from institutional review board approval.</p>

<sec id="section4-1090198111407185">
<title>Variable Definitions and Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Questions about the CA-125 blood test were included in both the <italic>DocStyles</italic> and <italic>HealthStyles</italic> surveys. In efforts to examine clinician beliefs about the effectiveness of screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125, we analyzed the <italic>DocStyles</italic> question, “For which cancers, if any, do you think that the following procedures or tests are effective in screening asymptomatic women in the average risk population? Select all that apply.” A series of cancers were listed as response options for each item: the CA-125 test, TVS procedure, and other tests/procedures. We combined responses into four outcome groups, including (a) respondents who selected CA-125 for ovarian cancer but not TVS, (b) respondents who selected CA-125 and TVS as “effective” screening tests for ovarian cancer, (c) respondents who selected neither CA-125 nor TVS as “effective” screening test for ovarian cancer, (d) and respondents who selected TVS but not CA-125 tests for ovarian cancer (data not shown for this response category). Physicians were also asked about demographic characteristics (sex, age, race/ethnicity), clinical specialty, type of practice, number of years of practicing medicine, among other practice- and sociodemographic-related questions.</p>
<p>Although we were interested in responses regarding CA-125 specifically, we also assessed physician responses regarding TVS along with CA-125, because of the ongoing trials investigating these agents used alone or together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111407185">Menon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). We were specifically interested in assessing the number of providers whose response was consistent with current recommendations, that is, neither CA-125 nor TVS is an effective screen for the asymptomatic average-risk population. We assessed bivariate relationships between the <italic>DocStyles</italic> outcome variables (of respondents by knowledge level about the effectiveness of CA-125 and TVS in screening asymptomatic women in the average risk population) and each of the physician characteristics using chi-square tests, at a significance level of <italic>p</italic> = .05. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for factors associated with responding “neither CA-125 nor TVS is an effective screen for the asymptomatic, average risk population.” We calculated odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, chi-square <italic>p</italic> values (Wald <italic>F</italic>), and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit <italic>p</italic> value for the model. The Hosmer–Lemeshow <italic>p</italic> value for the model was .87, supporting an acceptable fit. The explanatory variables were the subset of physician characteristics of potential relevance based on prior literature, background knowledge, and/or where preliminary descriptive analyses had identified a statistically significant relationship. Effects that did not meet the <italic>p</italic> ≤ .5 significance level were removed from the final model. All statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>
<p>To better understand women’s familiarity with the CA-125 test, we analyzed the <italic>HealthStyles</italic> questions, “Have you heard of the CA-125 blood test” (response options: yes, no, not sure) and “Have you ever had the CA-125 blood test” (response options: yes, no, not sure). Because TVS is not available to consumers directly, we did not analyze women’s familiarity with TVS. We describe responses to these variables by demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, marital status), menopausal status; reported cancer history (breast cancer; gynecologic cancers including cervical, uterine, ovarian, vaginal, vulvar cancers; and other cancers including other [unspecified] cancers, colorectal cancer), and concern level for receiving an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Personal cancer history (reported cancer history) was assessed by asking “Have you <italic>ever</italic> been told by a doctor that you have any of the following?” Respondents were not asked about cancer diagnoses or cancer history among family members. Concern for an ovarian cancer diagnosis was assessed by asking “How concerned are you about getting [ovarian cancer] in the future?” (response options: not at all, not very, somewhat, or very concerned). We provide frequency calculations for these analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section6-1090198111407185">
<title>DocStyles Survey</title>
<p>Overall, 8.2% of the physicians who responded to the questions we used in our analysis said that CA-125 alone (and not TVS) was an effective screen, 40.4% said CA-125 and TVS were both effective screens, and 28.3% said neither of these modalities was an effective screen for the asymptomatic, average-risk population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111407185">Table 1</xref>). Responses were similar by sex and ethnicity. However, younger physicians, aged 25 to 44 years (38.9%), and White physicians (40.1%) more often said that neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen. In terms of physician characteristics, responses did not differ significantly by number of years in practice, privileges at a teaching hospital, or financial situation of the provider’s patient population. Physicians in a group practice more often responded that neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen (40.0%) compared with those practicing in a hospital/clinic (33.9%) or individual practice (28.5%). Results also differed by physician specialty: OB/GYNs more often responded that neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen (56.5%) compared with family/general practitioners (34.4%) and internists (29.8%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings in this study indicate that overall almost half of primary care physicians believe that CA-125 alone or CA-125 and TVS are effective screens for ovarian cancer in the asymptomatic, average-risk population. Less than a third of these physicians believe, consistent with current screening guidelines, that neither of these modalities is an effective screen for ovarian cancer in this population. Physicians who were younger in age, White, were obstetricians/gynecologists, and in a group practice provided responses that were more often consistent with the scientific evidence and recommendations for ovarian cancer screening. Younger age and obstetrician/gynecologist specialty were independently and significantly associated with responses that were in agreement with current screening guidelines.</p>
<p>Although some provider responses were in line with screening recommendations, a large percentage was not. Internists and those in family/general practice were more likely to give responses that differed from current recommendations. Previous studies have also shown differences in beliefs and practices among OB/GYNs and internists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111407185">Turner et al., 1992</xref>). A study of hormone replacement therapy use reported that OB/GYNs were significantly more likely to provide accurate assessments of the risks and benefits associated with hormone replacement therapy, compared with internal medicine and family practice physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111407185">Williams, Christie, &amp; Sistrom, 2005</xref>). The results from these studies suggest that increased and appropriate education regarding gynecologic cancer screening and diagnostic care may be necessary for primary care physicians, especially for family physicians and internists. Additional education for older physicians, including OB/GYNs, may also be needed. Since guidelines-based information specifically targeted to OB/GYNs has been published relatively recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111407185">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2003</xref>), older OB/GYNs may not have benefited from obtaining this knowledge during their formal training.</p>
<p>Our findings also indicate that almost a third of women respondents had heard of the CA-125 test and a relatively small proportion (approximately one tenth of women respondents) reported having the test. These results are somewhat similar to a study in Seattle designed to measure ovarian cancer worry in high-risk women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111407185">Andersen et al., 2004</xref>). In the Seattle study, overall, about 50% to 70% of women reported having had a CA-125 test, and responses differed based on the recruitment technique. Relatively lower percentages were found among women recruited by commercial mailer (similar to our survey). Of those women, 33% said they were tested with CA-125 but not recently, whereas 9% said they were tested in the last year. Our findings also indicate that a majority of women who reported they had the CA-125 test were somewhat or very concerned about getting ovarian cancer. This concern could have led patients to pressure physicians to administer the test, a possibility suggested by the author of a Massachusetts study that reported excessive utilization of CA-125 by primary care physicians in one institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111407185">Lewandrowski, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Physicians may believe that administration of the CA-125 test itself is harmless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111407185">Lewandrowski, 2003</xref>); however, it can have many negative psychological and physiological effects on the patient. A U.K. study reported worry about cancer and perceived risk were higher in groups screened for ovarian cancer, regardless of their actual risk, compared with unscreened, community controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407185">Wardle, 1995</xref>). This excess worry and perceived risk were also associated with overall lower optimism in the screened groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111407185">Wardle, 1995</xref>). Additionally, worry and concern generally increase following false-positive results of cancer screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111407185">Aro, Pilvikki, van Elderen, van der, &amp; van der Kamp, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111407185">Brewer, Salz, &amp; Lillie, 2007</xref>), a result that is fairly common with CA-125 tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). The high false-positive rate with CA-125 is in part related to the fact that CA-125 levels vary by demographic and behavioral factors in postmenopausal women without cancer. Higher levels of CA-125 are associated with women at increased age and former smokers, whereas lower levels are associated with Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Native American women, as well as women who had a hysterectomy, current smokers, and obese women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111407185">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In many cases, an elevated CA-125 level can result in exploratory surgery or oophorectomy. In the U.S. CA-125/TVS screening trial, false-positive screening results resulted in a total of 1,086 surgeries (primarily oophorectomies) performed on women with no eventual evidence of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). These false-positive screening results effectively doubled the number of oophorectomy surgeries in the general U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111407185">Partridge et al., 2009</xref>). While oophorectomy may be warranted in some cases, there are several harms a patient can experience following the procedure (Hickey, Ambekar, &amp; Hammond, 2009). Several studies associate oophorectomy with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, hip fractures, dementia, short-term memory impairment, decline in sexual function, decreased positive psychosocial well-being, adverse skin and body composition changes, and adverse ocular changes (Hickey et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111407185">Shoupe et al., 2007</xref>). The Women’s Health Initiative study found that oophorectomy was associated with a twofold increased risk of coronary artery calcification compared with that found in premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111407185">Allison et al., 2008</xref>). A meta-analysis of postmenopausal women also concluded that women who had an oophorectomy were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease compared with women who went through natural menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111407185">Atsma, Bartelink, Grobbee, &amp; van der Schouw, 2006</xref>). Observational studies suggest that retaining the ovaries in postmenopausal women reduces the risk of osteoporotic fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111407185">Parker et al., 2007</xref>). A recent retrospective cohort study suggests that women who underwent oophorectomy before the natural onset of menopause had increased risk of later cognitive dysfunction, including dementia, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111407185">Rocca et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, oophorectomy in premenopausal women could lead to prolonged and/or more severe menopausal symptoms (Hickey et al., 2009).</p>
<p>The information reported here contributes valuable data regarding physician awareness of CA-125 screening in the average-risk, asymptomatic population, and to our knowledge, this is one of a very few studies that have examined CA-125 knowledge. While much important and novel information is presented, there are several limitations to this study. The sampling methodologies used in both surveys analyzed in this study may have resulted in a sample that is not truly random and/or representative of U.S. physicians or the population of U.S. women. As in all surveys, we have no information on the awareness or knowledge of those who did not respond to the surveys, and those responses could have been different from those reported here. The <italic>DocStyles</italic> survey was administered as a quota survey, which is common in market research but less common in health research. Quota samples obtain responses from the most available and willing individuals, and thus may underrepresent persons who are difficult to contact or reluctant to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111407185">Kalton, 1983</xref>). The generalizability of the data may therefore be limited using this technique. <italic>HealthStyles</italic> responses are self-reported, which may limit the accuracy of the data. We were also limited in our ability to fully characterize the <italic>HealthStyles</italic> data in that we could not assess whether women had a CA-125 test for screening or for approved diagnostic purposes or if CA-125 testing was warranted, as in the case of follow-up after cancer treatment. Although these limitations exist, it should be noted that the primary care and OB/GYN physician respondents included in the 2008 <italic>DocStyles</italic> survey have similar demographic characteristics to those in the AMA masterfile, particularly with respect to age and geographic area. The average age for primary care physicians and OB/GYNs among <italic>DocStyles</italic> participants was 45 and 45.8 years, respectively. The average age of these physicians in the AMA masterfile was 47.7 and 49.4 years, respectively. In addition, research has shown that responses to <italic>HealthStyles</italic> data generally are similar to those from the national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111407185">Pollard, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Research into the development of an effective screening test for ovarian cancer continues. Some newer tests rely on proteomic methodologies to detect ovarian cancer; however, most of these continue to have poor sensitivity and positive predictive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111407185">Petricoin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111407185">Visintin et al., 2008</xref>), and some still incorporate CA-125 measurements as a necessary component of a multimarker assay to detect ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111407185">Visintin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111407185">Yurkovetsky et al., 2010</xref>). Physician awareness of the limitations and harms of CA-125 as a routine screen for ovarian cancer is necessary, as many of these tests have been marketed directly to physicians and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111407185">Greene, Feng, &amp; Gail, 2008</xref>), despite the clear lack of clinical validity and utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111407185">Coates, Kolor, Stewart, &amp; Richardson, 2008</xref>). Studies have shown that direct to consumer marketing does influence patient and physician behavior, motivating discussions about advertised interventions and in some cases greatly increasing the use of these interventions, despite physician reservations and recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111407185">Robinson et al., 2004</xref>). The research presented here from both surveys demonstrates a need for improved education and suggests areas for targeted educational efforts, which may help curtail these influences. Educational and awareness initiatives, such as CDC’s <italic>Inside Knowledge: Get the Facts about Gynecologic Cancer</italic> campaign, can be a very useful resource for physicians and women regarding the evidence base for ovarian cancer screening. Specific educational materials disseminated through this initiative include a fact sheet and comprehensive brochure for both physician and public consumption, which clearly state that a screening test, or other early detection methods for ovarian cancer, does not currently exist. Additionally, in attempt to reach physicians of all ages and specialties, these materials are distributed at various targeted professional meetings. It is intended that the widespread dissemination of these materials to both physicians and the public will increase knowledge and awareness in both populations, thus decreasing inappropriate patient requests for the test and increasing the ability of providers to adhere to guidelines-based screening for ovarian cancer. The implementation of local policies that prevent the use of CA-125 for screening, as well as cost analyses that assess the overspending associated with inappropriate use of the CA-125 test, would potentially have a great impact on ultimately reducing the use of CA-125 as a screen for ovarian cancer in the average-risk, asymptomatic population.</p>
