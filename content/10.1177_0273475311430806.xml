<abstract>
<p>Pedagogical strategies can be thought of as a set of stimuli placed in students’ environment to influence their cognition, affect, and behavior. The design of strategies such as group assignments and a comprehensive understanding of their consequences for students should then include an analysis of all three of these elements and the interrelationships that exist among them. As such, this study investigated the unintended cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences of group assignments experienced by undergraduate business students. The discovery-oriented method of grounded theory was used. Data were gathered from a sample of 32 undergraduate marketing and management students by combining the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique with in-person interviews. Findings indicate that students do experience several cognitive and affective consequences that are contrary to the broad range of benefits consistently highlighted in academic literature. Findings also highlight prevalent behaviors that motivate the cognitive and affective consequences. The study should give educators reason to seriously consider the extent to which group assignments contribute to or detract from the value of undergraduate business education.</p>

<p>There is broad recognition that much of the work that business students will eventually accomplish in the workforce will be the result of team efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430806">Sundstrom, De Meuse, &amp; Futrell, 1990</xref>). There is also broad recognition that business schools have adapted their curriculum to help prepare students for the team-based environment in which most of them will be employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430806">Pinto, Pinto, &amp; Prescott, 1993</xref>). The adaptation has resulted in business curriculum in which a good deal of work completed by students is the result of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430806">Bolton, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Published research on group assignments consistently highlights their intended consequences in the form of a broad range of benefits to students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311430806">Hansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams, Beard, &amp; Rymer, 1991</xref>). Research also isolates problems that inhibit group effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311430806">Hansen, 2006</xref>) and pedagogical approaches to deal with problems and enhance the effectiveness of group assignments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430806">Gardner &amp; Korth, 1998</xref>). While a few researchers have raised negative outcomes such as disparity in learning because of unequal participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430806">Batra, Walvoord, &amp; Krishnan, 1997</xref>) or specialization of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>), little attention has been directed at formally developing a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which group assignments can and do result in negative or unintended consequences for students.</p>
<p>Such an effect was brought to my attention when a business student who was about to graduate explained that she had never developed her own presentation visuals even though many of her business courses required oral presentations. When asked how that happened, her response was, “Other members of my groups always did it.” This encounter combined with a paucity of research attention given to potential negative consequences of group assignments motivated this study, the purpose of which is to explore the unintended cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences of group assignments experienced by undergraduate business students.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. First, background literature that motivated and guided the inductive research process used is discussed. Then, research methodology is explained, followed by a discussion of results. The article concludes with a discussion of implications and limitations of the study.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0273475311430806">
<title>Published Academic Literature on Group Assignments</title>
<p>Published academic literature on group assignments concentrates primarily on three areas. First, researchers consistently emphasize the intended consequences or benefits of group assignments in the form of enhanced learning and preparation for the world of work. For example, a group assignment is an experiential learning technique that is intended to stimulate active engagement in the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>). Active learning can increase comprehension and retention of information and the development of a number of support skills, including oral and written communication skills, critical reasoning skills, and technical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams et al., 1991</xref>). Group assignments can be more complex, comprehensive, and thus realistic than projects assigned to individual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430806">Goretsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311430806">Henke, 1985</xref>). Realism may increase student interest, motivation, and sense of meaningfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams et al., 1991</xref>) and provide work experiences similar to those they will experience in the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430806">Goretsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311430806">Henke, 1985</xref>). Group projects provide students an opportunity to work collaboratively with a variety of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams et al., 1991</xref>), and by doing so, students can learn by teaching each other and observing the behaviors of “model” students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams et al., 1991</xref>). And, in a collaborative group experience, students can develop a number of essential workplace skills, including interpersonal, social, and group management skills and the ability to assume and be open to ideas and perspectives of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430806">Williams et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The second area of focus has been on isolating problems that inhibit the effectiveness of group assignments, most of which deal with aspects of individual group members, group dynamics and administration, and instruction. Frequently cited problems with individual group members are the social loafers who reduce their effort when part of a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430806">Latane, Williams, &amp; Harkins, 1979</xref>) and the lone wolves who prefer to work alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430806">Barr, Dixon, &amp; Gassenheimer, 2005</xref>). Individual students may also differ on a range of attributes, including employment status, course load, interpersonal skills, and motives, all of which make the basic functioning of groups more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430806">Barr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430806">Buckenmyer, 2000</xref>). Commonly reported group dynamic and administration problems include those that occur at the outset of a project, such as difficulty in developing goals, expectations, and plans, and those that occur during project completion, such as inability to handle conflict and unequal participation of group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430806">Buckenmyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430806">Forman &amp; Katsky, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>). Researchers have also highlighted a number of problems with instruction, including those that arise when assigning students to groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430806">Pfaff &amp; Huddleston, 2003</xref>) and grading the group’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430806">Tu &amp; Lu, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The third main focus deals with how instructional strategies—curriculum and the instructor’s role—can be designed to enhance the effectiveness of group assignments. For example, research indicates that instructors should increase the scope of a group assignment and the interdependency of its parts to motivate the desired collaboration among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430806">Pinto et al., 1993</xref>). Instructors should also clearly define how the team is going to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475311430806">Wood, 2003</xref>), how group members will be individually evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311430806">Tyagi, 2010</xref>), and how peer evaluations, if they are used, will be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475311430806">May, 2008</xref>). During project completion, instructors can enhance the group’s effectiveness by performing the role of a coach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430806">Bolton, 1999</xref>), facilitating techniques to monitor group member performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430806">Dommeyer, 2007</xref>), and functioning like a “real” manager by resolving problems such as social loafing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430806">Dommeyer, 2007</xref>). Researchers have also recommended that instructors engage students in exercises to enhance their abilities to work in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430806">Buckenmyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311430806">Deeter-Schmelz, Kennedy, &amp; Ramsey, 2002</xref>) or that business schools offer a separate course or part of a course that focuses on working in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>A Framework for Analysis of Group Assignments</title>
<p>If students are thought to be consumers of educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475311430806">Watson, 2003</xref>), then consumer behavior frameworks should prove helpful when designing pedagogical strategies and understanding their effects on students. One widely used framework explains that three primary elements for consumer analysis are cognition, affect, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430806">Peter &amp; Olson, 2008</xref>). Cognition refers to mental processes of understanding, evaluating, planning, deciding, and thinking, as well as the thoughts and meanings produced by these processes. Affect deals with feeling responses and includes emotions, specific feelings, moods, and evaluations. Behavior that is overt refers to the actions that are observable and measurable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430806">Peter and Olson (2008)</xref> explain that cognition, affect, and behavior form a reciprocal system in which any one of the elements can act as an antecedent to, or consequence of, any of the other elements. In contrast, some researchers in psychology believe that the generation of affect is always preceded by cognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430806">Izard, Kagan, &amp; Zajonc, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Marketing strategy can be thought of as a set of stimuli (e.g., products, brands, advertisements) that is designed and placed in consumers’ environments to influence their cognition, affect, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430806">Peter &amp; Olson, 2008</xref>). The development of marketing strategies and an understanding of their consequences on consumers must include an analysis of all three elements and the relationships that exist among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430806">Peter &amp; Olson, 2008</xref>). In a very similar way, pedagogical strategies have long been thought of as a set of stimuli placed in students’ environment to influence their cognition, affect, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430806">Thorndike, 1906</xref>). The set of stimuli includes any aspect of the environment that is under the direct and indirect control of an instructor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430806">Thorndike, 1906</xref>), and responses to the set of stimuli have been classified as educational outcomes or “the ways in which individuals are intended to act, think, and feel as the result of participating in some unit of instruction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311430806">Bloom, 1956</xref>, p. 12). Therefore, similar to marketing strategies, the design of pedagogical strategies such as group assignments and a comprehensive understanding of their consequences on students should include an analysis of all three elements and the relationships that exist among them. In effect, the basic stimulus–response model and the extant focus on benefits of group assignments provided the motivation to investigate their unintended consequences and to do so across all three elements of cognition, affect, and behavior.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The discovery-oriented method of grounded theory was used since it provides an appropriate way to pursue a topic that has received scant attention in published academic research. As such, this study relied heavily on methods outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430806">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref> and the approach was consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430806">Goulding (2005)</xref> who explains,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>According to the basic principles of grounded theory, once an area of research has been identified, the researcher should enter the field as soon as possible. Consequently the literature is not exhausted prior to the research, as in many studies, rather it is consulted as part of an iterative, inductive and interactional process of data collection, simultaneous analysis, and emergent interpretation. (p. 296)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A homogeneous sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430806">Patton, 2002</xref>) of 32 subjects was selected from 2 sections of an upper division Marketing Research class taught during consecutive semesters at a university in the Southwestern United States. All subjects were within one semester of graduating with a Bachelor of Science Degree in either Marketing or Management. Each subject had extensive experience working on group assignments and reported that on average, 88% of their business classes included at least one such assignment. The individual student was also the unit of analysis.</p>
<p>Data collection occurred throughout both semesters and combined aspects of the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311430806">Zaltman &amp; Coulter, 1995</xref>) with an in-person semistructured interview. The technique is founded on the premises that most communication is nonverbal and thoughts typically occur as images. To view a person’s mental images, the technique makes use of metaphors. Doing so enables subjects to communicate nonverbally and removes the constraint imposed by questions used in common methods such as surveys and focus groups.</p>
<p>During the first semester of the project, 13 subjects were given about 2 weeks to accumulate images to visually represent what they <italic>think</italic> about group assignments, how they <italic>feel</italic> about group assignments, and the <italic>behaviors</italic> they observe among other students when working on a group assignment. Each subject then participated in an in-person interview that lasted about 60 minutes and was guided by a protocol (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430806">Table A.1</xref> in the Appendix). Opening questions were asked to gather general information including the frequency of group assignments and how subjects formed groups. The main part of the interview consisted of a guided conversation during which subjects told stories about and explained the meaning of their images and relationships among them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0273475311430806">Figure A.1</xref> in the Appendix for an example). To obtain additional details, subjects were asked to explain issues for which they could not find an image, and in order to increase the depth of understanding, subjects were asked probing questions. Closing questions were asked to understand what students <italic>think</italic> and how they <italic>feel</italic> about the extent to which group assignments contribute to their development of skills and course-related knowledge.</p>
<p>The second semester targeted specific aspects of affect and behavior that emerged from the 13 interviews conducted during the first semester. To further investigate affect, 7 subjects were given about 2 weeks to collect images that reflect the emotions they experience as a result of group assignments and the causes of those emotions. To further investigate behaviors, 12 subjects collected images that represent the type of student they would like to have in their group and images that reflect the types of students whom they had worked with in prior groups. Images of desired group members were used to explore how students form groups, and images of types of prior group members were used to clarify the roles students perform as part of a group. Each of these 19 subjects also participated in an in-person interview that lasted about 60 minutes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430806">Table A.1</xref> in the Appendix for protocols). All 32 interviews (13 during the first semester plus 19 during the second semester) were audio recorded and transcribed, which resulted in approximately 400 pages of single-spaced interview data.</p>
<p>Data analysis was an ongoing process of microanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430806">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) in that shortly after each interview its transcription was analyzed line by line to identify relevant and meaningful units of text—words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. Text units that were common in meaning were grouped into categories to represent the main ideas in the data, and each category was given a label. The individually labeled categories of data were further organized into higher level categories that were also each given a label. This coding was first performed for an individual subject, and the results were subsequently integrated with those of other subjects. Memos were routinely written to serve as a record of analytic thoughts, and figures were developed to visually summarize the labeled groups of data and capture relationships among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430806">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0273475311430806">Figure A.2</xref> in the Appendix is the final visual summary of labeled groups of data for students’ behaviors. A similar figure was developed for affect and cognition. The labels and structure that appear in the three summary figures are explained in the Results section.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430806">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) had been reached—that is, the concepts and their dimensions were well developed and no new relevant data were emerging from fieldwork. In addition, to triangulate by researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311430806">Denzin, 1978</xref>), three research assistants were actively involved in analyzing data and they routinely met with the primary investigator to share and discuss interpretations of concepts and their relationships.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are organized into the three primary elements of behavior, cognition, and affect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475311430806">Figure 1</xref> and explained in the following sections, fieldwork suggests that the primary sequence of responses is behavior → cognition → affect → behavior. As such, results are consistent with researchers in psychology who believe that cognition precedes affect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430806">Izard et al., 1984</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0273475311430806">
<title>Behavior</title>
<p>This study was aimed at advancing knowledge of the behavioral consequences of group assignments on undergraduate business students. During fieldwork, four sets of salient behaviors emerged that span the life of a group project. The behaviors are placed under the headings of self-selecting groups, dividing labor, providing labor, and evaluating peers. The ways in which students divide and provide labor seem to be inherent aspects of group assignments that are believed to influence cognition. The ways in which students self-select groups and evaluate their peers are likely shaped by affective consequences, as explained below.</p>
<sec id="section7-0273475311430806">
<title>Self-selecting groups</title>
<p>When given the opportunity to self-select groups, students may simply turn to those who are seated in close proximity. However, one subject explained that doing so is like relying on “fate or luck” and “is a little bit dangerous, especially for a class grade.” Therefore, as students progress in their academic program, they tend to avoid “relying on fate or luck” by forming and activating, when possible, a group-specific social network. One student even touted his ability to do so by stating, “I’ve gotten really good at this group stuff; I’ve been getting into the right teams.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475311430806">
<title>The group assignment network</title>
<p>A social network is defined by a set of individual actors and the nature of relations among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475311430806">Van den Bulte &amp; Wuyts, 2007</xref>). A group assignment network is a set of individual students and the nature of relations among them is characterized by trust and its main precursor—trustworthiness. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430806">Mayer et al. (1995)</xref>, I define trust as the willingness of one student to be vulnerable to the actions of another student, based on the beliefs that the student will perform particular actions—for example, help achieve the grade to which one aspires and do so in an equitable way. Although making oneself vulnerable is risk taking, trust is not the act of taking risk per se. Instead, trust can lead to risk-taking behaviors that are observable and that differ depending on context. In the context of group assignments, the act of one student soliciting another student to be part of a group is an observable risk-taking behavior that indicates trust.</p>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430806">Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995)</xref>, fieldwork strongly indicates that trustworthiness, in the form of one’s student’s beliefs about another student’s ability, benevolence, and integrity, is the main precursor to trust and is thus the key attribute that connects students in a group assignment network. Abilities are the skills, competencies, and characteristics that enable a student to have a positive influence while working on a group assignment. For subjects in this study, the most salient abilities on which beliefs form are general intelligence and support skills, including writing, presentation, technology, and interpersonal communication. Subjects also clearly indicated that they form beliefs about other students on the extent to which they are different from themselves in strengths (discipline-related knowledge or support skills) and possess the ability and willingness to provide different perspectives. For example, one student explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I selected “think different” by Apple. I really like that statement because what I like in group members are people who are very clever and people who can think differently. In projects they can think of different ideas and then our group can stand out from other groups. I’ve had groups that I’ve had that and it has had positive impacts on the group as a whole.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Benevolence is the extent to which a student is believed to want to do good for other students. This dimension of trustworthiness emerged as subjects explained the extent to which they believe others to be “team oriented,” “supportive,” and willing to “help me with my weakness.” Finally, integrity is the belief that a student adheres to a set of values deemed acceptable. Similar to other dimensions of trustworthiness, subjects explained at length their beliefs about other students’ values, including equity, hard work, high-outcome performance (e.g., a high grade), honesty, timeliness, and reliability.</p>

<p>Forming a group assignment network requires developing beliefs about other students’ trustworthiness, and students in this study tend to do so in three basic ways. First, beliefs about trustworthiness develop through direct experience working with other students in formal group assignments or informal class exercises. These prior experiences appear to directly influence all three dimensions of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Second, throughout one’s academic program, beliefs about other students’ trustworthiness form through direct observation of their behaviors. As such, in any given class a student will likely have preestablished beliefs about the trustworthiness of at least some of the other students, and the beliefs will have formed from prior direct observation or work experience. Then, if the need arises to self-select a group, students will likely approach those who are believed to be trustworthy group members and avoid those who are not. If a student is unable to activate the needed number of members from their existing group network, he or she tends to observe behaviors of unfamiliar classmates, form beliefs about their trustworthiness, and avoid or approach the classmate based on those beliefs. As one subject explained, “There might be a couple people [in a class] who I don’t know, but by looking at their behavior I’ll decide whether I want to work with them or not.”</p>
<p>Observing behaviors appears to be directly linked to beliefs about abilities and integrity. Beliefs about abilities form as students observe others’ behaviors, such as “the way that they talk and the words they use” or “how they answer the teacher’s questions; how they respond or what their thinking is.” In addition, subjects explained a range of behaviors that shape beliefs about values. One subject explained that “a [person] reviewing their notes before class starts or reading a textbook” is believed to be “a hardworking student who is motivated and determined to get the project done.”</p>
<p>The third way that beliefs about trustworthiness form is by observing others’ traits, including race, sex, and clothing. Similar to observing others’ behaviors, observing others’ traits influences beliefs about their abilities and integrity. For example, subjects indicated that one’s race and sex are associated with beliefs about their ability to provide different perspectives or ideas, and one’s race is associated with beliefs about their intelligence or areas of strengths. One subject explained that when he does not know other students in a class, he tries to form a group with “a person from an Asian country or from India . . . because I know that he is probably a smart kid and getting smart people on your team is better than getting people that might not know what is going on.” During fieldwork, it also became quite clear that beliefs about others’ trustworthiness are influenced by what they wear. Subjects explained that those who wear eyeglasses are thought to be high in abilities, a belief that was explicitly expressed through images such as one of the GEICO gecko wearing glasses. The subject who selected the image explained, “He’s wearing glasses. He looks intelligent. He looks like he can bring something to the team that no one else can. He’s smart in an area that other people might not be knowledgeable about.” Clothing was quite consistently discussed as a physical cue associated with beliefs about other students’ values. Subjects in this study consistently characterized images of people dressed in business attire and uniforms as desired group members because they are motivated, hardworking, honest, and responsible.</p>

<sec id="section10-0273475311430806">
<title>Dividing labor</title>
<p>Dividing labor is an inevitable aspect of group assignments as students partition their assignment into multiple discrete units of work. Then, individual group members assume or are assigned responsibility for completing one or more units of work and decisions about who is responsible for what are made in several different ways.</p>
<p>Students often assume or assign responsibility for units of work based on the abilities—discipline-related knowledge and support skills—in which a student believes they are most proficient. That is, students discuss their own individual strengths and weaknesses and then group members create assignments such that a member’s strengths fit the skill or knowledge areas needed to complete the task. As one subject explained, “We try to play to people’s strengths. If someone is a better writer they can work on the paper, if someone is an excellent researcher they can take on more of the research, or whatever we feel like they’re best at to maximize their effort and efficiency.”</p>
<p>Units of work can be distributed based on trustworthiness, which, as previously explained, deals with one student’s beliefs about another student’s abilities, benevolence, and integrity. When a group member is believed to be relatively low in trustworthiness, other group members may not be willing to engage in the risk-taking behavior of assigning the individual “important” units of work. Instead, responsibility for those units of work is assumed by those who are believed to be trustworthy or possess the abilities and integrity to do the work well.</p>
<p>Students also assume or assign responsibility for units of work based on interest in either the type or topic of work to be performed. At times students strive to assume responsibility for units of work based on the perceived amount of labor required to complete the task. Finally, there are times when units of work are assigned randomly. Random assignment is used when the units of work cannot be distinguished in terms of basic skills, knowledge, or amount of labor needed to complete the task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0273475311430806">
<title>Providing labor</title>
<p>While working on group assignments, students tend to perform as a distinct group member type, of which five emerged during fieldwork. Inevitably, at least one group member is a leader who performs supplemental tasks needed to accomplish a goal—for example, to produce a final product that earns an “A.” These supplemental activities include coordinating the division of labor, monitoring task completion, and serving as the hub for communication.</p>
<p>Another type of group member is what some subjects referred to as a “hamster.” A hamster is one who follows the leader and provides adequate labor—in terms of quantity and quality—to effectively accomplish the group’s goal. One subject explained that this is the “person who wants to contribute and do a lot of work, but they don’t necessarily want that leadership role so they will just say ‘ok, tell me what to do and I’ll do it.’”</p>
<p>During most group assignments, one student serves as a “closer.” A closer is the group member who brings closure to an assignment by integrating the work of individual group members and refining the final product. Integration is needed to combine discrete units of work that may have been completed autonomously, and refinement is needed to deal with individual units of completed work that differ in quality.</p>
<p>Subjects explained at length many images that reflect a fourth type of group member who creates inequity. What emerged during fieldwork is the understanding that inequity arises when labor that is provided by a team member is compared to that which is expected. The type of group member who is perceived to create inequity is then one whose actual quantity or quality of labor provided falls below the expectations of others.</p>
<p>Inequity is commonly attributed to social loafing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430806">Latane et al., 1979</xref>), which occurs when a student reduces his or her individual effort when part of a group. In this study, social loafers routinely appeared in images that represent what other students do. However, inequity is caused not only by social loafers but also by normal heterogeneity among students. For example, students differ on academic abilities, and a group member whose abilities are relatively low can create the gap between the expectations held by those with high relative academic abilities and their perceptions of performance. Students also differ with respect to grade aspirations and the amount of effort they normally put forth to earn a desired grade. The low relative effort put forth by one group member may be normal for that student. Even though they are not loafing, their effort can create the perceived inequity among group members who aspire to earn a high grade and put forth effort to do so. And, a student’s lifestyle (e.g., employment status and number of hours worked, number of courses or credit hours, or family status) and interest in the subject may also influence the amount or quality of labor provided, which, in turn, can cause perceived inequity.</p>
<p>Finally, the fifth distinct type of group member is one who deals with inequity and does so either reactively or proactively. Basically, when one or more group members actually create inequity, one or more other members commonly provide supplemental labor to reactively deal with it. When one or more group members are perceived as those who will create future inequity, one or more other members may proactively deal with it. That is, if early in a project a student has negative beliefs about another’s trustworthiness, he or she may not grant that student responsibility for a task that can negatively influence the group’s grade. In doing so they proactively assume responsibility for additional tasks to avoid having to deal with inequity after it occurs. From one subject’s perspective, the Allstate logo was used as a metaphor to explain that the group member who strives to deal with inequity proactively is “helpful” and “wants more of the workload because they don’t want other people to mess up their grade.”</p>

<sec id="section12-0273475311430806">
<title>Evaluating peers</title>
<p>Several studies have investigated the use of peer evaluations as a means to judge individual performance and reduce problems such as social loafing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311430806">Y. Chen &amp; Lou, 2004</xref>) and free riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430806">Aggarwal &amp; O’Brien, 2008</xref>) or to enhance satisfaction with and attitudes toward group work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430806">Druskat &amp; Wolff, 1999</xref>). In this study, participants reported that their group assignments often included a peer evaluation. However, a common belief among subjects was succinctly expressed by one individual who said, “It is a peer evaluation but it’s not valid whatsoever.” Students who participated in this study generally think of peer evaluations as “not valid” because they tend to bias their responses in three primary ways.</p>
<p>First, a bias can occur when group members collaboratively agree to rate each other equally even when labor provided was not equal. Such collaboration leads to a positive bias for group members who contributed labor that was relatively low and a negative bias for members who contributed labor that was relative high. As one subject explained, “Honestly, we are agreeing to say we all did the same work, but there is always that one leader who deserves more and is really modest, a team player, and he or she is okay with it.”</p>
<p>Second, as students complete peer evaluations, their attitudes regarding a group member’s performance may differ from what is considered socially acceptable. Peer evaluations can then lead to responses that indicate students’ desire to respond in a socially acceptable way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311430806">May &amp; Gueldenzoph, 2006</xref>). In the context of this study, the socially acceptable behavior is to avoid creating negative emotional consequences for other group members or, as subjects explained, avoid “hurting another’s feeling,” “stepping on people’s shoes,” or “throw[ing] your colleague under the bus.”</p>
<p>Third, peer evaluations can constitute a psychological threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430806">Sherrard, Raafat, &amp; Weaver, 1994</xref>) to students because they are dealing with an issue that can have two primary negative outcomes for them—confrontation with, and negative word-of-mouth that can be spread by, a group member who received low scores. Students may evaluate peers in a way to minimize the threat of such outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section13-0273475311430806">
<title>Cognition</title>
<p>The second main focus of this study was to understand cognitive consequences of group assignments on undergraduate business students. The general conclusion is that the aforementioned student behaviors result in three dominant cognitive associations of autonomy, grade “boost,” and injustice. In addition, this section explains two primary cognitive effects in the form of constraint on, and disparity in, learning.</p>
<sec id="section14-0273475311430806">
<title>Autonomy</title>
<p>A group project has been defined as “a graded assignment requiring students to work collaboratively across multiple class periods and involving some time outside the normal class meeting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430806">Ettington &amp; Camp, 2002</xref>, p. 357). However, the division of labor reduces, and at the extreme eliminates, collaboration across class periods after units of work have been assigned. As a consequence, several participants in this study think of a group project as a number of individual discrete assignments on which they work autonomously. This basic perception was explained by one subject who stated, “I don’t see the projects we are assigned as group projects. They are like individual projects that are related to each other and when they are put together, it becomes a group project.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0273475311430806">
<title>Grade “boost.”</title>
<p>In <italic>An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</italic>, Adam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430806">Smith (1776)</xref> explained how the division of labor and specialization on subtasks leads to greater proficiency and productivity than would be achieved by individuals completing the broad task on their own. In the context of group assignments, students also recognize that assigning tasks based on the strengths of individual group members leads to higher performance on the assignment than if they each completed it individually. They also recognize that higher performance translates to a higher group grade and the “benefit” accrues to most students. This “benefit” of division and specialization of labor was highlighted by one subject who explained, “That’s how school is. You try to figure out the system and try to get an A in the course. If you can’t learn everything from it that’s too bad, but at least you got an A.”</p>
<p>Perceptions about group assignment grades likely depend on the type of group member. For group members who create inequity, a group grade may be thought of as a “boost.” The belief forms when students benefit from a grade that is higher than they would expect on their own individual contribution to the assignment, higher than they typically receive when completing an assignment on their own, or higher than they normally aspire to. The “boost” naturally occurs since those who deal with inequity do so to ensure that the product delivered meets their expectations and will earn the grade to which they aspire. Since inequity is normally dealt with by group members who are relatively high in performance expectations and academic ability, they have a disproportionate influence on the quality of the final product delivered and ultimately the grade assigned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0273475311430806">
<title>Injustice</title>
<p>Subjects in this study commonly associate group assignments with injustice and the belief arises in two ways. First, subjects collected many images that reflect inequity in labor provided and explained how the quantity of labor in particular is often unfair. As one subject explained, “You get angry [and] you kind of wonder why? Why am I the only one doing all the work? You ask is this fair?” Second, a single group grade is often thought of as unfair, and the perception arises when group members who create inequity receive the aforementioned “boost” to their grade or when members who do not create inequity take a “hit” to their grade because of low relative labor provided of others. In the context of this study, the perception is quite common since students’ performance evaluation is always based on a single group grade and, as subjects explained, there are “always” one or more group members who do not “carry their weight.” Students may also think of the group grade as unfair since it results in a loss of individual recognition and a constraint on one’s ability to stand out. For example, “If a group is given a project and a grade for that project, it is really hard for an individual to stand out . . . schools should look at that diversity and realize it and appreciate it; instead we are all put into groups.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0273475311430806">
<title>Constraint on learning</title>
<p>Group assignments are purported to increase active learning and develop each student’s discipline-related knowledge and skills (Skilton, Raafat, &amp; Weaver, 2008). At the same time, group assignments are often intended to provide students an opportunity to develop and receive feedback on support skills such as writing. However, subjects generally associate group assignments with a constraint on their development of both discipline-related knowledge and support skills and the constraint occurs in three main ways.</p>
<p>The division of labor constrains the breadth of content and skills each student applies and the more students there are in a project group the greater the division of labor and the greater the constraint on learning. As one student stated, “I guess all those professors just assume that you learn enough by doing your own section. I’ve never quite understood that thought process.” In addition, assigning or assuming responsibility for tasks based on areas in which students are relatively strong is, in essence, the specialization of labor, which was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al. (1999)</xref>. When students specialize in certain types of labor, they avoid areas in which they are relatively weak and thus miss opportunities to develop in areas where the greatest opportunity for learning exists. Finally, division and specialization of labor constrain the extent to which students learn though feedback. Learning is constrained when students receive a disproportionately high level of feedback on knowledge or skill areas in which they are most proficient and a low level of feedback on those areas in which they are least proficient. When feedback is provided, some students receive limited input on their own individual contributions since the final group output is often refined by a “closer” who completes their work autonomously and may not inform others of changes or corrections made to their part of the project. As one student explained “Yeah, they messed up so I just took it and I fixed it and they don’t know that they messed up.’”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0273475311430806">
<title>Disparity in learning</title>
<p>In academic literature, one of the commonly mentioned benefits of group assignments is that they increase active learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430806">Skilton et al., 2008</xref>). Although students may be actively learning when completing a group assignment, they tend to participate as the same group member type(s) and by doing so they experience disparity in learning. For example, students who possess leadership abilities routinely perform as group leaders and by doing so they further develop their abilities to lead. Students who have strong written communication skills tend to be closers and by doing so they further develop their writing skills. Group members who consistently deal with inequity are, in general, more actively engaged in the learning process and thus learn more than group members who either create inequity or do not deal with it when it does occur. Also, each time a group member is thought of as one who will create future inequity, he or she is at risk for disparity in learning. The fundamental issue is that students who are believed to create future inequity may not be granted the opportunity to actively participate in an assignment at the same level as other group members. As one subject explained, “If we know they won’t do as much work or as good of a job as others, we usually give them a smaller portion. We’ll make him our runner, or the person who prints the paper, or edits the paper if they can; more of an easier role.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0273475311430806">
<title>Affect</title>
<p>The third main focus of this study was to investigate affective consequences of group assignments. Prior research has linked group assignments to positive affective outcomes, such as satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430806">Aggarwal &amp; O’Brien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430806">Druskat &amp; Wolff, 1999</xref>) and positive feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430806">Dommeyer, 2007</xref>). However, subjects in this study collected far more images of negative emotions than positive emotions, and the time spent explaining negative emotions consumed the vast majority of the total time spent explaining how they feel about group assignments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475311430806">Figure 1</xref>, negative emotions appear to be consequences of cognition and, as explained below, can manifest prior to group formation and continue throughout the group experience.</p>
<sec id="section20-0273475311430806">
<title>Anxiety</title>
<p>Group assignments induce anxiety, which is characterized by apprehension and physiological symptoms of tension that may arise in response to the anticipation of future misfortune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430806">VandenBos, 2007</xref>). The anticipation of future misfortune is a cognitive response that may occur at the very outset of a course when students first learn of a required group assignment. For some students, the future misfortune is in the form being teamed with one or more students who will create inequity in labor provided. At the same time, for other students the misfortune is in the form of being teamed with classmates whose expectations are relatively high and having to put fort additional effort to meet those expectations. Subjects also highlighted how anxiety may occur throughout a group assignment in response to the belief that a group member will create future inequity in the quantity or quality of labor he or she provides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0273475311430806">
<title>Frustration</title>
<p>Frustration, the emotion that subjects discussed most extensively, is assumed to result from the act of interfering with or disrupting behavior that is directed toward some goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430806">Sutherland, 1989</xref>). In the context of group assignments, frustration appears to result when the actions or performance of one or more group members disrupts another’s ability to achieve two simple goals: earn the grade to which they aspire and contribute their fair share in doing so. Frustration runs especially high during task completion among group members who deal with inequity and believe they contribute more than their fair share of labor to earn the desired grade. For example, one subject explained, “It’s frustrating. Say that the final grade is an A. I would feel like I got that A but I don’t think that they got the A. They probably did C or B work not necessarily A work. But because I went through and took the extra time to edit, fix their parts, or whatever, everyone gets an A.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0273475311430806">
<title>Stress</title>
<p>Stress is a psychological tension produced by a physical, psychological, or social force that when applied causes some significant modification to the individual to which the force is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430806">VandenBos, 2007</xref>). Results of this study indicate that students experience stress from having to modify their own behavior to cope with the expectations of, or work provided by, others. That is, for some students stress is brought on during task completion by high relative performance expectations of other group members and by striving to increase their own quantity or quality of labor to meet those expectations. For example, “This one group I have right now, they’re actually over Since they are overachievers they are really strivto bust out the A+ work all the time. Sometimes it can be overwhelming trying to keep up with that.” For other students, stress is brought on during task comby group members whose output does not meet expectations and by the tension from having to provide addilabor to deal with such inequity and achieve the perevaluation to which they aspire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0273475311430806">
<title>Disappointment</title>
<p>Group assignments leave some students feeling disappointed, which is defined as a negative affect resulting from perceived performance that is below expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430806">Oliver, 1996</xref>). The most obvious and frequently discussed cause of disappointment is the belief that the labor provided is inequitable, which arises any time group members perceive that the actual labor provided by others does not meet expectations. Although subjects explained several examples of such disappointment, the failure of expectations to manifest occurs in two additional ways.</p>
<p>For some students, disappointment results from the constraint on learning or when the learning that occurred from the group assignment fell below what they believe could have been learned had the assignment been completed individually. Subjects indicated this link through comments such as, “I felt like I missed out by not working on the other sections” or “I haven’t accomplished much just a little section of a project.” Disappointment also arises when performance on the final output is constrained by one or more group members, and the group’s evaluation is lower than what individuals think they earned on their own contributions or lower than they would have earned had the assignment been completed individually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0273475311430806">
<title>Anger</title>
<p>Several subjects explained that group projects induce anger, which is an emotion characterized by tension arising from such sources as frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430806">VandenBos, 2007</xref>). Anger is considered a transitory emotional reaction, is brief in nature, and varies in intensity from mild to distressingly strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430806">Popplestone &amp; McPherson, 1988</xref>). For those who participated in the study, anger arises primarily when one believes that the <italic>quantity</italic> of labor provided is unjust. Anger seems to occur among all group member types who do not create inequity, and the intensity is strongest for those who actually deal with it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0273475311430806">
<title>Relief</title>
<p>The one positive emotional consequence that clearly emerged in this study is relief, which occurs as a response to a threat that has abated, disappeared, or failed to materialize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430806">Sutherland, 1989</xref>). Fieldwork indicates that relief can occur at the very outset of a course when a student, who knows or learns about a required group assignment, sees classmates who are members of his or her group network. The emotion will likely continue if the student is able to actually form a group with others who are in the network. In addition, early in the group project, relief may result from the division of labor and not having to complete an assignment individually. For example, one subject stated, “If I have a good group I feel more relief with the group project because we divide things up.” Students may also feel relief during project completion when other group members perform in a way (e.g., do their fair share and do it well) as to not induce negative emotions. Finally, for a group project during which a student actually does experience negative emotions, relief commonly occurs after submission of the final product (e.g., paper or presentation). The basic issue is that students feel relief when they realize there is no longer the threat of negative emotions they felt while completing the group assignment. For example, one subject explained that after completing group assignments, he is often “relieved and excited there is no more stress and there is no more anxiety. That is relief.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section27-0273475311430806">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>The overarching rationale for using group assignments in undergraduate business courses is that benefits accrue to students. In general, subjects in this study do think of group assignments as beneficial in that they help develop interpersonal skills needed in the “real world” and facilitate the formation of a social network. However, the value of an educational experience is a trade-off between the total benefits received for the total costs incurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311430806">Zeithaml, 1988</xref>). In several ways, this study advances knowledge of the costs of group assignments and the types of students who are incurring these costs.</p>
<p>First, when students self-select their assignment groups, they are, in part, engaging in a process of stereotyping. A stereotype is a set of beliefs about the personal attributes—behaviors and traits—of a social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430806">Stroebe &amp; Insko, 1989</xref>). Stereotypes are used as a default in the absence of other relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311430806">Wilder, 1993</xref>), and they function to justify a person’s behavior in relation to other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311430806">Allport, 1979</xref>). In the context of this study, some students believe that their classmates of a particular race are relatively high in academic abilities and that their classmates who wear businesslike clothes are high in integrity. On the other hand, students who listen to an Ipod before class are categorized as nonstudious and believed to be relatively low in integrity. These, and other, stereotypes are then used by students to justify their behavior while self-selecting groups. The key issue is that some students are avoided because of personal attributes such as race, lifestyle, attire, and personality. Although the use of stereotypes can be eliminated by randomly assigning students to groups, doing so is unpopular with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430806">Connerley &amp; Mael, 2001</xref>) and detracts from the realism that group projects are intended to provide.</p>
<p>Second, relative to individual assignments, all students pay a cognitive price for group assignments in the form of constrained learning. The basic issue was highlighted by one subject who explained, “It [the group assignment] definitely puts a damper on what you can learn.” The “damper” is a direct consequence of dividing labor; it occurs regardless of the way in which units of work are assigned (e.g., abilities, trustworthiness, or interest) or whether the instructor requires that “each group have individually assigned roles (e.g., a designated group leader), with the instructor’s clarification of each individual’s duties and responsibilities within the group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al., 1999</xref>, p. 114). All students are affected since dividing labor simply means that students will actively participate in some learning activities and, at the extreme, completely avoid others. Complete avoidance was the case with the marketing student who, as explained in the beginning of the article, had never developed her presentation visuals because “other members of my groups always did it.”</p>
<p>Third, the extent to which learning is constrained differs among students and those who are relatively low in ability and motivation are likely constrained the most. These students will tend to be thought of as low in trustworthiness and the type of group member who creates inequity in labor provided. They will then tend to be the group members to whom “important” units of work will not be assigned and thus will not be granted the opportunity to engage in learning activities to the same extent as other group members. These students will also be less likely to serve as a group leader and develop their abilities to lead or to serve as the closer and refine their written communication skills. They are also the students who tend to be excluded from group assignment networks of those who are relative high in abilities and will have fewer opportunities to learn from “model” students.</p>
<p>Fourth, relative to individual assignments, group assignments constrain the extent to which students learn through the process of grading. Grading is purported to provide a valid judgment about the quality of a student’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430806">Walvoord &amp; Anderson, 1998</xref>), and the assigned grade is intended to communicate to each student about the quality of their learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430806">Bain, 2004</xref>). However, when a team of students engages in the division and specialization of the labor, the common process of assigning a grade to the output of the team is not a valid way to judge the quality of the student’s work. Even for assignments in which students indicate the aspects of the project for which they were responsible (e.g., section of a report), one cannot be sure that the individual student whose name is attached to the section was solely responsible for the work. Without grades that communicate the quality of each individual student’s learning, students are unable to understand the progress they are making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430806">Bain, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, grades assigned to group assignments are likely, for most students, inflated and inaccurately communicate to students, instructors, prospective employers, and graduate schools about the quality of students’ learning. Grade inflation occurs when students divide labor based on strengths to help ensure that tasks are completed by group members who are relatively strong in the knowledge or skills needed to complete the work. At the same time, grade inflation occurs when students assign labor based on trustworthiness and prevent tasks from being completed by students thought to be relatively weak in the knowledge and skills needed. A similar situation arises when a group member deals with inequity reactively or serves as the closer since those who do so are likely strong in the abilities needed to complete the task. These behaviors are, essentially, specialization of labor, and they all lead to higher performance and thus a higher grade on the final product than individual students could achieve by completed the entire task on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430806">Smith, 1776</xref>).</p>
<p>Grade inflation may also be a group network effect. The argument for such an effect is based on social network theory, which explains that individuals tend to realize benefits by virtue of membership in social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311430806">Portes, 1998</xref>). Benefits accrue to network members since they have access to the resources of other actors in the network. A key point is that the social networks of students will naturally differ in the number and nature of actors (students) and the ties that connect them. As such, students who form a group assignment network composed of many direct ties to others who are high in academic abilities and motivation likely experience greater “benefit” than students whose network consists of few direct ties, or consists of others who are relatively low in ability or motivation.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the key findings that emerged in this study is the extent to which group assignments induce negative emotions for students. Although there was evidence that negative emotions are experienced across a range of students, those who are relatively high in academic ability and motivation likely pay the greatest emotional cost. They are the students who appear to routinely experience a high degree of anxiety due to the threat of being teamed with others who create inequity, and they commonly experience stress, frustration, disappointment, and anger when having to deal with inequity when it does occur. These negative emotional consequences are likely a main antecedent to several aforementioned behaviors. That is, a desire to avoid negative emotions motivates students to form and activate, when possible, a group assignment network; to use stereotypes to categorize unfamiliar classmates as those who are <italic>thought</italic> to be trustworthy and those who are not; to divide labor based on abilities and assign labor based on trustworthiness; and bias their peer evaluations. Emotional consequences should, on their own, give reason to seriously consider the benefit–cost trade-offs of group assignments. The seriousness was raised by one student who explained that he had difficulty remembering the prior semester’s course content but found very interesting how he could vividly explain the “emotional scars” that were left behind by his group assignments. Interestingly, the positive emotion of relief occurs when frustration, disappointment, stress, and anger either fail to materialize or the threat of their occurrence ceases to exist (e.g., on completion of the project). Albeit a positive emotion, relief of this sort is unintended.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This study should give educators reason to reexamine the teamwork-related aspects of undergraduate business education and coordinate relevant curriculum at the department or college level. More specifically, this study highlights the importance of clearly defining the teamwork-related educational outcomes that are intended <italic>and</italic> the potential consequences that are not and to do so across all three aspects of cognition, affect, and behavior. Then, undergraduate business curriculum—for example, a course, parts of courses, learning experiences—should be designed in a way to achieve the consequences that are desired <italic>and</italic> prevent the potential unintended consequences that are not.</p>
<p>A reexamination may motivate the development of a separate course such as the one that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430806">Chen, Donahue, and Klimoski (2004)</xref> designed to teach undergraduate students 14 specific teamwork knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). The 14 KSAs capture 5 KSA dimensions: conflict resolution, collaborative problem solving, communication, goal setting and performance management, and planning and task coordination. Based on the results of this study, a distinct course on teamwork KSAs could also include emotional regulation or control. Emotional regulation is the “processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311430806">Gross, 1998</xref>, p. 275). An ability to regulate or control one’s emotions has been linked to a range of positive outcomes, including job satisfaction and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311430806">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430806">Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Educators should also coordinate teamwork-related curriculum at the department or college level since all business students need to develop teamwork KSAs. At the same time, not all business courses need to include teamwork-related educational outcomes or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430806">McCorkle et al. (1999)</xref> succinctly stated, “Not all marketing classes or subjects should require group projects/assignments” (p. 115). Identifying courses in which teamwork KSAs will be developed through group assignments also means identifying courses in which they will not. Discontinuing group assignments in some courses will likely present a key challenge in itself since the group assignment is deeply embedded in the pedagogical strategies for most instructors. Finally, an instructor who includes teamwork-related outcomes in a course should posses the expertise needed to help students achieve them. As such, the use of a group assignment as a pedagogical tool should be assigned to instructors in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>Since the division and specialization of labor are common aspects of group assignments, there is likely no preventing some unintended consequences, such as constraint on, and disparity in, learning. One possible solution at the course level is to develop hybrid projects that require individual work to help each student achieve the full range of discipline-related outcomes and group work to develop team skills. For example, in a four-credit Marketing Research class, I have developed an approach in which students complete graded aspects of a semester-long project individually and nongraded aspects in groups. Very early in the semester, each student proposes a marketing research project. Most proposals target the company at which the student works or at which they know someone who works (e.g., parent). The class collectively selects the most viable proposals, of which there are typically five to seven, and students then select the project on which they work for the rest of the semester. Students individually complete each graded aspect of the project on which they have decided to work. That is, each student writes a project proposal, conducts qualitative research, develops a survey, analyzes data, writes a complete final report, and develops presentation visuals. Students work in groups to develop a final version of the proposal and survey after their graded submissions are returned. Students then work in groups to administer the final version of the survey and develop one data set that each student working on the project analyzes individually. Students also tend to collaborate in a very constructive way as they help each other during data analysis. The combination of individual and group work has been well received by students and, based on my own survey data collected at the end of the past four semesters, most students believe that they learn more from this approach than they would have had the graded assignments been completed in groups.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>As with any research, this study is not without its limitations, some of which suggest avenues for future research. Specifically, all subjects were seniors and selected from one business school at which students normally commute to campus and work at least half time. Selecting subjects from a sample of business schools comprising different types of student bodies and including students who are at different stages of their business education could extend the findings presented in this study. In addition, subjects were given extra credit for participating. Although the sample was diverse with respect to academic ability as judged by performance in my class, the sample may have been biased toward students who are relatively high in motivation and more likely to perform during group assignments as leaders, hamsters, closers, and those who deal with inequity. Additional insights may have emerged had the sample included subjects known to be relatively low in motivation or the type of group member known to create inequity in labor provided. Finally, this study does not provide the statistical generalizability to a larger population offered by a large-sample quantitative study. As such, future research is needed to formally develop and test the cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences and the interrelationships that exist among them. One pressing need is to investigate the actual effects that group assignments have on specific cognitive learning outcomes. In addition, the ways in which, and extent to which, students use stereotypes while forming group networks, and the benefits that accrue to students by virtue of membership in a group network, are promising topics for future research.</p>
