<p>This article offers a theoretical analysis of the 3D cinema experience, paying particular attention to the paradoxical manner in which a further apparatus, medium, or filter – namely 3D glasses – enables what many viewers perceive as a greater level of realism in the cinematic image. That 3D glasses constitute a further apparatus, medium or filter (with the others being the projector, the screen, and possibly the camera) between the image and the viewer, ultimately will lead to a more abstract discussion of the differences between ‘solid’ and ‘gaseous’ perception. Briefly, ‘solid’ perception involves an inability to see around or through objects, while ‘gaseous’ perception, after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712456254">Gilles Deleuze (1986)</xref>, involves the ability to pass through solid objects as if they were of the same consistency as thin air. The article will then consider the importance of ‘darkness’ in perception itself. My argument will be that darkness, equated here with the extra medium of the 3D glasses, is a key but overlooked aspect of film viewing, something made clear by 3D cinema. Into this argument, I shall include analysis of <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009), which enacts some of the theoretical arguments that I wish to make.</p>

<title>3D glasses</title>
<p>In addition to brief accounts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746847712456254">David Trotter (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746847712456254">Dave Kehr (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847712456254">RM Hayes (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Ray Zone (2007)</xref> have provided thorough histories of stereoscopic imaging, tracing its roots as far back as 1838, when it was ‘discovered’ by British scientist Charles Wheatstone. Although I shall not précis either Hayes’ or Zone’s illuminating work in detail, I should mention that Zone in particular surveys historical attempts to create autostereoscopic images, or stereoscopic images that do not require glasses (or lorgnettes). In particular, he discusses how stereoscopy pioneer Frederic E Ives reportedly patented a system for creating ‘stereoscopic images viewable without any optical device’ in 1903 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 163). Among the many to attempt to realise this patent was Gregg Toland, the cinematographer most famous for his deep focus work on <italic>Citizen Kane</italic> (Orson Welles, 1941) and <italic>The Best Years of Our Lives</italic> (William Wyler, 1946). Toland reportedly achieved autostereoscopic images in 1935, thanks to a camera invented by William Alder, an associate at the California Institute of Technology, and which supposedly made single-strip 3D images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 166). However, although Toland testifies that Alder’s system worked brilliantly during a screening at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, Zone maintains that Toland misconstrued what he saw, insisting that ‘any system dispensing with binocular stereopsis … could not work. That is the single incontrovertible fact at the heart of three-dimensional images’ (p. 166).</p>
<p>In other words, Zone insists that stereoscopic images can only be created by ‘doubling’ the image, such that two views, one mimicking the view from the left eye, the other mimicking the view from the right eye, are presented to the viewer. This presentation can be made in rapid succession, as some 3D pioneers have tried (although only with moderate success), or simultaneously, as is done for the majority of contemporary 3D movies. However, one cannot simply project two separate views onto a single screen simultaneously; the result would typically be a mess were there not a further device to separate the two different views again for the 3D film viewer. As a result, several systems have been developed to separate the two overlapping onscreen images, with the two most common being polarisation and colour separation. Both systems require viewers to wear glasses. In the case of polarised images, viewers wear glasses with filters that only allow similarly polarised light to pass through them, such that one eye views the polarised perspective, while the other views the non-polarised perspective. In the case of colour filters (or anaglyphs), viewers wear filtered glasses (such as the red and green glasses found in cereal packages in the 1980s) that similarly allow only certain frequencies of light to pass through them, such that the left and the right eye receive slightly different perspectives which combine to give the impression of three dimensions. In other words, even though there have been reputed showings of autostereoscopic films, such as Toland’s screening in Los Angeles, or films shown over a period of 18 years at the Moscow Stereokino during the Cold War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 168–169), most commonly 3D film viewing requires the use of some form of 3D glasses.</p>
<p>This is not to say that moving autostereoscopic images do not exist. Nintendo’s 3DS portable device, released in 2011, is a notable example. The 3DS places left- and right-eye images simultaneously on the device’s liquid crystal display (LCD), over which a parallax barrier is placed. Like 3D glasses, the parallax barrier filters left- and right-eye perspectives, such that the LCD appears to the viewer to be showing 3D images. In addition to parallax barriers, autostereoscopes can be created using lenticular arrays, which also separate the image into two displays, one for each eye. Lenticular arrays are similar to the ‘holograms’ (or lenticular images) popular among children, which feature two or more images within one frame, and which become visible to viewers as they move their heads or bodies in relation to the image, often in such a way that the different images give the illusion of movement (Marilyn Monroe blows a kiss, for example). However, with holograms where one must move one’s head or whole body in order to see one image and then the next, with lenticular arrays the distance between the eyes is sufficient for viewers to see both perspectives simultaneously.</p>
<p>Indeed, both parallax barriers and lenticular arrays require the viewer to be seated in a particular position in order to work. For this reason, together with the high cost of replacing the cinema screens and projectors that themselves have only recently been installed for the sake of digital 3D projection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847712456254">D’Alessandro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746847712456254">Tryon, 2009</xref>: 9–10), it seems that for the foreseeable future 3D cinema will be associated with viewers having to wear 3D glasses, the Moscow Stereokino notwithstanding.</p>

<title>Immersion and realism</title>
<p>Immersion and realism are terms often used in tandem in relation to 3D cinema. While I am going to argue that 3D glasses always compromise immersion, we should address the different ways in which 3D cinema is realistic and/or immersive.</p>
<p>In his analysis of expressive style in 3D computer graphic narrative animation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746847712456254">Pat Power (2009</xref>: 113) suggests that there are various levels of what he terms ‘modality cues’ that are simultaneously at work during film viewing:<disp-quote>
<p>In 3D animation, modality cues are generally interpreted through the dominant, common sense, <italic>naturalistic coding orientation</italic>, with high modality aspiring to naturalism. Stylistically, most 3D CG features favour high modality cueing for form (detailed but stylized 3D character models), high modality dialogue soundtracks (high-profile actors) and low modality characterization (e.g. talking tortoises or dancing penguins).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Translated into terms of ‘realism’, we can use Power’s ‘modality cues’ to measure 3D animated films as being realistic or otherwise in at least three different ways: in terms of perceptual realism, in terms of characterisation and in terms of ‘ontological realism’, or the ability of CG elements to interact convincingly with pro-filmic, flesh world elements.</p>
<p>Firstly, 3D CG is often measured in terms of its perceptual realism. With regards to <italic>Avatar</italic>, this can be seen in the film’s predominant setting, Pandora, a highly detailed environment in which both the flora and fauna are deeply textured. The film’s Na’vi characters are perhaps the clearest example of this deep texturing: they were designed not to be realistic, but to be ‘real’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712456254">Duncan, 2010</xref>: 128). That is, these CG characters, whose movements and expressions were also developed using motion and performance capture, were animated even at the level of their muscular structure; they were designed to be not just externally, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746847712456254">Stephen Prince (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746847712456254">2010)</xref> would term perceptually, realistic, but also <italic>internally</italic> realistic. In addition, the voices of these non-human but speaking characters were performed by human players, lending them a further level of realism.</p>
<p>However, while perceptually realistic, a counter-argument might be that the Na’vi have no real world referents (to the best of our knowledge, neither Pandora nor the Na’vi exist in our universe beyond their manifestations in <italic>Avatar</italic>), and so on the level of what Power terms characterisation we might say that <italic>Avatar</italic> has a ‘low modality’, or that the film is unrealistic. Nonetheless, this lack of realistic characterisation is arguably tempered by the fact that <italic>Avatar</italic> is not a uniquely CG film; <italic>Avatar</italic> also features many material pro-filmic elements that exist alongside and interact with the CG elements. These include the human characters who travel to Pandora in search of knowledge and the precious mineral known as unobtainium. In the terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712456254">Thomas Elsaesser and Warren Buckland (2002</xref>: 216), the CG elements of <italic>Avatar</italic> share the same ontological status as the human elements, thereby lending to the film a level of ontological realism that is arguably greater than that of ‘pure’ digital animations, including motion capture films such as <italic>A Christmas Carol</italic> (Robert Zemeckis, 2009) – whether or not those motion capture films feature low modality/unrealistic characters and/or high modality/perceptually realistic 3D environments.</p>
<p>Beyond issues of perceptual realism, characterisation and the shared ontological status of CG and human elements in <italic>Avatar</italic>, 3D cinema is often thought to be realistic as a result of its immersive capacities. In particular, when viewed in large screen formats such as IMAX, 3D imagery works in such a fashion that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone (2007</xref>: 3) explains, ‘there is no awareness of the edge of the motion picture frame. With L[arge] F[ormat] 3D, the stereoscopic imagery floats off the giant screen and into the audience space.’ The spectator’s alleged inability to perceive the edge of the frame leads Zone to conclude that ‘3D images present a heightened realism – a visual allure so powerful that they can easily overwhelm the story and subvert the narrative’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>If Zone here equates ‘realism’ with ‘visual allure’, then the ‘realism’ of 3D CG/live action hybrids such as <italic>Avatar</italic> lies in their ability not only to present a realistic world with believable characters and a realistic storyline, but also in their reputed ability entirely to occupy (or overwhelm?) the viewer’s attention. In other words, realism here is a measure not just of the resemblance of the fictional diegesis to the flesh world occupied by human viewers, or of the psychological depth of the characters in that diegesis, but simply a measure of affect. So large is the image coming out into the auditorium towards us as a result of the 3D that it cannot but occupy both our bodies and minds for the duration of its running time. ‘Immersed’ as we supposedly are, the 3D (and IMAX) movie occupies our entire sensorium; in addition to (perhaps even regardless of) the other, more formal levels of realism described above, then, large format 3D movies – including <italic>Avatar</italic> – are considered realistic because, for their duration, they are all that we can see and hear. Even if we know that we are watching a fiction film, its presence is undeniable and, as such, the film gains a reality status of its own.</p>
<p>That said, we should bear in mind the level of so-called realism <italic>Avatar</italic>’s makers have tried to give to its Pandora setting, especially in terms of how it provides moments of – potentially unrealistic – spectacle that interrupt the otherwise ‘realistic’ flow of the film’s narrative.</p>
<p>If, as mentioned, Zone believes that 3D, like colour and digital special effects, can ‘overwhelm the story and subvert the narrative’, this does not necessarily diminish the ‘reality effect’ of the film. With respect to <italic>Avatar</italic>, and regardless of James Cameron’s professed commitment to foregrounding the story ahead of all other elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847712456254">Freer, 2010</xref>: 72), the film contains many moments of spectacle, including ones in which the viewer is cued to marvel at the technological achievements of the filmmakers rather than simply follow the story. For example, when Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez) fly to the Hallelujah Mountains, we are presented with images of the characters gawping in awe at the floating rock structures (suspended in the air through magnetic forces) before viewers see the mountains for themselves. As a result of seeing the (p)reactions of the characters before seeing the mountains themselves, accompanied by the swelling orchestral score, viewers seem to be cued to find these moments spectacular in much the same way that they are cued to find the brachiosaurs spectacular thanks to the jaw-dropped (p)reactions of Grant (Sam Neill) and Sattler (Laura Dern) in <italic>Jurassic Park</italic> (Steven Spielberg, 1993).</p>
<p>Aside from the schematic nature of this moment (schematic because such moments are common in CG-laden films, as the <italic>Jurassic Park</italic> example makes clear), one could contend that the spectacular revelation of the Hallelujah Mountains undermines the perceptual realism of the 3D CG. This is because the spectacular nature of the images brings the very constructed nature of the Pandoran environment to our attention. In highlighting the constructed nature of these images, such moments of spectacle break not so much our perceptual immersion (the images and sounds dominate our sensorium, as suggested above), but they do break our narrative immersion, in that we are not only forced momentarily to forget the film’s story, but we are also reminded – forcibly – that we are watching a film.</p>
<p>As such, a tension emerges in that the more perceptually realistic, highly detailed and immersive (large format) 3D CG is or becomes, the more it seems to be deployed in a spectacular fashion, with spectacle understood here as compromising the spectator’s immersion in the film’s narrative, precisely because spectacle supposedly interrupts narrative. However, I wish to resolve this seeming contradiction by suggesting that narrative here works ‘alongside’ spectacle because spectacular ‘interruptions’ into the narrative, such as the visit to the Hallelujah Mountains, allow us precisely to view the fine level of detail that has gone into <italic>Avatar</italic>, whose setting might in numerous other films have simply been a painted backdrop consisting of a low level of detail. In other words, if heightened perceptual immersion, during spectacular moments, compromises narrative immersion, by interrupting the narrative, both nonetheless work towards the common goal of immersion, as is perhaps made clear when we consider ‘4D’ versions of the film, featuring moving seats, water and wind effects and smells, as were staged in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1746847712456254">Sunhee, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712456254">1</xref></sup> However, even if <italic>Avatar</italic> works hard always to immerse us on at least one level (perceptually, narratively, or both), I shall argue that this immersion/reality effect is, and never can be, complete, because in order to watch 3D cinema we have to wear 3D glasses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1746847712456254">
<title>Theorizing 3D glasses</title>
<p>While (large format) 3D cinema is surrounded by a discourse of realism and immersion, whereby the image is brought closer to the viewers, I argue that this immersion and realism is dependent upon a technology - 3D glasses - that separates the viewer even further from the image. That is, 3D glasses function as a further apparatus, or medium or filter, above and beyond the screen, the projector, and/or the camera, that do not bring us closer to the image at all, but which instead separate viewers from the image that they see.</p>
<p>In privileging the role that 3D glasses play, I should make clear that I do not wish to overemphasise the visual elements of 3D cinema, in that viewers do not wear ‘3D earphones’ or any other devices that intervene between viewers and the image (by which of course I mean a combination of sound and image). Nor do I wish to be waylaid in (otherwise important) debates about the roles played by the various other apparatuses (screen, projector, camera), even though such a consideration would be useful, particularly in light of the fact that the camera is as often as not virtual (i.e. immaterial) in digital effects movies. Rather, I wish simply to demonstrate that a further medium is required to engender a heightened level of immersion/reality effect. In other words, I refer to a realism brought about by so large and looming a 3D image that viewers cannot look at it in the – questionably – detached manner that various scholars even today maintain is the primary viewing mode; instead, we view films with our whole bodies – or haptically, or synaesthetically, as has been argued with regard to 2D cinema by, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746847712456254">Vivian Sobchack (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746847712456254">Laura U Marks (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847712456254">Jennifer M Barker (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>If 3D glasses do constitute a further medium between film and viewer, and if 3D films involve, as Zone argues, a heightened realism, then this paradox raises questions about issues previously considered core to film studies, particularly in light of CG animations that seek to imitate perceptual realism. A key question is that of indexicality. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712456254">André Bazin (1967)</xref>, cinema’s potential for realism is defined by its indexical relationship to reality as a result of its photographic basis (cinema is evidence of that which was before the camera at the time of the film’s making). Indexicality has received renewed attention in light of digital cinema, which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746847712456254">Philip Rosen (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847712456254">Mary Ann Doane (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746847712456254">Laura Mulvey (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746847712456254">DN Rodowick (2007)</xref> have all pointed out, does not have the same indexical relationship with reality, but which instead is a simulation of reality consisting of 1s and 0s, even if these conform to perceptual realism when output in a video format.</p>
<p>At this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847712456254">Tom Gunning’s (1990)</xref> notion of the cinema of attractions is also useful. In arguing that early cinema was characterised by self-conscious moments of exhibition or display, Gunning implicitly argues that audiences quickly learned, or perhaps always knew, that cinema was not a transparent recording of reality, but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847712456254">Sean Cubitt (2004)</xref> might term it, an <italic>effect</italic>. That is, the narrative cinema that came to displace the cinema of attractions might well have occulted the filmmaking process, such that viewers were supposedly not reminded of the mediated nature of the images before them, but film has nonetheless always been an exhibition or display that has required the viewer’s collusion (or acknowledgement of the apparatus) in order to operate – as the above discussion of spectacle in <italic>Avatar</italic> has already suggested. To this end, Gunning himself has proposed that indexicality alone does not constitute a strong enough argument for the basis of cinematic realism, suggesting instead that ‘the sense of a nearly inexhaustible visual richness’ and ‘the realistic effect of cinematic motion’ are also key factors in determining the image’s realism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847712456254">Gunning, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847712456254">2007</xref>: 41). Applied to <italic>Avatar</italic>, we have already discussed the film’s ‘visual richness’ in that Pandora was designed not to be realistic but to be ‘real’. Meanwhile, motion (κίνημα in Greek) is of course key to the film’s impression of reality, as Pandora itself is so alive with moving objects that it becomes hard to consider the film’s setting as merely a backdrop for the film’s action but rather, in accordance with the film’s ecological message, the setting is itself an active participant in the film’s action, constituting the agential force that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746847712456254">Aylish Wood (2002)</xref> might term a timespace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 3D nature of the film (when viewed as a 3D film) makes the movie even more immersive, even though the 3D glasses further weaken any claims to indexicality that <italic>Avatar</italic> might have. As per Norman McLaren’s highly successful 1951 3D animation made for the Festival of Britain, viewers are consciously aware when watching a 3D film that <italic>Now Is the Time (To Put on Your Glasses</italic>). Indeed, right from William T Crespinal and Jacob Leventhal’s <italic>As You Like It (Not Shakespeare)</italic> in the mid-1920s through to the present day, 3D film viewers are always reminded to ‘put on your glasses’ when viewing a 3D film (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 127). In other words, 3D film viewers are inescapably aware that what they are seeing is a construct – even if the digital animation is perceptually realistic. While the argument in favour of indexicality as a privileged aspect of polyester filmmaking is understandable, 3D cinema, and the overwhelming success and response to <italic>Avatar</italic> in particular, seems to suggest not simply that digital cinema can rival polyester-based film in terms of perceptual realism and in terms of the intensity of affect, but also that even analogue, indexical cinema was always understood as what Gunning might term an attraction, or an effect. In other words, indexicality, a perceived lynchpin of the digital–analogue realism debate, seems to lose force when the immersive and ‘realistic’ aspects of 3D digital animation/live action hybrids, such as <italic>Avatar</italic>, are taken into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746847712456254">
<title>The 3D spectator</title>
<p>Three-dimensional cinema suggests that narrative and spectacle are inextricably intertwined, while the 3D glasses that are a core part of the 3D viewing experience also help to challenge the typical weight given to indexicality as part of the ‘realism debate’. This latter argument merits further consideration.</p>
<p>Lauren Kroiz argues that ‘3D film foregrounds the scopophilic pleasures of cinema, while opposing traditional narrative film’s model of spectatorship which is predicated on viewers’ narcissistic identification with characters in the film’s diegesis’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 84). That is, viewers are supposedly separated from the film such that they view it from a detached position. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746847712456254">Laura Burd Schiavo (2003)</xref>, meanwhile, suggests that the viewing device/3D glasses creates an embodied viewing position, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847712456254">Jonathan Crary (1990)</xref> argues that 3D glasses remind viewers of the ‘composite, synthetic nature of the stereoscopic image’, an argument that might in turn explain why stereoscopic/3D cinema has never really achieved the widest success until perhaps the present ‘wave’ in the late 2000s and early 2010s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone, 2007</xref>: 84). To return to Kroiz:<disp-quote>
<p>By wearing the glasses the viewer, rather than entering into the world of depth that 3D seems to offer, is instead bodily positioned as an observer barred from identification within the spectacle … positioned in filmic space as a spectator, the viewer is unable to enter film as a character, unable to identify with the characters in the narrative.

<p>Were Kroiz’s argument entirely true, when applied to <italic>Avatar</italic> we would expect to read about an alienating film that viewers ultimately found off-putting, rather than the highest-grossing film of all time that attracted audiences to the cinema – and to large format 3D screens – in vast numbers.</p>
<p>As I argued above, the presence of the 3D glasses might well remind us that we are only watching a film, and this might enhance the scopophilic aspects of film viewing: we relish the bright, exaggerated, and other-worldly colours of <italic>Avatar</italic> in a fashion that perhaps is ‘automatic’ from the neurological perspective (for more on the neurological approach to film colour and spectatorship, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847712456254">Brown, 2012</xref>). However, whether or not the film appeals to pleasure systems in the human brain as a result of its colour scheme and/or because of the way in which the film often involves a fast cutting rate of the kind associated with ‘intensified continuity’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847712456254">Bordwell, 2006</xref>: 121–138; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712456254">Brown, 2011</xref>), <italic>Avatar</italic> also seems to have attracted viewers as a result of its narrative, which cues us to experience Pandora as a journey of discovery as a result of Sully’s own immersion into this extraterrestrial environment.</p>
<p>To date, <italic>Avatar</italic> has received multiple interpretations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847712456254">Joshua Clover (2010)</xref> sees the film as ideologically retrograde in its imperial quest to conquer the third dimension, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746847712456254">Robert Hyland (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746847712456254">John Rieder (2011)</xref> respectively see the film as reflecting a cultural imperialist and a male race-revenge narrative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847712456254">Ken Hillis (2009)</xref> reads the film as being about the ‘world soul’, and thus an ecological fantasy, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847712456254">James Der Derian (2010)</xref> interprets <italic>Avatar</italic> as a great anti-war film. As a result of these diverse readings, we can understand why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847712456254">Thomas Elsaesser (2011)</xref> prefers to read <italic>Avatar</italic> as a catch-all, mass appeal blockbuster that is, quite simply, designed to have something for everyone.</p>
<p>In this sense, <italic>Avatar</italic>’s simplicity and familiarity become key elements of its success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746847712456254">Pat Power (2009</xref>: 118) has drawn upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847712456254">Shilo McClean’s (2007)</xref> work on digital cinema to argue that CG features typically revert to ‘formulaic narrative structures such as Joseph Campbell’s a hero’s journey in a fairytale setting’. However, this very lack of originality might in fact be part of the reason for the film’s success, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746847712456254">Rieder (2011</xref>: 48) implies when he argues that<disp-quote>
<p>the stupendous commercial success of <italic>Avatar</italic> may have been achieved in spite of its ideologically retrograde character, as many of its early reviewers seemed to think, but it seems more likely that its revivification of old-fashioned, reassuring exoticism is one of the principal reasons for its popularity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Original or otherwise, the film has induced great feelings of euphoria and even depression in viewers, who find the world of Pandora stunningly beautiful and yet feel sad that the real world does not match Cameron’s invention in its beauty (for a brief journalistic account, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746847712456254">Piazza, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746847712456254">Matthew A Holtmeier (2010)</xref> sees such reactions as being founded upon audience identification with the Na’vi. In other words, contrary to Kroiz and Zone, the 3D imagery does not place viewers in an alienating position; instead, the film invites viewers to identify with Sully, who in turn identifies with the Na’vi and comes to want to protect their way of life.</p>
<p>In a fashion that surely many viewers of the film recognise, Sully functions as a surrogate viewer within the diegetic world of <italic>Avatar</italic>. Having been crippled during his military service in Venezuela, Sully replaces his now-dead brother on a mission to Pandora to study the Na’vi thanks to the avatar technology that allows him – and other humans – to occupy what seems to be the body of one of the indigenous species (they are in fact synthetic Na’vi bodies, not real ones). This in turn allows Sully and the other human avatar controllers to survive in Pandora’s otherwise uninhabitable atmosphere. As a first-timer and outsider to the avatar program, Sully (with some help from Spellman, who is also a Pandora virgin, albeit a more informed, geeky one) cues viewers regarding how to make sense of the world that he sees, as is made clear by the (p)reactions to the Hallelujah Mountains discussed above. However, Sully also implicitly cues viewers regarding how to respond to the 3D viewing experience. Immersed as he is in a Na’vi body – one that allows him free rein to roam Pandora, regardless of its dangers – Sully becomes like the ‘immersed’ 3D film viewer: both Sully and the viewer have the impression of supreme mobility (Sully through his Na’vi-seeming body, and the viewers through Cameron’s relentlessly moving – and often virtual – camera), while in fact being practically static (Sully in an enclosed womb-like avatar-controlling bed; the audience members in their auditorium seats). While Sully’s entry into and success within the Na’vi environment might be fantastic, and perhaps even ‘racist’ or ‘imperialist’ (in that the white human turns up on Pandora and not only enters into the Na’vi way of life, but also ends up being the best Na’vi warrior ever), it does function, then, to cue viewers for <italic>Avatar</italic>’s 3D cinema experience.</p>
<p>In this way, we once again see that identification is key to the success of this strategy, albeit here with Sully, who in turn comes to identify (however condescendingly) with the Na’vi. As Rieder argues, identification and absorption are perhaps too maligned as negative aspects of the cinematic experience, designed as they supposedly are to make the viewer unaware of the ideological positioning and messages that the film contains. While personally I tend to share this view, and while I also happen to believe that humans do not know how to look at their own planet if they feel that Pandora is more beautiful than Earth, the fact that <italic>Avatar</italic> has had such a strong effect on so many viewers worldwide proves the near-universal success of this ‘cueing’ strategy, no matter how ‘retrograde’ it might be.</p>
<p>In addition to Sully’s positioning as an ersatz 3D film viewer, together with the usual exhortation at the start of the film for viewers to don their 3D glasses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847712456254">Sean Cubitt (2010)</xref> has also pointed out how <italic>Avatar</italic> cues viewers through other formal strategies, such as the way in which the film’s images are layered:<disp-quote>
<p>Despite enormous technical achievements … [<italic>Avatar</italic>] has to train its audience against one of the pleasures of the modern blockbuster spectacle: the opportunity to let your eyes roam over the whole of the screen. Here we see the inverse of the monarchical seat in the baroque theatre: everyone occupies the perfect seat, but they must occupy it precisely as defined by the film’s optical system, or suffer the consequent eyestrain. In <italic>Avatar</italic>, the layers, intended to stack up as a believable world, introduce schisms between foregrounds and backgrounds. <italic>Avatar</italic> handles this by training viewers to watch ‘correctly’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As much is confirmed when the film’s cinematographer, Mauro Fiore, says that the cameras used for <italic>Avatar</italic> made it<disp-quote>
<p>difficult to throw things out of focus and help guide the audience’s eye. Shallow depth-of-field is an interesting dilemma in 3D, because you need to see the depth to lend objects a dimensionality, but if you have too much depth-of-field and too much detail in the background, your eye wanders all over the screen, and you’re not sure what to look at. I had to find new ways to direct the audience’s eye to the right part of the frame, and we accomplished that through lighting and set dressing. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847712456254">Holben, 2010</xref>: 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, the makers of <italic>Avatar</italic> did not want their viewers to be able to choose what to behold, preferring instead to make them view what the filmmakers deemed was the ‘right’ part of the frame. If Cubitt seemingly finds this ‘training’ of the audience a negative experience, in the light of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s success it nonetheless points to the manner in which cues – devices that deliberately attract our attention to a certain portion of the screen – can paradoxically help to maintain a sense of immersion and realism.</p>

<title>Seeing solid</title>
<p>Fiore continues by saying that<disp-quote>
<p>anytime you’re in a position where one lens is obstructed by an object and the other isn’t – say, when you’re shooting over someone’s shoulder or through a doorway – you get into a situation your eyes can’t comfortably handle in 3D. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847712456254">Holben, 2010</xref>: 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While on the whole Fiore manages to avoid such pitfalls, <italic>Avatar</italic> is not without moments of jarring 3D. For example, there is an early scene in which Sully is awakened from cryogenically frozen interplanetary sleep. A bed bunk juts jarringly out of the frame and into the auditorium in 3D as beyond it Sully raises himself. Speaking from personal experience, the viewer wants to look <italic>around</italic> the jutting corner of the bed bunk, but cannot. Furthermore, even though it is ‘closest’ to the eye (and jutting out into the auditorium), the fact that the corner of the bed bunk is out of focus also distracts the viewer. Were the bunk really that close, the viewer should be able to inspect it in focus, but cannot. In other words, viewers are on occasion powerfully reminded that the constructed 3D imagery of <italic>Avatar</italic> is just that, precisely because the film feels obliged to ‘cue’ viewers regarding where to look, as opposed to allowing them to choose.</p>
<p>That, in spite of the above objection, many viewers find <italic>Avatar</italic> realistic thanks in part to Sully’s functioning as a surrogate viewer arguably points to the ‘crippled’ nature of many film viewers, who cannot see ‘for themselves’, but who instead must be ‘trained’ in order to ‘see’ (‘I see you’ and a concomitant emphasis on visuality being one of the film’s most frequent refrains). That our vision is ‘crippled’ as opposed to enabled is made clear by the jarring bed bunk described above: what is closest to us should be easy to see in focus, and yet the viewer cannot achieve it. Furthermore, the viewer’s inability to see ‘around’ foreground objects that fill only part of the screen further reinforces the sense that 3D cinema currently is dominated by a linear, single-point perspective, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746847712456254">Power (2009</xref>: 120) has argued.</p>
<p>Here we reach an important distinction – blurred until now – between stereoscopy and 3D. Stereoscopy is understood as viewing objects through two separate lenses, or eyes in the case of humans. As RM Hayes reminds us, most humans can see in three dimensions up to a distance of 6 feet, but they very quickly lose this ability at greater distances. Even though their vision technically remains stereoscopic (they use two eyes), at 50 feet, humans have ‘extremely limited dimensional vision and after a hundred feet or so, literally none at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847712456254">Hayes, 1989</xref>: xiv). If Hayes distinguishes stereoscopy from 3D, in that our vision is always stereoscopic even if we cannot see three dimensions, I would like to make a further distinction between the two, based on notions of solidity and gaseousness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456254">Zone (2007</xref>: 5) explains, the term stereoscopic comes from the Greek στϵρϵός (solid) and σκoπέω (to see), meaning that stereoscopic vision is to ‘see solid’. It is the stereoscopic, or solid, nature of the bunk bed described above (we cannot see around it because it is ‘in our faces’) that disrupts immersive viewing. Rather than offering ‘solidity’, then, <italic>Avatar</italic> (and 3D cinema more generally) is most immersive/least disruptive when it allows viewers to experience the film world in a 3D, or ‘gaseous’, fashion.</p>
<p>Gilles Deleuze describes the camera of Dziga Vertov and 1960s American experimental cinema as ‘gaseous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712456254">Deleuze, 1986</xref>: 83–88). For Deleuze, cinema becomes gaseous when it escapes human perception and abandons its otherwise all-pervasive anthropocentrism. As I have argued elsewhere, digital cinema is at times posthuman (and ‘monstrous’) in its ability to pass through walls and other solid objects, including humans, as if they were as full or as empty as thin air (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847712456254">Brown, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712456254">2009b</xref>). That is, I have sketched out how digital cinema offers a non-anthropocentric perspective through its use of ‘impossible’ but continuous (virtual) camera movements that treat the subjects of the film as though they were as ‘gaseous’ as the air that surrounds them. I would extend this argument here to suggest that 3D cinema is least disruptive and most immersive when it offers us ‘impossible’ (and therefore ‘unrealistic’) perspectives that are not overtly ‘solid’ (as happens when we cannot see ‘around’ objects), but which instead are ‘gaseous’ – with humans featuring as part of the image, but not necessarily a, or the, privileged part. While <italic>Avatar</italic> contains jarring moments, <italic>Avatar</italic> still has ‘posthuman’ or ‘gaseous’ elements. Indeed, although <italic>Avatar</italic> forces the viewer to focus on the human/ humanoid-Na’vi elements, its story is still one concerning de-anthropocentrisation and the eventual becoming-Na’vi/non-human of its otherwise human ‘hero’.</p>
<p>In other words, <italic>Avatar</italic>’s ‘weakest’ 3D moments are not only those in which the image is more stereoscopic/solid/human than 3D/gaseous/posthuman, but these ‘weakest’ moments expose the film’s seeming ideology. They force viewers to look at certain parts of the screen, rather than allowing them to choose where to look – a technique linked, as explained, to the film’s ‘imperial’ ideology, in spite of its ability to influence the ecological thinking of its audiences.</p>

<sec id="section6-1746847712456254">
<title>3D digital darkness</title>
<p>I have argued that 3D cinema paradoxically involves an extra apparatus, or medium, or filter, between image and viewer, but that this paradox is the basis for a greater level of realism, when understood as immersive affect, in the cinema. This in turn undermines the argument that indexicality is the major source of ‘power’ in the (analogue) cinematic image, while at the same time suggesting the importance of spectacle in our understanding of realism.</p>
<p>The 3D spectator may be cued in <italic>Avatar</italic>, but I have also argued that, in tension with some of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s execution even if in line with its ecological ‘message’, 3D might work ‘best’ when democratic, non-anthropocentric, and ‘gaseous’ – that is when it aims to be 3D as opposed to ‘solid’, or ‘stereoscopic’ in the anthropocentric sense suggested here.</p>
<p>I should like to end this article, however, by moving in a new direction. The 3D glasses that viewers wear enable the ‘decoding’ or arrangement of what is otherwise a ‘messy’ image on the screen (messy because there are two, overlapping images). In other words, the 3D glasses allow us to ‘see clearly’. However, these glasses also – as mentioned – paradoxically take us ‘away’ from what we are seeing, since they act as a filter, medium, or apparatus, between the viewer and the image itself.</p>
<p>Most studies of human vision emphasise light and its central role in allowing us to see objects. According to physiologists, the human eye undergoes involuntary movements that are known as saccades; each saccade is followed by a fixation, during which we see, while during the saccade itself, humans cannot see (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746847712456254">Lotto and Purves, 2003</xref>). What is more, the human eye requires moisture in order to function properly, hence the human need to blink. Finally, too much light can of course blind humans. In other words, although overlooked, moments of metaphorical (saccades) and literal (blinking) darkness are integral to human vision.</p>
<p>In physics, light is, after Einstein, traditionally thought of as the limit of speed. Nothing can travel faster than light, which is therefore the measure of all movement – even though Einstein himself had trouble fathoming the ‘spooky action at a distance’ that enables separate photons to be similarly polarised despite the fact that, in order for such instantaneous communication between particles to be possible, information would have to travel faster than light (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746847712456254">Zeilinger, 2003</xref>: 34–43). While the possibility of faster than light travel and faster than light particles (or tachyons) remains purely theoretical, it can function as a metaphor here to suggest that not only does vision depend on ‘darkness’, but that the universe itself might yet be underpinned by a ‘darkness’ that exists ‘before’ light. That is, if we were to conceptualise tachyons, we would have to consider them as existing before light, and that, once light particles are ‘made present’, these tachyons not only recede away from human observers, but there is an ever-thinner (though never wholly disappeared) ‘layer’ of ‘darkness’ between light and human observers. This layer may even be a ‘medium’ as defined here. That is, like the glasses that we don to see 3D movies, darkness might be understood as the key to human vision, and perhaps even of cognition. Without this ‘darkness’, the world would just be a messy image, like the 3D film image viewed ‘raw’.</p>
<p>Although I offer this only tentatively, 3D film viewing could prove to serve, with its ‘extra’ apparatus/medium/filter, as a metaphor for human vision (we blink and look away in order to see) and perhaps also of the universe (tachyons underpin all light). As tachyons, if proven, would revolutionise physics, so might considerations of darkness trouble film studies. Perhaps 3D, hand-in-hand with CG animation, heralds not just the much-hypothesised ‘end of cinema’, but the beginning of exciting new times for film and film theory.</p>
