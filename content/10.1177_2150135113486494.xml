<p>We read with interest the article by El Tantawy et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135113486494">1</xref>
</sup> on “Diaphragmatic nerve palsy after cardiac surgery in children in Egypt: outcome and debate in management.” We are in full agreement with the authors that the occurrence of diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) significantly increases the morbidity in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart defects. Of special interest is the patient with a structurally or functionally univentricular heart. The impact of DP on patients undergoing univentricular palliation cannot be overemphasized. The integrity and function of the univentricular circuit is dependent on an intact respiratory mechanism that includes optimal function of the chest wall and its muscles, diaphragm, and other supporting physiological determinants, and any impairment in any of these leads to suboptimal performance of the univentricular circuit, which may manifest as raised systemic venous pressures, pleural effusions, and even ascites. In fact, there have been reports of failure of the Fontan circuit, where even a takedown of the Fontan operation has been contemplated because DP has not been initially suspected as the causative mechanism. Once DP was recognized and managed with a diaphragmatic plication, the normal hemodynamics of the Fontan circulation were restored, with dramatic improvement in the clinical presentation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135113486494">2</xref>
</sup> In their report, El Tantawy and associates state that they encountered three cases of DP after Glenn superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and one after a Fontan operation. One of the patients in the Glenn group died (cause not known) and one survived after a diaphragmatic plication procedure on the eighth postoperative day. What is however surprising is that, one patient with the Fontan operation survived with apparently adequate Fontan hemodynamics. We feel that instead of a paralysis of the diaphragm, this patient may have had a transient phrenic nerve paresis that may have spontaneously recovered, as it is quite unlikely for a patient undergoing a Fontan operation to have normal Fontan hemodynamics after a complete phrenic nerve paralysis.</p>
<p>The authors have opted to undertake diaphragmatic plication via a bilateral thoracotomy in patients with bilateral DP in two different settings. In our limited experience,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135113486494">3</xref>
</sup> it is often advantageous to perform this procedure in a single sitting via the transabdominal route. Not only does this avoid a bilateral thoracotomy but it also corrects the problem at a single operation on both sides and saves many days of interval between two surgeries. Via a bilateral subcostal incision or less frequently an upper abdominal midline incision, the liver and spleen are freed of their attachments to the diaphragm and retracted downward, after which the diaphragm is plicated in the usual manner. This approach does however entail retraction of a congested liver and spleen in patients after the Fontan operation, but it has the advantage that visualization of the diaphragm is excellent from the abdominal route, and it avoids accidental suture bites and potential bleeding from the liver and spleen, which could occur from a thoracotomy. Also, because of avoidance of two thoracotomy incisions, postoperative pain may be less with normal respiratory excursions that may improve the respiratory dyna-mics and favorably impact patients undergoing univentricular palliation. However, this approach may necessitate the support of our pediatric surgery colleagues who are more familiar with this approach, but the technique is easily learned and is reproducible. </p>
