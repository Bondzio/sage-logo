<abstract>
<p>For waste from electric and electronic equipment, the WEEE Directive stipulates the separate collection of electric and electronic waste. As to new electric and electronic devices, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive bans the use of certain chemicals dangerous for man and environment. From the implementation of the WEEE directive, many unsolved problems have been documented: poor collection success, emission of dangerous substances during collection and recycling, irretrievable loss of valuable metals among others. As to RoHS, data from the literature show a satisfying success. The problems identified in the process can be reduced to some basic dilemmas at the borders between waste management, product policy and chemical safety. The objectives of the WEEE Directive and the specific targets for use and recycling of appliances are not consistent. There is no focus on scarce resources. Extended producer responsibility is not sufficient to guarantee sustainable waste management. Waste management reaches its limits due to problems of implementation but also due to physical laws. A holistic approach is necessary looking at all branch points and sinks in the stream of used products and waste from electric and electronic equipment. This may be done with respect to the general rules for sustainable management of material streams covering the three dimensions of sustainable policy. The relationships between the players in the field of electric and electronic devices have to be taken into account. Most of the problems identified in the implementation process will not be solved by the current amendment of the WEEE Directive.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the last 20 years, the need for resource conservation and resource recovery has become an important issue on the agenda of international policy, AGENDA 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X12448521">UN, 1992</xref>). As can be seen from daily newspapers, only a few steps have been made to reduce the enormous problems the world is faced with. The most important one up to now is the Kyoto protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12448521">UNFCCC, 1997</xref>) with the aim of protecting the atmosphere as a sink for greenhouse gases, thus also reducing the amount of fossil energy used. Increasing amounts of non-renewable resources may lead to regional or worldwide scarcities already indicated by a steep increase in the prices for some specific resources. This is especially true for some rare metals. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12448521">Table 1</xref>, the concentration of some metals in the Earth’s crust, the development of their use and future demands are presented. These elements enhance energy efficiency for industrial purposes or serve as inevitable compounds for renewable energy production. Therefore, they may be looked at as components in ‘sustainable products’ being of high importance for future sustainable development. As may be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12448521">Table 1</xref>, many of these elements have never been used in industrial scale before the last decades of the twentieth century. Now, the demand is rising rapidly for industrial use, especially for private consumption mostly in electric and electronic devices as well as for the ‘sustainable products’ mentioned above. These metals are either found in extremely low concentrations in minerals or are mixed up with other elements with similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, separation processes are difficult and energy consuming. In particular, rare earth metals and the elements of the platinum group (PGM – platinum group metals) are only mined in few areas in the world. Therefore, the supplies of these elements are endangered by technical, economical and political obstacles.</p>

<p>The race for storage sites of valuable metals is picking up speed. One prominent example is the trouble about China’s export restriction for rare earth metals: ‘Like oil and gas, the demand for minerals, especially high-tech metals, has also increased significantly in recent years, while supply has lagged behind. The projected rise in demand, especially among emerging markets, will strain supply given the investments and technology required to extract these resources. This is especially true for high tech metals such as rare earth elements, which require extensive investments in exploration and mining before they can be extracted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X12448521">HCSS, 2010</xref>). The European Commission started strategic work on resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12448521">EC, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12448521">2011a</xref>) focusing on:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a globally free market for non renewable resources,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>more extraction of minerals in Europe,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>higher efficiency in the use of resources and recycling.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With the last hyphen waste management comes into business. Many discussions about future municipal waste policy are pursued under the heading ‘waste is a resource’. The Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12448521">EC, 2011b</xref>) ‘sets as long-term goal for the EU to become a recycling society that seeks to avoid waste and uses waste as a resource’.</p>
<p>As to waste management, there are high expectations of politicians with regard to the recycling of valuable goods. The successful collection and recycling of used glass, paper, cardboard and – partially – also of plastics in some member states is looked at as a yardstick also for the recovery of metals from waste. With respect to the European waste hierarchy as documented in Art. 4 of the Waste Framework Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12448521">EC, 2008</xref>), national legislators and authorities being responsible for waste management are urged to recycle waste, if waste prevention or preparing waste for re-use is not possible. In the special case of waste from electric and electronic equipment, the WEEE directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448521">EC, 2002a</xref>) stipulates:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the separate collection of electric and electronic waste of at least 4 kg per inhabitant per year,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the recovery and the following reuse or recycling of a certain amount of the separately collected items depending on the type of the waste.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As the European Community expects waste management and recycling to contribute significantly to resource recovery, we should look for the present situation. As to metals, a snapshot is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12448521">Table 2</xref>, just focusing the recuperation of some prominent metals from waste as compared to the consumption of these metals in Europe and the potential amount of scrap metal to be disposed.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12448521">Table 2</xref>, the recycling rates for non ferrous metals are relatively low as compared to iron and steel. The amount of secondary resources substituting primary resources is not more than 50% even in the case of iron and steel. This is not only due to losses in the waste management process, but also an outcome of the increasing demand for some metals as compared to the amount of scrap available. The recycling rates for most other metals are far below 50%, very often in the range of 1% or less, e.g. for Li, Sc, Ge, Ga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X12448521">Graedel et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Those metals are used for very specific purposes in electronic devices, i.e.:</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>gold and palladium in circuit boards,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>indium in liquid crystal display (LCD) screens,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>silver in circuit boards and radio-frequency identification (RFID) antennas.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>None of these metals is now mined in Europe. The same is true for lithium, gallium, tellurium, germanium, ruthenium, all of those classified as strategic metals for present and future technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12448521">Buchert et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the recovery of metals used in electric and electronic equipment could be an important tool to decrease Europe’s dependence on import of rare metals from abroad.</p>
<p>From technical reasons, numerous compounds are used in electric and electronic equipment partially now classified to be hazardous, e.g. chromate, lead and cadmium. For safety reasons, electronic appliances are equipped with flame retardants. Plastic casings of electronic devices contain up to 15% flame retardants by weight. Many of the substances used was found to be accumulative in man and the environment (polybrominated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenylethers), some congeners out of these groups being also toxic. With respect to consumer protection, the substitution of hazardous substances by less critical compounds in widely used items like electric and electronic products is an important issue. Within the scope of producer responsibility, critical compounds are often substituted by manufacturers. The general restriction of hazardous substances (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electric and Electronic Equipment, RoHS directive) in these items has been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12448521">EC, 2002b</xref>) parallel to the WEEE regulation coming into force in 2005.</p>
<p>In this publication, the results of the WEEE and RoHS framework with respect to resource recovery and detoxification of items are presented, based on data from the literature and on experiences collected in daily waste management. The problems in the waste chain will be identified using mainly experiences from Germany. There are some special regulations in Germany which differ from the implementation in other member states, but the general consequences are assessed to be very similar all over Europe.</p>

<title>Amount of WEEE collected in Europe</title>
<p>The WEEE Directive urges the member states to collect 4 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> of used electric and electronic equipmemt. There are 10 categories of electric and electronic appliances covered by the directive. According to German law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12448521">Deutscher Bundestag, 2005</xref>), the following categories of used items have to be kept separately for recycling:</p>
<list id="list4-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>large household appliances,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>refrigerators,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>IT and telecommunications as well as consumer equipment,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>display screens,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>gas discharge tubes,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>small household appliances, electric toys.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The producers and importers have to pay for the recycling or reuse of the devices proportional to their actual share on the market. For the overall recycling efficiency, targets in the range between 37.5 and 80% (product of recovery rate and recycling rate) have to be met depending on the category in question. In the member states, different systems have been established:</p>
<list id="list5-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>with respect to the responsibility of the parties (e.g. producers, distributors, communities),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>with respect to the type of collection systems,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>with respect to requirements for recycling facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12448521">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The amount of used electric and electronic devices collected separately in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12448521">EUROSTAT, 2010</xref>; figures for Italy see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12448521">Centro da coordinamento 2009</xref>) differs widely in Europe as may be taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12448521">Table 3</xref>. The amount of electric and electronic equipment sold correlates with the GDP as has been demonstrated by Huisman in an empirical investigation of figures from some European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12448521">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X12448521">Huisman, 2010</xref>). The amount of electric and electronic equipment in some member states has been calculated using the regression formula cited above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X12448521">Huisman, 2010</xref>). It may be taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12448521">Table 3</xref> that the relationship between the assessed amount of WEEE available and the amount actually collected is between 1 : 10 and 1 : 2 with the exception of Bulgaria, where the amount of collected waste exceeds the expectations. The enormous differences in the collection of electronic scrap are partially due to different inventories of devices used in European households depending on their incomes.</p>

<p>Even with respect to the different economic situations in the member states, the overall result is not satisfying. As to the actual amendment of the WEEE, several new targets are under discussion, i.e. a 65% relation between electric and electronic equipment yearly sold and electric and electronic waste yearly collected with respect to the data from national markets. The reasons for the poor results are analysed in the next chapter taking the German situation as an example.</p>

<p>If electric or electronic devices come to their end of life, the owners of the items not longer used are at the beginning of the waste chain. The waste chain ends up with the reuse of appliances or the use of secondary raw materials in the production chain. Waste with hazardous materials has to be safely disposed. The German regulation urges the waste owners to keep WEEE separately from normal waste. The communities are responsible for the collection of WEEE from households which are transported to special storage areas. Consumers are allowed to give used electric and electronic equipment back to the retailers, who are obliged to take back the appliances free of charge. Producers and importers are responsible for the transport of WEEE from the storage areas to recycling facilities. They are also responsible for recovery and recycling of WEEE according to the goals published in the WEEE Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448521">EC, 2002a</xref>). In many Member States, the producers are also responsible for the collection of e-waste. For a detailed description of the different implementations of the WEEE Directive the reader is referred to the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12448521">Cahill et al. (2011)</xref>. In Germany, EAR (Elektronik Altgeräte Register), a non-profit company is acting as an official body for the registration of devices brought on the market. EAR is also responsible for the transport of e-waste from the urban collection sites and for the recycling of used devices. EAR has no own transport or sorting capacities; so, waste management companies are commissioned for transport, sorting, and recycling. As to German law, the communities pay for the collection and storage of e-waste. On the other hand, they may reclaim one or more categories of e-scrap as defined in the WEEE Directive. In this case, the community is responsible for the fate of the complete scrap of the reclaimed group of appliances. This regulation which is not common in most other member states was introduced to protect workshops of disabled people being active in the manual destruction of electronic devices since years.</p>
<p>The stream of electric and electronic devices after use is presented in a schematic flow chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12448521">Figure 1</xref>). At every branch, decisions concerning the further fate of e-waste have to be made. There are numerous problematic interfaces between participants or processes which are assigned by flashes. These interfaces are discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hibernating e-scrap</italic>: the users are the first decision makers in the waste chain. Many devices ‘hibernate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734242X12448521">Kapur and Graedel, 2006</xref>) in households although they are no longer in use. According to a recent assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X12448521">Janz and Bilitewski, 2009a</xref>), 350 000 Mg useless electric and electronic devices are stored in German households. About 500 million (Mio) mobile phones are stockpiled in households in the USA; assessments for Australia and Switzerland are in the range of 14–16 and 8 Mio, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12448521">Beigl et al., 2010</xref>). About 100 Mio mobile phones ‘hibernating’ in German cupboards include 2.4 Mg gold, 25 Mg silver, 900 Mg copper, 0.9 Mg palladium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X12448521">Hagelüken, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>E-scrap going to the waste bin</italic>: consumers are expected to separate these items from the normal waste. From the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12448521">Table 3</xref>, it may be taken that about two-thirds of e-scrap cannot be collected separately up to now. In particular, small appliances are found in the waste bins. Waste from electric and electronic equipment may contribute more than 1% to the amount of residual waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734242X12448521">Janz and Bilitewski, 2009b</xref>). If waste is going to landfill, all reusable items are lost. Heavy metals in printed circuit boards seem to be relatively stable with respect to leaching as has been demonstrated in lysimeter experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X12448521">Rotter et al., 2011a</xref>). It is not clear, how dangerous organic compounds used as flame inhibitors or stabilizers in plastic materials will behave in landfills. In the case of mechanical and biological treatment of residual waste, large appliances can be separated by a mechanical step, whereas small items such as button batteries could contaminate the compost. All organic compounds will only be safely disposed of in the case of incineration. Heavy metals will be concentrated either in the fly ash or in the bottom ash depending on their individual partition coefficient. In Germany, fly ash is disposed of in former salt mines; in other European countries, fly ash is mixed with concrete for stabilization before reuse or landfilled or dumped in former lime pits together with other waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734242X12448521">ISWA, 2008</xref>). Bottom ash is normally used for road foundations and will be mixed with other materials in case of repair and re-construction. Considering the fate of e-scrap in residual waste, with few exceptions scarce metals are highly dissipated in the waste processed. In the case of fly ash disposed in salt mines, the metals are concentrated and potentially recoverable. The processing of bottom ash from municipal incinerators includes recycling of some metals (Fe, Cu, Al); in pilot plants, scarce metals could be retrieved from bottom ash using sieving techniques for the separation of fractions below 20 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X12448521">Muchova et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X12448521">2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>E-scrap vanishing before or during collection</italic>: many washing machines, dryers, dish-washers and cooking ovens identified for collection by their owners are collected by the informal sector and very often transported abroad, partially outside the European Union. Some municipalities accept used electric and electronic devices only in recycling yards instead of kerbside collection to avoid cherry picking in the streets. This has been reported from those cities in which wholesale buyers are placed before the recycling yards offering small money for particular devices. The activities of the informal sector now gain more attention in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X12448521">Lange et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X12448521">2011</xref>). Following an assessment based on counting of cars and vans typically used by waste pickers from Eastern Europe, about 290 000 Mg of used electric and electronic devices are crossing the borders between Germany and Eastern Europe per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734242X12448521">Lange, personal communication, 2011</xref>). The number of devices taken by waste pickers will vary depending on the community-based collection systems and the difference between the mean national income and the income of the poor and that of citizens in neighbouring countries, respectively. In a recent study from Lithuania based on national statistics, records of communities and waste management companies as well as interviews with several hundred consumers, the collection by the informal sector is assessed to cover about 50% by weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12448521">Gurauskienè and Stasiskienè, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Destruction of valuable devices</italic>: a lot of devices are destroyed by waste pickers when they are placed on the street for collection. Waste pickers are interested in valuable parts such as copper tubes and compressors from refrigerators. This leads to uncontrolled losses of cooling agents such as fluoro- chlorinated hydrocarbons and fluorinated hydrocarbons now banned following the Montreal Protocol. The former have high ozone depletion potential and act also as greenhouse gases, the latter do not threat the ozone layer, but are also potent greenhouse gases. At present, far more than 50% of the refrigerators to be disposed in Germany contain CFCl<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734242X12448521">LANUV, 2009</xref>). The controlled recovery of CFCl<sub>3</sub> and CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> from refrigerators is an important step in the protection of the ozone layer. (The export of refrigerators outside of the European Union is forbidden to prevent uncontrolled emission of substances leading to ozone depletion.) There are no official data about the amount of cooling agent lost due to illegal decomposition of freezers. A German non-governmental organisation (NGO) assumes an overall loss of 45% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12448521">DUH - Deutsche Umwelthilfe, 2008</xref>). From an investigation in the City of Düsseldorf during Spring 2008 it was concluded that about 70% of all freezers had been either stolen or damaged by cutting the copper tubes and the compressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12448521">Friege et al., 2008</xref>). In a random test in July, 2011, the results were even worse: about one-third of all refrigerators announced for separate collection by the citizens had been stolen. 85–90% of the remaining freezers were picked up already severely damaged thus emitting up to 100% of the cooling agent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Illegal export, dangerous recycling activities</italic>: About 1 035 000 Mg waste from electronic devices, mostly personal computer and mobile phones, are illegally exported from European to African and Asian countries. In the case of Germany, the illegal export via Hamburg harbour is about 155 000 Mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734242X12448521">Sander and Schilling, 2010</xref>). In West Africa, India, and East Asia, some valuable metals like gold, silver and copper are recuperated from circuit boards using insufficient equipment. In these processes, a large percentage of valuable metals cannot be separated and is therefore lost for further use. People working in backyard dismantling areas are exposed to numerous harmful substances especially in the case of incineration of plastic cages, printed circuit boards with the aim to concentrate valuable metals for recuperation [for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X12448521">Schluep et al. (2009)</xref> ]. The population not directly engaged in the recycling of e-scrap is endangered by emissions from incineration and from dangerous waste dumped leading to air pollution and severe contaminations of the water tables in the surroundings [see for example, Sepúlveda et al. (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0734242X12448521">Wong et al. (2007)</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>No calculable waste flows for the recyclers</italic>: the facilities erected for the recycling of waste from electric and electronic equipment calculate their tenders based on the amount of e-waste and the valuable parts therein on one hand and the costs for proper destruction, sorting, and disposal on the other. The estimation of the e-waste to be recycled is based on the objectives given by the WEEE Directive, on the technical information from the producers, and the empirical knowledge from foregoing years. Due to the activities of the informal sector which cannot be predicted, the calculation of prices offered to EAR has turned out to be complicated. Moreover, severe damage of used appliances may also occur when handling e-scrap at the presorting and storage site as well as at the transport between storage area and recycling facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448521">Deutscher Bundestag, 2011</xref>), which makes decomposition of used items more difficult. The communities are allowed to reclaim certain fractions of the e-scrap (see above) decreasing the normal waste fees to be paid by the citizens. This increases the uncertainties in the cost accounting of the waste management companies which are complaining the loss of valuable appliances and materials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Losses of scarce metals in the recycling process</italic>: The goals for recycling mentioned above have to be met with respect for the complete device. Recycling companies might therefore focus on few valuable parts and a lot of iron scrap and plastics to meet the recovery targets. If electronic waste is shredded at an early stage of the process, dismantling of modules is not more possible thus decreasing the yield of precious metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12448521">Hagelüken, 2006</xref>). If the dismantling process is managed correctly, parts with potentially hazardous components like capacitors are separated at first. Very valuable modules like printed circuit boards are manually dismantled. If Fe, Cu, Al as the most important metals (by weight) and plastic materials like ABS are separated in the next step, many rare elements will get lost. ‘The basic rule is that the recovery rate for a specific metal (or material) from an input stream is decreasing with a rising concentration rate (purity) of that metal separated into an output fraction. From the perspective of a targeted metal in an output fraction this “concentration dilemma” means that the more complete this metal is separated from an input stream, the more it will be contaminated after separation by non target material.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12448521">Hagelüken, 2006</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Recovery processes in the European industry are far better managed than those in developing countries. But having the complete waste chain in mind, the overall results are poor. Following a thorough analysis for personal computers and mobile phones covering about 40% of the gold used in electric and electronic equipment, not more than about 10% of the gold included in these devices could be recovered in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12448521">Chancerel and Rotter, 2009</xref>). This survey is frustrating with respect to the recovery of resources.</p>

<title>Hazardous substances banned by RoHS</title>
<p>The ‘detoxification’ of electric and electronic devices numbers among the producers’ responsibilities. Importers are subjected to the same restrictions. In new electric and electronic equipment sold on the market, the following substances may not longer be used after 1 July 2006:</p>

<list-item><p>polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE; more than 0.1% w/w).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some exceptions have been defined in the Annex of the Directive; for example, for mercury in fluorescent lamps and for lead in alloys with copper, alumina and steel. An exemption for Deca-BDE provided by RoHS was finalized in 2008.</p>
<p>Only few analyses of electric and electronic devices coming onto the market after 2006 have been published. Renowned manufacturers have phased out these chemicals [see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0734242X12448521">Siemens, 2010</xref>)], sometimes also other chemicals under discussion like polybrominated flame retardants in general. This seems not to be true for all no-name brands: In five out of 10 cordless telephones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12448521">Kalberlah et al., 2011</xref>), Cr-VI had been used for plating thus violating the regulation. In one of the cordless telephones, also cadmium, lead and deca-BDE exceeded the limit values. Four of the items violating the Directive had been manufactured outside Europe; in the last case the country of origin could not be identified. The authors also found some other critical substances not restricted by RoHS like Tetrabisbromophenol A. In the case of computers, no violations of RoHS could be detected in a sample of about twenty appliances of different origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12448521">Kalberlah et al., 2011</xref>). There are substantial reasons to assume that violations of RoHS in the case of new appliances are rare.</p>
<p>Due to the long lifetime of some products ranging from about 4 years (computers) to about 20 years (electric heaters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12448521">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>), products containing hazardous substances will interfere with recycling processes for a long time.

<p>To give an example, PCBs from old capacitors used as starters for fluorescent tubes, are found in e-scrap even today. Contaminations of e-scrap recycling facilities by PCBs have recently been reported [see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12448521">Anonymous (2010)</xref>]. The source of the contamination may relate to damaged capacitors. According to a systematic investigation of electric and electronic waste, the threshold concentration for Pb was exceeded in many devices and in some cases also for Cd and PBDEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X12448521">Wäger et al., 2010</xref>). If hazardous compounds are not properly separated and disposed, several effects may occur: In the case of landfilling, they may endanger ground water or ambient air. In the case of recycling, there might be emissions from the recycling process and/or contamination of consumer products. Recyclers are therefore responsible for the separation of waste with hazardous materials and materials used as a secondary raw material. From many publications (see above) it is clear that even in state of the art recycling facilities modules with hazardous substances might remain in the stream destined for reprocessing. The situation outside Europe is worse. Brominated flame retardants which have been identified in hygiene products sold in Australia and Asia, are a prominent example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448521">Bilitewski, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Objectives of the European regulation</title>
<p>First of all, the objectives pursued by the European legislation have to be analysed. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734242X12448521">Table 6</xref>, the scope of the regulations in question is presented. The WEEE directive is focusing on the minimization of waste going to landfills. The protection of (non-renewable) resources is not explicitly numbered among the objectives of the WEEE directive. Resource recovery in general is connected with the re-use or recycling of used applications. The scope and instruments of this directive were discussed in the 1990s leading to a final decision in 2002. The directive was set into force by national laws in 2005. In the 1990s, the scarcity of some no-renewable resources was not a policy issue in Europe. Therefore this Directive is ‘old-fashioned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734242X12448521">Huisman et al., 2006</xref>). The extended producer responsibility (EPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734242X12448521">OECD, 2001</xref>), which had turned out to be useful for waste from packaging became a central element of the WEEE Directive. It is an important finding that EPR has partially failed in this case [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X12448521">Rotter et al. (2011b)</xref> for a discussion].</p>

<p>In the 1990s, chemical policy was an important issue due to numerous problems related with hazardous chemicals to be regulated and due to the failure of the ‘Sixth Amendment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12448521">EC, 1979</xref>), which had turned out to be ineffective with respect to existing substances [see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12448521">Friege (2002)</xref>]. The RoHS directive is connected with the way of thinking developed for chemical policy [see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12448521">Friege and Nover (2006)</xref>]. This means:</p>
<list id="list9-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>focus on hazardous substances in consumer goods,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assessment of the toxicity of the substances in question and of the exposure of consumers</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>minimization of hazardous substances depending on the technical needs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ban on hazardous substances after long transitional periods.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some of the elements mentioned above are also pillars of REACH. As to the RoHS Directive, few violations of the regulation have been documented. The vast majority of appliances seem to comply with the law. As to RoHS, the producers’ responsibility is obviously working.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12448521">
<title>Reasons for shortcomings of the regulations</title>
<p>Looking at the implementation and the enforcement of both Directives, serious shortcomings arise with the WEEE Directive. The problems coming up with e-scrap may be related with incorrect objectives, e.g. the target ‘4 kg per inhabitant and year’ being independent of the environmental hazards or benefits caused by the materials. Some problems mainly come from lack of enforcement, e.g. illegal export of unusable devices. Many problems are connected with an overestimation of the effects of the extended producer responsibility (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12448521">Fehling (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X12448521">Huisman (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734242X12448521">Huisman et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734242X12448521">Khetriwal et al. (2008)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X12448521">2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X12448521">Rotter et al.

<p>The problems described in the section entitled ‘Implementation problems in the “waste chain”’ may be traced to basic principles in waste management as related to the management of ‘normal goods’, which have been disregarded in the WEEE Directive. These principles may be summarized as ‘dilemmas’ which can only partially be overcome by readjusted regulations.</p>
<sec id="section9-0734242X12448521">
<title>Entropy</title>
<p>Recycling processes are always confronted with the entropy dilemma. Following statistical thermodynamics, entropy may be used as a yardstick for the disorder of a closed system. To achieve greater order in the system, external energy has to be fed to the system. It is therefore impossible to close technical loops completely [Stumm and Davis (1974) cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X12448521">Schenkel and Reiche (2004)</xref>]. Valuable materials diluted in the products are hard to recover because of the mechanical, thermal and chemical energy needed for the isolation process [Note: the concept of relative statistical entropy, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12448521">Brunner and Rechberger (2004)</xref>, is very helpful in this context]. The use of rare elements in complicated electronic devices leads to quality defects with respect to the rare elements recovered after the recycling process or irreversible losses due to thorough cleaning [see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X12448521">Pehlken (2010)</xref>]. From the recycling of plastic materials from waste, this effect is well known (‘downcycling’). In the following, this dilemma is abbreviated with the symbol Δ<bold>S</bold>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734242X12448521">
<title>Dissipative use</title>
<p>Billions of people use electronic and electric items such as mobile phones, personal computers or freezers. This means a dissipative dispersion of products containing a number of valuable metals in very low concentrations. Waste management companies collect dissipated goods after use. The owner decides if and when the item in question is handed over to the trash collector. The higher the dissipation rate, the less devices will be collected separately in relation to the number of devices sold. In the following, this dilemma will be characterized by the symbol <bold>D</bold>!. The dissipation dilemma can be demonstrated using platinum (Pt) as an example: Pt is used in the chemical industry (catalysts, laboratory equipment) and for the production of glass (fibre glass nozzles). The recycling rates are &gt; 80 and &gt; 95%, respectively. As to Pt from automobile catalysts, the recycling rate is &lt;&lt; 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12448521">Bringezu and Bleischwitz, 2009</xref>), although the loss of Pt from car catalysts during the use phase has been minimized. The catalysts are exported with the cars or lost in the shredder process. The recovery of Pt from smaller devices by consumers is near 0%. This is a phenomenon that is well known from hazardous chemicals banned for further use: Industrial applications may easily be phased out especially in combination with requirements for workers’ protection. On the contrary, hazardous substances used in household applications often remain there for a long time, although the users or homeowners are informed about potential problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12448521">Friege, 2012a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12448521">
<title>The dual character of waste and resource</title>
<p>Waste may be looked at as a resource, or as a peril. In addition to the economic dilemma resulting from this dualism (see subsection entitled Economical and social problems), there is also a practical one: The more the material or product in question is mixed up with potentially hazardous substances, the more difficult is the recovery of valuables. There is a limit of recycling due to the danger of carrying off critical substances in new products made of secondary materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448521">Bilitewski, 2010</xref>). This dilemma is characterized by the symbol <bold>H</bold>↔<bold>R</bold> (hazardous substance vs. resource). Having waste management regulations in mind, the difficult dualism of waste and resources often leads to incorrect classifications sometimes caused by lack of knowledge, sometimes caused by economic interests. This dilemma is characterized by the symbol <bold>W/V</bold> (waste vs. valuables).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734242X12448521">
<title>Economic and social problems</title>
<p>Successful waste management does not depend only on elaborated technical solutions, but also on economical and social circumstances. From an economical point of view, waste is defined as an item with a negative price, i.e. for waste disposal, a price has to be paid depending on the quality and the amount of waste. If waste contains valuable components such as used paper and cardboards, the waste owner might decide to keep this waste fraction separately to decrease the price to be paid for the residual waste. He might also decide to collect used paper and cardboards from other waste owners seeking to earn some money. This depends on the opportunity costs which are a function of the individual social situation. If the price for a certain waste fraction increases considerably, waste turns into a more or less polluted resource. In the following, this dilemma will be characterized by the symbol Δ<bold>E</bold>. The economic dilemma leads to problems for the planning of waste management, because the amount of waste to be collected and recycled cannot be extrapolated from the actual streams of products (input) and waste (output).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0734242X12448521">
<title>The role of time</title>
<p>Time is a crucial challenge for waste management for two reasons: First, chemicals banned for use in new products come up with the waste thus disturbing recycling processes. This is a long-lasting problem, because devices with dangerous chemicals may be used for decades, e.g. small capacitors with PCB as the isolating agent. [See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734242X12448521">Kümmerer and Hofmeister (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X12448521">Hofmeister and Kümmerer (2009)</xref> describing the role of time for chemical policy.] Second, scarce resources cannot be substituted by secondary raw materials as long as they are in use. This sounds very simply, but the consequences may be dramatic in the case of societies with lack of resources in the future. For example, the amount of Li needed in Europe will increase from 6000 Mg to 20 000 to 50 000 Mg in 2050, mostly driven by the demand for batteries for electric vehicles. The supply of secondary Li in 2050 is estimated to be between 17 and 23% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734242X12448521">Konietzko, 2011</xref>). This dilemma is shown by the symbol Δ<bold>t</bold>.</p>

<title>Chances for optimization</title>
<p>These dilemmas cannot be solved by proper waste management, because they are caused:</p>

<p>The EPR partially fails with respect to the collection of devices from several reasons which have been discussed by a number of authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X12448521">Rotter et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X12448521">Scheijgrond, 2011</xref>). The producer responsibility principle also underlying the RoHS Directive works more successfully for the following reasons.</p>
<list id="list11-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The standards which have to be met by new products may be controlled by the consumers,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Companies bringing branded products to the market fear reports about failing standards,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Manufacturers along the product chain are responsible for the raw materials or modules delivered to the final producer; they can be identified, if problems with the product show up.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As there are economic, social, technical and ecological problems to be solved in an optimization process, a holistic approach should be chosen. The basic rules for sustainable management of material streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12448521">Enquête-Kommission, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12448521">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X12448521">SRU, 2002</xref>) are widely accepted also by policy makers. With respect to non-renewable resources, the second management rule is as follows: ‘Consumption of non-renewable resources should be limited to levels at which they can either be replaced by physically or functionally equivalent renewable resources or at which consumption can be offset by increasing the productivity of renewable or non-renewable resources.’ The optimization in the direction of sustainable progress might be seen as an isosceles triangle with economy, ecology and social issues as cornerstones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12448521">Figure 2</xref>). Technical solutions help to overcome the problems which are identified in the optimization procedure. Within this approach, the relationships between the participants in the process are of outstanding importance.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12448521-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The consumption of large amounts of rare elements is not sustainable. Even in the case of far better recovery rates as yielded today for WEEE, the supply of the industry with scarce metals for ‘sustainable use’ is endangered as may be taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12448521">Table 1</xref>. Therefore, the substitution of these metals should be first choice to avoid the <bold>D</bold>!, as well as the Δ<bold>S</bold> dilemma. One prominent example is the changing technology for lamps: the normal light bulbs have partially been exchanged by halogen lamps and now by LED lamps with far lower energy consumption. As to lighting of houses, bureaus, and streets, this is an efficiency revolution. For LED lamps, semiconductors partially consisting of rare elements (indium tin oxide – ITO, gallium arsenide) are needed. In organic light emitting diodes (OLED), metallic electrodes such as ITO will be unnecessary in future due to the development of electrodes made of organic materials.</p>
<p>Strategies fighting the <bold>D</bold>! dilemma should be second choice after substitution of the material in question. To overcome the <bold>D</bold>! dilemma with respect to scarce metals, the use of these non-renewable resources could be restricted to industrial appliances. At first glance, this idea sounds unusual. But this strategy is often used for hazardous materials which are of technical importance. Scarce resources and hazardous substances may be looked at as one coin with two sides which might be managed in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12448521">Friege, 2012b</xref>). This may be explained by two examples:</p>
<list id="list12-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Early restrictions of the use of cadmium focused on highly dissipative uses such as pigments and plating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Products are not covered by RoHS, when they are intended for large-scale industrial use or are used in implanted medical devices thus allowing the use of metals banned regularly for dissipative use.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Recovery of scarce resources may be seen as the third choice. To increase the recycling rates, collection of WEEE could be enhanced by economic incentives to overcome the Δ<bold>E</bold> dilemma. Some European countries such as Switzerland and Norway collect about 50% or more of used electric and electronic appliances. It has been demonstrated that in these cases the interests of consumers, producers and waste management companies have been taken into consideration. Free riding of producers on one hand and cherry picking by the informal sector on the other hand lead to failure of the system. A high level of compliance among all stakeholders is necessary to overcome free riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X12448521">Khetriwal et al., 2009</xref>). In Switzerland, this success has been achieved through independent control and monitoring, and the joint effort of all the stakeholders. The relative success in Switzerland may be also a result of the welfare with a lower importance of the informal sector. From the balances for WEEE published [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12448521">Gurauskienè and Stasiskienè (2011)</xref> for Lithuania and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12448521">Müller et al. (2011)</xref> for Ghana] it is concluded that the importance of the informal sector increases with decreasing GDP. To mitigate the influence of the informal sector, the collection rates could be enhanced by deposits to be paid by the consumers when they buy an electrical appliance. Tools such as this are helpful to overcome the <bold>D</bold>! and the <bold>W/V</bold> dilemma.</p>

<sec id="section16-0734242X12448521" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The field of electric and electronic devices is widely seen from the viewpoint of waste management. This is not sufficient. The problems coming up with the implementation of the directives are connected to scientific, economic and social phenomena:</p>
<list id="list13-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The high dissipation of appliances is a general obstacle for high collection rates – <bold>D</bold>!.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Used EE going to recycling facilities contain precious non-renewable resources in small concentrations. Due to the entropy effect, the recovery is difficult and needs a lot of energy – Δ<bold>S</bold>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The phasing out of hazardous substances needs a lot of time. Material recovery of parts from used EE may lead to contamination in the recycling chain – Δ<bold>t</bold>, <bold>H↔R</bold>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Used EE items have positive as well as negative prices on the market depending on the item in question – Δ<bold>E, W/V</bold>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waste owners and waste pickers have different subjective assessments about the value of used EE appliances leading to uncontrolled activities of the informal sector resulting in further losses of materials and the emission of hazardous substances – Δ<bold>E</bold>, Δ<bold>t</bold>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The objectives of the Directive and the tools used for the implementation will fail as long as the dilemmas presented are not taken into consideration. The first yardstick is the overall weight of appliances collected per inhabitant thus neglecting the extremely different ‘ecological backpacks’ as well as the value of the resources in electronic devices partially represented by the prices of primary raw materials. The second yardstick used in the Directive is the amount of material recycled in relation to the overall material going to the recycling process. Again, there is no connection to the ecological value of the different resources. According to the Directive, the recycling goal is reached, if a certain percentage of the material is leaving the process for further material recycling neglecting the unavoidable losses in the next steps of the process. There is no incentive for the waste owner to give back unusable appliances to the responsible parties, e.g. communities or producers.</p>
<p>Sustainable management of material streams (Enquête Kommission 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12448521">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X12448521">SRU, 2002</xref>) covers the ecological, economic and social dimensions of the streams of materials and products looking at their life cycle. Waste management is just one part of the whole system which should be integrated into a more holistic approach [see for example, Brunner (1986) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12448521">Friege (1997)</xref>]. Looking at the areas of needs, we can differ between the following fields:</p>
<list id="list14-0734242X12448521" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Communication (computer hardware and telecommunication equipment)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cleaning of textiles and dishware (washing machines and dishwashers)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cooling of food (refrigerators and other cooling devices)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lighting (lamps, bulbs, …)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Entertainment and cultural delight (TV screens, hi-fi and video equipment)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Healthcare (medical equipment).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>If the discussion is focused at the areas of need, the door to solutions integrating resource conservation, waste management and hazardous substances is opened. It is necessary to integrate producers, retailers, users, waste collectors and recyclers. The goals for resource conservation and recovery should be as clear as those established for phasing out hazardous chemicals; otherwise enforcement will not be possible. In this discussion, special resources might be identified which should either not longer utilised in highly dissipated use patterns or collected thoroughly after use. Successful collection might be enforced by economic instruments like charges or levies. With respect to the waste owner, it seems necessary to establish clear responsibilities and instruments for enforcement.</p>
<p>Today, saving resources such as rare metals becomes an issue, because we are faced with a lack of supply and with trade restrictions. This situation should be taken as a chance to develop the regulations concerning electrical and electronic equipment integrating the aspect of resource recovery. Even with great efforts to optimize the collection rates, recovery of rare metals from electric and electronic devices will suffer from the <bold>D</bold>! and the Δ<bold>S</bold> problem. Therefore, the use of scarce resources in appliances widely dissipated could also be avoided accepting some technical disadvantages. A voluntary step of this kind cannot be anticipated in a world where wealthy clients are looking for the most advanced electronic equipment. But lessons can be learned from prior experience: In former years, the production of energy-efficient freezers or personal computers was not a public issue. Today, the producers are urged to announce the energy consumption of freezers with a symbol on each appliance thus informing the clients. Wasting scarce resources is not better than wasting energy. Therefore, the use of certain metals in electronic appliances could be subject to labelling combined with a quality mark assigning the lowest concentration level. Energy efficiency is already promoted by the Ecodesign directive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0734242X12448521">Table 8</xref>). This Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12448521">EC, 2009</xref>) focuses on the saving of energy in energy driven appliances like lamps, freezers, motors. In the latest amendment, the application range has been extended covering also energy-related products, which do not necessarily use energy, but have an impact on energy consumption and can therefore contribute to saving energy, such as windows, insulation material or bathroom devices. Appliances regulated by this Directive have to meet certain minimum energy standards. The European conformity mark ‘CE’ guarantees the conformity of the appliance with the Ecodesign Directive. Protection of material resources is not directly addressed up to now as may be taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0734242X12448521">Table 8</xref>: ‘Although a comprehensive approach to environmental performance is desirable, greenhouse gas mitigation through increased energy efficiency should be considered a priority environmental goal pending the adoption of a working plan.’ (Whereas No. 14)</p>

As outlined in a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X12448521">Schomerus and Spengler, 2010</xref>), the Ecodesign Directive might help to fill up gaps between other Directives without replacing them. Art. 21 says that ‘the Commission shall review the effectiveness of this Directive and of its implementing measures, including… the methodology for the identification and coverage of significant environmental parameters, such as resource efficiency, considering the whole life cycle of products…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12448521">EC, 2009</xref>). This review should be taken as an opportunity to include a strategy for the conservation of scarce resources. Thus, the conformity mark (‘CE’) might become also an indication for saving critical non-renewable resources.</p>
