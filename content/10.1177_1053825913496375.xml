<p>Welcome to volume 36 issue 2. In this issue Tucker, Sugerman, and Zelov explore a novel use of adventure programs to strengthen social bonds among youth and enable them to better cope with a parent having cancer. Tanner and Ernst introduce the Taking Action Opportunities curriculum, which integrates new technology with science education to increase young students’ environmentally responsible behaviour. Lee and Ewert investigate the influence of family style on youth participants’ perceptions and participation within adventure programs. Carson and Domanague explore the role of emotion in college students’ service learning experiences. Finally, Seaman and Rheingold explore the process of “circle talk” as a method of reflection, and show that conceptualization occurs through a situated and socially shared process.</p>
<p>We thought we should also introduce you to changes we’ve made to the editorial structure of the Journal. Having moved publication to SAGE, the Editors and AEE in consultation with the publisher have worked to refresh and update the <italic>JEE’s</italic> advisory structure. The old Journal Advisory Committee (JAC) has now been dissolved. Together with Dr. Ken Gilbertson, the last Chair of the JAC, we would like to sincerely thank committee members for their dedication, interest, and stewardship of the Journal, and for their support in this transition. Thanks also to Ken for his dedication to the JAC. Some members of the JAC have stayed on within the new structure, while a number have stepped aside to graciously enable the involvement of other scholars.</p>
<p>To assist the editors, we now have a two-tiered structure comprised of an Editorial Board (EB) and an Editorial Advisory Panel (EAP). The EB is made up of twenty members who are accomplished scholars, and leading organizers and practitioners in experiential education. The combined expertise of the EB covers the multiple perspectives on experiential education and members will serve a four year term; although to ensure continuity through transitions half of the current EB will sit for only two years. While a Convener of the EB remains to be invited, the EB will offer strategic oversight and international perspectives, have a broad mix of backgrounds and disciplines, and raise the Journal’s global profile. The EAP is comprised of four members whose research abilities are of the highest calibre and whose interests are complimentary to those of the editors. Upon request, members of the EAP provide direct editorial advice within their areas of expertise, thus deepening and broadening the knowledge and experience available to the editorial team, and ensuring that we continue to provide high-quality feedback to authors, and content to readers. The EAP compliments the strengths of the Editors, so it will likely change along with the editorship of the journal in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to expertise, we have tried to ensure that the makeup of EB and EAP has a balance of men and women, and shows strong international representation. Members hail from Asia, Continental Europe, East Africa, North America, Oceania, and the United Kingdom (though unfortunately not yet India or South America). On the inside cover you can take a look at the list of EB and EAP members; we feel they offer both continuity and fresh perspectives. We would like to thank all the members of the inaugural EB and EAP for stepping into these roles and continuing a culture of support, engagement, and excellence within the Journal. We look forward to refining and improving the functioning of the EB and EAP in service of the <italic>JEE</italic>. This is an exciting time for the <italic>JEE</italic>, which continues to benefit from the support not only of the AEE, EB, and EAP, but most importantly of our readers, reviewers, and authors.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Editorial Team,</p>
