<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prior research has shown that adherence to medication is low. The objective was to determine eventually difference to medication adherence between the most chronic diseases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812471447" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a 33-item self-administered questionnaire that included a convenience sample of 635 individuals who were collecting or buying drugs for the treatment of chronic diseases. The survey was conducted at 106 Zagreb pharmacies and the questionnaire was filled out by the study subjects with instructions and help provided by the pharmacist, who administered the questionnaire. The questionnaire was anonymous, and study subjects could get their doubts cleared from the pharmacist. Study subjects were divided into two groups, with adherent defined as a ‘yes’ response to the statement that they ‘never fail to take their medication on time’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494812471447" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The survey questionnaire listed the 16 most common reasons for non-adherence and the study subjects had to answer the question for each of these reasons reporting it as the possible cause of his or her non-adherence. These answers were then used to examine the relationship of each reason to non-adherence. In our study population (<italic>n</italic> = 635), non-adherent subjects prevailed over adherent subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 370; 58.3% vs. <italic>n</italic> = 265; 41.7%). A total 1,357 diagnoses were reported by survey respondents (i.e., an average of 2.1 diagnoses per respondent). The most common diagnoses were diseases of the circulatory system (<italic>n</italic> = 500; 36.8%) and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (<italic>n</italic> = 285; 21.0%).</p>
<p>Each patient was classified into one primary chronic diagnosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812471447">Table I</xref>). There was no difference in the proportion of self-reported adherence across the distribution of nine primary diagnoses. The great majority of study subjects reported forgetfulness (‘I just forgot’) as the main reason for skipping drug doses, followed by being away from home and shortage of the drug (having consumed it all). Only in patients with depressive disorder were the reasons somewhat different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812471447">Table II</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Research on adherence has typically focused on the barriers patients face in taking their medications. Common barriers to adherence are under the patient’s control (forgetfulness was the most common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812471447">1</xref>]), so that attention to them is a necessary and important step in improving adherence. Additional reasons for medication non-adherence, such as being away from home, could also be associated with forgetfulness since the patient should have remembered to bring his medication along with him while going out. The next most common reason self-reported by the study subjects was a shortage of the drug which could also be related to forgetfulness (e.g., failure to collect or buy a new supply of drug on time). The existence of more than one cause of risk considerably increases the non-adherence risk of a patient.</p>
<p>Number of non-adherent patients in our study are significantly higher than in a German study (about one-third of patients can be classified as non-adherent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812471447">2</xref>]. Suboptimum medication adherence is common in the United States and leads to serious negative health consequences but may respond to intervention. Reduced out-of-pocket expenses, case management, and patient education with behavioral support all improved medication adherence for more than one condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812471447">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Adherence to chronic medication in Denmark is generally quite low, but there is a rare exception: women’s adherence to medications for osteoporosis (bisphosphonates and raloxifene) was surprisingly high. This may be due to a high level of public information available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812471447">4</xref>] on osteoporosis in Denmark.</p>
<p>One solution is dosing frequency decreases because prior research has shown a decrease in medication adherence as dosing frequency increases. Patients with chronic diseases appear to be more adherent with once-daily compared with more frequently-scheduled medication regimens. It refers to all types of medication adherence: taking adherence, regimen adherence and timing adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812471447">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to frail older people (those which experience complex problems: disease, dependency and disability) and who often suffer from more chronic diseases. Understanding the concept of frailty may help to optimize medication prescribing for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812471447">6</xref>]. Compared with the study by Yeaw et al. which measured adherence by proportion of days covered (PDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812471447">7</xref>], our self-reported adherence rates were significantly lower.</p>
