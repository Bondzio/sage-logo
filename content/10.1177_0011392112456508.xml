<abstract>
<p>This article aims at drawing on sociological insights into reconciliation processes which emerge out of ethnic, national and state conflicts. First, the concept of <italic>reconciliation</italic> is interrogated as an instrument for sociological enquiry. The article locates the concept’s lexical origins in western/northern Christian traditions and identifies the usages of religious connotations in secularised strands of conflict resolution theory and praxis. While acknowledging the problems involved in assuming a conceptual universality, the basic meaning of the concept is located in many different historical, religious and secular traditions across the globe. Once overcoming Christiano-centric and western/northern biases and limitations, reconciliation can be retrieved and operationalised as a sociological concept for understanding and comparing ethnically and other deeply divided societies. Second, the article argues for further development of sociological comparative perspectives on how societies deal with violent and divisive past, which enhances academic knowledge and may impact policy as regards reconciliation processes, both in terms of understanding the past as well as dealing with the present and future of post-conflict societies. A sociology of conflict and reconciliation offers frames for transferring knowledge and experience that transcends simplistic assumptions and enriches understanding of the complexities of conflict and its transformations.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Cet article vise à utiliser les concepts sociologiques pour les processus de réconciliation qui émergent des conflits ethniques, nationaux ou étatiques. Tout d’abord le concept de <italic>réconciliation</italic> est remis en question en tant d’instrument d’enquête sociologique. L’article situe les origines lexicales du concept dans les traditions occidentales /chrétienne nordique et identifie les usages à connotations religieuses dans les éléments sécularisés de la théorie et de la pratique de la résolution des conflits. Tout en reconnaissant les problèmes soulevés par l’hypothèse d’une universalité conceptuelle, la signification basique du concept est située dans de nombreuses différentes traditions historiques, religieuses et séculaires partout dans le monde. Une fois dépassées les distorsions et les limites christanocentrées et occidentales/nordiques, la réconciliation peut être extraite et rendue opérationnelle en tant que concept sociologique pour la compréhension et la comparaison des sociétés profondément divisées sur le plan ethnique ou autre. Ensuite, l’article argumente en faveur d’un développement accru des perspectives sociologiques comparatives sur la façon dont les sociétés gèrent le passé violent ou source de division, ce qui accroit les connaissances universitaires et peut avoir un impact sur les politiques en matière de processus de réconciliation, tant en termes de compréhension du passé qu’en termes de gestion du présent et de l’avenir de sociétés post-conflictuelles. Une sociologie du conflit et de la réconciliation offre des cadres de transfert de connaissance et d’expérience qui transcende les hypothèses simplistes et qui enrichit la compréhension des complexités du conflit et ses transformations.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>El objetivo de este estudio es hacer uso de las percepciones sociológicas de los procesos de reconciliación que emergen de conflictos étnicos, nacionales y de estado. En primer lugar, el concepto <italic>reconciliación</italic> se cuestiona como un instrumento de investigación sociológica. Este estudio ubica los orígenes léxicos del concepto en las tradiciones cristianas occidentales/septentrionales e identifica los usos de las connotaciones religiosas en las corrientes seculares de la teoría de resolución de conflictos y su práctica. A la vez que se reconocen los problemas que implica la adopción de una universalidad conceptual, el significado básico del concepto se sitúa en un gran número de tradiciones históricas, religiosas y seculares diferentes de todo el mundo. Una vez superados los sesgos cristiano-céntricos y occidentales/septentrionales y sus limitaciones, la reconciliación se puede recuperar y aplicar como un concepto sociológico para entender y comparar las sociedades divididas étnicamente y con otros tipos de divisiones profundas. En segundo lugar, el estudio propone un mayor desarrollo de las perspectivas sociológicas comparativas sobre la forma en la que las sociedades abordan un pasado violento y divisivo, que mejore el conocimiento académico y que pueda tener un impacto en las políticas relativas a los procesos de reconciliación, tanto en la comprensión de pasado como en la forma de afrontar el presente y el futuro de las sociedades posteriores al conflicto. Una sociología del conflicto y la reconciliación ofrece un marco para transferir conocimientos y experiencias que transciendan las suposiciones simplistas y que enriquezcan el entendimiento de las complejidades de los conflictos y sus transformaciones.</p>

<p>True reconciliation, which occurs when society is no longer paralysed by the past and people can work and live together, cannot be based on silence. No society can be restored to health by papering over as much pain as South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate about the complicity and crimes of the apartheid era is necessary, even if uncomfortable.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article focuses on <italic>reconciliation as a concept and as an object of sociological enquiry</italic>; it primarily seeks to refine its conceptual usages to improve the analytical tools of such enquiries. It does not analyse conflict resolution (CR) theory, neither does it chart the vast corpus of sociologically inspired work in the field of CR, transitional justice and reconciliation. First, the article interrogates the concept in the hope of clarifying and specifying its meaning. This allows us to further develop the use of sociological enquiries which would shed light onto the processes of reconciliation in society. Second, it contextualises reconciliation within conflict resolution/transformation and transitional justice theory. It finally concludes with some rudimentary ideas about the limitations of sociological enquiries, which can offer the tools for moving beyond the current state of knowledge into a sociology of ethnic/state conflict and reconciliation.</p>

<title>Interrogating reconciliation: Retrieving a universal but locally embedded concept</title>
<p>When assessing the ways in which societies deal with past atrocities, violence and exclusions in ethnic, racial and religious war-torn or divided societies, the <italic>concept of reconciliation</italic> becomes the subject of contestation. Reconciliation is about the present and future which somehow requires managing past differences, divisions and polarisations around which violence was historically organised. It therefore presupposes a theory of ethnic/national conflict upon which any notion of transforming this conflict will be implemented. Contemporary studies of collective violence and war can be enriched by a proper interface with sociological scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011392112456508">Malesevic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011392112456508">Oberschall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011392112456508">Smithey, 2011</xref>). However, there has not been much sociological interest in peace and reconciliation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392112456508">Brewer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There is no universally accepted mode of reconciliation. Even though, the prevailing ‘model’ stresses the need to address past violence, oppressions and divisions by connecting to an accepted narrative of ‘truth’ about the past violence, it needn’t necessarily be so. History is not short of examples of ‘collective amnesia’ imposed by the winning side or as a compromise to ‘move on’; this is the so-called Spanish model of the ‘pact of oblivion’ imposed by the Franco regime which dictated in favour of letting bygones be bygones, focusing on economic prosperity and ‘leaving it to next generations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392112456508">Fernandez, 1996/2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392112456508">Kovras and Loizides, 2011</xref>). Most scholars and activists see this as unsatisfactory in practice, not to mention the moral, ethical and political objections. Even in Spain this is questioned as children and grandchildren of those killed by the Franco regime are seeking the truth about their past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392112456508">Kovras and Loizides, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevailing model involves connecting reconciliation to a process of seeking and acknowledging ‘the truth’ about past atrocities, violence and human rights violation to provide a sense of ‘justice’ for the victims. In theory, this allows society to move beyond the ‘past wounds’: reconciliation is ‘the ultimate goal of conflict resolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011392112456508">Ramsbotham et al., 2011</xref>: 246). The idea is that societies in transition to democracy would be reconciled via ‘transitional justice’, i.e. transitional measures to address past violence and violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456508">De Greiff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456508">Elster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011392112456508">Rigby, 2001</xref>). A major problem is that the two goals, ‘truth’ and ‘justice’, can be and often are antagonistic. Also, the notion of ‘truth’ is contested and relative. As for ‘moving on’, this is part of ideological, symbolic and performative acts seeking to legitimize a ‘post-conflict’ order.</p>
<p>The very concept of reconciliation is often loosely defined or ill-defined. Asmal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456508">1997</xref>: 46) argue that it is a ‘misused concept’ as it is wrongly assumed to be ‘a painless forgetting’. ‘Genuine reconciliation’ means ‘facing the unwelcome truths in order to harmonize the incommensurable world views so that inevitable and discontinuing conflict and differences stand at least within a single universe of comprehensibility.’</p>
<p>This painful process recalls Derrida’s aporia that ‘the only thing to forgive is the unforgivable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456508">Derrida, 2001</xref>: 395), otherwise it cannot be ‘pure’:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . it should not be, normal, normative, normalising. It should remain exceptional and extraordinary, in the face of the impossible: as if it interrupted the ordinary course of historical temporality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456508">Derrida, 2001</xref>: 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Derrida’s comment may cast doubt on the reconciliatory logic as practised in various state-sanctioned institutions: there are at least 40 examples of truth commissions across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456508">Hayner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456508">HCHR, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011392112456508">Olsen et al., 2011</xref>);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392112456508">2</xref></sup> new truth commissions are called for in unthinkable contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392112456508">3</xref></sup> The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was a state-sanctioned process providing for, under certain circumstances, <italic>conditional forgiveness</italic> in the form of amnesty in return for admission, frank disclosure and genuine remorse or repentance, which contrasts with ‘unconditional forgiveness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392112456508">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of issues emerge: for one, the so-called ‘right to forgive’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392112456508">5</xref></sup> cannot be a blank declaration, but reserved as a <italic>prerogative of the victim or the victim’s relatives</italic>. Neither can this process be ‘a symmetrical process of mutual absolution’; hence advocates of TRC-like processes argue that such a commission is ‘a facility for the oppressed’, designed precisely to ‘enable them, should they so choose, to fulfil their civic sacrament of forgiving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456508">Asmal et al., 1997</xref>: 49). Questions arise in the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0011392112456508">Spivak (1990)</xref>: to what extent <italic>can the subaltern really speak</italic> on equal terms? Are they are really listened to, when the very language of reconciliation is already ‘contaminated and constrained by the dominant narrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011392112456508">Sadria, 2008</xref>: 62)? Also, what if the victim chooses <italic>not to forgive</italic>? In 1996, Biko’s widow chose <italic>not to forgive</italic>, challenging the constitutionality of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392112456508">6</xref></sup> She challenged the exchange of amnesty for the killers for truth (frank disclosure) as violation of a basic right to justice, to seek prosecution and civic remedy. The Court performed, in its own words, an ‘agonizing balancing act’ when it ruled against Mrs Biko and in favour of ‘the nation transcending the divisions and strife of the past’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392112456508">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reconciliation cannot be a general amnesty ‘blaming it all on history’, for that would be impunity. However, in the real world amnesties and de facto impunity to former dictators and perpetrators of crimes of repugnant regimes are not uncommon, particularly in negotiated transitions: ‘The right to be magnanimous cannot be exercised if all the wrongs are excused or justified or blamed on history’, Judge Sachs noted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392112456508">8</xref></sup> We are dealing with institutional processes – not <italic>individual</italic> but <italic>collective</italic> acts in societies suffering from past conflict, atrocities and divisions which are thought to be in transition towards democratisation. The <italic>ancient regime</italic> is finished and <italic>the new order regime</italic> establishes a process to <italic>reconcile</italic> people, individuals, ethnic groups, classes and former warring factions, with the painful past. For many Latin Americans there is aversion to the very ‘rhetoric of reconciliation’ as it smacks of impunity for the torturers and perpetrators; as one activist scholar remarked for Argentina and Chile, ‘ “truth” was for the Left and “reconciliation” for the Right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0011392112456508">VanAntwerpen, 2008</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>To institutionalise the ‘right to forgive’ at a societal level is a contradictory affair. Socially sanctioned and state sanctioned processes are forced to address questions of normativity and morality: to what extent can we study reconciliation in society without its ethnical connotations and attachments? Attempts to read reconciliation purely in an ‘objective’ and positivist manner lose the social meaning, which transforms the powerful moral, ethical and other spiritual aspects into social forces. Like other social phenomena, sociological insights allow for a close interrogation of ‘the rich and nuanced process of reconciliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392112456508">Asmal et al., 1997</xref>: 49), beyond the ideological and rhetorical banalities surrounding the concept.</p>
<p>There is no consensus on how and whether forgiveness necessarily fits within an institutional framework, for reconciliation is both process and goal, and as such it is uncertain, uneven and often unfinished. Even the protagonists of the celebrated South African TRC Commission, while agreeing on the general principles such as ‘restraint, generosity, empathy and perseverance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011392112456508">Villa-Vicencio, 2009</xref>: 170), disagree about crucial stepping stones and means in the process. Unlike Tutu, for Villa-Vicencio<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392112456508">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011392112456508">2009</xref>: 171) ‘reconciliation does not necessarily involve forgiveness’, but an exploration of a new relationship, as ‘reconciliation interrupts an established pattern of events’. At the lowest level, this results in an agreement to stop killing each other; at a more advanced level, it establishes ways to prevent killings in the future by establishing ‘structures for sustainable peace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011392112456508">Villa-Vicencio, 2009</xref>: 170). Reconciliation is also seen as breaking the silence about the past via the recognition of ‘the truth’; acknowledging the wrongdoing is as much about the future as it is about memory and justice. It can be seen as idealistic or utopian, particularly at the height of violent eruptions; however ‘it is often the only realistic alternative to the escalation of violence in societies’ seeking to overcome violence and wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011392112456508">Villa-Vicencio, 2009</xref>: 172). The ‘praxis of reconciliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456508">Lederach, 1997</xref>: 31) becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>A sociological reading of reconciliation is less interested in abstractions around the ‘purity’ of the concept, as long as the concept remains relevant, legitimate and useful. It is more interested about the manner of and the reasons for the ‘praxis of reconciliation’. It explores how the social processes may generate ‘extraordinary’ or ‘exceptional interruptions’ which allow us to speak of ruptures to the old order, what was once ‘normality’ – war, polarisation, division, etc. – and thereby potentially initiating <italic>new societal normalities</italic> which put an end to the former. This process may or may not involve forgiveness; it may require punishment for the guilty for atrocities and/or it may lead to systemic and power transformation; it may even take different forms and different time frames. These questions are objects for historical and sociological enquiry in the particular context under study.</p>
<p>Reconciliation is sociologically interesting because it breaks through the narrow confines of various traditions, spreading and energising processes which in turn generate a kind of sociopolitical and cultural osmosis within very diverse societies. What makes a Jesuit priest be inspired both by Christianity and Gandhi and Marxism, to be energised by the cause, working in El Salvador, Guatemala, Northern Ireland, travelling to the Middle East, Central America and the Philippines, to be frequently arrested and imprisoned for civil disobedience at a US Air Force base in North Carolina, to spread his <italic>Theology of Nonviolence</italic>?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392112456508">10</xref></sup> Mandela, like Gandhi, is distinguished as a global symbol of resistance <italic>and</italic> reconciliation: he stood his ground against apartheid after 27 years’ incarceration, yet he threw his weight behind reconciliation thus becoming a beacon for peace. During political, social and economic crisis, where the ‘logic of fragmentation’ is prevailing, Sitas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>) speaks of the ‘ethic of reconciliation’ as an emerging force with a potential for unity. This has found expression in four surges of postwar thought: the neo-Gandhian notions of non-violence; the postwar western self-reflexivity which no longer tolerates violence, racism and oppression of the ‘Other’; the convergence between post-Stalinist communism/socialism, workers’ movements, democratic traditions and human rights sensitivities; and, finally, the creativity of artists whose lives and works retrieve what is live and human in humanity amid the destructive elements of modernity. This is a subject this article returns to.</p>

<title>A genealogy of reconciliation: Religious origins, reformulations and secular processes</title>
<p>The term reconciliation is rooted in the Latin <italic>conscientia</italic>, i.e. joint knowledge, <italic>reconciliare</italic>, i.e. remaking or bringing together of people, and <italic>concilium</italic>, i.e. ‘places of meeting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392112456508">James, 2008</xref>: 117). The current meaning of reconciliation has Christian religious and ethical origins. This makes it often questionable for non-religious persons. Christian routes meeting the ‘Other’ occur via the connection to God. In Christian theology the ‘doctrine’ of reconciliation’ is no peripheral matter. According to Karl Barth, it is via ‘the work of reconciliation’ that ‘the covenant is fulfilled’ and this is at ‘the heart of the subject matter of Christian faith’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392112456508">Barth, 2004</xref>: 3–4). It is one of the seven sacraments, as ‘the Sacrament of Reconciliation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392112456508">11</xref></sup> Desmond Tutu (2004), who personified the South African TRC, presented a vision deeply ingrained in Christian Protestant tradition; he insisted that ‘God has a Dream’. The preaching of love, peace and reconciliation are commonly shared between different religions.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic traditions of reconciliation emerged as a kind of post-liberation theology, particularly in Central and South America. It is a synthesis of Christian doctrines and praxis derived from social action for liberation and Marxism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011392112456508">12</xref></sup> Religiously inspired groups in Nicaragua played leading roles in the reconciliation process between the Sandinistas and indigenous groups: reconciliation meetings would start with Psalm 85. Religious rituals provided the cement for unity: ‘Truth and mercy have met together, peace and justice have kissed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456508">Lederach, 1997</xref>: 28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0011392112456508">13</xref></sup> Reconciliation is extended and ‘secularised’ in order to apply to worldly matters in society. For instance ‘the four major concepts’, i.e. ‘Truth, Mercy, Justice and Peace’, proposed by Lederach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456508">1997</xref>: 31) are inspired by Christian doctrines. In any case, religion can be utilised as a positive force for peace-making, particularly in partnership with secular groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456508">Brewer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Reconciliation traditions are also found within the eastern Orthodox Christian tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0011392112456508">14</xref></sup> In theological terms reconciliation is based on <italic>the communion of a person before God</italic> – the Greek word for ‘society’ (<italic>koinonia</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0011392112456508">15</xref></sup> also means ‘communion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0011392112456508">16</xref></sup> There is no notion of ‘the individual’ in the original Greek Christian canonical texts, which is derived from modern western liberal and constitutional thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0011392112456508">17</xref></sup> Yet, ‘free will’ is granted to each person to chose his/her route to <italic>Theosis</italic> (Θέωσις), i.e. the <italic>Truth</italic> (<italic>alitheia</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0011392112456508">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392112456508">Clement, 1997</xref>):<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0011392112456508">19</xref></sup> <italic>Reconciliation</italic> (<italic>syn-philiosis [symphiliosis]</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0011392112456508">20</xref></sup> refers to the Orthodox Christian doctrine as interpreted by an ecumenical, multicultural and multi-faith perspective of tolerant and peaceful coexistence. The Holy Synod decision of 1872 condemned nationalism and racism as ‘a sin’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0011392112456508">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the sense of communication, mutual understanding, exchange and dialogue that leads to a new level of understanding enabling people (as individuals, groups and institutions) to engage in the reconciliation process is not confined to western traditions. It exists in different cultural settings, albeit in different forms. Despite lexical objections to the concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392112456508">Kadir, 2007</xref>), a reconciliation-type of social process cuts across many disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0011392112456508">22</xref></sup> This reinforces the argument by Sitas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>) that the ‘ethic of reconciliation’ is a truly <italic>global</italic> phenomenon.

<p>In Arab cultures an ancient structure for conflict resolving existed even before Islam; <italic>Sulha</italic> (settlement) was applied in the absence of a legal system. <italic>Musalaha</italic> or reconciliation is reached in a step-by-step process emphasising the link between the various psychological dimensions of communal life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0011392112456508">23</xref></sup> Among ancient Indian cultures, the doctrine of <italic>Brihad-Aranyaka Upanished</italic> is premised on the idea that conflict arises from ‘different interpretations and an imperfect understanding of the essential oneness of all beings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392112456508">Komesaroff, 2008</xref>: 2).

A similar concept exists in African traditions; the concept of <italic>Ubuntu</italic> focuses on dialogue and the principle that human existence is interconnected and communal, hence there is potential for including every human being in the well-being of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392112456508">Murithi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2008</xref>). <italic>Ubuntu</italic> is a unifying tradition that can serve as a basis for reconciliation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392112456508">Francis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011392112456508">Villa-Vicencio, 2009</xref>). Among traditional tribunals, the <italic>Gacaca tribunal</italic> was used in a number of countries including Rwanda following the genocide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392112456508">Freeman and Hayner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011392112456508">Malan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011392112456508">Megwalu and Loizides, 2010</xref>). Thus, reconciliation assumes a ‘universalising’ potential through the various cultural frames within which ‘reconciliation’ is located, anchored and embedded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0011392112456508">25</xref></sup> It is therefore worth engaging further on how the ‘local’ interfaces with the ‘global’ in appreciating the nature of conflict, cooperation, peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p>There are nonetheless inherent difficulties in drawing on religious-based concepts of reconciliation. The ambivalent legacy of religious doctrines and institutions, often justifying war and violence throughout the centuries, can be problematic. An open historical and current sociological question is whether religious differences are the primary causes of conflicts or whether these differences are exploited (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392112456508">Brewer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011392112456508">Popovski, 2008</xref>: 16–19). The legacies of the Crusades, as holy warriors forcefully spreading empire onto the ‘infidels’, the Jihad for Muslims serving a similar role, illustrate that religions can be used and abused as an ideological <italic>causa belli</italic>, based on notions of religious supremacy. Moreover, the concept of reconciliation can be thought of as historically corrupted: it formed an integral part of the rhetoric of medieval tribunals during the Holy Inquisition, where ‘the pertinacious and impenitent heretic was consigned to the stake’; those ‘who recanted and professed conversion, even at the last moment, were admitted to reconciliation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0011392112456508">26</xref></sup> Moreover, reconciliation can be seen as historically connected to empire and imposition of the West on the rest. Sociologically one can observe greater difficulties where religious doctrines and institutions are enmeshed in the conflicts, particularly where there are contestations over territories by different religious or non-religious groups. The historic role of Byzantine emperors using ‘proto-Crusaders’ as god-driven fighters against the infidels in various Anatolian campaigns remains a controversial legacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0011392112456508">27</xref></sup> In the Balkan context, in the eastern and southeastern Mediterranean post-Ottoman order, the historical role of the Orthodox Church is very much in question: first, it collaborated with the Ottoman rulers in amassing taxes and wealth; then, with the creation of the new states, it often acted as a vehicle for irredentist nationalism and hatred, rather than promoting peace and reconciliation. As the Ecumenical Patriarch noted,<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the association, which is increasing today, between Church and nation is deeply ambiguous. . . . Nationalism . . . attempted to appropriate Orthodoxy, to make it its instrument, to install within it its hatreds, its fears and its fantasies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392112456508">Clement, 1997</xref>: 183)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Notions such as ‘just wars’, ‘just cause’ for war, etc. (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011392112456508">Popovski et al., 2008</xref>) are the flip-side of ‘peace’ and ‘reconciliation’ in religious doctrines and articulations about the world order. Christian doctrines in western and eastern churches and other religions have produced apologetics for war and hatred, drawing on scripture and patristic references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011392112456508">Stoyanov, 2008</xref>), as there is ‘a complex correlation between religion and violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011392112456508">Popovski, 2008</xref>: 17). The same arguments are relevant in the relations between Islam, Christianity and fundamentalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392112456508">Ali, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0011392112456508">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, where there are strong secular or even anti-religious traditions in sections of the population, the concept of religion-based reconciliation becomes particularly problematic. Additionally, the current international climate of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism in western countries following the September 11 attacks seriously undermines ‘liberal peace’ models of conflict resolution and reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011392112456508">Mac Ginty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011392112456508">Paris, 2004</xref>). The key lies in developing open readings of reconciliation, attempting to cross-cut the religious/faith boundaries and critically engage with Eurocentricity.</p>
<p>One effort is to draw on the common heritage of ‘Abrahamist traditions’ among the monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which is in itself a reconciliation process between the faiths. For Derrida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392112456508">2001</xref>: 28),<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>Abrahamic</italic> tradition – <italic>complex</italic> and <italic>differentiated, even conflictual</italic> – is at once singular and on the way to universalisation through that which a certain theatre of forgiveness puts in place or brings to light.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this logic may not appeal to the non-Abrahamists, or the secularists or atheists. In any case, there is no singular route to <italic>reconciliation</italic> as the concept is contested, contradictory and ambivalent. If the concept is to be truly universal, it must go beyond any Christian privileging or biases. Trying to conceptualise ‘reconciliation’ means trying to capture multiple processes, ideas and practices, official, semi-official and unofficial, state-sponsored or sanctioned, or anti-state or non-state sanctioned that lead to very diverse, often contradictory societal processes. As such, they transcend officially sponsored truth/reconciliation commissions or symbolic acts of apology at a collective level. One must take note of techno-centric, Eurocentric and Christiano-centric biases of the English word ‘reconciliation’ and its Greek alternative <italic>symphiliosis</italic>. Reconciliation is schematically illustrated as not confined to religious routes, but contained in different cultural and secular thinking.</p>
<p>A crucial aspect of addressing the biases is to move <italic>beyond</italic> the religious/traditional cultural dimensions without negating the necessary historic links in the specific society under study. At the same time it is pertinent that we distinguish between the <italic>different uses of symbolic, ideological, religious cultural resources</italic> to articulate reconciliation, understanding and coexistence, from <italic>the actual social reality of the concept of defined modes in society</italic>. Even those coming from the same processes or sharing basic ideological reference points often have different approaches. Even within South Africa, Tutu’s religious-inspired ‘religious redemptive narrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011392112456508">Wilson, 2001</xref>) is contrasted to Villa-Vicencio, who preferred a more modest agenda, which ‘did not depend on moral absolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0011392112456508">VanAntwerpen, 2008</xref>: 26). Another dimension is the very <italic>performance</italic> of reconciliation, which took a completely different form in the televised South African TRC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0011392112456508">29</xref></sup> to the approach taken in the Guatemalan context, where the commission refrained from naming perpetrators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0011392112456508">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>To <italic>universalise</italic> reconciliation in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0011392112456508">Wallerstein’s (2006)</xref> ‘universal universalism’, we must undo ‘Euro-centric or relative universalism’, which is but ‘rhetoric of power’. Universality is inherently <italic>ambiguous</italic>, as Kant’s notion of ‘perpetual peace’ illustrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392112456508">Kant, 2006</xref>). Yet, it contains the potentiality to become ‘<italic>ideal universality</italic>’ in the sense that it can exert active force towards emancipation: reconciliation can be seen as a crucial dimension of universality as ‘the ideal non-discrimination and non-coercion is “immortal” or irrepressible’ and has re-emerged over time and has shifted continually in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392112456508">Balibar, 2002b</xref>: 167). The histories of struggles are inscribed in Balibar’s notion of ‘<italic>ideal universality</italic>’; struggles of workers, women, anti-racist and other situated anti-oppression struggles are condensed in the dialectic between violence and identity, in what Balibar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392112456508">2002a</xref>: 30) abstracts as ‘civility’ which ‘excludes extremes of violence, so as to create a (public, private) space for politics, emancipation and transformation, and enable violence itself to be historicized’.</p>
<p>The traditions which emerge from historical anti-oppression struggles are a key source of reconciliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0011392112456508">31</xref></sup> As Primo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392112456508">Levi (1998)</xref> reminds us, to retrieve what is still human in the history of humanity after the Holocaust, we have the ‘duty to remember’ and learn from the destructions and deadly abuses of power, mostly inflicted by the powerful. This duty extends from the legacy of slavery to colonial oppression to the two world wars, from Nazism and the Holocaust to Hiroshima/Nagasaki right through to deadly wars, genocides and the recent ‘ethnic cleansing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392112456508">Bauman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011392112456508">Mann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2008</xref>). Justifiably, a crucial source of the ‘ethic of reconciliation’ is arguably the process of ‘self-reflexivity of Western modernity’, which can condense learning from the historic struggles from the point of view of the oppressed ‘Other’ in the West and the Colonies. For Sitas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>) the third source of the ‘ethic of reconciliation’ is the critique of Stalinism following the collapse of the Soviet model, which led to the convergence between socialist ideas and human rights discourses into social rights. Yet, we live in the contradiction of emerging forces out of the ashes of multiple systemic defeats and crises of modernity; the ‘ethic of reconciliation’ has so far not halted the powerful of the globe as far as geopolitics and economic policy-making are concerned; nonetheless it is a moral, political and social force to be reckoned with, mobilising masses calling for restraint on the powerful, global transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0011392112456508">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>A sociology of conflict and reconciliation: Imagining and investigating the post-conflict and post-division order</title>
<p>Reconciliation as the <italic>end goal</italic> and <italic>process</italic> of conflict resolution has a long history. It started from the precursors in the inter-war period of what was later established as ‘Conflict Resolution’ (CR) by scholars within the discipline of International Relations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0011392112456508">33</xref></sup> studying the potential for world peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0011392112456508">34</xref></sup> The field of CR as a distinct, influential area of study took off in the late 1950s. Since the 1970s, there has been remarkable innovation in both theory and practice, as scholars drew more from the various critiques and nuanced analyses within CR, as well as other studies beyond. ‘Conflict analysis’ became more sophisticated and nuanced, when compared to earlier models ridden with functionalist and behaviourist underpinnings. The Norwegian sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392112456508">Galtung (1969)</xref> famously distinguished between ‘negative peace’ and ‘positive peace’: the former is about conflict transformation for <italic>which type</italic> or <italic>process</italic> of conflict resolution is appropriate; the latter is about <italic>social transformation</italic>. This is very much a foundational sociological intervention which paved the way for the innovative ‘conflict transformation school’ and later syntheses since the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0011392112456508">35</xref></sup> The nature of particular types of conflict that last a long time are referred to as ‘protracted social conflict’ and proceed from the common assumption of conflict theory that ‘conflict is an inseparable part of social interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392112456508">Azar, 1986</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>The transformation from ‘conflict’ (war, killings, polarisation, division, etc.) towards a state of ‘peace’ is the process where the warring factions in ‘protracted social conflict’ are somehow reconciled. The idea of reconciliation refers to societal processes leading to ‘a conscious and justified settling of accounts with the past’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0011392112456508">36</xref></sup> In CR theory the end result, the idealised <italic>Ithaca</italic> of a long journey is reconciliation: Ramsbotham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011392112456508">2011</xref>: 7) use the schema of ‘difference, contradiction, polarisation, violence, WAR, ceasefire, agreement, normalisation and finally reconciliation’. This model is a typical reading as the end of a long-drawn process rather than a highly non-linear, fluid and contradictory process within a fragmented and polarised social structure: ‘restoring relationships to live non-violently with radical differences – can be seen as the ultimate goal of reconciliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011392112456508">Ramsbotham et al., 2011</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>In this light, when referring to wider and societal reconciliation we need to examine the network of relationships, mechanisms and process promoting justice and address the root-causes of enmity.</p>
<p>Assumptions about the nature of conflict, polarisations and divisions need to be challenged. For instance reconciliation and CR models need to get rid of any ‘ethnicist’ assumptions about ‘communities’, be they ethnic or religious, which are considered as unified and homogeneous and ignore political, ideological and social characteristics and identities, such as gender and class. The rich debates around social identity, racism and anti-racism, gender, nationhood and intersectionality can enhance reconciliation theorisation and praxis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0011392112456508">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dealing with the violent and divisive past is no easy matter. Different societies deal with this subject very differently but they are also influenced by one another; ideas and social processes ‘travel’ or ‘migrate’ and influence other contexts but they do so in different and unintended ways. There is neither a consensus as to the ‘best route’, nor any ‘toolkit’ to be copied and applied universally; however there are factors often closely connected to political, economic and cultural agendas in a world system based on hegemonic relations. There are pitfalls in the various measures; moreover there are problems in the adaptation of imported models of truth and reconciliation in this ‘booming truth business’ which is in vogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0011392112456508">VanAntwerpen, 2008</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that the ‘truth’ about what happened in the past (i.e. knowing who is politically, morally and legally responsible for the violent acts/processes and the circumstances under which these occurred) <italic>will</italic> necessarily lead to reconciliation. However, it is thought that this is possible under certain conditions, as it was arguably achieved in South Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392112456508">Gibson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011392112456508">Sanders, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, the very model has been questioned within South Africa itself for failing to appreciate essential features of apartheid, which allowed the white minority to benefit from its ‘minority democracy’ by oppressing, exploiting and excluding the black majority. It was further criticised for adopting an individualistic approach to guilt, inherited from the model designed and intended for the Latin American truth seeking processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0011392112456508">38</xref></sup> It failed to address the historic injustices by glossing over white privilege, so as to legitimise the new regime without the necessary transfer of wealth and income (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392112456508">Ellis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011392112456508">Wilson, 2001</xref>). Moreover, in other contexts, reconciliation can be achieved <italic>without seeking any agreement as to the ‘truth’ of the past</italic>, by leaving each of old warring sides to retain its version of ‘the truth’ and agree on how to ‘manage’ the present via a power-sharing system and to deal with the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392112456508">Cox et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>What about ‘transitional justice’? The notion itself is recognition that traditional or conventional justice is <italic>unable</italic> to deal with transitional situations. In the ‘imperfect world’ of transitions, measures addressing gross human rights violations of the past regime are not necessarily in line with ‘retributive justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392112456508">De Greiff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456508">Elster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456508">Hayner, 2010</xref>). Reconciliation is thus associated with the idea of transition to democracy from dictatorship or war-torn societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392112456508">Elster, 1998</xref>). These refer to disparate types of measures dealing with the violent past such as enhancing peace-building or legitimating regimes, the rule of law, fairness, democracy and bringing about reconciliation, which are supposed to support or complement each other. However, this is not necessarily the case. The priorities, the quality and the extent to which each of these are actually realised are determined by the settlement reached and the balance of political forces.</p>
<p>A key issue is often the conflicting interpretations of the past, in other words the question of ‘truth’. International literature is illustrative of different dimensions of <italic>truth seeking</italic> and <italic>truth telling</italic> as crucial aspects of reconciliation in post-conflict situations. The 40 examples of truth commissions across the globe have common characteristics, but at the same time vary enormously depending on their different mandate, national, social and historical context and the balance of forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392112456508">Hayner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392112456508">HCHR, 2006</xref>). Studies have also focused on the relation between truth/reconciliation and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0011392112456508">Smyth, 2007</xref>), the role of NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392112456508">ICTJ, 2004</xref>), transitional justice and how conflict-ridden societies reconcile themselves with their history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011392112456508">Long and Brecke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011392112456508">Rigby, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0011392112456508">39</xref></sup> The issue of dealing with past violence and reconciliation is a sociological issue and is beginning to emerge in current sociological debates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0011392112456508">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many scholars consider that to appreciate transitional justice one has to take a holistic reading, one which is based on pragmatic and conceptual grounds in ‘an imperfect world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0011392112456508">41</xref></sup> The very essence of ‘transitional justice’ is to institutionalise and legitimise processes and mechanisms to promote that which would facilitate the ‘transition’ to a post-conflict settlement and a new state of affairs. In other words, transitional justice refers to symbolic processes as well as to processes and practices forming part of a settlement leading to the stabilisation of the post-settlement order. ‘Reconciliation’ in the broader sense of the term is a process of compromising very different and asymmetrical actors, such as victims <italic>and</italic> perpetrators from both sides; hegemonic forces of the two groups, i.e. elite pacting; and subaltern forces of the different groups, where the violent past is deemed regrettable by all sides.</p>
<p>Societal reconciliation requires a ‘theatre’, a public space for the public performance of democratic accountability as a means for inaugurating new beginnings; this needs to engage the ‘local’, the ‘historical’, the ‘political’ and the ‘social’ in the society’s public sphere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392112456508">Cole, 2010</xref>). The notion of <italic>social space</italic> is needed for this social performance to take place, as reconciliation requires deep-rooted social transformations involving what Lederach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456508">1997</xref>: 29) calls ‘primary factors’ that ‘traditionally have been seen as irrelevant or outside the competency of international relations’. It is ‘a process of encounter [in] . . . a social space’ and therefore ‘understood as both a focus and a locus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392112456508">Lederach, 1997</xref>: 29–30). Despite criticisms about the distortion and corruption due to power reasons, communities and social movements continue searching for ‘new institutional forms’ and ‘third-spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Different societies are likely to continue to deal with their past differently as the political settlements vary enormously and depending on how one views past historical events pertaining to conflict, political crimes and wars. Being very much about <italic>the politics of the present</italic> that extends to the future, the process of reconciliation organises accordingly <italic>the politics of memory and forgetting</italic>. In this sense, this process can only be understood as a sociopolitical process in its particular context. It is about how the ‘past’ is used for the purposes of constructing ‘nationhood’ or ‘peoplehood’; hence, to justify ‘national unity’ about building a better and perpetually peaceful future very different approaches are adopted, such as <italic>collective amnesia</italic> (Japan, Spain and Russia); or purges via prosecutions via trials and justice (Nuremberg, International Criminal Court); or lustrations for the same reasons by disqualifying collaborators of the ancient regime from public office (e.g. GDR, Eastern Europe). Purging of the past sins may call for some negotiated restitution, e.g. Germany’s reparation to Israel and compensations for forced labour, Canada’s and Australia’s negotiations about indigenous land rights. In other instances ‘political re-education’ is called for or some form of truth commission (Latin America, South Africa, etc.). Many times a mixture of the above is adopted.</p>
<p>Bashir and Kymlicka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392112456508">2008</xref>: 13) refer to three ‘types’ of reconciliation on the basis of the goals, tools and theories they derive from, which are not mutually exclusive but have different effects: (a) as a religiously inspired confessional enterprise, (b) as a nation-building project or (c) as a human rights project. They argue for <italic>an expanded approach to the subject of reconciliation</italic>: the need to connect reconciliation with a multicultural approach, which allows for going beyond the CR models of transitional justice and draw also on the rich debates around multicultural society. This is a fruitful approach and goes along similar directions of the arguments presented in this article. One conception can speak of <italic>societal</italic> reconciliation, the Greek <italic>symphiliosis</italic> (i.e. the processes of reaching <italic>philia</italic>, friendship). This refers to <italic>a wider and deeper social process</italic> and is not confined to political or elite reconciliation in ethnic–state conflict or divided societies. A requirement for a genuine <italic>symphiliosis</italic> is ‘transcendence’ of the divisions and polarisations that result from ethnic–state conflict, which means <italic>comprehensive transformation of ethnic/social inequality, exclusionary and discriminatory structures and practice, ideologies and discourses in society</italic>. Such a goal does not mean postponing the process of <italic>symphiliosis</italic> for some distant future after the ‘event’ of ‘solution’, but should be an immediate task of civic action initiatives seeking reconciliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0011392112456508">42</xref></sup> On the other hand, we must not lose sight of the centrality of <italic>reconciliation in the narrow sense</italic>, which refers to dealing with the specific pain and suffering of the victims of political violence, i.e. uncovering the historical events such as violent acts in the form of some legal, non-legal or other measures. <italic>Societal reconciliation</italic> or <italic>symphiliosis</italic> takes a longer-term approach to social, cultural, psychological and political processes of reconciliation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0011392112456508">Trimikliniotis, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0011392112456508">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a strong case for arguing that the processes ought to be discussed before a settlement, and initiatives <italic>should begin beforehand, but they can only be truly operational during and after a settlement</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0011392112456508">Trimikliniotis, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0011392112456508">2010</xref>). Societal reconciliation, as opposed to <italic>elite reconciliation</italic>, should thus be seen as an essential and integral part of the resolution. As such, it must be perceived as a range of policies and social processes that enable the transformation of the results of historic conflicts and wars, in which the driving forces in turn engender institutional and societal changes in attitudes, perceptions and praxis.</p>
<p>Reconciliation as a distinct feature of South Africa’s post-apartheid transition has been aptly heralded as ‘a remarkable negotiated revolution’ of global significance. But what can we then conclude about reconciliation in <italic>global</italic> terms? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">Sitas (2008)</xref> speaks of a ‘global ethic of reconciliation’ as ‘Nelson Mandela’s gesture of reconciliation resonates everywhere, moving people from Mexico to China’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>): ‘The specific “model” in resolving intractable conflicts offers a more appropriate framework for a globalised and increasingly entangled and polarising world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2011</xref>: 571).</p>
<p>Balibar’s concept of <italic>civility</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392112456508">2002a</xref>) is the answer to be juxtaposed to <italic>cruelty</italic> and suffering resulting from the failures of modernity and ‘the dark side of democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392112456508">Bauman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011392112456508">Mann, 2005</xref>). We can thus extend the logic of Sitas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011392112456508">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">2011</xref>), who identifies three key features in the ‘ethic of reconciliation’: (a) ‘the “other” (however defined) is not eliminable surplus – and such an “other” defined by inherent and immutable attributes would be racist’; (b) ‘the “other” is non-enslaveable and non-exploitable’; (c) ‘the “other” is not a “non” and therefore is nonexcludable or marginalizable from social norms or rights despite gender, race, ethnos or caste-like group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011392112456508">Sitas, 2011</xref>: 571). Sitas was more concerned with the ‘ethic of reconciliation’; while this present article is more concerned with reconciliation per se.</p>
<p>Sociological thinking on reconciliation as a genuinely <italic>global or universal</italic> concept is embedded in the social, political, ideological and cultural reality, the particularities and the social struggles of peoples. The concept has contested and ambiguous ‘histories’; but so do all ideals and virtues worth arguing for, believing, even dying for. One strand has been institutionalised and draws on Christian religious doctrines, western conflict resolution and ‘liberal peace’ models. Other strands are more critical as they subject the concept to the critiques of modernity. If we have learned something from sociology, as well as thinking derived from Gramsci to Foucault, from feminism, anti-racism and post-colonial thinking, any heuristic devices, techniques, technologies and ideas are hardly neutral, pure or objective; they are very much part of the order of things. They therefore contain the contradictions of power, interests and ideologies as well as social, economic and political struggles in society. As such we need a reconceptualisation in order to render the concept truly universal, legitimate, relevant and operational for sociological enquiry.</p>

<title>Conclusion: For a sociology of conflict and reconciliation</title>
<p>A condition precedent for universalising the concept of reconciliation is to subject its various interpretations to critique, so that the concept undoes its Eurocentric biases, and then to reconstruct it so as to embed it within the various social, cultural, economic and political contexts. The concept can be retrieved, refined and operationalised for sociological enquiry for the purposes of learning and comparing ethnically/socially deeply divided societies. Different societies deal differently with the legacies and practices of violence, polarisations, human rights violations and ethnic exclusions. Further development of such comparative endeavours would enhance knowledge for academic purposes and may even have an impact on policy formulation. Sociological insights into the origins, development and cycles of conflict, the dialectic of violence/non-violence, transitions from wars (international and civil), partitions and polarisations to societies and states based on peaceful coexistence are valuable in enriching our knowledge. Such insights can surpass any CR studies reducing reconciliation to mere ‘techniques’ or political toolkit models ridden with unsubstantiated assumptions and biases.</p>
<p>While recognising that there are crucial political, legal, psychological and anthropological aspects in such an endeavour, a sociological analysis would illuminate essential <italic>social underpinnings, meanings and practices than can enrich all other disciplines</italic>. Scholars, practitioners and activists in conflict resolution can benefit by drawing on the richness and nuances produced by current sociological thinking. Sociology itself as a discipline is in constant need of renewal. As the world is getting more complex, unstable, uncertain about its future, and arguably more polarised, sociologists are forced to sharpen their explanatory frames in protracted social problems threatening lives and well-being. In this sense, <italic>a sociology of conflict and reconciliation</italic> would be enormously beneficial: this would allow for more scope in the study of the processes of reconciliation within a dynamic, conflict-ridden and polarised social reality.</p>
