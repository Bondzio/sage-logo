<abstract>
<p>Although ethical leadership by formal nurse leaders is critical to enhancing ethical health-care practice, research has shown that many nurses feel unsupported by their leaders. In this article, we consider the limited attention directed toward ethical leadership of formal nurse leaders and how our own research on ethical nurse leadership compares to other research in this field. In searching <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> since its inception 20 years ago, we found only a dozen articles that directly addressed this topic. We then reviewed nurses’ professional codes of ethics in Canada and found significant retractions of ethical guidelines for formal nurse leaders’ ethical responsibilities over the past decade. We began to seek explanations of why this is so and offer some recommendations for the study and enhancement of ethics for formal nurse leadership.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a general assumption that formal nurse leaders can and should provide ethical leadership by demonstrating ethical practice and providing support for ethical practice of registered nurses. “Role modeling ethical management practice is one of the most forceful ways to promote ethics in practice” (p. 156)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012474291">1</xref></sup> and can foster nurses’ ability to embed ethics into health-care and nursing practice. Yet over a lengthy period of research with practicing Canadian registered nurses, we found that many nurses feel unsupported by their formal nurse leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012474291">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012474291">5</xref></sup> Even when frontline nurses take informal leadership roles to enhance ethical practice, their actions to build a moral community cannot be sustained if they are unsupported by their formal nurse leaders. At the same time, we found that formal nurse leaders had difficulty supporting initiatives of frontline nurses to enhance their ethical practice, and we began to question what limits their ability to do so and what broader contextual influences might be shaping such difficulties. To clarify, in this article, we use “nurse leaders” as a broad term to indicate individual registered nurses in various leadership roles (manager, administrator, charge nurse, supervisor, etc.) who provide support to frontline registered nurses. The expectation for ethical leadership is that these individuals take responsibility to engage in ethical behavior and provide leadership in building a moral community, that is, a workplace where values are made clear and are shared, where these values direct ethical action, and where individuals feel safe to be heard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012474291">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To find answers to this question, we sought to explore a series of questions including the following:

<title>Background to the concern about and significance of ethical leadership</title>
<p>In 2006, Storch and Pauly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012474291">7</xref></sup> developed a paper titled, “Take me to your leader” as part of a broader study of ethical nursing practice. This unpublished manuscript was written against the backdrop of severe fiscal reductions in most Canadian provinces. These reductions aimed at “re-structuring and re-engineering health care”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012474291">8</xref></sup> had a wave of impacts. An estimated 7000 formal nurse leaders were removed from their managerial and administrator positions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012474291">9</xref></sup> and thousands of nurses were dismissed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012474291">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012474291">11</xref></sup> This devastation was supported by many who championed the motto that “every nurse is a leader.” With that message, seemingly accepted by many frontline registered nurses, senior health-care administrators had good cause to remove formal nurse leaders and assume that every registered nurse could manage without a leader to guide and support nursing practice. The effect was a loss of visible and available nurse leaders, dilution of the leadership of any remaining formal nurse leaders, and an identity crisis among nurse leaders. This change is still evident in the multitude of titles currently used by formal leaders responsible for nursing who do not have “nursing” in their title, such as “clinical leader” or “program manager.” The loss of a nursing title, specifically in Canada, creates a challenge in identifying sources of visible and accessible nurse leaders for both the leader and the follower.</p>
<p>Health-care reform and deep cuts to health care and nursing began in the late 1980s in Canada and other countries extending into the 1990s. During this time, articles about moral distress began to appear in nursing literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012474291">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012474291">14</xref></sup> These initial articles all emphasized the important support role registered nurses required from their formal nurse leaders to address moral distress. In addition, research tools to measure moral distress were developed, and publications focused on the ethical climate and the leaders’ role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012474291">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012474291">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our own research, initially involving 19 focus groups with nurses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012474291">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012474291">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012474291">18</xref></sup> and later involving a 3-year participatory action research project with frontline nurses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012474291">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012474291">4</xref></sup> reinforced that nurses in practice were lacking the support needed to provide safe, compassionate, competent, and ethical care, with resultant moral distress. We have also found that formal nurse leaders were conflicted and faced their own challenges. More detail on these findings will be reported in a forthcoming article.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012474291">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beginning in 2005, articles on moral distress and ethical climate began to appear in <italic>Nursing Ethics.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012474291">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012474291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012474291">32</xref></sup> These latter articles may appear to be misplaced in this account, but the issues of moral distress and ethical climate have implications for nursing and organizational ethics. In part, these issues highlight the importance of the supportive role required from formal nurse leaders. In our research, we saw the struggles of formal nurse leaders as a critical dimension requiring attention in order to provide the necessary support for ethical nursing practice of frontline registered nurses. With these pressing issues in mind, what guidance for ethical responsibilities of leadership has been available to formal nurse leaders?</p>

<sec id="section3-0969733012474291">
<title>Attention to ethical responsibilities of nurse leaders in<italic> Nursing Ethics</italic>
</title>
<p>In a cursory review of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic>, we found only a dozen articles directly related to ethics and nurse leadership, the first of which was published in 1996.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012474291">33</xref></sup> That means there was less than one article per year over the 20-year period of the journal. We encountered difficulties in searching this literature because titles of formal nurse leaders varied considerably including nurse executive, administrator, director, manager, head nurse, charge nurse, unit manager, nursing supervisor, clinical nurse coordinator, team leader, facility manager, operations leader, bed utilization manager, and so forth. In a recent edition of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic>, Suhonen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012474291">34</xref></sup> noted this same problem in their literature review of organizational ethics, which overlaps with our topic of nursing ethics. They concluded that “there is a need for concept analysis and concept development to bring definition to terms used in organizational and administrative ethics” (p. 298). Organizational ethics includes board members, senior administrators, and managers, including formal nurse leaders. While Suhonen and her colleagues have done a stellar job of their literature review on organizational ethics related to health care, we wish to focus specifically on one aspect of this larger field, the ethical responsibilities of formal nurse leaders.</p>
<p>Hendel and Steinman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012474291">35</xref></sup> studied Israeli nurse managers’ organizational values, based on their thesis that the changing work environment required attention to new organizational values. They concluded that the nurse managers needed to redefine nursing values to facilitate transition from organizational models to a changing work environment that required increasing administrative responsibilities for the nurse manager. Finnish researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012474291">36</xref></sup> focused on how the work environment in intensive care units (ICUs) was related to the quality of patient care. They found that the ICU nurses they studied were positive about their work environment because they had opportunities to engage in discussion with colleagues and they had access to support to address ethical problems. However, many ICU nurses highlighted concerns that their organization’s culture was not ethical, and they were unsure whether their immediate supervisor would support them in difficult situations in their ethical practice.</p>
<p>Other articles focused on specific problems in nursing management such as chemical dependence of nursing colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012474291">33</xref></sup> and ethical conflicts in performing utilization reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012474291">37</xref></sup> Bell’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012474291">37</xref></sup> conclusion was that nurses involved in utilization reviews need to be “philosophically competent” (p. 553) to manage the conflicts. The need for greater attention to incorporate ethics in decision making was emphasized by both Chiu and Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012474291">33</xref></sup> and Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012474291">38</xref></sup> as they investigated and drew conclusions about downsizing of health care.</p>
<p>The ethical dimension of formal nursing leadership relative to specific issues is examined by several writers. Supervision of nurses, with a focus on its impact on nurses’ moral decision making, has been studied and discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012474291">39</xref></sup> De Raeve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012474291">40</xref></sup> maintained that “clinical supervision … provides a forum for preservation or restoration of integrity in nursing” (p. 489). Other writers emphasized the importance of using ethical theory to establish frameworks for ethical decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012474291">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012474291">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012474291">42</xref></sup> Two recent articles focused on codes of ethics for nurse managers and nurse directors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012474291">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012474291">44</xref></sup> One article was from Finland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012474291">43</xref></sup> and the authors emphasized allocation of scarce personnel resources and ensuring the quality of care. A second article was from the European Nurse Directors Association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012474291">44</xref></sup> and included the contents of a proto-code designed to be adapted to different countries or organizations as required. Toren and Wagner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012474291">42</xref></sup> also supported the development of a nursing management code of ethics with an emphasis on managers’ responsibilities to staff, the rights and responsibilities of nursing staff, and relationships as a team. Furthermore, two research teams focused on developing instruments. Töyry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012474291">45</xref></sup> developed a measure to assess “humane caring” for the use of managers, which included questionnaires and interviews for patients and staff. And more recently, Öztürk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012474291">46</xref></sup> developed an administrative ethical behavior scale to determine nurses’ views about head nurses’ ethical and unethical administrative behavior.</p>
<p>In summary, publications in <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> initially focus on specific managerial ethics issues, gradually moving to a discussion of organizational ethical issues with proposals for how ethical leadership could be enhanced or how expectations of ethical leadership of formal nurse leaders need to change.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> is the only journal containing articles on ethics and formal nurse leadership responsibilities. Many health management-oriented journals contain occasional articles related to ethics for leaders. In addition, nursing management texts normally include attention to ethics in leadership and management, some with entire chapters devoted to this topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012474291">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012474291">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012474291">48</xref></sup> In addition, Silva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012474291">49</xref></sup> published one of the few texts devoted to ethics and nursing administration. The need for formal nurse leadership in ethics and organizational management has not abated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012474291">
<title>Sources of guidance for formal nurse leaders</title>
<p>In a 1994 publication, Storch was bold in her suggestions for nurse managers and administrators to heed the call of ethical leadership responsibilities at macro-, meso-, and microlevels of their work within and outside their organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012474291">1</xref></sup> At macrolevels, leaders were called to be spokespersons, political strategists, and advocates “for health care reform, for maximizing the utilization of nurses as a valuable human resource, advocating client-centered attention in government policy and law reform, and ensuring nurses’ voices are heard and their views well represented” (p. 155). At the mesolevel, ethical responsibilities called for the nurse manager to serve as the conscience of the health-care team, to avoid compromises that lead to decreased standards of care by neutralizing nursing contributions, to interpret nursing clearly, to support research, to support developing guidelines for client care, and to support nurses in dealing with ethical problems. At the microlevel, nurse managers were called on to foster healthy work environments, create a climate that fosters caring and connectedness, recognize the importance of meeting nurses’ needs in order to meet client needs, and provide meaningful participation in decision making. They were also reminded that “… to deskill and to displace is to devalue” nurses and nursing (p. 156). However, later statements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012474291">48</xref></sup> are not nearly as bold or forceful and are so gentle that such considerations would likely be missed by the reader. Was this because the ideals and the realities of formal nurse leadership were no longer a fit with the changing leadership positions and/or had organizational values changed?</p>
<p>It is significant to observe the trend in nursing codes of ethics in Canada over time as well. When the Canadian Nurses Association’s (CNA) code of ethics was published in 1985,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733012474291">50</xref></sup> it included an ethical standard specific for formal nurse leaders:
<disp-quote>
<p>Administrators bear special responsibilities that flow from a concern for present and future clients. The nurse administrator seeks to ensure that the competencies of personnel are used efficiently. Working within available resources, the administrator seeks to ensure the welfare of clients. When competent care is threatened due to inadequate resources or for some other reason, the administrator acts to minimize the present danger and to prevent future harm. (p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote>In the years that followed, three other CNA Codes were released in 1991, 1997, and 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733012474291">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012474291">53</xref></sup> All these Codes contained a specific directive to nurses in formal nurse leadership positions. In fact, the 2002 Code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012474291">53</xref></sup> contained a statement directing nurse leaders to “strive to provide adequate staff to meet the requirements for nursing care as part of their fundamental responsibility to promote practice environments where fitness to practice and safe care could be maintained … [and] with their staff, they should work towards the development of a moral community” (p. 18). But when the latest CNA Code was released in 2008,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012474291">6</xref></sup> there was no directive to impose a different or greater ethical responsibility upon formal nurse leaders than any other registered nurse. Why the change in calls to actions for nurse leaders? Was it a recognition that such expectations were difficult to meet in the current health-care climate?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012474291">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We believe that the micro-, meso-, and macrostatements by Storch in 1994<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012474291">1</xref></sup> continue to be meaningful and critical to the ethical responsibilities of a formal nurse leader in 2012 and beyond. From our studies on moral distress and moral climate, there is a steady theme that emphasized the importance of the nurse leader’s role in working together with frontline nurses to address the ethics of work environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012474291">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012474291">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012474291">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012474291">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012474291">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012474291">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012474291">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969733012474291">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969733012474291"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969733012474291">56</xref></sup> Yet, the relative paucity of publications in <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic>, the lack of emphasis in other publications, and even the removal of such responsibility from the CNA Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012474291">6</xref></sup> makes this a challenging matter. Although we have focused on the Canadian context of formal nurse leaders and the CNA’s Code of Ethics, we believe that the situation for formal nurse leaders is common in other Western countries.</p>
<p>Massive changes have occurred in health-care delivery, including reengineered care and creating complex positions for nurses in executive positions. Shannon and French<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012474291">8</xref></sup> summarized major emerging trends that have changed the position of many formal nurse leaders, chiefly nurse executives, who are now managing multidisciplinary programs and are connected in different ways to operations. They questioned if these “powerful nurses … can make their professional expertise visible and valued by the organization in general and the nursing staff in particular” (p. 235). These formal nurse leaders need to incorporate organizational values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012474291">35</xref></sup> while also critically questioning and resisting values-in-action that drive activities to threaten safe, compassionate, competent, and ethical care by frontline registered nurse staff. To do so, they require greater support at higher levels in organizations.</p>
<p>Earlier in this article, an observation was made that frontline nurses need their leader’s support so they in turn can support their clients. In the same way, formal nurse leaders need support themselves to carry out their ethical responsibilities to their staff. Of interest in this respect is that results of a study by Mitton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969733012474291">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969733012474291">58</xref></sup> suggested “that moral distress is a relevant managerial concept not unique to clinical staff,” (ref. 57, p. 109) particularly in the managerial functions of setting priorities and allocating resources. Managers reported that they found that discussion to validate their distress provided support in their moral distress. These authors concluded that resource allocation frameworks need to be regarded as ethical devices, not just economic aids. It may be that revisiting ethical standards or codes of ethics for executives and managers is timely and that even the process of considering standards or codes may provide support for formal health-care and nurse leaders. The publications by Aitamaa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012474291">43</xref></sup> and Stievano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012474291">44</xref></sup> are inspiring and helpful as they offer a collective potential for utilizing codes of ethics to promote and enhance formal leader attention to ethical responsibilities.</p>

<title>Recommendations and conclusions</title>
<p>As we have reviewed our research program in nursing ethics that has included attention to formal nurse leadership, first by default and then by serious planning to engage formal nurse leaders in our studies, we have found that the expressions of registered nurses about their need for administrative support have not changed over time. Greater attention must be focused on how to support formal nurse leaders in recognizing and articulating their ethical responsibilities. We believe it is imperative that leaders in research and education work in collaboration with formal nurse leaders: this could include supporting development of realistic and feasible ethical codes that uphold ideals of the profession. Ultimately, there is a fundamental need to seek ways to fill the gap between what registered nurses need and what is missing.</p>
<p>Our recommendations are as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Further research is needed to determine how nurse leaders perceive their role with regard to ethics and how specific strategies may be developed to help them take up these responsibilities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is timely to engage in debate and dialogue about the development of ethical standards for formal nurse leaders. We recommend that these standards be developed by nurse leaders themselves. Development of these guidelines can provide support for leaders and allow leaders to explicitly address the contextual supports that they need given their work environments. Our hope is that such standards for ethical nursing leadership may strategically allow leaders to have further conversations with their executive teams about how they may not only model ethical practice but may also be visible and supportive to frontline nurses.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Formal nurse leaders should engage with their executive or managerial team to discuss each team member’s perception of their ethical responsibilities and how those can be met. This may include discussion and application of existing ethical guidelines or the need to develop new guidelines. For example, the Canadian College of Health Leaders’ <italic>Code of ethics</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0969733012474291">59</xref></sup> may need to be revised to provide more substance for the varying responsibilities of members of executive or managerial teams.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To meet “the need for a supply of nurses willing and able to step into formal administration and other leadership roles” (p. 6),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012474291">9</xref></sup> nurse educators and formal nurse executives must work together to prepare nurses for executive leadership. This would include management development as well as knowledge and skill advancement in ethical leadership.</p>
