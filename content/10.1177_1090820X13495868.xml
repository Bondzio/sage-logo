<body>
<p>Reduction mammaplasty is a relatively common surgical procedure. Patients who undergo breast reduction surgery often seek relief from symptoms such as neck and back pain, inframammary rashes, and furrowing of bra straps on the shoulders. Most of them also desire the best possible aesthetic result. A major factor contributing to aesthetic appearance is the amount of visible postoperative scarring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13495868">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many procedures for reduction mammaplasty have been described in the literature, and new methods and modifications abound. As with other surgeries, no single operation is superior and suitable for all patients. Technique selection varies according to the location of the pedicle, the scar pattern, or both of these factors. Common scar patterns include, but are not limited to, the inverted-T scar (Wise pattern), the vertical scar, and the “no vertical scar” technique (horizontal breast reduction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13495868">2</xref></sup> The most widely used technique is the inverted T-scar because it is suitable for a wide variety of breast sizes and shapes. However, it produces a scar with periareolar, horizontal, and vertical components and has the propensity for medial and lateral “dog ears.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495868">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13495868">4</xref></sup> The vertical technique has been gaining interest primarily due to the surgeon’s ability to produce a short vertical scar and a periareolar scar, but this method is not well suited for breasts of moderate to large size and has a high rate of revision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495868">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13495868">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13495868"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13495868">7</xref></sup> However, the vertical technique does avoid lateral dog ears and produces good long-term projection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13495868">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13495868">9</xref></sup> The horizontal pattern of breast reduction is suitable for most ptotic breasts and aims to eliminate the vertical component of the scar by using a periareolar incision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495868">10</xref></sup> The periareolar scar is designed to be tension free, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing, more rounded shape for the areola.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495868">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Plastic surgeons continue to debate the relative merits of each method of breast reduction. Studies that have compared patient and surgeon postoperative satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes for various techniques have shown that scarring is the most likely cause of dissatisfaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495868">11</xref></sup>; however, patient preference is not often reported in the literature. A few studies have assessed patient preferences retrospectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495868">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13495868">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13495868">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study was designed to prospectively determine patient preferences regarding scar patterns after breast reduction, comparing the 3 most common scar patterns used in North America: horizontal, vertical, and Wise. Because patients desire the least visible scarring after reduction mammaplasty, we hypothesized that they would favor the horizontal scar pattern.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X13495868" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board of St Joseph’s Healthcare in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Tri-Council Policy Statement.</p>
<p>From April 2011 to August 2012, 66 consecutive patients referred to the senior author (N.M.H.) for reduction mammaplasty surgery were recruited for participation in the study. The participants were given a questionnaire prior to surgical consultation and their answers were confidential and unknown to the surgeon during consultation. The questionnaire is available as an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com/supplemental">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com/supplemental</ext-link>. Our target population was women referred for breast reduction surgery because we assumed that they had a vested interest in scar placement and would be likely to most closely represent the opinion of the general population undergoing reduction mammaplasty. Inclusion criteria were age greater than 18 years and symptoms of breast hypertrophy such as neck and back pain, skin rash, and bra-strap grooving. Excluded from the study were patients who had undergone previous breast surgery, requested mastopexy, or desired breast reduction for purely aesthetic reasons. In addition, patients who requested liposuction reduction were not included. Patients who met the inclusion criteria provided informed consent prior to study participation.</p>
<p>Patients’ responses to the questionnaire had no impact on medical management. Our standard of care for reduction mammaplasty is to utilize the most appropriate technique for each patient to achieve outstanding aesthetic and functional results in a safe manner. Although the senior author offers patients only the horizontal or the vertical reduction technique, the Wise pattern was included in this study to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the 3 most common techniques used in North America. The questionnaire results were unknown to the senior author during the consultation and were kept anonymous. This minimized the potential for an ethical dilemma in which the surgeon would potentially perform a procedure that the patient had previously judged to yield unsatisfactory scars.</p>
<p>To illustrate the location of visible scars, each patient was shown line drawings and representative postoperative photographs of the typical results of reduction mammaplasty with each of the 3 techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13495868">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13495868"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13495868">3</xref>). Since the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the scars visible to the patient, the number of drawings and photographs was kept to a minimum, which also avoided redundancy. The patients scored the scars on a modified 10-point Likert scale (1 = unacceptable; 10 = acceptable).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>A sample size of 60 was required to detect a small difference (of 1.5 in score) between the 3 means, ensuring that β = 80%, α &lt; 0.016, and σ = 2.5. This would also account for a 10% rate of incomplete forms. Based on this statistical calculation, the total number of subjects could be limited to those who had a vested interest in breast reduction surgery and scar placement. Means with standard deviations and medians with maximum and minimum values were reported for all continuous variables. A nonparametric Friedman test was used to compare mean scores. Generalized linear regression analysis was performed to adjust for age, body mass index (BMI), and torso/bra size. Post hoc analysis was performed using the Bonferroni method (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .016). A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.001 was considered statistically significant. SPSS software (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois), version 20, was used for all statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides evidence that, with regard to scar placement, the horizontal technique of breast reduction is preferred by patients. This finding was independent of age, BMI, or torso/bra size.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first designed to prospectively evaluate patient preferences regarding postoperative scars. Other studies have assessed preferences retrospectively. In 2003, Cruz-Korchin and Korchin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495868">3</xref></sup> published findings from their randomized controlled study that compared outcomes between the Wise and vertical techniques of breast reduction in moderate resections. Six months postoperatively, patients were sent questionnaires to evaluate their satisfaction with surgery outcomes. Study participants ranked the vertical scar pattern significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) than the Wise pattern with respect to scar placement (6 ± 2 vs 3 ± 3) and overall aesthetic result (8 ± 1 vs 6 ± 3). However, the study did not include the horizontal technique.</p>
<p>Some investigators have attempted to delineate which component of the Wise scar pattern is least appealing to patients: the horizontal, the vertical, or the areolar portion. In 2007, Sprole et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13495868">12</xref></sup> performed a retrospective chart review of 121 patients who underwent the Wise technique of breast reduction. Patients were sent a questionnaire at least 1 year postoperatively and asked to rate their level of satisfaction following surgery and the extent to which they were bothered by their scars. Although 86% of the patients stated that they were highly satisfied with the surgery, 65% noted that they were dissatisfied with their scars. Interestingly, 65% of the patients indicated that the horizontal component of the Wise pattern bothered them the most because that scar was irritating or itchy. Fifty percent reported that they would want their vertical component erased. The results confirm that there is widespread patient dissatisfaction with scar placement, especially the visible scars. In an effort to determine which part of the Wise scar pattern was the most bothersome to patients, Celebiler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13495868">13</xref></sup> studied the various components of this pattern and concluded that patients were most pleased with the periareolar scars and least satisfied with the horizontal scars.</p>
<p>Passot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13495868">14</xref></sup> is credited as the first to describe the “no vertical scar” procedure (in 1925). More recently, Lalonde et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13495868">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495868">10</xref></sup> have achieved excellent aesthetic results with this technique. The primary advantage of this method, also known as the horizontal technique, is that there is no vertical scar, unlike the Wise and vertical techniques. Moreover, patients appear less “operated” after their surgery. The junction of the areolar skin and breast skin helps to conceal the periareolar scar, and the inframammary scar is concealed under the breast. Patients who undergo the horizontal technique only see the periareolar scar when looking in the mirror, and they only see the inframammary scar if they lift their breasts.</p>
<p>Our study also shows that the horizontal method of breast reduction is preferred with respect to scar placement. However, proper patient selection is imperative because this technique is not appropriate for all breasts. Candidates for this procedure should have at least 5 cm of skin between the areola and the anticipated new site of the areola.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13495868">15</xref></sup> Lalonde and Lalonde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13495868">15</xref></sup> reported that 70% of their patients met this criterion.</p>
<p>Our study was designed strictly to assess patient preference with respect to scar placement. We did not consider factors that influence patient satisfaction with the overall surgery, such as breast shape, relief of symptoms, or nipple sensation. In future studies, we plan to use a questionnaire that evaluates scars as well as shape, in a trade-off fashion, whereby the patient can specify what is most important to her. This information will help the surgeon select the most appropriate technique for each patient. In addition, it would be helpful to question the same cohort of women in a follow-up study to compare preoperative and postoperative opinions. It was not possible to perform this type of analysis in the present study because the questionnaires were completed anonymously.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study was the use of photographs to assess 3-dimensional outcomes. Bias was minimized by providing representative photographs of the average expected results and explaining to patients that typical results can vary. Because our objective was to assess which visible scar was least desirable to patients, we felt that the questionnaire would be the most practical tool to achieve this goal.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As hypothesized, the present study indicated that patients do prefer the “no vertical scar” (horizontal) technique over the vertical and Wise patterns in terms of expected postoperative scarring. Thus, plastic surgeons should make a conscious effort to include the horizontal technique among their procedures for reduction mammaplasty.</p>
