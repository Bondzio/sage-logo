<p>This article explores the use of video in qualitative research. In particular, it focuses on the ways video recordings can be used to document cooperative work and tacit participation in a work setting. The article first presents previous research on participation framework, cooperation and multimodal interaction, then examines a single episode of interaction in a medical emergency call and dispatch centre. The article discusses aspects of coordination and collaboration emerging from the interaction between two people; a call taker and a dispatcher, working side by side during the managing of an emergency call. It explores the way in which social interaction can be studied even when there is no apparent correlation between different courses of action and how video can be used in order to reveal such subtle interaction work. The article finally examines the way in which video can document back stage practices that are central to much work practice but that are hidden from official documents.</p>

<title>Video, participation and work</title>
<p>The subject of this article is the use of video to document cooperative work and tacit participation in a work setting. The empirical materials come from research that I have conducted in the recent past in an Italian emergency call centre. My concern in this article is to show how video can be a natural instrument with which to document what we can gloss as the ‘back stage’ practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111436140">Goffman, 1959</xref>) to which workers are mutually oriented when providing a service to a citizen. In the case discussed, the service is provided mainly by telephone or radio, not face to face. Several studies have already well demonstrated how video recordings of routine working days afford access to a variety of subtle and unpredictable ways in which the interaction between caller and operators maintains smooth and seamless talk amid a complex work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794111436140">Mondada, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794111436140">Whalen and Vinkhuyzen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794111436140">Whalen et al., 2002</xref>). Other studies have compellingly shown how video recordings are powerful means with which to study social interaction in workplaces among colleagues, with particular reference to the delicate ways in which common tasks are executed or separate lines of actions are brought together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111436140">Heath and Luff, 2000</xref>). My goal is to show how video analysis can reveal the subtle tacit work performed by operators in an emergency call centre beneath the surface of the service provided to callers.</p>
<p>Cooperation among the operators was an omnipresent feature of work at the emergency operations centre that I studied and in particular among the personnel directly involved in the management of events. Cooperation took place at several levels. First, there was a functional division of labour and responsibilities between two operators working side by side in the booth. One was the ‘call taker’ and was responsible for taking telephone calls asking for assistance, and for collecting the information necessary to respond to the emergency. The other was the ‘dispatcher’, who received the relevant information from the call-taker, identified the vehicles to be deployed on the ground, and maintained contact with them throughout the entire operation. A second level of cooperation, a highly complex and fluid one, did not depend on the formal differentiation of the operators’ work, although it was connected with it. This second level consisted of the web of informal and tacit practices that enabled joint and flexible management of activities by the operators during the handling of telephone or radio calls. It was based on a situated logic and on ad hoc decision-making processes that unfolded case by case, moment after moment, according to ongoing contingencies. The aim of the article is to show how it is possible to describe tacit cooperation processes of this second type by means of a video analysis.</p>
<p>The article shares the analytical stance of what has been known as the ‘workplace studies’ strand of video research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794111436140">Heath et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468794111436140">Luff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794111436140">Mondada, 2002</xref>), inspired by ethnomethodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794111436140">Rawls, 2008</xref>). Among the many possible ways to analyse video recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111436140">Borzeix et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111436140">Goldman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111436140">Knoblauch et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794111436140">2008</xref>), my approach consists in showing the reciprocal relevance of social actions for the very same people involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111436140">Heath, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111436140">Heath and Hindmarsh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111436140">Heath et al., 2010</xref>). Rather than applying a commonsense reading of the video material or using – from outside the situation that was recorded – a checklist of theoretical concerns, the aim of the analysis is to document the ways in which certain actions are demonstrably relevant for the participants in a situation. The point is not that an action may be meaningful, but to show how it is consequential for the activities at hand: it should carry some meaning <italic>for someone at the scene</italic>. Interaction is considered an object of analysis in light of the temporal unfolding of action, given that interaction is not merely a matter of time passing by, but rather of talk, positions, and bodily orientations loaded with local history: they are considered as both an account of previous actions and reflexively as the context for future ones. Noticeable in a span of interaction is an orderly temporal arrangement of sequential positions. Drawing on my emergency data, I intend to show that even when it seems that ongoing activities are being performed by an individual and isolated operator, his/her actions involve (sometimes directly and explicitly, sometimes in a rather oblique and unpredictable way) the other operator at the work station.</p>
<p>Video is central to this analytical endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111436140">Büscher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794111436140">Goodwin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111436140">Knoblauch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794111436140">Mondada, 2006</xref>). Much research has already well documented that, while talking is a central resource for gaining shared understanding, a variety of body positions, movements and gestures, directions of gaze, handling of material objects and technological apparatus, as well as the ecology of the space, all constitute powerful resources that members can use to give meaning and intelligibility to the situation, and to achieve the smooth execution of practical tasks. Recordings that, as far as possible, maintain intact this complex web of multimodal resources used by members to communicate are essential in order to gain access to phenomena that are ephemeral and fleeting yet extraordinarily powerful and meaningful. Through the analysis of video it is possible to analyse also the (unexpected) ways in which talking itself has consequences for people not in a state of talk but simply sharing the same ecological situation.</p>

<title>Work, technology and collaboration in an emergency control centre</title>
<p>Video analysis gives access to the details of work practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111436140">Heath and Luff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794111436140">Hindmarsh and Heath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111436140">Hindmarsh and Llewellyn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794111436140">Llewellyn and Hindmarsh, 2010</xref>). In my particular case, I studied the work at a medical emergency operations centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111436140">Fele, 2008</xref>). An incoming telephone call or radio communication opens a participation regime that officially involves only the operator in charge of handling that particular call (the call-taker or the dispatcher). Every incoming telephone call and radio communication activates a case-management mechanism that ‘represents’ the organization’s ‘front’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111436140">Goffman, 1959</xref>: 32). Goffman uses the term ‘performance’ to denote ‘all the activity of an individual which occurs during a period marked by his continuous presence before a particular set of observers and which has some influence on them’, and he defines ‘front’ as ‘that part of the individual’s performance which regularly functions in a general and fixed fashion to define the situation for those who observe it’ (p. 32). Besides its dramaturgical terminology, Goffman’s work can be used as a first approach to video analysis. It enables us to see the communicative work of the operations centre operators only as the final stage of a complex process of interaction between the parties in the situation. Telephone or radio communications can be considered the finished product of concurrent work of preparation, assembly and packaging that is radically social and that does not figure directly in the final record. When isolated from the context in which they are produced, these (verbal) communications by the operations centre seem to concern a single responsible individual. When viewed within the setting where they are produced to become an institutional and formal finished product, they are the result of collective and social work that entails intense cooperation among the persons involved and co-present in that setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794111436140">Whalen and Zimmerman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The video also makes it possible to see exactly how the communication technology plays an important role in socially shaping the actions of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111436140">Heath and Luff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794111436140">Suchman, 1997</xref>). Telephone calls provide examples of ‘bounded’ forms of communication: only the call-taker can hear the call. But this does not mean that the colleague sitting near to the call-taker cannot have an idea of what is happening on the telephone. The dispatcher can rely on what his/her colleague (the call-taker) is saying into the microphone. For a complete report on the event that has prompted the emergency call, the dispatcher must usually wait for the briefing that the call-taker makes immediately on conclusion of the telephone call. But in the meantime the dispatcher can gain some information relevant to the dispatch (what happened, where it happened, the degree of seriousness, etc.) only by overhearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111436140">Goffman, 1979</xref>) what her colleague says aloud to the microphone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111436140">Heath and Luff, 2000</xref>). This organization has an important consequence for the emergency procedure well before the call is over, in that it permits a dispatcher to anticipate the appropriate next action (for instance, calling an ambulance on the ground).</p>
<p>This case offers us excellent opportunities to explore the ways in which these technological apparatuses predispose affordances for the actions of participants, and offer to the participants a terrain on which to exploit interactional resources. In the case of emergency services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111436140">Fele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794111436140">Zimmerman, 1992</xref>), the collaborative and mutual sustained efforts of the operators in dealing with the task at hand constitute the back-stage of work at the operations centre, and they are not accessible to those at the other end of the radio or telephone communication line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794111436140">1</xref></sup> I now provide an example of the use of video in order to unpack this collaborative, tacit, back-stage work at the medical emergency operations centre that I visited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468794111436140">
<title>The context</title>
<p>The material analysed consists of video recordings made in an operations centre handling emergency calls to the 118 number in a region of North-Eastern Italy. Located in the main town of the region and opened in 1993, the medical emergency call centre (answering the emergency number 118) operates around the clock, 365 days a year, and coordinates 48 emergency stations distributed around the province (which has a surface area of circa 6200 kmq and around 478 thousand inhabitants), and a helicopter rescue service. In 2007, the operations centre handled 34,689 emergency situations, with an average of about 95 per day. In my research I conducted a preliminary ethnographic survey during which I collected around 45 hours of video recordings. I also collected the audio recordings of incoming and outgoing telephone calls and radio communications during the days and hours when the video recordings were made. The research began in 2003 and is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The work of handling emergencies at the town operations centre was organized around two ‘boxes’ or booths (#3 and #4) that received calls requesting assistance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468794111436140">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

</fig>
<p>Box 3 and Box 4 dealt with assistance calls coming from two different areas of the province. There was usually no communication between the two boxes, because each of them handled emergencies independently and was self-sufficient. Although the work space of each box was separate from the other, it was also permeable: it was possible to close the door and shut out interferences, but at the same time the walls were made of glass, so that it was always possible at least to see what was going on in the other box.</p>
<p>Two operators worked side by side in each box. They sat at a desk bearing computer screens, keyboards and mouse, radio sets, telephones, a closed-circuit television screen, sheets of paper, notebooks, and so on (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468794111436140">Figure 2</xref>):</p>

</fig>
<p>In the dispatch centre that I analysed there were two persons working together in a booth, with different institutional roles: one was in charge of answering the phone and receiving requests for assistance, the other was in charge of the dispatch. During their eight-hour work shift, these two persons more or less regularly alternated their roles, so that at one point the call-taker took over as dispatcher and vice versa. But this division of labour was not fixed once and for all, and it might happen for instance that the two operators dealt in parallel with two different incoming emergency calls.</p>
<p>This article deals with aspects of the coordination and collaboration emerging from the interaction between the two persons working together in a booth that could be caught on video tape. It usually happened that each operator did his/her work independently and in parallel with the other. But at some point the work of one operator intersected with that of the other. With a video analysis I shall concentrate on one episode. I examine a case in which an operator, although she was engaged in activity parallel to that of her colleague, demonstrated her awareness of what was happening next to her, paying attention to what was emerging from the telephone call being handled by her colleague.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that this mostly tacit work of mutual awareness of what was going on between the two operators sharing a social space of work is omitted from the official documents. The official audio recordings of phone or radio communications retain few traces of the collaborative and participative work among the operators. Of course, the official audio recordings powerfully document collaboration and coordination between the people at the two ends of the telephone or radio line. What they do not document is the cooperation and collaboration that goes on among the people at each end of the line. Video recordings allow us to have access to precisely that cooperation and collaboration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468794111436140">
<title>Tacit participation</title>
<p>I examine how people sharing a work space, even if they are engaged in different and often independent tasks, show that each of them know what is happening alongside them for all practical purposes, and at that moment. The whole episode lasts about one minute and through it we will follow in its entirety the handling of an emergency call. Not from the point of view of the caller nor from the point of view of the call-taker: but from the points of views of call-taker and dispatcher working side by side.</p>
<p>Consider the first excerpt. The scene begins with a call arriving at the operations centre, at a particularly busy moment when two other emergency calls have just been received and the operators are checking the resources on the ground. Maria, the call-taker, answers the telephone, while Antonia, the dispatcher, is busy with the computer and the radio. Two contiguous but apparently independent courses of action unfold. Marked in grey in the transcript is what can be heard only by the call-taker in her earphones and is not available to the dispatcher. The entire telephone call was recorded, and its full content is made available to the reader for the sake of legibility:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Transcript 1</bold>. Telephone call (beginning, lines 1–12). Maria call-taker (CT)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<graphic id="img1-1468794111436140" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-img1.tif"/>
<p>Almost simultaneously with this phone call dealt with by Maria, Antonia starts attending to an incoming radio call:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Transcript 2</bold>. Radio call. Antonia dispatcher (DS)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<graphic id="img2-1468794111436140" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-img2.tif"/>
<p>Apparently, these are two different, parallel and unrelated lines of action: one consists of dealing with the incoming emergency phone call, the other consists of dealing via radio with the ambulance on the ground. The two operators in the booth are each busy with its own line of action, and apparently there is no exchange between them. The video gives us access to the visual and bodily orientations of both operators. Both operators are visually and bodily oriented to the technological apparatus in front of them (the computer screen and the notebook for the call-taker, the radio set for the dispatcher). There is no apparent glancing or twisting of the bodies toward each other. When the emergency incoming call arrives at the centre, Maria orients herself toward the new task by activating the telephone communication, pressing the space bar on the keyboard placed to her left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468794111436140">Figure 3.1</xref>) and opening the call with the canonical phrase for the Italian medical emergency service (‘<italic>one one eight?</italic>’).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1468794111436140" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The reason for the telephone call turns out to be a request for assistance at the scene of a motorway accident. On reception of the communication, the video recording shows how Maria sets about taking notes on a pad placed in front of her on the desk. Maria picks up a pen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468794111436140">Figure 3.2</xref>), but rapidly puts it down again. Her right hand shifts to the mouse, which she uses to close a window left open on the computer screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468794111436140">Figure 3.3</xref>). Immediately afterwards, Maria picks the pen up again and with three broad strokes crosses out part of the sheet of paper in front of her (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468794111436140">Figures 3.4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468794111436140">3.5</xref>). She prepares to take notes on the lower part of the sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468794111436140">Figure 3.6</xref>) and then she asks ‘<italic>but where?</italic>’ (Transcript 1, line 4). Maria will keep this position during this first excerpt, taking notes about where the accident has happened, how many cars have been involved in the accident, and how many casualties there are.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1468794111436140" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Just slightly after the beginning of the phone call, there is an incoming call on the radio (Transcript 2, line 1: ‘<italic>central from five five seven</italic>’, where 557 is the code number of the emergency vehicle making the call). The video shows how Antonia leaves her position in front of the computer in order to answer to the radio call by shifting her left hand from the computer keyboard to the radio button (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468794111436140">Figures 4.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794111436140">4.1a</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig5-1468794111436140" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Antonia presses the button on the radio apparatus with her forefinger and opens the sound contact (‘<italic>go ahead</italic>’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468794111436140">Figures 4.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794111436140">4.2.a</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig6-1468794111436140" position="float">

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794111436140">Fig 4.1.a</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794111436140">Fig 4.2.a</xref> Antonia takes care of the entire radio communication that follows. The radio message that ensues is incomprehensible. Antonia immediately changes her posture by leaning slightly forward and turning her head to the right so that her left ear is close to the radio speaker. She says ‘<italic>I didn’t understand, could you repeat?</italic>’ (transcript 2, line 4). Her body is entirely oriented to the radio: she has stopped her activity on her computer so that she can concentrate on listening to the incoming reply on the radio. The radio reply contains the repair requested (‘<italic>the coverage at Perdive, is it green?</italic>’, line 5). The ambulance making the radio call to the operations centre has just been dispatched to cover a zone (the town of Perdive) left uncovered by the dispatch of a vehicle (based in Perdive) to an accident some distance away. The ambulance crew is asking whether the operational code for this ‘coverage’ should be ‘green’, i.e. the least critical operational level (out of three). Antonia’s reply specifies the operational code (‘<italic>yellow</italic>’, line 6) and it is followed by the final acknowledgement token from the radio caller (‘<italic>all right</italic>’, line 7).</p>
<p>One sees from these initial exchanges that the participation framework seems characterized by a certain reciprocal independence between the two operators. The two operators are engaged, with their talk and with their body displays, in two distinct yet contemporaneous tasks (one is responding by telephone to a new request for assistance; the other is responding by radio to a message from an ambulance on the ground busy with a previous emergency rescue). Apparently, each operator follows her own course of action independently from the other: their talk and bodily postures overtly signal that each operator is focused on her activity and is presumably not oriented to the other’s activity.</p>
<p>Yet the two courses of action are not reciprocally inconsequential. Maria is collecting information about an emergency case on the telephone; this information should then be made available to the dispatcher so that the ambulance (or whatever rescue vehicle is necessary) can be dispatched as soon as possible. What Maria is saying on the telephone may be consequentially relevant for her colleague sitting nearby. It is likely that Antonia is actively oriented toward the actions of her colleague in order to gather as much information as possible about the case at hand. Antonia, as an ‘overhearer’, is trying to make sense of what is going on over the telephone in order to gain an idea of what kind of emergency needs help, and what kind of actions will soon be needed from her in order to give the appropriate organizational response to the emergency. Antonia is trying to take advantage of what Anna is saying on the telephone in order to anticipate what will be needed to accomplish the next relevant requested action: the dispatch of a rescue vehicle, before the actual closure of the call and the formal communication from the call-taker about the case and the details of the emergency. The video is an outstanding resource with which to explore these interactional subtleties.</p>
<p>If we consider what happens in the booth more closely, we can begin to appreciate how the two parallel and apparently unrelated tasks (the phone call and the radio communication) are subtly interconnected. The two events do not just occur at the same time; they are socially shaped. The video in this case is an excellent resource with which to see not only how a task is bodily accomplished but also how two tasks are subtly coordinated. The following transcription depicts what happens in the booth: in the first column on the left is what the call-taker says on the telephone; in the adjacent column to the right is what the dispatcher says on the radio, and what is hearable from the radio.</p>
<p>What we notice first is how Antonia, the dispatcher, modulates her turns in order to avoid overlaps with those of her colleague. She gives permission to speak to the radio when her colleague is not speaking. While she has no control over the production of radio talk, she has the opportunity to insert her turns in such a way that they do not overlap with her colleague’s turns. We left Antonia in her position as a dispatcher with her body shifted into a ‘receiving posture’ in order to maximize her comprehension of the forthcoming communication on the radio. But this does not prevent her from overhearing what is happening on the telephone line. Her colleague Maria produces her turn on the telephone: ‘<italic>but, southbound, anyway?</italic>’ (transcript 3, line 11). At that point Antonia can gain the information from Maria’s turn that something has happened on the motorway (the formulation <italic>southbound</italic> gives vital information – which carriageway is involved – always requested in the case of motorway accidents). Antonia is also in a position to access Maria’s ‘feelings’ at that moment. On conclusion of her turn Maria produces a loud ‘snort’ (‘<italic>ph:::::!</italic>’), which Antonia is able to hear because she is not speaking on the radio at that moment and the expected radio communication has not yet arrived. Maria’s ‘snort’ signals annoyance. It is a form of protest against a particularly irksome situation; it is a sort of ‘an understandable reaction to an understood event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111436140">Goffman, 1978</xref>), which has communicative value because it signals to others present that particular attention should be paid to what is happening. Remember that the actual call is the third in a row, and that the new request for emergency intervention puts the system under strain. Maria is expressing her discomfort with that situation, in which there is no time for the operators even to catch their breath. Antonia is sharing this situation and she able to hear that expression from Maria. Finally, Antonia can have access to the following turn in her colleague’s talk (‘<italic>how many cars [are involved], how many casualties are there?</italic>’ (transcript 3, lines 14-15), even if only the last part of the turn does not overlap with the incoming new radio communication (line 13).</p>

<p>Antonia is in a position to obtain another piece of relevant information in order to gain a better picture of the ongoing emergency: that there are cars involved and that there may be casualties. Only on conclusion of Maria’s question turn on the telephone does Antonia answer the radio caller (‘<italic>yellow</italic>’, transcript 3, line 16), carefully positioning it in such a way as to avoid overlapping with her colleague’s talk. Antonia then resumes her normal posture at her work station: she leans back and turns toward the computer, though still leaving her left hand poised on the radio communication button. When she has obtained confirmation from the radio that her message has been received (‘<italic>all right</italic>’, Transcript 3, line 19) Antonia releases also the radio button and turns her left hand to the computer keyboard. In this way she leaves the task connected with the radio and returns to her previous activity at the computer screen. She still displays no direct involvement with her colleague’s activities, but she is in a position to receive new information about the accident from what her colleague continues to say at the phone.</p>
<p>Let us follow how Maria continues the telephone call in order to collect relevant information about the car accident. Maria asks ‘<italic>is he conscious, does he react, can he speak?</italic>’ (Transcript 3, line 18). Anna as overhearer is in a position to understand that there are apparently no <italic>casualties</italic> (in the plural) involved in the accident, but only one <italic>casualty</italic>. And the telephone call continues, with Maria gathering information by means of another series of questions to the caller:
<disp-quote>

</disp-quote>
</p>
<graphic id="img4-1468794111436140" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-img4.tif"/>
<p>Maria’s question (‘<italic>madam, can you at least tell me the motorway kilometre number?</italic>’, line 14–15) enables Antonia as overhearer to acquire a further item of information. The way in which the question is constructed and the sequential position in which it occurs shows that the previous question (‘<italic>is he conscious, does he react, can he speak?</italic>’, line 12) has not received an answer, or has received a very vague and unsatisfactory one (it is as if Maria is saying ‘okay, you may not know if the person is conscious, but at least can you answer this other question?’). This opens an uncertainty frame about what exactly is happening. If we turn to the video, we see how Maria, during this exchange with the caller, expresses her full disappointment with the fact that the series of questions brought only little (and uncertain) information. Maria is preparing to take notes after her question on the telephone (‘<italic>madam, can you at least tell me the motorway kilometre number?</italic>’, lines 14–15 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468794111436140">Figure 5.1</xref>), but she does not write anything because the caller is unable to give the information requested. Maria raises her head and asks a next question (‘<italic>southbound anyway, madam?</italic>’, line 17 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468794111436140">Figure 5.2</xref>), which seems to establish at least one point of anchorage by confirming an item of information elicited previously (lines 7-8). Upon receiving confirmation, Maria’s gaze returns to the notepad and she assumes the note-taking position (with the pen already pointed at the paper) as she asks the next question (‘<italic>give me a phone number</italic>’, line 19 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468794111436140">Figure 5.3</xref>):</p>

</fig>
<p>Just as she completes her utterance, Maria leaves her note-taking posture to make a characteristic gesture: she raises her right hand (holding the pen) from the notepad and with a sudden movement lets it fall to the desktop (with a thump) so that it almost bounces on the surface. She simultaneously removes her gaze from the notepad, bends her head toward her left side (as if to show annoyance), and then returns to her writing position to record the telephone number that the caller is giving her:</p>
<fig id="fig10-1468794111436140" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-fig10.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Maria’s gesture largely corresponds to her previous vocal ‘snort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111436140">Goffman, 1978</xref>: 90). With this gesture Maria is visibly expressing her disappointment that the series of questions brought only little (and uncertain) information and that time is passing without any appreciable news. This gesture is a witnessable action, and Antonia is in a position to visually witness what her colleague is doing (a gesture of impatience and irritation), as well as hear the audible thump of Maria’s arm falling on the table, or feel the (presumable, even if light) tremble of the desk, which she shares with her colleague. Antonia, even if she is still showing no apparent visual or bodily involvement with Maria’s feelings, is in a position to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>The dispatcher’s position continues to be tied to her work on the computer. A second message comes in on the radio (‘<italic>central from one five six one?</italic>’ – I do not report this brief exchange on the transcript), that is hearable because Maria is not talking but writing down the number given to her by the caller. Antonia moves her hand to the button on the radio console as she prepares herself to answer the radio call. She says ‘<italic>go ahead</italic>’ to the radio (not reported on the transcript) at the moment when Maria repeats out loud the last two digits of the telephone number given by the caller (‘<italic>zero eighty</italic>’, line 22), but no other communication comes from the radio. Antonia can thus hear undisturbed what Maria continues to say to the phone. Apparently, the call is near to closure. Maria reassures the caller that help is on the way (‘<italic>I’ll send someone immediately</italic>’, line 23). Usually, satisfaction of the request for intervention (sending an ambulance) marks the end of an emergency telephone call. Hence the call should now conclude; but instead something else happens. Maria re-opens the interrogative series with a new round of questions. See the transcript:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Transcript 1</bold>. Telephone call (continuation and ending, lines 23-35). Maria call-taker (CT)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<graphic id="img5-1468794111436140" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1468794111436140-img5.tif"/>
<p>The telephone call seems to have reached its conclusion but instead resumes with a scenario more dramatic than could previously be foreseen.</p>
<p>Maria apparently begins a second round of information-gathering (‘<italic>can you confirm that the patient is unconscious?</italic>’, line 24). She seems to assume that there is someone injured at the accident scene and that this person is unconscious. The question is designed as a request for confirmation of a given fact that depicts a negative scenario. Whereas previous questions left the gravity of the accident uncertain, now it seems that the situation is serious (an unconscious patient). The worsening of the scenario is further confirmed by the next question that Maria asks: ‘<italic>but is the man trapped in the car?</italic>’ (line 27). There seems to have been an escalation in the degree of seriousness of the emergency: there is an unconscious victim, possibly trapped inside the wrecked car.</p>
<p>It is at this point that we see and hear in the video something interesting. Antonia for the first time says something out loud, not addressed to the radio. She has left her radio-response position and has resumed her home position at her computer. As soon as Maria utters the first part of her turn ‘<italic>but is the man trapped</italic> …’, Antonia raises her head (from the keyboard and her notes). On completion of Maria’s turn, in total ‘open air’, with no overlap with other speech, Antonia curses out loud (‘<italic>For Christ’s sake!</italic>’):

<p>There is nothing connected to the radio communication (or to Antonia’s work at the computer screen) that could have caused this expletive. So, why does Antonia utter it? Why does she utter it <italic>now</italic>? Is it possible to say that Antonia <italic>does</italic> something with this expletive? What could Antonia mean by this expletive? The answers, I think, are to be found in the logic of the interaction as it has unfolded until this point in the sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468794111436140">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are good reasons for saying that Antonia’s expletive enables her to show to her colleague that she is fully aware of what has been worked out during the phone call. Her curse does not concern the activity that she has hitherto performed entirely independently at the computer and on the radio during Maria’s telephone call. The expletive concerns what is emerging from the telephone call at that particular moment. It is thus a sequential object precisely positioned in an especially delicate sequence. The expletive occurs after Maria’s two turns of post-completion of the telephone call. It is uttered at the culmination of the escalating gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>Through an expletive Antonia can demonstrate that she has attentively followed what has happened until that point in the telephone call handled by Maria. While hitherto Antonia has shown no overt signs of participation in her colleague’s activities, and the two courses of action seem to have unfolded independently from each other, Antonia now shows by the precise positioning (exactly now) and mode of her utterance (an expletive) that she has been closely monitoring the course of events emerging from the talk of her colleague. In a certain sense, Antonia’s expletive elegantly demonstrates her participation in the unfolding events because it fits well with the ongoing flow of events in terms of both its timing and form.</p>
<p>What is relevant here is the value of the expletive for the colleague in the booth. The expletive is a hearable object – a form of verbal action. It’s there, we may say, to be heard. From that particular verbal action, from where it occurs, Maria can make sense of what her colleague has understood about the interaction on the telephone thus far. It is produced just at the end of an escalating sequence concerning the seriousness of the accident. Antonia can ‘air’ her interpretation of the situation thus far open to her colleague’s appreciation, especially because an expletive does not need to initiate a state of open talk with a colleague. Maria can continue to talk on the telephone while at the same time being aware of her colleague’s state of knowledge. Antonia does not need to interfere with her colleague’s course of action, asking for her attention, diverting her colleague’s interactional energies (as she would have done if she had asked a question or requested clarification or performed some other sort of explicit verbal action addressed to her colleague). The expletive is a sort of a comment or remark on what just happened. The way in which it is positioned shows that Antonia is not only able to demonstrate that she has been paying attention to events at her colleague’s work station; she also produces a verbal object designed to attract her colleague’s attention while minimizing her distraction. Antonia’s expletive tells Maria that she is present; that she has been following events; and that she understands what has happened. But instead of initiating a conversational exchange or opening a verbal interaction with her colleague, she produces a vocal object that discreetly calls for attention. Antonia’s expletive makes Maria aware that her colleague is participating without distracting her from the main task in which she has been engaged since the outset: the telephone call.</p>
<p>Hence the expletive has high information value (it shows the degree of knowledge of her colleague of the situation thus far, and her awareness of the gravity of the situation). But the expletive also has an obvious emotional colour. It expresses the fact of ‘being fed up’ with the situation. Producing an expletive enables the dispatcher to demonstrate that she shares the same emotion as displayed by her colleague on at least two occasions during the episode. The expletive has been produced by Antonia, but it could equally have been produced by Maria. It seems that Antonia has uttered it on Maria’s behalf. She expresses the same ‘feelings’ manifested by Maria on the two previous occasions mentioned: the ‘snort’ and the gesture of impatience and irritation.</p>
<p>In sum, by means of an apparently trivial and crude device, also Antonia the dispatcher is able to communicate to her colleague – the call-taker – her own understanding of the case at hand. Not only has she taken advantage of what her colleague was saying on the telephone, but she is now in a position to give her colleague a sign of having followed the case, of having understood how serious the situation is, and of sharing the same emotion. In short, we see how two people working together – but on distinct tasks – are able to exchange overt signs of their participation in a joint undertaking without explicitly doing so. There is nothing particularly theatrical in the use of the expletive; there is nothing particularly evident about this device; and it does not have major consequences. The telephone call will then come to its natural conclusion, and the official briefing on what has happened, and on what to do in order to send the appropriate assistance, will soon begin. But this trivial device (an expletive) has recast all the previous stream of behaviour in such a way as to evidence that the situation has been carefully monitored. As said, the dispatcher has been able to communicate that she followed what has been happening to her colleague at her side; that she has understood the seriousness of the situation, and that she has shared her colleague’s emotional state. The briefing on conclusion of the call will not require a preparatory stage, and the call-taker will not have to say very much to her colleague: the expletive has alerted the call-taker that her colleague has followed the call in its entirety. Both operators are now ready to deal with this new emergency without disconnections in their work: the shift from one task (collecting information about the emergency) to a new one (dispatching help to the site of the accident) will be accomplished smoothly and rapidly.</p>
<p>Expletives belong to the repertoire of back-stage behaviours that dispense with ‘manners’ – behaviours apparently ‘flooding out’ behind the official façade. Organizational routines are replete with episodes of this kind. Of interest here has not been the contrast between a presumed ‘formality’ of official front-stage behaviours and the equally presumed ‘informality’ of back-stage behaviours. Rather, I have sought to provide further illustration of the notions of participation in, and coordination of, actions in work groups. Through these frail, often occasional and idiosyncratic, devices, most of which are relegated to the back stage of official and formal tasks, continual coordination work between the parties is performed in social interaction. Video analysis gives researchers access to frail interactional devices of this kind, and it enables them to appreciate how subtle and delicate the participants’ mutual orientations may be.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The article has examined one way in which video analysis can be applied to analyse the tacit and informal interaction between participants in a work space. We have seen that, in certain cases, even when ongoing activities directly and explicitly involve only one of the persons in a scene, the others present can show him or her evident signs of participating in the principal activity. The example has been taken from ongoing research that deals with medical emergencies. The excerpt on which this article is based is an example of a typical activity undertaken in emergency call centres: receiving a call that contains a request for intervention implies construing the call in order to obtain the most useful information about the case, so that the best possible help can be sent to the emergency scene. This activity by the call-taker has usually been studied as a communicative genre – the emergency telephone call – and as such it has been studied through the use of audio recordings. In this article I have argued that there is more than is contained on an audio tape if we consider the entire ecological context in which the call is dealt with. In particular, I have shown how the words of the call-taker can be consequentially relevant for the dispatcher working alongside her colleague. The dispatcher can start, piece by piece, step by step, to gain understanding of the emergency that has arisen well before the actual transfer of the information about the case, as usually happens in the debriefing after the end of the telephone call. Moreover, we have seen how thin, tenuous or rarefied can be the communicative devices used by the dispatcher in order to show her colleague her understanding of the situation and its seriousness, while at the same time demonstrating that she shares the colleague’s emotional state. The video gives us access to the ecology of the shared space, making the interaction between the caller and the call-taker less relevant, while instead foregrounding the importance of what is being said for the parties sharing that ecological space. This is probably the main analytical principle to which video analysts must pay attention when they start to examine workplace videos (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111436140">Heath et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The video analysed in this article has concerned one telephone call, from its beginning to its end; and paradoxically our main analytical guide has been talk, not bodily movements or gestures or other visual communicative devices. The two persons in the booth appear to be engaged in rather separate lines of action. But the video offers us the opportunity to consider in what talk consists when the parties are not addressees but overhearers. The use of the video shows how apparently parallel and unrelated tasks are in a sense intertwined. Sharing a work space is not a matter of physical arrangement in an area that is jointly occupied. Rather, it is a matter of fluid and tiny exchanges among the persons (see the notion of ‘interactional space’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111436140">Mondada, 2009</xref>). Participants show each other that they are monitoring what is going on, and that they are aware of what is happening at certain moments in time. This interactional work is hidden from the official documents and audio files, and cannot be accessed even with audio recordings of what happens in the booth: but this interactional work is open to inspection when we use a video recording.</p>
<p>The case discussed may seem to be relatively rare or indeed unique. Yet, it teaches us how far we can go in exploring the resources at the disposal of participants to show their position in social interaction, their understanding of the situation, and their affiliation with the position taken by their fellows. The issue of collaborative work must be specified and analysed well beyond the official division of labour in light of these considerations.</p>

<p>As Candy Goodwin writes about radio communications (but her point applies to telephone communications as well): ‘participants in service encounters over the radio are located within different participation frameworks – one entailing the caller/called and the other the framework of co-workers in their work centre. In that the radio medium permits only one person to transmit at a time, each party can control what the other participant to the call can hear, so that conversations among co-present co-workers are unavailable to parties on the other end of the line. In essence participants can construct a ‘back stage’ merely by not releasing the radio call button. Other activities in the room are inaccessible to those on the other end of the service encounter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111436140">Goodwin, 1995</xref>: 176).</p>
