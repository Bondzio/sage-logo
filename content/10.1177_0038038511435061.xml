<abstract>
<p>This article looks at the construction of active young femininities within the context of girls’ participation in sport. It draws on findings from longitudinal, qualitative research carried out in the UK. The research revealed the importance of ‘ability’ discourses as particularly salient for girls’ ongoing sports participation at secondary school. This was exemplified in the idea of ‘being good at sport’. Throughout the article I consider some of the difficulties for girls in holding onto notions of themselves as ‘good at sport’ and look at the ways in which this identity was both shifting and relational in the context of their peer and schooling interactions. The findings suggest that processes of team selection, emphases on performance outputs and ongoing expectations of fixed athletic development were all particularly relevant to girls’ sporting identities and participation both in and out of school.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines the social processes framing the sports participation of a small group of young women as they made the transition to secondary school. The participation of young women, a social group identified as ‘under-represented’ in sport in general, has often been deemed problematic and thus targeted for intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435061">Bennett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435061">Kirk, 2000</xref>). Yet, recent feminist research has also demonstrated growth in the levels of intense commitment and skill demonstrated by female athletes participating at high levels of competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435061">Adams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435061">Scraton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435061">Theberge, 2003</xref>). Widespread achievements in women’s sport have been used to argue that sport is now largely commensurate with the construction of active young femininities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435061">Azzarito (2010)</xref> defines these new ‘alpha femininities’ as fit, healthy and achievement-oriented identities that girls are increasingly able to take up. This article suggests that such discourses of female sporting achievement are complicated by social constructs of ‘ability’ as a highly gendered and thus discriminatory sorting mechanism. It addresses some of the processes that operate in the construction of gendered discourses of sporting success and failure in the context of school and extracurricular sport. The girls’ experiences reveal the importance of ability discourses or ‘being good at sport’ as framing their decisions and investments in sport and physical activity.</p>
<p>This emphasis on sporting achievement can be situated in relation to broader constructs of ‘talent’ and ‘ability’ within contemporary youth sporting initiatives. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435061">Green (2010</xref>: 3) notes, youth sport has ‘always served as a conveyor belt for elite sport, showcasing able and talented youth with potential to succeed’. As young people are often positioned as future Olympic and sporting hopefuls, their participation in sport and the identification of young talent remain pressing goals at both local and national policy levels in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038511435061">Collins and Buller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038511435061">DCSF, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435061">Houlihan and Green, 2006</xref>). Although often unacknowledged, such strategies may uncomfortably straddle tensions between aims of increased overall participation and those of elite talent identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435061">MacPhail et al., 2003</xref>). While the 2008 Physical Education and Sport Strategy proposed both to target and identify ‘the most talented young people in the country’ as well as to provide a ‘sustainable legacy’ of ‘engaging more young people in sport’ overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038511435061">DCSF, 2008</xref>), current government policy demonstrates little concern for equity in sport with proposals to replace the wide network of established School Sport Partnerships in Britain with an ‘Olympic-style school sport competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435061">Gove, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038038511435061">1</xref></sup> Although sport policy often seeks to downplay any inherent tensions between elite and mass participation, this approach pays inadequate attention to the ways in which a focus on elite performance can alienate and exclude many young would-be participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435061">Lines, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of such discrepancies, the focus on youth talent identification remains a strong incentive at the level of both practice and policy. Talent identification programmes that see talent as an innate and identifiable classification are backed up by sophisticated scientific discourses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435061">Peirce (2009)</xref> reports on the ‘new science of talent identification’ which ‘brings together biometrics, psychology and intensive training’ to select young people for rigorous, sport-specific training regimes. This scientific approach to talent identification is increasingly used to justify the merits of sport selection processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435061">Houlihan and Green, 2006</xref>). Such discourses serve to reinforce the focus on elite talent development, which has been described as currently dominant in terms of ‘funding, facilities and coaching’ in youth sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435061">MacPhail et al., 2003</xref>: 252).</p>
<p>This article is concerned with the specifically gendered consequences of ability designations for a group of young women interested in sport. It contributes to recent work that has sought to question the straightforward use of ‘ability’ as a sorting mechanism within youth sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435061">Evans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435061">Hay and Macdonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038038511435061">Wellard, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435061">2007</xref>). This body of work variously reveals the ways in which categories of ‘ability’ are constructed and perpetuated within youth sport and PE, thus setting up juxtapositions between ‘able’ and ‘non-able’ participants as well as individualizing success or failure at sport. Ability designations are here seen as inevitably gendered and otherwise normative, thereby creating inequalities for young people’s participation and a sense of ‘lack’ in relation to sporting achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435061">Probyn, 2000</xref>: 20). Researchers have noted feelings of shame, humiliation and anxiety as common affective traces of PE and sporting experiences described by adults who did not ‘fit’ the performative and corporeal requirements of school sport and PE lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435061">Ennis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435061">Evans et al., 2007</xref>). Influential policy documents such as <italic>Sport: Raising the Game</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038511435061">DNH, 1995</xref>) have in recent years emphasized the competitive elements of PE, thereby placing an increased emphasis on performance and ability within youth sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435061">Houlihan and Green, 2006</xref>). This emphasis was certainly relevant to the girls in this research as they struggled to make sense of their sporting identities over the transition to secondary school.</p>

<title>Ability and Girls’ Sporting Identities</title>
<p>Distinctions between ‘able’ and ‘non-able’ participants can be seen to relate to specific social and political meanings in and around sport, gender and young people’s participation, which circulate through a range of discourses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435061">Evans et al. (2007)</xref> argue, such distinctions are important since they relate to the allocation of resources as well as according value to specific bodies. Importantly, they question whether there is ‘a dominant “ability” or “image” of value, such that some students are unable to recognize themselves as having a “body” or “self” or “ability” of any value?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435061">2007</xref>: 52). The discourse of ‘being good at sport’ might therefore be seen as representing particular ideals of sporting participation and as containing particular signifiers about who might embody such an identity and what physical performances this requires. This suggests that sporting participation requires both an affective investment, as a sense of ‘fit’ with dominant ideas of athleticism, and an embodied sense of capacity: as a set of skills and competencies gained through participation and practice over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435061">Shilling, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A range of feminist work has demonstrated the ways in which the equation of sporting ability with dominant discourses of masculinity has served to position women’s bodies as inferior sporting participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038511435061">Choi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435061">Hargreaves, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435061">Scraton, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435061">Cockburn and Clarke’s (2002)</xref> research revealed that girls felt it necessary to disinvest from the masculinized connotations of physical education through overt performances of ‘girliness’ in order to construct their young femininities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435061">Evans (2006)</xref> further suggests that any disjunction girls felt in PE was also experienced as an embodied sense of incapacity – that they were unable to physically perform to the standard of ability felt to be required. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435061">Adams et al. (2005</xref>: 28) note that femininity and athleticism were only seen as compatible where girls could also ‘display competent and skilful bodily performances’. These gendered and embodied processes can be seen to mediate both girls’ sense of themselves as sporting participants and their physical capacity to participate in specific sport settings.</p>
<p>Such insights demonstrate the importance of the body and physical capacity in girls’ sports participation. However, there remains work to be carried out on our understanding of how sporting ability is embodied by young women within broader social contexts, including schools and peer settings and the interaction between these processes. The research carried out also demonstrates the operation of such processes over time as the girls made the transition to secondary school. I suggest that girls’ embodied experiences within the sexually charged and highly regulated adolescent contexts of school and peer settings are particularly important to their sports participation and these processes are explored within the article. The study further demonstrates some of the ways these meanings interacted with the girls’ physical sense of capacity as potential sporting participants. As the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038511435061">Young (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435061">Shilling (2004)</xref> has demonstrated, gendered bodies both shape and are shaped by dominant discourses of gendered practices, thus constructing many women’s and girls’ lack of a sense of capacity or ‘ability’ in relation to sport. Discourses of ability characterized one of the dominant ways in which sport and physical activity were understood in school and sport settings throughout the research.</p>
<p>In primary school the girls felt able and willing to participate in a variety of sports in and out of PE; however, at secondary school, performance-based assessments were both commonplace and taken for granted as sorting mechanisms for ‘sporty’ and ‘non-sporty’ girls. For girls who had ‘made the cut’, the idea of being ‘good at sport’ could operate as a form of distinction and as a sense of achievement. Yet this achievement was attached to a fixed notion of ongoing development that set up a burden of expectation for girls’ sporting performances. Alternatively, many girls concurred with definitions of themselves as bad or ‘rubbish at sports’ and therefore unable or unlikely to participate. Discourses of good/bad at sport were embodied as girls lived out these subjectivities through their participation and engagement in sport within specific school and extracurricular contexts.</p>
<p>The research demonstrates how achievement discourses in women’s sport are complicated by ability constructs. I argue that current emphases of youth sport on ‘talent’ and ‘ability’ may be particularly exclusionary for young women as they operate within the gendered contexts of school and peer settings. Girls’ identities within their peer-regulated school and sporting contexts are seen to interact with their sporting participation in specific ways, often mediating against sporting identities as an undervalued or relegated form of identification. Girls often struggled to see their bodies as having any ‘value’ within these specific contexts as they negotiated the range of physical and sexual meanings circulating around their bodies. The findings demonstrate how processes of team selection, coaching emphases on performance outputs and ongoing expectations of athletic development were particularly constraining for girls’ participation as they operated within the gendered context of school and peer settings. These processes can therefore be seen to operate as discriminatory mechanisms of exclusion from sports participation for girls. I focus here on the experiences of three girls involved in the research who were identified as ‘good at sport’ in primary school and the specific processes that framed their ongoing (dis)engagement. The research demonstrates how the girls’ emergent identities as gendered subjects in school settings provided an important context for their embodied sense of themselves as potential sports participants.</p>

<title>The Research</title>
<p>The research for this study entailed a longitudinal, qualitative investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038511435061">McLeod and Thomson, 2009</xref>) into girls’ participation in sport and physical activity. This involved tracing the sports participation of six particularly physically active girls over a period of four years as they moved from Year 5 (10–11 years) to Year 8 (13–14 years) in schools at divergent locations across London, England. Within the article I focus on three of the girls in particular: Lindsay, Lucy and Spirit.</p>
<p>Lindsay’s parents had emigrated from Pakistan to the UK before she was born and their subsequent loss of status and income was compensated by a particular interest in their children’s schooling and career aspirations. Lindsay had attended an inner city, ethnically diverse comprehensive primary school where she excelled in both schoolwork and a variety of sports. She then carried on to Adlington Secondary School,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038038511435061">2</xref></sup> a mixed sex comprehensive school nearby.</p>
<p>Spirit and Lucy both attended the same primary school in a sought-after catchment area on the outskirts of London. Spirit went on to attend Folkestone Secondary, a fee-paying, selective, independent day school nearby. In addition to the wide range of extracurricular activities her parents enrolled her in, they also hired a tutor to study for secondary school selective entrance exams. Spirit took up running in Year 4 and was subsequently identified as ‘talented’ in this particular sport.</p>
<p>Lucy went on to attend Wellington Gardens, a high-achieving comprehensive girls’ secondary school. She came from an active, middle-class family whose interests centred on a range of outdoor activities including climbing, canoeing and involvement in Scouts with her three brothers.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were held with each girl twice yearly from Year 5 to 8 of her schooling. During the interviews we talked about girls’ sports involvement, friendships, schoolwork and other interests with a view to exploring their ongoing gender constructions. This long-term and intimate involvement in the girls’ lives allowed me to gain important insights into the shifting, complex processes framing girls’ investments in sporting and gendered identities. When the girls were in Year 8, I also distributed a questionnaire in each girls’ PE lesson (<italic>N</italic> = 54). The questionnaire responses located themes already arising in the individual responses around ability constructs as forming a selective sorting mechanism for girls’ sporting participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0038038511435061">
<title>The Importance and Difficulty of ‘Being Good at Sport’</title>
<p>The girls involved in the research had all enjoyed sport at primary school and had participated enthusiastically in a range of physical activities including playtime chase games, cross-country running, football, netball and numerous outdoor activities. Studies have suggested that adolescence, and particularly the transition to upper secondary school, are key points at which girls are likely to drop out or to disengage in sport and physical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435061">Flintoff and Scraton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038511435061">Green et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038038511435061">WSFF, 2007</xref>). When I did the last set of interviews with the girls in Year 8, most had given up on sport and were noticeably less invested in PE. Despite enjoying football in primary school, Lindsay, like her peers from primary school, felt unable to continue with this participation. Lucy and Spirit continued with their sports participation, but they each had issues around coaching and club selection that differently affected their involvement and enjoyment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038511435061">Coakley and White (1992</xref>: 21) suggest that young people make choices about their sports participation ‘through a series of shifting, back and forth decisions made within the structural, ideological and cultural contexts of their worlds’. Although the decision to participate in sports often related to material circumstances including travel, cost and time, these were moreover framed by broader understandings of sports participation and the place it might have in the girls’ lives and identities. Girls increasingly related their sporting decisions to the idea of ‘being good at sport’ and their (dis)identifications with this classification.</p>
<p>At this transition into adolescence, sport became more competitive and some girls felt that they were no longer ‘good at sports’ even if they had participated in a variety of physical activities during primary school. Although many girls had hoped to continue their sports involvement into secondary school they either did not believe that they would be selected for a team or were not selected once they attended tryouts. In the questionnaire I carried out in their PE lessons when the girls were in Year 8, I asked whether they had ever thought about trying out for a sports team. The class-wide responses suggested that ability or perceptions of ability played a key role in these decisions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Not very welcoming as they make you think that you can only go if you’re good at it. (Questionnaire, Wellington Gardens)</p>
<p>Yes, but I’m scared if everyone else is much better than me/more advanced. (Questionnaire, Adlington School)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each secondary school held a sports day and this meant competing in different events on show for the rest of the school. Several girls mentioned the fear of ‘coming in last’ on sports day and ‘embarrassing themselves’. Girls’ recurrent fear that they would not be ‘good enough’ can be related to overall feelings of both shame and pride that frequently characterize sports participation as ‘a constant lack, or recurring incompleteness’ of the athletic body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435061">Probyn, 2000</xref>: 20). Girls’ responses suggested an either/or positioning in which they felt compelled to align themselves according to estimations of their ‘ability’ and where the prospect of identifying with ‘being good at sport’ was increasingly tenuous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0038038511435061">
<title>Not Making the Cut</title>
<p>It became clear over the course of the research that school structures and their understanding of girls’ sports participation were particularly relevant to girls’ decisions. As the girls moved into secondary school they were presented with a new set of expectations around academics, extracurricular activities and social norms. The teams and sports clubs they might join at this transition often represented one of the first points at which overt competition could function to exclude them from participation, but they also served as messages about a girl’s social identifications. Trying out for a team represented a specific type of social risk where ‘not making the cut’ could have important implications both for a girl’s physical inclusion and for her identity as an athlete and as a gendered subject in school.</p>
<p>In addition to Scouts and her outdoor activities, in primary school Lucy was also an enthusiastic participant in the cross-country team, netball and rugby. In the hopes of continuing with her running as she moved into Year 7, she went along to Champions Athletics Club, where both her twin brother and Spirit trained. Lucy quickly discovered that expectations at the club were very high and that they were unwilling to cater to her abilities. As her mother Mary described, ‘although Lucy is quite a nice runner and she has stamina, she’s not … fast’ (Interview, September 2006). When I asked later in Year 8 about running, Lucy had decided that she preferred alternative sports that did not have initial sorting mechanisms.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Lucy:</speaker>
<p>Like running, you don’t have to learn to run, you just sort of do it. But things like sailing or climbing or anything like that you have to learn the technique. So I prefer things like that ’cause you have to learn it and show your ability and things like that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sheryl:</speaker>
<p>Mmm.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lucy:</speaker>
<p>Whereas with running it’s just like ‘right, you’re really good you can go in the competition’ or ‘you’re really rubbish, you can’t’. (Interview, Year 8, November 2007)</p>
</speech>
<p>Here Lucy is clearly critical of discriminatory sorting mechanisms and the process of exclusion she was subjected to at the running club. The club’s practice of accepting only girls who already met a certain standard or speed before joining the group indicated to Lucy a fixed notion of ability in which being a good runner is a matter of innate talent rather than a result of practice or training. That the club was unwilling to train girls whose running fell below a set standard suggested a limited view of the potential for development and a clear focus on performance outputs. Lucy expresses a preference for outdoor sports such as sailing or climbing where she envisions more scope for improvement and where she suggests she would have the opportunity to prove herself through ‘learning the technique’ and thus ‘showing your ability’. Interestingly, Lucy’s access to these outdoor sports was provided through her participation in Scouts which she joined with her brothers after finding Brownies uninteresting. Similarly, outdoor sports were not something her all-girls secondary school could offer and she had acquired a ‘tomboy’ designation in primary school through her participation and effort in such activities. Although Lucy continued to participate in Scouting activities into secondary school, her parents had concerns about the possibility of overnight camps and her possible exclusion as the only girl in the group. Gender thus remained an important context for her activities even as ability was distinguished between gender-designated activities and groups.</p>
<p>In this excerpt Lucy seems to view ability as a bodily skill that can be learned over time but she is also aware that certain sports cannot or will not cater for this process of development. This affects her view of running as something ‘you don’t have to learn’. In contrast, Lucy had previously described the physical pleasure of running as an experience of ‘getting the energy out of me’ (Interview, Year 6, 2005), an embodied joy unrelated to a particular performance goal. Thus, ability designations were embodied for Lucy as they served to displace the previous joy of running through movement and energy sensation towards a performative assessment that measures Lucy’s physical capacity or speed as unvalued or lacking in value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038038511435061">Wright and Dewar’s (1997)</xref> research marked the sense of surprise experienced by adult women engaging in sport or physical activities later in life at both their bodily capacities and the enjoyment that such engagement might offer.</p>
<p>Coaches at the running club would surely have agreed in principle that ‘ability’ represents a trait that is learned over time; nevertheless their practices of selection suggested a more fixed view of children’s potential as well as an explicit defence of sport as a process of sorting ‘winners’ and ‘losers’. Lucy’s enthusiasm for running, her stamina and her commitment were unimportant to the running club, who were intent on placing high in league standings and in developing local champions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435061">MacPhail et al. (2003</xref>: 265) observe the increasing trend towards young people’s participation in adult-organized community-based sport and the subsequent need for research into children’s experiences of these settings. Adult investments in notions of ‘success’ or ‘failure’ alongside perceived needs to uphold the status of the club or team may create exclusionary experiences for young people while they are constructing self-identities that may or may not include sport in future.</p>
<p>Lucy condemned the club’s sorting mechanisms as ‘unfair’ but there was little that she or her parents felt capable of doing about it, though her twin brother continued to run at the club. Lucy’s experience at school netball tryouts was unfortunately similar, where she was not selected for the team and she explained ‘and all the people they chose were actually really quite good’ (Interview, Year 7, September 2006).</p>
<p>Lucy’s experiences of team sports are clearly mediated by adult gatekeepers who are seen to be inflexible in their estimations of ability and the potential for development. Lucy’s claim supports her earlier account of running, where a pre-existing ability is not only valued but is also a prerequisite for participation. Comments from teachers suggested that schools might be aware of ability as a discriminatory sorting mechanism yet felt compelled to perpetuate such cycles due to the ongoing expectations of parents, head teachers and other regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, school sporting accomplishments seem to have been taken up as forms of distinction within the increasingly competitive league tables and standings schools find themselves subject to. Lucy’s comprehensive overtly competed with the private all-girls’ schools nearby and, in line with its perceptions of acceptable and ‘ladylike’ behaviour, the school encouraged sporting participation but did not allow girls to run around or shout at playtime. Meanwhile, the boys’ school next to it where Lucy’s brothers attended made no such restrictions. Within team selection processes, the emphasis on ability took precedence over a girl’s enthusiasm or willingness to take part and impacted not only on Lucy’s enjoyment and opportunity to play but also on her identity as a potential sports participant. In Lucy’s experiences, similar to many girls I spoke with, ability had become the ultimate arbiter of participation and, concurrently, of self-worth. As Lucy puts it, ‘you’re rubbish, you can’t’, thus lowering both her motivation and constructing her identity as a ‘non-able’ participant.</p>

<title>‘I’m Not a Good Runner Any More’</title>
<p>Categorizations such as ‘good at sport’ or ‘talented’ can be seen to be constructed through their opposition to a binary Other – ‘bad at sport’, thus setting up juxtapositions between participants and forms of participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038511435061">Coakley and White (1992</xref>: 26) suggest that personal competence plays a key role in affecting individuals’ decisions to continue with their sports involvement. Both in their research and my own, young people who felt that they were ‘good’ at something were more likely to carry on as it took on a central role in their lives, forming part of their self-identifications.</p>
<p>When I met her in Year 5 (age 10), Lindsay explained that she would sometimes play basketball and ‘champ’ [also known as foursquare] at playtime. She took up football under the guidance of a supportive teacher who set aside a girls’ pitch time on the playground that had previously been male dominated. Similar to other girls, Lindsay described primary school and the games she had played there as more ‘fun’ and she recounted, ‘In primary we played football, all the girls played football and we all had our own pitch’ (Interview, Year 7, June 2007). Lindsay had also enjoyed a high standing amongst her classmates and had been avidly cheered by both male and female peers during class sporting competitions. During our Year 7 and 8 interviews, Lindsay lamented that male classmates no longer paid attention to her, something she connected with her wearing of a headscarf. She was the only Muslim girl in her secondary school form room and this contributed to her sense of difference, as she alluded to in our interviews. Lindsay, along with other girls in the study, expressed a sense of betrayal from boys who had previously been their friends but were now ‘too into football’ to play with them. Here Lindsay suggests that boys were now overtly more interested in girls’ physical appearance than their athletic abilities.</p>

<p>They go and hug those girls and it’s like you’re left out. And they go and hug them but if they don’t come to you and hug you then you feel kind of like ‘yeah, those boys don’t like me and I shouldn’t be with them’. Like I shouldn’t be with these persons.</p>

<p>Yeah, it feels that um, maybe I’ve got a scarf on, that’s why they don’t come hug me or maybe I’m a bit too religious or blah, blah, blah. (Interview, Year 8, November 2007)</p>
</speech>
<p>Lindsay’s experience of not seeming to embody the valued physical attributes possessed by other girls contrasts with her relationships in primary school where she was often revered by male peers for her running and football abilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038511435061">Young (2005</xref>: 76) describes ‘breastedness’ as an important factor in women’s physical sense of space in gendered social interactions and as therefore marking out a particularly key experience in a young woman’s embodied sense of self. Here Lindsay reveals a growing sense of her body as an object of potential value in relation to male peers and yet she feels excluded from this attention because of the symbolic veil which sets her apart as ‘too religious’, as she explains. The extract suggests some of the complex gendered contradictions for young women of wanting to feel noticed and valued, though not necessarily through the physical touching or ‘hug’ that is described. As Lindsay moved into Year 9 she stopped wearing her headscarf to school and began to invest more overtly in physical performances of a ‘girly’ femininity through specific clothing and use of makeup. Although physical attractiveness and sports participation were clearly commensurate for many girls at the school, a position of ‘otherness’ seemed to make such performances difficult to balance. Yet Lindsay’s decisions around sport were also clearly related to a growing sense of her position in a larger competitive pool of physically active girls.</p>
<p>Before beginning secondary school, Lindsay’s family had moved to another home outside the area and much further away. She continued to attend Adlington but this entailed long commutes and meant that she could not go to football training after school because of her parents’ fears for her safety in travelling back. She was not selected for her class relay team on sports day and this seemed to reinforce her belief that she was no longer athletic or ‘good at sport’.</p>

<speaker>Sheryl:</speaker>
<p>So what’s changed?</p>

<speaker>Lindsay:</speaker>

</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sheryl:</speaker>
<p>And has that stopped you from running?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lindsay:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. ’Cause you know you can’t run quick, fast enough, ’cause there’s so many other girls in Year 8 that can run so fast and you feel like you can’t do it. (Interview, Year 8, November 2007)</p>
</speech>
<p>Similar to Lucy, Lindsay’s experience of being rejected from the class relay team for sports day quickly translated into a negative self-belief and her identification as ‘not a good runner any more’. While, clearly, male classmates were similarly experiencing this movement into a larger pool of competitors, girls’ self-belief in particular seemed to be subject to these external assessments, positioned as they were as already outside the particular norms of sports participation. Lindsay’s experiences also suggest the added difficulties for girls who have been positioned outside the dominant constructions of sporting participation due to their racialized identities. The stereotypical association of Asian femininity and passivity has often problematized Asian girls’ participation in sport, forcing them to challenge both racialized and gendered perceptions of their abilities and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435061">Dwyer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The coupling of feminized humility and ever-increasing pools of talent seems to work against girls’ positive valuations of their sporting abilities. Within a competitive model of sports it was often difficult for girls to believe in their abilities, even if they were competing at high levels, since there would always be another girl who was ‘better’ or as Lindsay states ‘so many other girls who can run so fast’. Girls sometimes mentioned specific moments where the idea that they were ‘bad’ or ‘rubbish’ at sport had been cemented – often by an adult assessment of their ability. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435061">Shilling’s (2004)</xref> understanding of embodied physical capital, negative sporting experiences and public humiliations can quickly translate into negative self-belief and decreased bodily capacity. Both for Lindsay and Lucy, external assessments of their abilities and the process of selection leading to rejection served to constitute ‘unable’ sporting identities for the girls that were embodied as they did not have the chance to take part and improve. Both girls struggled to hold onto the identity of ‘being good at sport’ and therefore saw little reason to continue, thus investing their efforts and identifications elsewhere.</p>

<sec id="section7-0038038511435061">
<title>Being Identified as ‘Talented’</title>
<p>Commenting on the ‘Excellence in Cities’ programme aimed at challenging academically ‘gifted’ young people, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435061">Lucey and Reay (2002)</xref> note the burden of expectation placed on young people asked to carry the ‘beacon of excellence’. Similarly, for young people identified as ‘talented’ within running or other sports, expectations around their ongoing improvement in fulfilment of ‘potential’ can serve to create pressurized contexts. Although Spirit’s performances in running at primary school were widely acclaimed by her peers and teachers, Spirit had described to me how she initially took up running in a bid to lose weight, a goal that had turned compulsive at one point as she simultaneously restricted her food intake. The gendered association between weight loss and physical activity for many young women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038511435061">Evans et al., 2008</xref>) demonstrates again some of the complex discourses that often frame girls’ participation in sport.</p>
<p>In Year 7 Spirit was selected to join Champions Athletics Club based on her running performances in local races. While at primary school, she had been able to envision future participation and ongoing success in running and she told me that she hoped to become ‘an Olympic runner one day’ (Interview, Year 5, June 2005). Throughout primary school Spirit was involved in a wide number of extracurricular activities including basketball, karate and cross-country running. In Year 5 she was seen as one of the fastest runners in her class, thus gaining accolades from teachers and coaches, as well as interest from the youth running club. Early into Year 7, she shifted her career goals in line with more ‘realistic’ ambitions.</p>
<p>Spirit’s dreams of becoming an Olympic runner had been quickly dissolved by the running coach at her new club who bluntly informed the girls that none of their times would put them in position for future Olympic glory. Accordingly, Spirit noted her change in orientation towards running: ‘But now I’m not doing it for fun any more, now I’m doing it to get faster’ (Interview, Year 7, December 2006). In research into young people’s socialization into athletics clubs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435061">MacPhail et al. (2003</xref>: 261) noted that boys and girls between 13 and 15 ‘viewed competition as increasingly important to them’, representing a shift from an earlier orientation towards enjoyment and self-improvement. The shift towards performance outcomes (quicker times) was in line with the ethos of the competitive running club Spirit had joined but was also reflected in school sporting activities.</p>
<p>Girls who were able to compete in elite sports teams seemed to have compelling reasons for continuing, often reinforced by adult expectations of ongoing improvement. This could be considered a form of encouragement but it could also create pressure to continue to succeed and perform in successive competitions. The celebration of ‘PBs’ (personal bests) in Spirit’s running club meant that girls were under constant pressure not only to place in events but also to achieve more highly than they had before. Here Spirit describes her coach’s reaction to her performance in the school-wide races.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And he said to me ‘Oh Spirit, I think you’re over-training a bit now, that’s why you lost’ and I said ‘<italic>I’m not allowed to come second for once?!</italic>’ It’s really annoying. That’s why I hate Mr Sebastian. (Interview, Year 6, December 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The school-wide acknowledgement that Spirit was the ‘fastest runner’ in her year had worked to build up a series of expectations around her performances whereby her second place finish in the school races becomes noteworthy as insufficient or even ‘losing’. Similarly at her running club, the coaches described Spirit’s progress to me as ‘disappointing’ given her earlier performances. Expectations around Spirit’s sporting performances were matched in intensity by those around her academic performances, creating a pressurized context for her ongoing achievements. Spirit keenly sensed the need to keep up her high grades alongside growing extracurricular commitments at school and had described to me the juggling act she performed in order to do so. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435061">Walkerdine et al. (2001)</xref> has similarly demonstrated the intense pressure on some middle-class girls to perform across their various activities in outstanding achievements that are simultaneously normalized and expected. While selection for sports programmes based on developing ‘excellence’ may prove compelling for those selected, it can also become a burden as the need to prove oneself and one’s distinction becomes progressively more difficult in higher and higher echelons of competition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0038038511435061" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The girls’ experiences, whilst individual, highlight some of the specifically gendered, classed and racialized processes that can impact on girls’ sports participation. These included the type and ethos of the secondary school they attended, expectations from parents and coaches and access to teams in practical terms such as costs and transportation. Overall, the transition to secondary school marked a significant point where girls who had previously enjoyed sport were moved into more structured and competitive settings that acted as a sifting mechanism for their participation.</p>
<p>The research findings implicate three key processes in relation to ability that impacted on girls’ participation at this important transition. The first of these was the process of team selection where ability designations formed a prerequisite for participation by becoming both a motivation to take part and the sole reason to continue. Girls who decided to not even try out for sports teams on the assumption that they would not be selected were strongly swayed by these ability designations. The experiences of girls like Lucy who did try out for sports teams but were subsequently not included further attested to this. These expectations created processes of either self-selected or imposed exclusion based on perceptions of ability across sporting contexts. This exclusion from sport was embodied as it presented a lack of opportunity to develop and improve for girls who had been convinced that they were ‘rubbish at sports’ as some of the girls described themselves.</p>
<p>The second key process was the progression into a larger pool of candidates as the girls moved into a larger school and a more widespread competitive base. While this movement might be viewed as a natural progression in ‘growing up’, it was compounded by the pressures of secondary school where wider expectations were made of the girls around academics and performing adolescent femininities in line with peer social groups. This combination of pressures proved too daunting for girls like Lucy and Lindsay, who attempted but were unable to continue with their sports participation. Although ability designations had proved motivating in primary school, they were unsustainable amidst other pressures. And while their male peers were faced with similar pressures, many boys’ ability to construct socially valued young masculinities through sport seemed to make it easier to continue this participation.</p>
<p>Finally, girls such as Spirit who did continue with sport were faced with developmental models that placed expectations on their performances. The research suggests that such expectations may rest alongside academic commitments, thus creating a pressurized context for this participation. Developmental models also translated into persistent training and rising standards of performance making it ever more difficult for girls trying out new sports or to ‘join in’ at a later age.</p>
<p>Girls often seemed to regret the loss of physical activity in secondary school but felt powerless to change this. The forms of ‘fun’ experienced in earlier physical activity participation were not readily available at secondary school and girls therefore felt compelled to shift towards performance or fitness-oriented goals. The emphasis on performative targets such as speed, skill and weight/body size as ‘measurable’ outcomes might be seen to negate the possibility of other learning-oriented goals such as bodily pleasure, social experiences and even personal development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0038038511435061" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At a point when the girls were constructing important ideas about both their physical abilities and their identities, schools and outside clubs were clearly implicated in routinely distinguishing young people’s experiences, often resulting in exclusion. Here, sporting expectations were upheld by facilitating adults invested in particular models of sporting achievement both in and outside of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435061">Evans and Davies, 2004</xref>). The role of school sport can be set within a broader competitive educational context in which schools are expected to compete with one another for student places, parental support and league standings within the British education ‘market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435061">Ball, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The research demonstrates some of the ways in which secondary schools as spaces shut down possibilities for enjoying or feeling as if one can be good at sport. Team selection, whilst arguably necessary, proved particularly damaging to the girls’ already fragile sporting identities in the hierarchical and selective ways they were structured. School teams could much more readily embrace democratic and participatory forms of inclusion that focus on all young people’s potential and right to take part in physical activity. The research demonstrates how school spaces are also subject to wider social contexts where sport continues to be strongly associated with masculinity and where girls’ bodies are routinely valued according to their physical appearance. The girls came to see themselves and to position themselves in school spaces amidst the highly constraining and conflicting discourses of ability, gender and other social constructs that mediated their sporting participation, including body size and physical appearance. Sports participation was often seen to set girls apart from their peers and therefore the need to both prove one’s physical abilities and to sustain social friendships and norms could be particularly difficult for girls.</p>
<p>The emphasis on adult models of sporting participation at this level meant that girls felt they had to make immediate decisions about whether they were ‘good at sport’ or not, thus dictating whether and which physical activities they continued to participate in. The research suggests that while many girls enjoyed physical activity, including the competitive elements of this pursuit, they were easily discouraged in new settings that felt impersonal and overtly exclusionary. While constructions of ability had operated to sustain or motivate girls at earlier points of participation, these became increasingly difficult to uphold as girls were persuaded to drop out of sports altogether. For the girls in this research, ‘being good at sport’ represented a fragile identity that could be easily interrupted or broken, even as this remained a requirement for much participation in sports. Paradoxically, this meant that girls often did not have the opportunity to disprove their believed incapacity as it became embodied in their sense of personal competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435061">Shilling, 2004</xref>). The research has implications for the models of sporting participation that are made available to young people and suggests some of the possible gendered consequences of initiatives that attempt to identify and develop young talent.</p>
<p>The research also offers some insights into the ways in which more girls might become and stay physically active and involved in sports. Girls in particular seem to find it difficult to hold onto notions of ability and are therefore subject to exclusion and the constitution of ‘unable’ identities. This fragility suggests that girls may require ongoing support from adults and peers in sports settings that are both inclusive and encouraging in and outside of school. While the girls involved in the research often enjoyed the competitive elements of sport it was difficult for them to remain involved when such competition could result in possible exclusion from a team or club.</p>
<p>The research also demonstrates that adult sport gatekeepers were sometimes less attentive to the affective and social aspects of girls’ participation. Such adults need to remain reflexive about their own investments in sporting success and failure as well as keeping in mind the social and friendship contexts of girls’ participation. Encouraging girls to continue to take part in sport will require remaining sensitive to the social aspects of girls’ activities while prioritizing young people’s physical enjoyment in a spirit of equity and participation.</p>
