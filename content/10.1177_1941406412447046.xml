<p><italic>Healthy Eating, Healthy Weight for Kids and Teens</italic> is not a “diet book” for children. It is a guide for families to help children learn to eat in a way that will help them achieve and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<p>The book begins by teaching parents how to understand what a healthy weight for their child is and how to monitor it over time as their child grows. The second chapter helps parents identify and establish weight goals for their child using body mass index percentiles for age and introduces the reader to the 8 strategies that comprise the rest of the book.</p>
<p>The 8 strategies are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1941406412447046" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Eat with a plan. Meal planning for families</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Turn off the tube and move. Information about decreasing screen time and increasing physical activity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reducing sugar sweetened beverages</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Portion control: using “MyPlate” to determine recommended serving sizes for children</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing fruit and vegetable intake</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Decreasing high calorie “Fast Food”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consuming breakfast</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Eating family meals</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The remaining chapters address each of these 8 strategies in detail. All the concepts provided in the book have been shown to be effective in helping children achieve and maintain a healthy weight. These evidence-based strategies are presented in detailed, actionable items and case-based examples. The book includes sample contracts to promote commitment among participants and lots of text boxes with tips to provide quick access to helpful information. Recipes and menus are included, with an appendix of daily calorie needs for children, and “MyPlate” daily eating plans and an index for a quick way to find information.</p>
<p>This book is written at a fairly high grade level and may be beyond the ability of some families. A nutrition professional would need to adapt the material to meet the needs of the client who might need some assistance with some of the concepts.</p>
