<p>Objective: The current study examines the equivalence of a measure of family coping, the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation scales (F-COPES), in Chinese American and Korean American breast cancer survivors (BCS). Methods: Factor structure and cross-ethnicity equivalence of the F-COPES were tested using structural equation modeling with 157 Chinese American and Korean American BCS in California. Results: Of the original F-COPES subscales, acquiring social support, reframing, and passive appraisal did not adequately fit the data. Thus, a modified five-factor structure of the F-COPES was created. The modified F-COPES was validated with respect to quality of life, psychological distress, and family communication. Conclusions: The findings illustrate the importance of cross-ethnicity measurement testing and provide a rationale for developing culturally tailored measurements for ethnic minority populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Asian American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512448933">American Cancer Society, 2010</xref>). Given early detection and advanced treatment options, breast cancer survival rates for Asian Americans have increased significantly, demonstrating a 90.6% five-year survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512448933">American Cancer Society, 2010</xref>). Because more people are surviving cancer, both cancer survivors and their family members need to learn how to cope with cancer as a chronic illness and to alter functioning to accommodate survival within the family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512448933">Mitschke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731512448933">Veach, Nicholas, &amp; Barton, 2002</xref>). Although a great deal is known about how European Americans cope with stressful events such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512448933">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1988</xref>), much less is known about family coping in Asian American breast cancer survivors (BCS).</p>
<p>Of the many Asian American subgroups, this study specifically focused on Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. Chinese Americans and Korean Americans are the largest and fastest growing Asian American subpopulations in the United States, totaling 3.8 and 1.7 million people, respectively, in a 2010 count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731512448933">United States Census Bureau, 2011</xref>). The literature recognizes that Chinese Americans and Korean Americans share certain traits such as prioritizing the needs of the collective, which usually means the family, over those of any individual and promoting harmonious interpersonal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512448933">Ka’opua, Gotay, Hannum, &amp; Bunghanoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512448933">Ka’opua &amp; Muleller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512448933">McCubbin, McCubbin, Thompson, &amp; Thompson, 1995</xref>). In reality, however, large variations exist in degree of acculturation, migration experiences, cultural values and beliefs, primary language, and socioeconomic status between Chinese Americans and Korean Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512448933">Jiobu, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731512448933">Srinivasan &amp; Guillermo, 2000</xref>). For example, the Chinese group has had a longer length of stay in the United States than the Korean group, indicating that Chinese Americans are more acculturated than Korean Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512448933">Mui &amp; Shibusawa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731512448933">Uba, 2003</xref>). Moreover, Korean Americans who are more recent immigrants to the United States tend to have higher expectations toward their own families due to limited social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512448933">Ashing-Giwa, Padilla, Tejero, &amp; Kagawa-Singer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512448933">Lim, Yi, &amp; Zebrack, 2008</xref>). Given that there are sociocultural similarities and differences between them, it is important to determine how Chinese Americans and Korean Americans cope with cancer.</p>
<p>In general, coping is described as the cognitive and behavioral efforts made to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are perceived as taxing to the resources of the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512448933">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). How family members cope with cancer is important to Chinese Americans and Korean Americans in particular because in Asian cultures the family is a major source of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512448933">Ashing-Giwa et al., 2003</xref>). Once a family member is diagnosed with breast cancer, other family members may develop a variety of coping strategies. To date, studies have identified a number of diverse coping strategies within the family, including seeking information; taking action; giving and seeking emotional support; talking or not talking about the situation; denying or minimizing the experience and feelings; being positive, hopeful, and protective; relying on prayer and faith; and altering assumed roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512448933">McCubbin, Larsen, &amp; Olson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731512448933">Nikoletti, Kristjanson, Tataryn, McPhee, &amp; Burt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512448933">Northouse &amp; Peters-Golden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049731512448933">Zacharias, Gilg, &amp; Foxall, 1994</xref>). However, most available studies on family coping have been conducted in European Americans, and little is known about family coping strategies in Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>
<p>Mechanisms for coping with cancer may be dictated by personal and cultural experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512448933">Kim, Nair, Knight, Roosa, &amp; Updegraff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512448933">Prelow, Tein, Roosa, &amp; Wood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731512448933">Yeh, Inman, Kim, &amp; Okubo, 2006</xref>). Traditional Chinese and Korean cultures tend to uphold interdependent and collectivistic values to maintain interpersonal harmony compared to European Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731512448933">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>). That is, Asian Americans may expect family support to be evident through intimate personal connections within the extended family. In contrast, European Americans may not have such high expectations of the extended family system, focusing instead on stronger attachments within the nuclear family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512448933">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512448933">Lee and Lu (1989)</xref> identified several culturally specific coping strategies for Asian Americans, referred to as “functional coping” strategies: believing in fate and karma, recreating a flexible family support system and community support network. Additionally, Asian Americans may try to adjust their own behavior to the social context using emotion-focused coping rather than try to change their current problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512448933">Knight &amp; Sayegh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512448933">Morling &amp; Fiske, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512448933">Pinquart &amp; Sorensen, 2005</xref>). There are also evidences that Asian Americans are more likely than other ethnic groups to use emotion-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512448933">Knight &amp; Sayegh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512448933">Pinquart &amp; Sorensen, 2005</xref>), because Asian culture tends to emphasize harmony that a person’s maturity is related to the ability to control one’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512448933">McCollaum &amp; Lester, 1997</xref>). Therefore, the Western tradition of seeking help from outside or problem solving may be culturally inappropriate from a collectivistic perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512448933">Erez &amp; Earley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731512448933">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, given the lack of evidence on different coping mechanisms among Chinese American and Korean American BCS, we should not overlook the possibility that differences in coping may exist between Asian subgroups, depending on their level of acculturation.</p>
<p>To assess the stress and coping capacity of families, several self-report family coping scales have been created based on developmental and family systems perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512448933">Hauser, 1989</xref>). Specifically, the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales (F-COPES) has been widely used to assess the problem-solving attitudes and behaviors that families employ when responding to difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512448933">McCubbin et al., 1987</xref>). The F-COPES is a 29-item scale with 5 subscales: (1) acquiring social support; (2) seeking spiritual support; (3) mobilizing family to acquire and accept help; (4) reframing; (5) passive appraisal. The F-COPES has been used to assess 1,388 couples and families throughout the family life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512448933">Olson et al., 1983</xref>). Although specific demographic information has not been reported, we assume that the scale was developed for use in European American middle-class populations and does not therefore reflect the cultural values, cultural scripts, and culture-specific response sets of Asian American subgroups. Specifically, language differences among Asian Americans may cause systematic bias in measurement if researchers neither provide adequate translations of survey questions nor address differences in cultural meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731512448933">Sudano et al., 2011</xref>). To date, psychometric properties of the F-COPES have not been fully examined with more robust techniques, especially among Asian Americans. Given that Asian Americans show familial and cultural values that differ from European Americans and even within Asian American subgroups, individuals with qualitatively different disease experiences may not cope in similar ways. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether the family coping scale has equivalent measurement characteristics (i.e., factor structure, reliability, and validity) across ethnic groups so that comparisons between studies are valid.</p>
<p>Measurement equivalence is the extent to which scales have the same meaning across groups; measurement equivalence provides a rationale by which researchers can consider a measure to be valid across ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512448933">Knight &amp; Hill, 1998</xref>). Lack of measurement equivalence calls into question the validity of results specifically when they have been obtained from ethnic minority groups; for example, the construct of family coping may vary across groups due to different concepts of family and culture. Thus, a measure developed using a primarily European American sample may not capture the salient features of this construct for ethnic minorities. If measures are not equivalent, we cannot determine whether differences in family coping scores reflect true findings across groups or whether they can be attributed to measurement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512448933">Knight, Virdin, &amp; Roosa, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Establishing measurement equivalence is a fundamental step in conducting cross-ethnicity research. Presently, no studies have investigated the measurement equivalence of the F-COPES in Chinese American and Korean American BCS. The primary focus of the current study was to examine two central types of measurement equivalence across ethnic groups: (a) equivalence in the internal structure of the F-COPES (called <italic>factorial invariance</italic>) and (b) equivalence in predictive or criterion outcome scales (called <italic>construct validity equivalence</italic>). For factorial invariance, we evaluated the extent to which there are similarities in the way items contribute to subscales of the F-COPES, and in turn, similarities in the way that these subscales are related to the larger construct. This analysis provides a basis for determining whether the F-COPES measure can be interpreted in the same way for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Construct validity equivalence is based on the argument that “if a construct has the same meaning cross-culturally, it should also enter into the same empirical relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512448933">Hui &amp; Triandis, 1985</xref>). Thus, failure to find validity equivalence may suggest differences in the psychological and social processes that contribute to family coping with cancer.</p>
<p>The current study examines the equivalence of a self-report family coping measure, the F-COPES, in Chinese American and Korean American BCS. More specifically, this study had three primary objectives. The first objective was to examine the factor structure of the F-COPES across ethnicity and to determine the best factor model of the F-COPES for comparative study in Chinese American and Korean American BCS. The second objective was to examine the equivalence of the best factor model of the F-COPES across ethnicity. The third objective was to investigate whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL), psychological distress, and family communication measures are related to subjects’ self-report ratings on the F-COPES in similar ways in Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 157 Chinese (<italic>n</italic> = 86) and Korean Americans (<italic>n</italic> = 71) diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants were adult women who had survived 1 to 5 years after initial breast cancer diagnosis and were cancer-free. The women had been diagnosed with breast cancer in Stages I–III and had completed active treatment including surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Women with advanced cancers (i.e., Stage IV) were excluded due to significant differences in disease progression and prognosis. Participants did not have any other major disabling medical (e.g., heart disease, stroke) or psychiatric conditions (e.g., major depression, schizophrenia). Additionally, women in the study were able to speak Mandarin/Cantonese, Korean, and/or English. For example, in the Chinese American group, 76 completed the questionnaires in Chinese and 10 completed the questionnaires in English. For the Korean American group, 66 completed the questionnaires in Korean and 5 completed the questionnaires in English.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512448933">Table 1</xref>, the mean ages of Chinese American and Korean American BCS were 55.2 and 53.9 years, respectively. The average number of years participants had been living in the United States was approximately 24 years for both Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. A large majority of participants indicated that they were born in their original home countries (i.e., China/Taiwan, or Korea). Participants did not differ significantly in most demographic characteristics, although there were exceptions; for education, Korean Americans were more likely than Chinese Americans to have obtained higher levels of education. In terms of medical characteristics, cancer stage, surgery-axillary node dissection, and years since diagnosis were also significantly different between Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Chinese Americans were more likely to have been diagnosed with breast cancer in Stage II whereas Korean American BCS were more likely to have been diagnosed in Stage I. Chinese American BCS were more likely to have undergone axillary node dissection compared to Korean Americans. Years since breast cancer diagnosis for Korean Americans (<italic>M</italic> = 3.94; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.4) was slightly longer than that of Chinese American women (<italic>M</italic> = 3.24; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.8). Meanwhile, the results of nonparametric statistics indicated demographic and medical characteristics did not vary by language spoken (Chinese/Korean vs. English) except for income (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and length of residence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) in the Chinese American group and marital status (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the Korean group.</p>

<title>Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from the California Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP; Los Angeles [LA] County, Orange County, and San Diego regions, specifically) and area hospitals in LA County. To recruit study participants, we first obtained potential participants’ contact information from the CSP and local hospital registries, and each participant was mailed an invitation letter. Potential participants who did not respond to the invitation letters received a telephone call from a clinical research assistant 2 weeks after the letters were mailed. If the potential participant was interested, the clinical research assistant conducted a brief screening over the phone to assess eligibility. Subsequently, eligible participants were mailed a questionnaire and consent form and were asked to return them in an enclosed prepaid envelope within 3 weeks. If survivors had not returned the survey after the third follow-up phone call, they were considered nonrespondents. Participants received a $40 grocery store gift certificate after completing the questionnaire. All research procedures were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Review Board and by the participating institutions.</p>
<p>Of the 619 potential participants who had been mailed invitation letters, 369 were inaccessible (235 Chinese Americans and 134 Korean Americans). Most did not respond to the invitation letters or follow-up telephone call and some were not reachable due to incorrect contact information. A total of 250 potential participants could be reached and of this group, 26 refused participation (10.4%), 11 were ineligible (4.4%), and 56 agreed to participate but did not complete the survey (22.4%). Thus, a total of 157 BCS (86 Chinese Americans and 71 Korean Americans) completed the final survey, achieving final response rates of 25.4% of the identified sample and 62.8% of the accessible sample. The characteristics (i.e., age, cancer stage, and years since diagnosis) of those who participated in this study were compared with those who did not participate. No significant differences were found to exist between two groups.</p>

<title>Translation of instruments</title>
<p>Based on a rigorous “forward–backward” translation procedure, the English version of the questionnaire was translated and back-translated into Chinese and Korean by independent and bilingual translators. Then, the panel of translators compared the two English versions to make sure that they were equivalent. If they were not, corrections were made until equivalence was achieved. Pilot testing to check the validity and reliability of the translated instruments was conducted with a small convenience sample. Revisions resulting from the pilot test were incorporated into the final questionnaires. The Chinese and Korean versions were given to participants according to their language preferences.</p>

<title>Family coping: The Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation scales</title>
<p>The F-COPES is a 29-item, self-report measure derived from the Double ABCX model of family stress theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512448933">McCubbin &amp; Patterson, 1983</xref>). The F-COPES asks respondents to choose the answer that best describes their attitudes and behaviors when they face problems or difficulties in their family. This scale is divided into 5 subscales that measure internal and external coping mechanisms. The subscales are (1) acquiring social support (the family’s use of emotional and tangible support from extended family, friends, and neighbors; 9-item); (2) reframing (the family’s ability to redefine stress/situation; 8-item); (3) seeking spiritual support (the family’s participation in and emotional support acquired from their church; 4-item); (4) mobilizing the family to acquire and accept help (the family’s use of community resources to cope with their problems; 4-item); and (5) passive appraisal (the family’s inactive coping style in managing problems; 4-item). Respondents are asked to rate items on a scale of 1 (<italic>almost never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>almost always</italic>).</p>
<p>Subscale scores were obtained by summing the responses to all items. High scores indicate more coping behavior, and it is assumed that families exercising more coping behavior are more successful at adapting to stressful situations. Low scores indicate a general shortage of coping behavior. The F-COPES has strong internal consistency, with an alpha of .86. The alphas of each subscale range from .63 to .83 and test–retest reliabilities (4-week) range from .61 to .95. The F-COPES also has good factorial and concurrent validities, correlating with several other family measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512448933">Olson et al., 1983</xref>). However, the F-COPES had not been translated into Chinese or Korean, and neither reliability nor validity tests have been conducted for Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>

<title>Health-related quality of life: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)</title>
<p>The FACT-G was used to check the validity of the F-COPES; family coping positively influences HRQOL for cancer survivors. The FACT-G is a standardized, 28-item HRQOL instrument consisting of four dimensions including physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512448933">Cella, 1997</xref>). Individual item scores range from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very much</italic>), with higher scores indicating better HRQOL. The FACT-G generates (1) subscale scores on four dimensions (with standardized scores ranging 0–100) and (2) an overall HRQOL score (FACT-G; with standardized scores ranging 0–100). This scale has good reliability and validity for Chinese Americans and Korean Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512448933">Kim, Ashing-Giwa, Kagawa-Singer, &amp; Tejero, 2006</xref>). In the current study, reliability coefficients for the FACT-G subscales ranged from .77 to .95.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049731512448933">
<title>Psychological distress: Brief Symptom Inventory–18 (BSI-18)</title>
<p>The BIS-18 was used to assess the validity of the F-COPES, assuming a negative relationship between family coping and psychological distress for BCS. An 18-item self-report scale was developed to measure psychological symptoms in the medical community and in general adult populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512448933">Derogatis, 2000</xref>). The BSI-18 consists of one broader factor (the Global Severity Index [GSI]) and three subscales including somatization, depression, and anxiety. Symptoms are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with values ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>extremely</italic>). Scores are calculated by summing the values of the 6 items in each subscale. The GSI is obtained by summing the values for each subscale. According to the guidelines in the BSI-18 manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512448933">Derogatis, 1993</xref>), raw scores are converted to standardized <italic>T</italic> scores based on female oncology norms (<italic>M</italic> = 50;<italic> SD</italic> = 10). This scale also shows good internal consistency for Chinese Americans and Korean Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512448933">Lim et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, reliability coefficients ranged from .78 to .91.</p>

<title>Family Communication scale</title>
<p>The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation scales (FACES IV)–Family Communication scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512448933">Olson, Gorall, &amp; Tiesel, 2004</xref>) was used to assess family communication for BCS; we assumed that it would be positively correlated with the F-COPES scale. The FACES IV–Family Communication scale was designed to investigate the functionality of communication within the family. Responses to this 10-item self-report questionnaire are given using a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree)</italic> to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The total score is calculated by averaging responses to the 10 items, with higher scores indicating better family communication. In this study, reliability coefficients were .96 for both groups.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The hypothesis-testing framework of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), as measured by the power analysis program provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512448933">MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (1996)</xref>, was used as a vehicle to estimate the power for factor analysis. Given α = .05, a null hypothesis RMSEA of .05, an alternative hypothesis RMSEA of .10, and degrees of freedom ranging from 20 to 50, the range of statistical power given a sample size of 71 is between .70 and .82. Although the subgroup sample sizes are not large enough to detect a large effect size in this study, the current study is still valuable because (1) it is to provide an exploratory analysis of measurement equivalence and (2) we reduced the number of parameters in the subgroup analysis to address such concerns (Details are provided below).</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for the primary variables in the study. To investigate whether demographic and medical characteristics are statistically different between ethnicities, we used independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests and chi-square tests. Correlations were used to check the convergent and divergent validities of items. In addition, the internal consistency of the measurements was evaluated using Cronbach’s α coefficient. The data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software. All hypotheses were tested with a <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 criterion for significance.</p>
<p>As a preliminary step, we assessed whether the inclusion of people who had answered the questionnaire in English (<italic>n</italic> = 15) created a bias in the results. After dropping the 15 individuals who had used the English version of the questionnaire (76 Chinese Americans and 66 Korean Americans), we tested the reliability and analyzed the single-factor model using the same procedure as with the entire sample. The results were equivalent regardless of whether participants used the English version of the questionnaire; thus, we decided to include participants who used the English version of the questionnaire in this study.</p>
<p>Subsequent analyses were conducted using AMOS 20.0 software. Before conducting the main analysis, missing study variables were examined. The number of missing values in our study was less than 2.5%, so multiple imputation (MI) using AMOS was carried out for each of the measures with missing items. To generate imputations for the missing values, the model is first fitted using a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, model parameters are set equal to their ML estimates, and linear regression is used to predict the unobserved values for each case as a linear combination of the observed values for that same case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512448933">Arbuckle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Measurement invariance is supported when factor loadings for items comprising subscales are equal across groups. To establish measurement invariance, we used a multistep procedure. First, we tested whether the single-factor model, based on the originally hypothesized five-factor model of the F-COPES, fit the data for each ethnic group using confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). Here, we chose to test the equivalence of one subscale at a time instead of all F-COPES subscales due to the ratio of parameters to cases in the current study. Second, if the single-factor within-group model fit the data, we tested for invariance of factor loadings comparing a multigroup unconstrained model (i.e., factor loadings will be not equivalent across groups) to a constrained model (i.e., factor loadings will be equivalent across groups). If the model did not differ significantly between groups, this was considered to support the equality of the factor loadings. If the single-factor within-group model did not fit the data, or the model significantly differed between groups, we modified the original single-factor model to achieve fit and create an equivalent model across ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Third, a series of multigroup CFAs was conducted to determine the adequacy of the modified factor structure of the F-COPES and assess factorial invariance across ethnic groups. To do this, we checked to see if the modified model fit the data. Then, factorial invariance was assessed to fit a series of hierarchically nested factor structures (configural, metric, strong, and strict). Configural invariance is established if a CFA model that allows the same set of items to form a factor in each group shows good model fit. Metric invariance exists if the strength of the relationship (i.e., factor loading) between each item and the latent construct under consideration are invariant across groups. Strong invariance exists with item similarity across groups. Finally, strict invariance tests the unique error variances associated with each item across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512448933">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512448933">Meredith, 1993</xref>). Given that strict invariance is not realistic in the social sciences, at a minimum equivalency of factor pattern coefficients (i.e., factor loadings are equivalent across groups; metric invariance) is required to claim factor invariance across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512448933">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>). In the current study, we concluded that if the equivalency of factor pattern coefficients across groups was achieved, items would be considered invariant across groups.</p>
<p>Finally, to test the validity of the F-COPES, a structural model of relationships among the F-COPES, HRQOL (FACT-G), psychological distress (BSI-18), and family communication (FACES-IV) was created. Because of the limited sample size, the number of parameters was reduced by creating factor scores for each of the F-COPES subscales that had multiple indicators. Additionally, each of the scores for HRQOL, psychological distress, and family communication was created by taking the sample mean of the items for the respective scale. Based on research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512448933">Boyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512448933">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512448933">Knobf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512448933">Morgan, Fogel, &amp; Rose, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512448933">Stanton, Danof-Burg, &amp; Huggins, 2002</xref>), family communication was correlated with family coping, and pathways from “family communication” and “family coping” to “HRQOL,” and “psychological distress” variables were given. As with the final model for the F-COPES, multigroup analyses were conducted to examine the equivalence of the structural model across ethnic groups. Here, measurement weights, structural weights, structural covariances, and measurement residuals models were compared with unconstrained model to examine if each model is equivalent across groups.</p>
<p>To test the adequacy of the models, chi-square tests were first used for determining the model fit. Two other goodness-of-fit indices were also used: the comparative fit index (CFI; acceptable model fit ≥ .9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512448933">Bentler, 1990</xref>) and the RMSEA (acceptable model fit ≤ .08; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731512448933">Steiger, 1990</xref>). Chi-square tests were also used to compare the models.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in two major sections. First, CFA were performed to determine the factor structure of the F-COPES scale and to test whether the construct was equivalent in Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Second, structural equation modeling was used to demonstrate the validity of the F-COPES scale assuming its relationship with family communication, psychological distress, and HRQOL. The equivalence of this model across ethnicity was also tested.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049731512448933">
<title>Construct of F-COPES Scale</title>
<p>Before conducting CFA, Cronbach’s α coefficient of the F-COPES subscale for each ethnicity was examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512448933">Table 2</xref>, the coefficients for all subscales but the passive appraisal subscale were moderate to good, ranging from .69 to .91. However, for the passive appraisal subscale, the coefficients were 0.39 for Chinese Americans and −.01 for Korean Americans. Correlation coefficients between passive appraisal subscale items also ranged from −.07 to .27 for Chinese Americans and from −.10 to .09 for Korean Americans, indicating a lack of convergent validity for the passive appraisal items. Hence, the passive appraisal subscale was dropped from further analyses.</p>

<p>Based on the original factor structure of the F-COPES scale, we tested each subscale for fit with the data and equality of factor loading across ethnicity using CFA. For the single-factor within-group model, the spiritual support and mobilizing subscales fit the data for both ethnic groups whereas the social support and reframing (Chinese specifically) subscales did not. These findings suggest that the items comprising the social support and reframing subscales may not measure the same underlying construct. Next, we compared the unconstrained between-group model to the constrained between-group model for the F-COPES subscales. Findings showed that the change in chi-square was not significant for three subscales (social support, reframing, and mobilizing). These findings suggest that the items comprising these subscales may have similar meanings in Chinese American and Korean American BCS (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731512448933">Table 3</xref>). Thus, we modified the original single-factor model to produce best-fit models (i.e., social support and reframing subscales) and create an equivalence model (i.e., spiritual support subscale) across ethnicity.</p>

<p>
<italic>Note.</italic> <sup>a</sup>Passive appraisal scale has not been included in this analysis because of insignificant relationships between items within the subscale and low reliability scores. <sup>b</sup>Mobilizing family to acquire and accept health subscale has not been modified because of good fit to the data and cross-ethnicity equivalence from the original model. <sup>c</sup>Social support is divided by two factors: (1) relatives/friend support (Items 1, 2, 5, 20, 25) and (2) neighbor support (Items 8, 10, 29), and Item 16 has been deleted. <sup>d</sup>Item 13 (showing that we are strong) in the reframing subscale has been deleted. <sup>e</sup>Error variances of Item 14 (attending church services) and Item 30 (having faith in God) in the seeking spiritual support subscale have been correlated.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>For the social support subscale, we divided all items by two factors: (1) relative/friend support (5-item) and (2) neighbor support (3-item). An item “sharing concerns with close friends” was also deleted due to low factor loading with the relative/friend support factor. As such, the modified social support subscale adequately fit the data. The modified model also showed measurement equivalence across ethnicity (<italic>p</italic> = .396). For the reframing subscale, an item “showing that we are strong” was deleted due to low factor loading and this modified model improved the fit. Additionally, the change in chi-square was not significant, indicating that the modified reframing factor is equivalent across ethnicity (<italic>p</italic> = .222). Finally, we modified the spiritual support subscale to create an equivalence model between groups. Because all items were significantly related each other, we did not delete any items. Instead, we allowed a disturbance correlation between Items 14 (attending church services) and 30 (having faith in God) that refers to unanalyzed associations between disturbances. This modified spiritual support subscale did not show significant group differences according to the chi-square test, suggesting that the Items comprising this subscale may have similar meanings in both ethnicities (<italic>p</italic> = .069; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731512448933">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Cross-Ethnicity Measurement Equivalence on the Modified Factor Structure of the F-COPES</title>
<p>The modified factor structure of the F-COPES was created from the results of the single-factor model. It comprises five factors: (1) relative/friend support (5-item); (2) neighbor support (3-item); (3) reframing (7-item); (4) spiritual support (4-item); and (5) mobilizing (4-item). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049731512448933">Table 4</xref> shows the correlation coefficients between the items in the modified F-COPES scale. Overall, the modified version showed good convergent and divergent validity for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. However, in the Korean group, neighbor support items strongly correlated with relative/friend support items and mobilizing Item 4 showed strong relationships with relative/friend support and neighbor support.</p>

This suggests that the modified five-factor structure of the F-COPES is acceptable for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. We compared the unconstrained to the constrained between-group models to examine the factorial invariance of the F-COPES between Chinese American and Korean American BCS. As defined in the methods section, equivalency of factor pattern coefficients is the minimum requirement for claiming that the same factors are being measured in each subgroup. Multiple group CFA showed that the modified five-factor models are equivalent between Chinese American and Korean American BCS when factor loading is constrained (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 28.8; Δ<italic>df</italic> = 18; <italic>p</italic> = .051). Although measurement intercepts (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 228.5; Δ<italic>df</italic> = 41; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), structural covariances (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 239.3; Δ<italic>df</italic> = 56; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and measurement residuals (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 295.1; Δ<italic>df</italic> = 80; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were not equivalent between the two ethnic groups, we conclude that the modified five-factor model is invariant between the two groups on the basis of our measurement equivalence requirement. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1049731512448933">Table 5</xref>, all factor loadings were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and ranged from .41 to .94 for Chinese Americans and from .37 to .91 for Korean Americans. However, the correlations between relative/friend support and spiritual support factors, and between spiritual support and mobilizing factors, were not significant for either Chinese American or Korean American BCS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731512448933">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Validating the Modified Five-Factor Structure of the F-COPES</title>
<p>To test the validity of the modified five-factor structure of the F-COPES, a model of its relationships to HRQOL, psychological distress, and family communication was estimated. A multiple group analysis was conducted to investigate the equivalence of the structural model across ethnicity. First, the equivalence of the pattern of relationships between variables in the model was tested. Next, we tested the equivalence of factor loadings from the F-COPES latent factor to the five subscales across ethnicity (Step 2). Third, we investigated the equivalence of the path coefficient from the F-COPES and family communication to the HRQOL and psychological distress factors across ethnicity (Step 3).</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the baseline and the factor loading constrained model yield a moderate fit. The chi-square test found no significant differences between these models (<italic>p</italic> = .335), suggesting that the factor loading constrained models are invariant between Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Next, the path coefficient constrained model, which imposed equality constraints on all paths, showed a good fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(42) = 86.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .08. The chi-square test demonstrated equivalence in the path coefficients between the two ethnic groups (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 8.059, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = .428). Additionally, structural covariance (<italic>p</italic> = .529) and measurement residual (<italic>p</italic> = .418) constrained models were also equivalent in Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049731512448933">Figure 2</xref>, the factor loadings and path coefficients were similar in each ethnicity. However, in the path from family coping to psychological distress, there was a significant association in Korean Americans only at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. Other path coefficients in both ethnic groups were significant at a <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The trauma of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment can result in personal and familial distress. Hence, for cancer survivors, family coping can assume an important role in the process that links cancer experiences to adjustment within the family system. However, there are few studies addressing family coping in cancer survivorship research. Furthermore, very little research on family coping has focused on Asian Americans such as Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Given that the measures that have been used in family coping research were developed using predominantly European Americans, it has not been clear whether these measures are applicable to Chinese Americans and Korean Americans. Thus, we investigated the cross-ethnicity equivalence of the F-COPES, one of the commonly used measures of family coping. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the measurement equivalence of the F-COPES for Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>
<p>The current study found that the factor structure of the original F-COPES measure is not appropriate for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Specifically, acquiring social support, reframing, and passive appraisal subscales did not adequately fit the data. For example, the passive appraisal subscale was not reliable for this study sample, indicating very low reliability and correlation coefficients. For acquiring social support, a two-factor model consisting of relative/friend support and neighbor support showed a better fit with the data for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Although the F-COPES measure demonstrated the adequacy of the five-factor structure and strong internal consistencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512448933">McCubbin et al., 1987</xref>), our study results suggest that it is important to check the measurement equivalency before applying measures that were developed for European Americans to other ethnic minority groups. Without measurement equivalence tests, our interpretations may create a bias in the results of comparative studies in particular. Consequently, our study contributes to both the family coping and the measurement literatures by pointing out the possibility of nonequivalence in the factor structure of the traditional family coping measure for ethnic minority, non-English speaking BCS. Such findings can also provide a rationale for developing culturally tailored measurements for populations of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Of all subscales in the F-COPES, the passive appraisal subscale showed particularly low reliability scores in this study sample. Some studies have reported good reliability scores for the passive appraisal subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512448933">Churchill, Villareale, Monaghan, Sharp, &amp; Kieckhefer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731512448933">Navia &amp; Ossa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512448933">Ostwald, Bernal, Cron, &amp; Godwin, 2009</xref>) whereas other studies have reported that its Cronbach’s α is low even in European American samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512448933">Eaton, Davis, Hammond, Condon, &amp; McGee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512448933">Redinbaugh, Baum, Tarbell, &amp; Arnold, 2003</xref>). In the <italic>Family Assessment</italic> book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512448933">Grotevant and Carlson (1989)</xref> comment that the meaning of items comprising the passive appraisal subscale is problematic. Such inconsistent findings suggest that we need to pay attention to which items form the passive appraisal subscale and whether these items are appropriate for general use, regardless of ethnicity and culture. Specifically, “knowing luck plays a big part in how well we are able to solve family problems” or “believing if we wait long enough, the problem will go away” items may be influenced by cultural contexts. Indeed, it is known that good fortune is more central to all aspects of Chinese and Korean life and culture compared to American culture, such that the meaning of luck may be different between Eastern and Western cultures. Chinese and Korean cultures also value virtues such as patience on the basis of Confucianism, which is the standard of moral and social conduct for many Asian people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512448933">Mui &amp; Shibusawa, 2008</xref>). As a result, people in Asian cultures may believe that the virtues of patience, waiting, and tolerance are their best coping mechanisms when facing family problems or difficulties. Moreover, one study reported that Item 12, “watching television,” showed the weakest correlation with all other items in this subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512448933">Redinbaugh et al., 2003</xref>). Some people will watch television as a coping mechanism by which they can avoid responding to problems, although this item is too broad to consider it representative of a passive appraisal coping mechanism. Rather, it may be a habitual living pattern that is not related to other passive appraisal items. As a result, we cannot conclude that such items are representative coping patterns of the passive appraisal subscale. It will be important to reconsider which items are representative of passive appraisal for general populations, regardless of ethnicity and culture. Additionally, it will be essential to develop culturally tailored passive appraisal items according to ethnicity.</p>
<p>In the single-factor model, we found that the social support subscale did not adequately fit the data for Chinese American and Korean American BCS, suggesting that the items may not be measuring the same construct. Specifically, we demonstrated that the factors of relative/friend and neighbor support exist in the social support subscale. Here, we need to think about the meaning of neighbors for immigrant families. As indicated in the demographic information, more than 80% of participants still speak their native languages even though they have lived in the United States for more than 20 years; this suggests that they may still be isolated from their new societies and maintain their original cultures within their own communities because of language and cultural barriers. As a result, the meaning of neighbors in immigrant families may imply their new society, such that it will be different from a network that includes relatives and/or friends. A study that investigates social networks and social support between Korean Americans and Koreans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512448933">Lim &amp; Zebrack, 2008</xref>) could support this explanation. It will be necessary to further investigate if other ethnic minority groups show a similar pattern in the social support subscale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the original reframing subscale did not show a good fit specifically with Chinese American BCS. After deleting Item 13 (showing that we are strong), the model fit was improved; this indicates that Item 13 may be different from other items in the reframing subscale. Although the model fit of the Korean group improved after deleting Item 13, the original model also showed a good fit with Korean American BCS. Such differences in the model fit between Chinese American and Korean American BCS may reflect their cultural differences. There are two possible explanations; first, according to the F-COPES manual, the reframing subscale assesses the family’s ability to tackle obstacles, to display confidence publicly, and to initiate problem-solving strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512448933">Olson et al., 1983</xref>). Specifically, Item 13 includes a “showing” word, implying public display of the family’s confidence. However, in general, Chinese culture does not encourage talking about family issues publicly, so this item may not be appropriate in this cultural context. Second, differences in medical characteristics (cancer stage and years since cancer diagnosis, specifically) may influence differences between two ethnic groups. Given that Chinese Americans had been diagnosed with cancer at more advanced stages and survived for a shorter period of time compared to Korean Americans, Chinese Americans may have been less confident about their strengths. Nevertheless, it is unclear why Item 13 is not related to the reframing subscale in Chinese Americans only. Researchers will need to reexamine the inclusion of Item 13 in the reframing subscale using a greater number of Chinese participants and with other ethnic minority populations.</p>
<p>In terms of the spiritual support subscale, our findings showed a good fit with Chinese American and Korean American BCS; however, the single-factor model did not demonstrate model equivalency across ethnicity. This finding provided a rationale for modifying the original model to the equivalent model. Thus, we allowed a disturbance correlation between Items 14 (attending church services) and 30 (having faith in God). In fact, Item 14 is related to religiosity (i.e., one’s participation in an organized religious institution), and Item 30 is related to spirituality (i.e., concepts encompassing meaning, wholeness, connection, and peace; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512448933">Peterman, Fitchett, &amp; Brady, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512448933">Vachon, 2008</xref>). Although religiosity and spirituality are often used interchangeably, there seems to be no consensus among researchers regarding the definition of these terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512448933">Bekelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512448933">Lim &amp; Yi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512448933">Reynolds, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, some studies argue that these two phenomena are not independent of one another and are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731512448933">Stefanek, McDonald, &amp; Hess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512448933">Vachon, 2008</xref>). As a result, this disturbance correlation may reflect the unique definitions of and relationship between religiosity and spirituality.</p>
<p>Overall, the modified five-factor model showed a moderate fit with the data and demonstrated cross-ethnicity equivalence. However, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731512448933">Figure 1</xref>, seeking spiritual support showed low or nonsignificant correlation coefficients with other subscales. According to the F-COPES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512448933">McCubbin et al., 1987</xref>), seeking spiritual support should show strong relationships with social support and mobilizing subscales because these three subscales were considered external coping strategies. Nevertheless, we should not overlook cultural and medical characteristics of Chinese American and Korean American BCS. One study reported that 83% of cancer survivors have religious faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512448933">McMillmurray et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, immigrants tend to search for religious belief systems as a venue to retrieve diverse information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512448933">Lim &amp; Yi, 2009</xref>). Thus, most Chinese American and Korean American BCS who are faced with life’s challenges may use spiritual support as a general coping strategy to psychosocially adjust after a cancer diagnosis. One study supports our explanation, indicating that religious and spiritual needs are the best tool for helping cancer survivors cope with the overall effects of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512448933">Ashing-Giwa et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, seeking spiritual support may have a different meaning for ethnic minorities with breast cancer.</p>
<p>After testing the adequacy of the modified five-factor structure of the F-COPES, the F-COPES measure was validated with HRQOL, psychological distress, and family communication. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between the F-COPES and validity indicators, such that they seem to be applicable to validity testing. Our results show the equivalence of the structural model across ethnicity. This means that the modified F-COPES measure is equivalent for Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Hence, the results reaffirm that the modified F-COPES measure can be applied to Chinese American and Korean American BCS.</p>
<p>A central objective of this research was to examine the equivalence of the F-COPES between Chinese American and Korean American BCS. For the most part, there is good evidence that the F-COPES is appropriate for use with European American families. Unfortunately, there was no evidence that the F-COPES has comparable meanings for Asian Americans such as the Chinese or Koreans. Some studies have simply dropped specific subscales due to low reliability scores instead of reexamining the adequacy of the factor structure or applicability of this measure for ethnic minority populations. The equivalence for Chinese American and Korean American BCS who completed the assessments in their native language is noteworthy because these comparisons demonstrate both ethnic and language consistency of the F-COPES, suggesting that the modified model may be applicable to other ethnic minority populations. Thus, this study fills a gap in the research literature in that there are few studies that have evaluated ethnic group similarities and differences in family coping.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. First, the sample size of Chinese American and Korean American BCS was not large enough to support the generalization of these study findings. Moreover, because the Chinese and Korean versions of the survey were administered to most Chinese Americans and Korean Americans, the number of English version users (<italic>n</italic> = 15) was very small. Consequently, we could not directly test the equivalence of the F-COPES according to language. Nevertheless, these preliminary tests demonstrate differences in demographic and medical characteristics, and outcomes by language were not significant. Additionally, this study included predominantly first generation immigrants, because most breast cancer occurs after age 40 and their immigration histories are relatively short. Furthermore, immigration effects were not controlled in analyses due to small number of cells. Given that second and even third-generation Chinese Americans and Korean Americans are increasing fast, interpretations about cultural contexts should be made with caution. Future studies are needed to test the equivalence of the measure by language and generations. A second limitation is that there is no reference group for comparisons. Although this study focuses on Chinese Americans and Korean Americans, the measurement equivalence tests should include the reference group. Specifically, given that no study has examined the adequacy of the F-COPES for European American BCS, BCS may have different coping mechanism than the general population. Future study is needed to include multiethnic samples, including European Americans, to comprehensively investigate cross-ethnicity equivalence. A third limitation is the lack of longitudinal data; these data can provide more knowledge about the pattern between predictors and outcomes in validation tests. That is, we can determine whether changes in family coping would simply parallel changes in other indicators or if changes between family coping and indicators are related to each other.</p>
<p>This study makes an important contribution to understanding the family coping measure used by Chinese American and Korean American BCS by examining measurement equivalence in a cultural context. Specifically, the current study provides a rationale to examine the cross-ethnicity equivalence of measures before such measures are used in comparative research. Findings from this study suggest a number of areas for further exploration. First, research might begin by addressing whether family coping measures are applicable to the research target populations and if the structure of the measures is appropriate for them. This process should be a priority if the target population is a non-English-speaking ethnic minority. The current study did not demonstrate the adequacy of the original F-COPES measure in Chinese American and Korean American BCS. Future study is needed to understand how each subscale of the F-COPES functions in ethnic minority populations and what these coping strategies mean in different cultural contexts. Qualitative methodology and longitudinal research will be helpful for answering questions of construct relevancy and construct function. The F-COPES is not sensitive enough to see the different coping mechanism according to the stage of cancer survivorship, because it is used to identify general coping strategies without restriction for a specified time frame regarding administration of the survey. Future study is required to develop the cancer-specific tool that can appropriately capture characteristics of cancer survivors. Finally, the cross-ethnicity measurement equivalence tests will be a strong rationale for developing culturally tailored measurements for ethnic minority populations, which would extend research on cancer survivorship into culturally and ethnically tailored approaches.</p>
