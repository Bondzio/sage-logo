<abstract>
<p>In this study, we determined whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a more widely available imaging modality, is as effective as α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (AMT)–positron emission tomography (PET) in localizing epileptogenic tubers in tuberous sclerosis complex. Following that, coregistration of AMT-PET and diffusion tensor imaging scans apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in all tubers using a region-of-interest approach and were compared with AMT-PET tuber/cortex uptake ratios, which were used to differentiate between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers. Forty-three tubers, out of a total of 320 tubers, had AMT-PET uptake ratios greater than 1 and hence were classified as potentially epileptogenic. FA in epileptogenic tubers was reduced compared with the other tubers (<italic>P</italic> = .03). A significant negative correlation was observed between AMT-PET uptake ratio of epileptogenic tubers and FA values (<italic>r</italic> = –.45; <italic>P</italic> = .003). Tubers with higher AMT-PET uptake ratios corresponded well with lower FA values in tuberous sclerosis complex patients.</p>

<body>
<p>The majority of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have seizures during their lifetime, and many develop intractable epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811422751">1</xref>
</sup> In tuberous sclerosis complex subjects with intractable epilepsy, surgical resection of the offending tuber is an option to control seizures but is not always feasible. Since tuberous sclerosis complex patients often present with multiple tubers within close proximity and scalp electroencephalograms may not be able to distinguish between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers, presurgical localization of the epileptogenic lesion is very challenging.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging methods capable of differentiating epileptogenic from nonepileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex would be expected to facilitate surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811422751">2</xref>
</sup> and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of glucose metabolism<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422751">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422751">4</xref>
</sup> are sensitive in the detection of tubers but do not differentiate between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic lesions. PET imaging employing α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (AMT), a tracer of tryptophan metabolism,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811422751">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422751"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811422751">7</xref>
</sup> can differentiate between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers interictally in two-thirds of tuberous sclerosis complex patients with intractable epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811422751">8</xref>
</sup> Our group later also reported that an α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake ratio (tuber/normal cortex) cut-off value of 0.98 reliably differentiates between epileptogenic tubers and nonepileptogenic tubers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811422751">9</xref>
</sup> This ratio takes into account that nonepileptogenic tubers have <italic>lower</italic> α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan uptake than normal cortex.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET, however, is that it is not widely available. There have been attempts to pinpoint epileptogenic tubers using MRI but success has been limited. In the present study, we determined whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could assist in the differentiation between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers. Diffusion tensor imaging can provide 3-dimensional information about white matter tissue water diffusion in individual image voxels, thus offering a new method to evaluate not only the magnitude of water diffusivity but also the direction of the diffusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811422751">10</xref>
</sup> Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a quantitative diffusion tensor imaging parameter, which measures the direction-dependent diffusivity of water molecules and is an indicator of the diameter and density of fibers, myelination, and macrostructural features of brain white matter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811422751">10</xref>
</sup> Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) denotes the degree of restriction to water diffusion and is another important parameter of diffusion tensor imaging along with fractional anisotropy in identifying white matter abnormalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the diffusion tensor imaging indices (fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) of cortical tubers can be used as biomarkers of epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Seventeen children (11 boys, 6 girls; age range, 3-14 years; mean age, 7.6 years) with a diagnosis of definite tuberous sclerosis complex as defined in the revised clinical diagnostic criteria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811422751">1</xref>
</sup> and medically refractory epilepsy were included in the present study. None of these patients had been included in our previous studies. Selection criteria included presence of tubers on MRI, availability of diffusion tensor imaging and an α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET scan. Interictal and ictal scalp electroencephalogram findings were unable to accurately define the tubers for surgical resection but, instead, lateralized the seizure focus or localized the focus to a quadrant of the brain. In those brain regions, typically multiple tubers were found that could be potential surgical targets. Studies were performed in compliance with regulations of the Wayne State University Human Investigation Committee, and written informed consent of a parent or guardian was obtained.</p>
<sec id="section2-0883073811422751">
<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Procedure</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed using a 3-T Twin-Speed GE Scanner with an 8-channel head coil. The full MRI acquisition included the following series: (a) 3-dimensional structural MRI scan of the brain using a T1-weighted inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient recall sequence designed to optimize the tissue contrast between gray and white matter. Imaging parameters were as follows: repetition time/echo time/inversion time = 6.2/2.5/450 ms; flip angle = 12°; matrix size = 265 × 265, Array Spatial Sensitivity Encoding Technique factor of 2; field of view = 205 × 205 mm<sup>2</sup>, zipped by 2, with a thickness of 1.6 mm, yielding a cubic voxel of 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm<sup>3</sup>; (b) T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery acquired in 30 coronal planes with repetition time/echo time/inversion time = 11000/160/2450 ms; field of view = 240 × 240 mm<sup>2</sup>; matrix = 288 × 192; slice thickness = 4 mm and 1-mm gap, 2 repetitions; (c) axial T2-weighted fast spin echo (32 echo train length) with repetition time/echo time = 5000/108 ms; slice thickness = 4 mm; gap = 1 mm; matrix = 384 × 256, 2 repetitions.</p>

<title>α-[<sup>11</sup> C]methyl-l-tryptophan PET Scanning Procedure</title>
<p>For the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET scan, subjects fasted for 6 hours to obtain stable plasma tryptophan and large neutral amino acid levels during the study. Two venous lines were established, 1 for tracer injection and 1 for collection of timed blood samples (0.5 mL/sample, collected at 0, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes after α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan injection); plasma tryptophan concentration was measured in these samples by high-pressure liquid chromatography as previously described to confirm stable values during the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422751">11</xref></sup> Children were sedated intravenously with either nembutal (Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) if necessary. Prior studies performed on 5 adults each scanned twice (once without and once with sedation using midazolam) in our laboratory have shown no significant difference in serotonin synthesis between the 2 testing conditions (Chugani and colleagues, unpublished data, 1995). The α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (0.1 mCi/kg) was injected intravenously over 2 minutes. Twenty-five minutes after tracer injection, a dynamic emission scan of the brain (7 × 5 minutes) was acquired in 3-dimensional mode, generating 47 image planes with a slice thickness of 3.125 mm. Measured attenuation and decay correction were applied to all images. The standard uptake value (SUV; represents tissue activity concentration normalized to the injected activity per kilogram of body weight) method for semiquantitative analysis of tracer accumulation was used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422751">12</xref>
</sup> As all subjects received a standardized dose based on their weight (0.1 mCi/kg), calibrated images (μCi/mL) directly depict the standard uptake value.<sup>7</sup>

<title>Diffusion Tensor Imaging Acquisition and Generation of Fractional Anisotropy and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps</title>
<p>Spin-echo echo-planar diffusion weighted sequences were acquired in the axial plane with 55 diffusion sensitization gradients (<italic>b</italic> = 1000 [s/mm<sup>2</sup>]) applied in noncolinear directions (<italic>D<sub>i</sub>
</italic>, <italic>i</italic> = [1,…, 55]) and a T2-weighted reference (<italic>D</italic>
<sub>0</sub>) scan (<italic>b</italic> = 0 [s/mm<sup>2</sup>]). The diffusion weighted sequence consisted of the following imaging parameters: a set of minimum 34 axial slices of 3-mm thickness without gap, field of view = 240 × 240 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix = 128 × 128 reconstructed with homodyne to 256 × 256, repetition time/echo time = 9000 to 11000/80 ms. Double radiofrequency-refocusing pulses and parallel imaging capability (Array Spatial Sensitivity Encoding Technique factor of 2) were applied to reduce eddy current and geometric distortion artifacts derived from echo-planar imaging. Because the scans for tuberous sclerosis complex subjects were clinical MRI studies, sedation was used as necessary by the sedation team at Children’s Hospital of Michigan according to standard clinical protocols. All children were monitored for movement during the scan. If there was significant movement, those scans for which MRI was repeated were removed from the study. Diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were generated using diffusion tensor imaging studio software.<sup>

<title>Regions of Interest</title>
<p>Cortical tubers were visually identified on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2-weighted images. Definable lesions in the cortex that were hyperintense or heterointense with calcification were counted as cortical tubers on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted images. Hyperintense lesions within the white matter such as subcortical heterotopias or radial migration lines were not taken as cortical tubers. α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET, diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient map images were coregistered to fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2-weighted images using VINCI software (VINCI 3.80.0, Germany).

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET standardized uptake values of the cortical tubers were divided by the standardized uptake value from normal cortical regions to obtain the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET tuber/cortex uptake ratios. The values for normal cortex regions of interest were taken across several planes and averaged for each patient. Normal cortex was identified based on all the neuroimaging data. In our previous studies, we have reported that epileptogenic tubers have an α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake of 0.98 or more.<sup>9</sup> In a subsequent study, we reported that a ratio of 1.02 should be used as an optimal cutoff between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422751">14</xref>
</sup> Here, we have used an α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake ratio of 1 as a cut-off for differentiating between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers. Apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy values of epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers based on the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake ratio cut-off were entered into a database and analyzed using a statistical program (SPSS version 19).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated in tuberous sclerosis complex patients that cortex with increased α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake corresponds well with the seizure onset area as defined by intracranial electroencephalogram recordings.<sup>9</sup> Thus, the location of increased α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan uptake on PET can be a useful guide for locating the epileptogenic cortex. In tuberous sclerosis complex subjects with intractable epilepsy, a cut-off value of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake ratio (&gt;1) was ascertained to differentiate between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.<sup>9</sup> The rationale for performing the present study was to determine whether a more widely available neuroimaging tool (ie, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging) might suffice to differentiate epileptogenic from nonepileptognic tubers and, thus, replace α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET in the presurgical evaluation of tuberous sclerosis complex patients since α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET is not a widely available tool.</p>
<p>In this preliminary retrospective analysis, we report that the fractional anisotropy of epileptogenic tuber(s) is significantly lower than fractional anisotropy of nonepileptogenic tubers. We also found a good correlation between fractional anisotropy and α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake ratio in epileptogenic tubers. Although fractional anisotropy values are helpful, it is unlikely that they have the same localization accuracy as α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET. Nevertheless, we have begun a prospective study to address this issue. Based on these preliminary data, we believe these 2 modalities (diffusion tensor imaging and α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET) complement each other in identifying epileptogenic tubers.</p>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex is fundamentally a brain disorder of cortical development and, histologically, the normal cortical architecture is disrupted within a tuber and effaced by abnormally oriented dysmorphic neurons, reactive astrocytes and eosinophilic cells, which may exhibit both neuronal and glial features. Thus, both the disruption of normal cortical architecture and the presence of atypical cells may contribute to the abnormalities observed in diffusion tensor imaging indices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811422751">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811422751">16</xref>
</sup> Motion of fluid within the brain is normally restricted to movement along the same axis as the axon or myelin sheath. When neurons or myelin sheaths are damaged, the fractional anisotropy decreases because the fluid can move freely along various axes. On the basis of our diffusion tensor imaging assessment in tuberous sclerosis complex patients, we suggest that these regions (tubers) most likely reflect histopathologic abnormalities of cortical dysplasia and this in turn is manifested as a fractional anisotropy abnormality.</p>

<p>In this study we have relied on α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET to differentiate between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic tubers. α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET has been shown to have 20% to 188% higher uptake in epileptogenic compared with nonepileptogenic tubers in two-thirds of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex and medically intractable epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422751">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811422751">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422751">14</xref>
</sup> In our epilepsy surgery program, α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET is now routinely used as one of the most important tools in the presurgical evaluation of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex for epilepsy surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422751">14</xref>
</sup> A number of other surgery programs, including one from overseas, refers tuberous sclerosis complex patients to Detroit for α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET scans. Indeed, detection of tuber(s) with increased α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake can provide additional localizing information, even when the scalp electroencephalogram results are not precisely localizing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422751">14</xref>
</sup> Therefore, it is clinically desirable to obtain independent imaging data to confirm the location of the presumed epileptic focus, to enhance the confidence of patient selection for epilepsy surgery, and, in some cases, to raise the possibility of additional epileptic regions missed by scalp electroencephalogram. α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET can help optimize subdural electrode placement in such cases.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET is its availability. Although PET scanners are now widely available, few centers have the expertise in the synthesis of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan. Furthermore, the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan is labeled with <sup>11</sup>C, which has a half-life of only 20 minutes and can, therefore, be synthesized only at PET centers that have cyclotrons. Efforts are being made to overcome this pitfall by developing an <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811422751">18</xref>
</sup>F-labeled α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (2-hour half-life) and thus allow transport to nearby PET centers, as is being done widely with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose.</p>

<title>Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</title>
<p>Diffusion tensor imaging techniques can be of value in the investigation of children with tuberous sclerosis complex and show some promise in improving our understanding of tuber properties. Some diffusion tensor imaging studies in tuberous sclerosis complex patients have reported increased apparent diffusion coefficient values<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811422751">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811422751">18</xref>
</sup> in cortical tubers with no difference in fractional anisotropy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811422751">18</xref>
</sup> compared with controls. Reductions of fractional anisotropy were also observed in a previous diffusion tensor imaging study of patients with miscellaneous cortical dysplasias.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811422751">19</xref>
</sup> In another study, fractional anisotropy of corpus callosum correlated negatively with total tuber volume.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811422751">20</xref>
</sup> In the present study, we compared fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient values in epileptogenic tubers with values in nonepileptogenic tubers, as defined by α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET, in tuberous sclerosis complex patients. Reduced fractional anisotropy observed in tubers in general is consistent with results from some of the previous reports. Indeed, reduced fractional anisotropy has been described in a variety of conditions associated with hypomyelination and increased ectopic neurons that can also occur in the cortical tubers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811422751">21</xref>
</sup> and therefore reduced fractional anisotropy observed in this study may indicate the underlying pathology of cortical tubers. Our study shows that epileptogenic tubers have even lower fractional anisotropy than tubers in general, thus providing some value in localization for epilepsy surgery. For example, fractional anisotropy measurements may be useful in α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET negative cases. Although apparent diffusion coefficient values were higher in epileptogenic tubers compared with nonepileptogenic tubers, the increase was not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Methodological Considerations</title>
<p>One of the limitations of this study is accurate assessment of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake values for small tubers owing to partial volume effects. Region of interest–based analysis of α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET uptake can give false-positive results for tubers whose diameter falls below the resolution of images. However such small tubers are not usually epileptogenic and hence were omitted from our analysis. The second issue is that reduced fractional anisotropy is found in a wide variety of neurologic disorders and is not specific to tuberous sclerosis complex; still it could provide some predictive value when combined with other methods.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Converging information between α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET and diffusion tensor imaging along with extracranial ictal and interictal electroencephalogram localization can improve our ability to select candidates who would potentially benefit from surgical treatment and minimize the invasiveness of currently available presurgical localization procedures. In our opinion, invasive electroencephalogram monitoring should never be used for diagnostic purposes. Our initial results using α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan PET and diffusion tensor imaging support the concept that newer neuroimaging techniques, when combined with scalp electroencephalogram, may be able to identify epileptogenic tubers and those tuberous sclerosis complex patients who are surgical candidates less invasively and more cost-effectively.</p>
