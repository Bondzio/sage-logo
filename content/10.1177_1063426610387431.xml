      <abstract>
        <p>This study reports the results from a Swedish randomized controlled trial of a
          standardized behavior management intervention. The intervention targeted students with
          externalizing behavior in a regular education setting. First- and second-grade students
            (<italic>N</italic> = 100) from 38 schools were randomly assigned to either the
          intervention or an active comparison group. Observer, teacher, and peer ratings were
          collected at pretest, posttest (6 months later), and follow-up (14 months after pretest).
          Significant intervention effects were found on student externalizing behavior and teacher
          behavior management at both posttest and follow-up. The intervention effect on student
          externalizing behavior was mediated by change in teacher behavior. Moderating effects of
          demographic and classroom variables were explored, as well as the social validity of the
          intervention. The results are discussed in relation to cost-effectiveness and feasibility
          of behavioral interventions in typical school settings.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Externalizing behavior among young children, such as aggressive and disruptive acts, is one
      of the most important risk factors for a deviant development through adolescence and adulthood
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610387431">Farrington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610387431">Flanagan, Bierman, &amp; Kam, 2003</xref>).
      The reported prevalence of problem behaviors among students in Sweden is lower compared to
      other developed countries, but still, approximately 5% of the students are in need of special
      service and intervention due to serious emotional and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610387431">Heiervang, Goodman, &amp; Goodman,
      2008</xref>). These children enter the school system unprepared for the experience of
      schooling and often bring emerging antisocial behavior patterns with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063426610387431">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>). Once in
      the school system, a number of dynamic processes further increase the risk for academic
      failure and long-term negative outcomes. For example, high-risk students are often subject to
      an excess of teacher reprimands at the expense of contingent praise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610387431">Beaman &amp; Wheldall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610387431">Clunies-Ross, Little, &amp; Kienhuis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1063426610387431">Rydell &amp; Henricsson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1063426610387431">Van Acker, Grant, &amp; Henry, 1996</xref>).
      Furthermore, the level of teacher support and teacher–student conflict have a significant
      effect on future school and peer adjustment, independent from student behaviors and
      characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426610387431">Hamre &amp; Pianta,
        2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426610387431">Hughes, Lou, Kwok, &amp;
        Loyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1063426610387431">Silver, Measelle,
        Armstrong, &amp; Essex, 2005</xref>). Early failure within the school system increases the
      likelihood of subsequent placement in alternative educational settings and school absenteeism,
      which is a key risk factor for several serious outcomes including school dropout, suicide
      attempt, teenage pregnancy, violence, and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426610387431">Kearney, 2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the United States, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426610387431">Individuals
        with Disabilities Education Act (2004)</xref> directly references the need for and use of
      positive behavioral interventions and functional behavioral assessment processes for students
      who display problem behavior that impedes their success at school. To meet these requirements,
      several researchers have developed school-wide intervention models with system-level support
      for involved school personnel. These models enhance the capacity of schools to design
      effective environments that improve the fit or link between research-validated practices
      (e.g., behavior management strategies) and the environments in which teaching and learning
      occur. An example is School-Wide Positive Behavioral Support (SWPBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1063426610387431">Sugai et al., 2000</xref>), which is currently being adopted
      by more than 7,000 schools across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426610387431">Bradley, Doolittle, Lopez, Smith, &amp; Sugai, 2007</xref>).
      SWPBS is organized as a three-tiered model, in which the primary tier represents school-wide
      systems intended to prevent challenging behaviors and affect approximately 85% to 90% of a
      school’s population. The secondary tier is reserved for students who display emerging or
      modest challenging behaviors, involving between 7% and 10% of a school population. The
      tertiary tier targets approximately 3% to 5% of the student body, who require more complex and
      individualized support beyond their exposure to universal and selective interventions.
      Interventions at this level are based on functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and involve
      high investments (e.g., external consultants) to prevent the emergence or continuation of
      higher intensity problem behaviors. The FBA guides the implementation of behavioral support
      plans that often include behavior management strategies (BM).</p>
    <p>Despite the common use of FBA and BM for individual high-risk students, there are several
      issues that limit claims about efficacy and effectiveness of such interventions. First, a
      review of the FBA literature reveals a body of research that spans the past 30 years, but most
      of the research concerns children in contained settings with serious disabilities and has
      little direct relation to general education students in classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426610387431">Conroy, Clark, Fox, &amp; Gable, 2000</xref>;
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1063426610387431">Scott et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
    <p>Second, the limited evidence supporting FBA and BM in general education settings is primarily
      based on single- subject and within-group experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1063426610387431">Simonsen, Fairbanks, Briesch, Myers, &amp; Sugai,
      2008</xref>). There have been promising reports in recent years from randomized trials of
      school-wide multi-component intervention models involving FBA and BM, such as SWPBS (e.g.,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610387431">Horner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1063426610387431">Sorlie &amp; Ogden, 2007</xref>).
      Nevertheless, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of FBA and BM for high-risk students
      in those studies. In the few randomized trials investigating the specific effect of individual
      BM, the results have been mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1063426610387431">Metropolitan Area Child Study Research Group (2002)</xref> reported no significant
      intervention effects on student behavior, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone et al. (2009)</xref> found significant effects on
      student behaviors with effect sizes in the medium range. The present lack of randomized trials
      of BM, and discrepant views on what counts as credible evidence, has led to conflicting
      conclusions in reviews of interventions for externalizing behavior. Some reviews state that
      school-based BM is an evidence-based intervention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1063426610387431">Pelham &amp; Fabiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1063426610387431">Wilson &amp; Lipsey, 2007</xref>), whereas others exclude this
      type of intervention due to lack of randomized trials (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610387431">Eyberg, Nelson, &amp; Boggs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1063426610387431">Mytton, DiGuiseppi, Gough, Taylor, &amp;
        Logan, 2006</xref>). One could argue that evidence from studies using single-subject design
      shows that individual BM causes behavior change in students, but many researchers would argue
      that evidence from randomized trials also is necessary to enable high-quality, wide-scale
      dissemination of such interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426610387431">American Psychological Association, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610387431">Flay &amp; Collins, 2005</xref>).</p>
    <p>Third, recent evidence suggests that FBA and BM targeting individual students are conducted
      either with such lack of rigor and logic as to be worthless or with such complexity and
      formality as to be unrealistic for the typical school setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610387431">Blood &amp; Neel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1063426610387431">Scott, Anderson, &amp; Spaulding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1063426610387431">Van Acker, Boreson, Gable, &amp; Potterton,
        2005</xref>). To improve the quality of the implementation and increase the feasibility for
      typical school personnel in everyday school settings, there is a need to develop standardized
      training models of BM. Such models also provide opportunities to conduct randomized controlled
      trials with better control of the independent variable (i.e., the intervention).</p>
    <p>Fourth, interventions in outcome studies of BM have often been applied with heavy involvement
      by the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610387431">Lane, Weisenbach,
        Phillips, &amp; Wehby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1063426610387431">Sasso, Conroy, Peck-Stichter, &amp; Fox, 2001</xref>). Interventions that largely are
      implemented by consultants are not realistic options for most school districts, because of the
      involved costs and lack of qualified specialists. For a fact, most students in need of
      intervention do not gain access to service at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426610387431">Kazdin, 2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>To conclude, a widespread dissemination of FBA and BM requires the development of
      intervention models that are not only effective but also feasible and involve limited costs
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1063426610387431">Romeo, Byford, &amp; Knapp,
      2005</xref>).</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a standardized FBA-guided behavior management
      intervention program in a randomized controlled trial. The program targeted individual
      students, screened for externalizing behavior. The primary outcome domains were measures of
      student externalizing behavior and teacher behavior management. The lack of active control
      groups (i.e., attention control or alternative intervention) is a common limitation in
      school-based intervention research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610387431">Flay
        &amp; Collins, 2005</xref>). For that reason, the BM condition was compared with a condition
      in which the teachers were trained in a universal social and emotional skills training
      program. The program in the comparison group did not involve training in BM, nor did it
      directly target externalizing behavior. Our hypothesis was therefore that the BM intervention
      would outperform the comparison group on measures of student externalizing behavior and
      teacher behavior management. It was also hypothesized that change in teacher behavior would
      mediate the change in student externalizing behavior.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Elementary public schools in the greater Stockholm, Sweden, urban area (population = 1.9
          million) were informed about the study through announcements. To be included in the study,
          the teachers had to teach a class in a regular education setting and have at least one
          student with externalizing behavior problems. The level of externalizing behavior problems
          was assessed through a screening procedure, in which all students in each teacher’s class
          were rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>very
            much</italic>). The ratings were then used as a base for discussion between the
          researchers and the teachers to identify students who were suitable for the study. A
          written consent from the targeted student’s parent was required for participation. After
          randomization, the teachers also completed the <italic>Strengths and Difficulties
            Questionnaire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426610387431">Goodman,
            1999</xref>). The scale has been shown to discriminate clinical populations of children
          with diagnoses such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and
          attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426610387431">Goodman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610387431">Heiervang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610387431">Malmberg, Rydell, &amp; Smedje,
            2003</xref>). The mean externalizing score for the students included in this study was
          more than two standard deviations above the average in Scandinavian normative samples
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610387431">Heiervang et al., 2008</xref>). No
          student scored less than one standard deviation above the normative average.</p>
        <p>Of the 100 students included in the study, 86% were boys. The students attended first-
          and second-grade regular education classrooms (<italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 8.4
          years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.6), with an average class size of 22 students
            (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.0). In almost one third (29%) of the students’ families, both
          parents were born abroad, arriving as immigrants primarily from former Yugoslavia, the
          Middle East, and Northern Africa. This proportion was slightly larger than the average of
          20% within the city of Stockholm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1063426610387431">Statistics Sweden, 2008</xref>). To allocate financial needs to school districts, the
          City of Stockholm uses a socioeconomic index ranging from 44 to 159 (<italic>M</italic> =
          100, <italic>SD</italic> = 48). The index is based on factors such as household income,
          citizenship, marital status, crime rate, employment status, and number of students who
          drop out of school. Low indexes reflect less poverty and social problems. The
          participating students attended schools in neighborhoods with an index ranging from 46 to
          144 (<italic>M</italic> = 94, <italic>SD</italic> = 28), suggesting that the sample was
          representative of the city population in terms of social and economic factors. A minor
          part of the targeted students (25%) received between 1 and 3 hours of weekly special
          education in small groups, besides their regular education. There were no significant
          differences between the two experimental conditions on any demographic or school-related
          variables (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
        <p>Because most studies of behavioral school-based interventions have been conducted in the
          United States, it may be relevant for the reading of this article to state some
          similarities and differences between the American and Swedish school systems. The Swedish
          and American educational systems are fairly similar in terms of expenditure on primary and
          lower secondary educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1063426610387431">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,
            2009</xref>). However, all schools in Sweden are publicly funded and parents are free to
          choose whichever school they wish for their child. The students usually stay in the same
          classroom with the same teacher over periods of 3 years, in contrast to students in the
          United States, who usually change teachers each year. Thus, the Swedish system offers
          opportunities to conduct studies using prolonged training and follow-up assessments with
          the same teachers.</p>

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>A total of 189 teachers from 54 schools indicated their interest to participate in the
          study. At the time of randomization, 38 teachers did not have a student who met the
          inclusion criteria and 51 teachers no longer expressed interest in participation. Thus,
          100 eligible teacher–student pairs from 38 schools were randomly assigned to either the BM
          intervention or the comparison group. To prevent spillover effects between conditions,
          teachers and students from the same schools were grouped and randomized to either
          intervention or comparison. Thus, the unit of randomization was schools
            (<italic>N</italic> = 38), whereas the unit of intervention and measurement was
          teachers/students (<italic>N</italic> = 100). Because there were more training resources
          available for the BM intervention than for the program offered to the comparison group,
          the intervention group was oversampled. Therefore, 26 schools with 60 teachers/students
          from 54 classrooms were allocated to the intervention group, whereas 12 schools with 40
          teachers/students from 34 classrooms were allocated to the comparison group. Because some
          teachers shared classrooms, the number of teacher–student pairs was larger than the number
          of classrooms. In such cases, each teacher was responsible for one targeted student in the
          class.</p>
        <p>Measures were collected at pretest, posttest (6 months after pretest; <italic>SD</italic>
          = 1.1 months), and follow-up (14 months after pretest; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.9 months).
          Although the measurement timing varied between participants, there were no significant
          differences between the two groups (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). The same teacher
          performed the screening, training, and ratings throughout the whole 14-month period, which
          was possible since teachers in Sweden generally stay with the same group of students for 3
          years.</p>
        <sec id="section4-1063426610387431">
          <title>The intervention</title>
          <p>The teacher training procedure in the intervention group followed a program known as
            “COMET” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426610387431">Forster &amp; Karlberg,
              2005</xref>). The program primarily involves FBA-guided interventions targeting
            individual students but also includes general classroom behavior management strategies.
            Individually tailored interventions guided by FBA usually are implemented as part of the
            third tier in school-wide interventions based on the tier model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610387431">Horner et al., 2009</xref>). However, due to the
            standardized nature of the COMET program and the fact that a relatively large number of
            teachers can be served by each consultant, it can probably be applied at both the
            secondary and tertiary levels within school-wide intervention programs. A detailed
            program manual supports the standardization of COMET. The program manual includes BM
            strategies and prescribes homework exercises that are implemented between training
            workshops. The selection of BM strategies is based on previously published
            school-intervention manuals and books (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610387431">Kratochwill &amp; Bergan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1063426610387431">Morris, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426610387431">Wielkiewicz, 1995</xref>). The manual
            also includes a simplified stepwise FBA procedure that guides the application of the
            individual interventions. The first step is to identify problem behaviors and matching
            behavioral goals for the targeted student. Thereafter, occurrence and triggering
            antecedents are assessed for 2 weeks, before an individual intervention plan is
            formulated. All intervention plans include goal setting (i.e., clearly stating the
            behavioral expectations with the student) and contingent praise when the student engages
            in the stated behaviors. All interventions also include planned ignoring and positively
            stated commands in response to problem behaviors, since harsh and negative reprimands
            often function both as antecedents to and as reinforcement of such behaviors. Thus, the
            primary targets of change on behalf of the teachers are to increase the use of praise
            and decrease the use of harsh reprimands. As an option, the teachers can enhance the
            reinforcement of the goal behaviors through token systems, which in turn could be
            enhanced through the use of back-up reinforcement by the student’s parents. Once the
            strategies targeting the individual student are in place, the teachers continue with two
            BM procedures targeting the entire classroom: stating and reinforcing classroom rules,
            and cooperative learning exercises. In the latter strategy, the teachers let the
            students work in pairs with structured academic assignments. The students are instructed
            to prompt and reinforce each other throughout the exercise.</p>
          <p>The content of the program is implemented during nine 3-hour workshops by a consultant
            with groups of 4 to 5 teachers. The program manual includes detailed agendas prescribing
            specific activities that are to be covered during each workshop. Behavior management
            strategies are practiced through modeling and role-playing supported by instructional
            videotapes. A large part of the workshops is devoted to homework assignment and
            follow-up. All teachers receive similar assignments, but they are tailored to the
            individual students through the FBA process. The teachers implement the homework
            assignments during 1 or 2 weeks between the workshops.</p>
          <p>In this study, the first workshop was scheduled directly after pretest measures were
            collected, and the last workshop was given approximately a month before posttest. During
            the last workshop, a plan for the maintenance of improvements in behavior management is
            formulated for each teacher. The teachers in the study attended on average 7.2
              (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.3) of the nine workshops, which means that the average number
            of total training hours per teacher was 22. The teachers were provided professional
            development release time to attend the workshops.</p>
          <p>For the majority of the workshops (65%), the consultant was a clinical psychologist who
            was trained in BM and FBA by a professor of special education. A certified teacher and
            PhD student in education participated as an assistant consultant and subsequently was
            the leader of a lesser part of the workshops (35%), under supervision of the first
            consultant. Both workshop consultants were part of the research team.</p>

          <title>The comparison group</title>
          <p>The teachers in the comparison group were trained in a universal prevention program
            known as CHARLIE (Chemical Abuse Resolution Lies In Education), which was developed by
            the Storefront Group in Minnesota (<italic>Project CHARLIE manual</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1063426610387431">1987</xref>). The program is based on a
            manual containing 74 lesson plans with social and emotional learning exercises. The
            classroom teacher implements the program in groups of 15 to 25 students. A specific
            skill is discussed, modeled, and role-played during one lesson each week. Examples of
            skills are giving compliments, receiving criticism, listening, conflict resolution,
            sharing, decision making, assertiveness, and being friendly. The program does not
            directly target individual students or externalizing behavior, nor does it involve
            teacher behavior management. Thus, the program was not expected to have a specific
            effect on measures related to student externalizing behaviors or teacher behavior
            management. Instead, the purpose was to provide credible attention to the comparison
            group teachers, as opposed to using a wait-list or no-treatment control group. The
            reason for choosing CHARLIE was that it is a highly accepted and widespread school-based
            program in Sweden, despite the lack of supporting research evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610387431">Ferrer-Wreder, Stattin, Lorente, Tubman,
              &amp; Adamson, 2004</xref>).</p>
          <p>Certified staff from the CHARLIE organization in Sweden trained groups of 20 teachers
            during two full-day workshops, which mainly were devoted to role-playing of lesson plans
            from the manual. The workshops were scheduled immediately after the pretest measurement
            collection. After the workshops, the teachers applied the program without further
            support or guidance, consistent with the manner in which the program is typically
            implemented. The teachers were provided professional development release time to attend
            the workshops. Because the study targeted individual high-risk students, the teachers
            were given the rationale that these students might benefit as a result of general
            improvement of social and emotional skills in the entire class. To further increase the
            credibility of the intervention in the comparison group, the teachers were offered to
            take part in an additional 3-hour small group workshop. During the workshop, the
            participants discussed the parts of the CHARLIE program that would be most beneficial
            for the targeted high-risk students. Three of the teachers in the comparison group
            missed one of the full-day workshops and six teachers missed the 3-hour workshop. Thus,
            on average, the teachers attended 18 training hours in the comparison group.</p>

          <title>Intervention fidelity</title>
          <p>The primary targets of change on behalf of the teachers in the intervention group,
            increased use of praise at the expense of harsh reprimands, were measured through
            independent observations and are reported in the Results section. The fidelity of other
            intervention strategies in the BM program was measured through teacher reports at
            posttest and follow-up. Because the interventions were tailored to the individual
            students’ needs, the specific strategies that the teachers implemented varied. All
            teachers (100%) stated behavioral goals for the targeted students and reported that they
            subsequently praised those behaviors. Most teachers also applied a token system linked
            to the behavioral goals (73% and 75% at posttest and follow-up, respectively). Slightly
            less than half of the teachers included home notes with back-up reinforcement as part of
            the token system (45% at both measurement points). It was also assessed to what extent
            the teachers implemented the general classroom management strategies. Most teachers
            stated and reinforced classroom rules (68% and 73% at posttest and follow-up,
            respectively). Cooperative learning exercises were implemented by less than half of the
            teachers (38% and 48% at posttest and follow-up, respectively), who used the exercises
            during 15 lessons on average (<italic>SD</italic> = 15).</p>
          <p>Because the purpose of the program in the comparison group was to provide the teachers
            with credible attention, no fidelity measures related to the content of that program
            were collected. However, the teachers reported the number of implemented training
            lessons, which on average was 13 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11) at posttest and 19
              (<italic>SD</italic> = 19) at follow-up.</p>
          <p>During the time period between pretest and follow-up, the teachers in both conditions
            were instructed not to use any materials or strategies from the other condition. This
            was in part controlled for through the randomization process, in which all teachers from
            a single school were allocated to the same condition.</p>

        <title>Measures</title>
        <p>The students were the main targets in the study, but measures of teacher behavior were
          also collected, because FBA and BM are based on the idea that student behavior change is
          facilitated through change in teacher behavior. Thus, the main outcome domains were
          externalizing student behavior, teacher praise, and teacher reprimands. Because
          externalizing behavior often coincides and interacts with hyperactivity and peer problems
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426610387431">Ladd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1063426610387431">Pedersen, Vitaro, Barker, &amp; Borge,

            Schrepferman, Patrick, &amp; Stoolmiller, 2004</xref>), secondary measures related to
          these constructs were also collected. Finally, student on-task behavior during deskwork
          was measured, due to the increased risk of academic failure for students with
          externalizing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426610387431">Kearney,
            2008</xref>). The specific measures that were collected within each construct are
          specified below.</p>
        <sec id="section8-1063426610387431">
          <title>Independent observations</title>
          <p>At each measurement point, independent observers who were kept blind to the
            experimental condition visited the classroom of the targeted students for one full day.
            This means that every participating teacher–student pair was observed for 4 to 5 hours
            on three occasions (pretest, posttest, and follow-up). The students had the same
            schedule on each occasion, which included at least one lesson of individual deskwork.
            Three types of recordings were performed.</p>
          <p>First, the observers used continuous event recordings of the targeted student’s
            externalizing behavior as well as harsh teacher reprimands directed at those students.
            These recordings were extended throughout the entire day and included recess.
            Externalizing behavior was defined as a student acting in ways that disturbed or hurt
            other students and/or the teacher (e.g., teasing, making noise, or acting aggressively).
            A harsh reprimand was defined as raising the voice and/or using negative descriptions of
            the students’ behavior.</p>
          <p>Second, the time on task of the targeted student was recorded through time sampling
            during 40 minutes of deskwork. Every 30 seconds, the observer recorded whether or not
            the student was on task, which was defined as actively engaging in the task at hand or
            listening to the teacher.</p>
          <p>Third, after the deskwork observation period and at the end of the observation day, the
            observer made an estimate of how many times the target student was explicitly praised by
            the teacher on a 3-point scale (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>one or two
              times</italic>, 2 = <italic>three or more times</italic>). The cutoff at three or more
            instances of praise generated an even distribution of the data. The two estimates of
            praise (after deskwork and at the end of the day) were correlated in the moderate to
            strong range at pretest, posttest, and follow-up (<italic>r</italic> = .57,
              <italic>r</italic> = .50, and <italic>r</italic> = .70, respectively). Therefore, a
            composite praise score was computed as the standardized mean of the two scores. The
            reason for not using a continuous event recording of teacher praise was that it was
            expected to occur with low frequency.</p>
          <p>The observers were master’s students in psychology who were recruited for the purpose
            of the study. Although the observers were kept blind to the intervention condition, it
            may sometimes have been obvious that the teachers they visited participated in a
            particular experimental condition. Therefore, to prevent bias, the observers were also
            kept uninformed of the specific content of the teacher training in the two conditions,
            as well as the purpose of the study. As far as possible, the same observer visited a
            teacher at pretest, posttest, and follow-up, which was achieved in about half of the
            cases. Before pretest, members of the research team trained the observers to criterion
            by showing videotapes of teacher–student interactions. The interrater reliability was
            good to excellent between the trained observers (.67 &lt; <italic>K</italic> &lt; .84).
            For the purpose of validating the observer ratings, the teachers completed a brief
            rating at the end of the day during which the observer visited the classroom. The
            teachers were kept blind to the ratings performed by the observer, and vice versa. The
            rating consisted of three items that were conceptually matched with the observer-rated
            behaviors. Each item was rated from 1 (<italic>never/very bad</italic>) to 5
              (<italic>all of the time/very good</italic>). The first item (“How often did the
            student act disturbingly in the classroom?”) was significantly correlated with the
            observer rating of student externalizing behavior across all measurement points
              (<italic>r</italic> = .40, <italic>r</italic> = .43, and <italic>r</italic> = .52,
            respectively). The second item (“How much of the time was the student engaged in
            schoolwork?”) was in turn consistently correlated with the observer rating of time on
            task (<italic>r</italic> = .52, <italic>r</italic> = .60, and <italic>r</italic> = .41,
            respectively). The third item (“How was your relation to the child during the day?”) was
            expected to correlate with the observer rating of teacher reprimands and praise.
            However, only the observer rating of teacher reprimands was consistently correlated with
            that item (<italic>r</italic> = −.38, <italic>r</italic> = −.39, and <italic>r</italic>
            = −.30, respectively). For teacher praise, the correlation was only significant at
            pretest (<italic>r</italic> = .27). Nevertheless, for the most part, the daily teacher
            ratings supported the validity of the independent observations.</p>
          <p>The distributions of the observer ratings of student externalizing behavior and teacher
            reprimands were skewed. Therefore, those variables were transformed using modular ranks
            before further analyses were conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1063426610387431">Zimmerman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1063426610387431">in press)</xref>. The variance homogeneity of the
            nontransformed variables was tested with Levene’s test, since heterogeneity has been
            found to inflate the risk of Type I error in rank transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1063426610387431">Zimmerman, 2004</xref>). The test revealed that the
            variance was equal in the experimental conditions.</p>

          <title>Teacher ratings</title>
          <p>The teacher rating used in the study was the <italic>Conners Teacher Rating
              Scale</italic> (CTRS-39; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426610387431">Conners,

            between 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) and 3 (<italic>very much</italic>). The internal
            consistencies in the present sample of the CTRS subscales were <italic>α</italic> = .77
            for externalizing behavior (conduct problems), <italic>α</italic> = .76 for
            hyperactivity, and <italic>α</italic> = .72 for peer problems (asocial).</p>
          <p>The teachers also performed a brief class-wide rating of externalizing behavior (BREB)
            for the targeted students and his or her classmates (<italic>N</italic> = 1,940 for all
            students in the targeted students classrooms). A reason for including this measure was
            that it allows for normative comparisons. The scale has been used by the research group
            in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1063426610387431">Sundell,

              never</italic>) and 5 (<italic>almost always</italic>), which are averaged to achieve
            a total score for each student. The items are “aggressive—starts fights, is mean to
            peers, hits or pushes other students,” “disruptive—disrupts play or activities,” and
            “peer aggression—is intrusive and seeks contact in aggressive ways.” The test–retest

          <title>Peer ratings</title>
          <p>Positive and negative peer nominations were collected in each class by a research
            assistant, following the procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426610387431">Coie, Dodge, and Coppotelli (1982)</xref>. The names of
            all students in a given class were handed out to the participants. The research
            assistant who administered the peer ratings ensured that the students recognized the
            names of all classmates by reading them aloud in front of the class. The children were
            then asked to circle the names of the three children they most liked to play with
            (positive nominations) and the three children they least liked to play with (negative
            nominations). The nominations were standardized within classrooms.</p>
          <p>Peer nominations have been shown to be reliable and valid with both younger and older

            later behavior problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426610387431">Ladd,

              <italic>r</italic> = −.31. Test–retest reliability across 6 months was investigated in
            a separate untreated sample (<italic>N</italic> = 817) and was <italic>r</italic> = .72

            nominations variable was correlated with teacher-rated externalizing behavior (BREB) at
            pretest (<italic>r</italic> = .48), which was stronger compared to the corresponding
            correlation for the positive nominations variable (<italic>r</italic> = −.19).
            Relatively stronger links between negative nominations and externalizing behavior have
            also been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610387431">Johnston, Pelham, Crawford, &amp; Atkins, 1988</xref>;

        <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
        <p>At baseline, the experimental conditions were compared using a one-way analysis of
          variance (ANOVA) for the outcome measures and demographic variables that were measured
          with continuous variables. For the categorical demographic variables (e.g., gender),
          chi-square was used in the comparison. Intervention effects were analyzed separately at
          posttest and follow-up, using a repeated measures ANOVA. The independent variables were
          Experimental Condition (intervention vs. comparison) and Time (pre–post and pre–follow-up,
          respectively).</p>
        <p>The participating targeted students (<italic>N</italic> = 100) were nested within
          classrooms (<italic>N</italic> = 88), which were nested within schools (<italic>N</italic>
          = 38). To control for dependence among participants, the most conservative measure would
          have been to conduct the analyses of intervention effects at the school level
            (<italic>N</italic> = 38), which was the unit of randomization. However, that would not
          give a fair representation of the effects, because the unit of intervention was at the
          student level (<italic>N</italic> = 100). Therefore, to account for the nesting of
          participants, the following measures were taken. First, an analysis was conducted that
          compared the intervention effects at the class level (<italic>N</italic> = 88) with the
          effects at the student level (<italic>N</italic> = 100), which revealed no differences.
          Therefore, to account for the nesting of students within classrooms, all analyses of the
          outcome measures were conducted at the class level (<italic>N</italic> = 88). Second, to
          account for the nesting of classrooms within schools, the intraclass correlation
          coefficients (ICCs) and variation inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated for every
          outcome measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1063426610387431">Murray &amp; Hannan,
            1990</xref>). The ICC represents the extent to which an outcome measure correlates
          between classes within the same school. The VIFs are derived from the ICCs and are used to
          compensate the <italic>F</italic> values in the analyses of intervention effects. The mean
          ICC for the outcome measures was 0.09 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.10). ICCs at that level are
          considered to be high, which means that the classrooms within the schools were fairly
          dependent. Nevertheless, the mean VIF was only 1.13 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.14), which is
          low considering that a VIF of 1.0 indicates no dependence among classrooms. The reason for
          the low VIF values was that most schools contained only one or two participating classes.
          To summarize, the analyses of the intervention effects were performed at the classroom
          level (<italic>N</italic> = 88), accounting for the nesting of students within classrooms.
          The <italic>F</italic> values in the ANOVAs were then adjusted with the VIFs, which
          accounted for the nesting of classrooms within schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1063426610387431">Murray, 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>With an alpha set at .05 and a sample size of 88 classrooms, the statistical power to

        <title>Attrition and Missing Data</title>
        <p>Three participating student–teacher pairs had dropped out at posttest, of which two were
          from the intervention group and one was from the comparison group. At follow-up, a total
          of 14 participants had dropped out, 8 from the intervention group and 6 from the
          comparison group. The reasons for dropout were that 6 teachers had left the schools, 5
          teachers reported that their targeted students had transferred to other schools, and 3
          teachers had dropped out for unknown reasons. With respect to those participants who
          completed the entire study, the amount of missing data was approximately 6% per
          participant across the pre, post, and follow-up measurement points. Consistent with recent
          literature in addressing missing data and attrition, a multiple imputation procedure was
          used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426610387431">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426610387431">Little &amp; Rubin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1063426610387431">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>). This
          allows for an intention-to-treat analysis, since all participants in the study can be
          included in the analysis. Five imputed data sets were created using the software NORM
          v.2.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1063426610387431">Schafer, 1999</xref>) with

          preserve treatment effects.</p>
        <p>A supplementary analysis of the intervention effects with nonimputed data was also

        <p>At posttest, there were significant interaction effects (Time × Group) for observed
          student externalizing behavior and observed teacher reprimands (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610387431">Table 2</xref>). For these measures, the students and
          teachers in the BM group showed a more favorable development across time than the
          comparison group. The effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>) were in the medium range. At
          follow-up, four out of five primary outcome measures showed significant interaction
          effects in favor of the intervention group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610387431">Table 2</xref>). The effect sizes for the student measures
          were in the medium range, whereas the teacher measures showed large effects. There was a
          main effect of time for the CTRS subscale of externalizing behavior and the BREB teacher
          rating. An inspection of the mean values across time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610387431">Table 1</xref>) suggests that teachers in both groups
          experienced improvements across time on the CTRS scale, whereas the main effect for the
          BREB was due to the improvements in the intervention group alone.</p>

        <p>An analysis of mediation was conducted to explore the hypothesis that change in teacher
          behavior would cause change in student externalizing behavior. First, a composite measure
          of change in student externalizing behavior at follow-up was computed as the mean of the
          standardized values of the three related outcome measures (observed student externalizing
          behavior, BREB, and the CTRS subscale of externalizing behavior). Second, an analysis of
          mediation was performed using several regression analyses, following the recommendations
          by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610387431">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>. There
          was a significant effect of experimental condition on student externalizing behavior
          change, β = .32, <italic>t</italic>(88) = 2.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. There was
          also a significant effect of experimental condition on the mediator variable (teacher

            <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The fact that the direct effect between experimental
          condition on student externalizing behavior (β = .25) was lower than the total effect (β =
          .32) implies that change in teacher reprimands partially mediated the intervention effects
          on student externalizing behavior. The mediation was significant according to the Sobel
          test, <italic>z</italic>(88) = 2.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610387431">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). The lack of a significant

        <title>Moderators of Intervention Effects</title>
        <p>Multiple regression analyses with forced entry were conducted to examine the possible
          moderating effects of student age, gender, immigrant status, special education status,
          class size, and the socioeconomic index of the student’s school. For each regression
          analysis, the pretest score of the outcome variable, a dummy variable that represented the
          intervention group, and the tested moderator variable were entered into the first
          equation. In the second equation, the interaction between intervention condition and the
          moderator variable was added. With a strong moderator effect, the addition of the
          interaction variable increases the accounted variance. Only two instances moderated the
          intervention effect—socioeconomic index for the outcome variable of teacher praise at
          posttest, and special education status on the outcome of time on task at follow-up. Two
          significant moderator variables are less than what would have been expected by chance,
          given 120 analyses (6 moderator variables × 10 outcome variables × 2 measurement points)
          and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, which suggests that the intervention effects were

            be in recommending this intervention to a colleague?”). The questionnaire was
            administered anonymously to prevent the teachers from giving socially desirable answers.
            The average score was 4.4 for the intervention group (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.4) as well

            nominations as their classmates (<italic>Z</italic> = 0.0). In contrast, the number of
            negative nominations was still almost one standard deviation above the class means for
            both groups at follow-up. At pretest, 73% and 63% of the targeted students were rated at
            least one standard deviation above the average student on externalizing behavior (BREB)
            in the intervention and comparison groups, respectively. At follow-up, this proportion
            was only 39% in the intervention group, whereas a slight increase was evident in the
            comparison group (72%). The difference between the groups at follow-up was significant,
              χ<sup>2</sup>(2, 100) = 8.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The hypothesis that the BM intervention group would outperform the comparison group in
        terms of student externalizing behavior and teacher behavior management was partly supported
        at posttest and fully supported at follow-up. At posttest, significant intervention effects
        were found on observer-rated student externalizing behavior as well as teacher reprimands.
        At follow-up, these results were maintained and further significant effects emerged on the
        teacher rating of externalizing behavior (BREB) and the observer rating of teacher praise.
        Due to the significant intervention effect on teacher reprimands at posttest, it was
        possible to demonstrate that change in teacher reprimands mediated the intervention effect
        on student externalizing behavior at follow-up. The intervention effects were demonstrated
        to be socially valid in terms of acceptability ratings and normative comparisons to the
        targeted students’ classmates. None of the explored demographic or classroom variables
        moderated the intervention effects. Of the secondary outcome measures, significant
        intervention effects were found for positive peer nominations at posttest and follow-up and
        for the teacher rating of hyperactivity at follow-up.</p>
      <p>A notable result in this study was the long-term intervention effects. A possible
        explanation for the delayed effects on some of the outcome measures may be that students
        stay with the same teachers for several years in Sweden. The teachers had time to learn and
        master the BM strategies and the students were exposed to them during extended periods.
        Although follow-up data still are to be reported, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone et al. (2009)</xref> suggested in their
        preliminary report that intervention effects seem to fade. More frequent changes in
        classrooms and teachers in North America may be related to the lack of long-term effects.
        The delayed effect on teacher praise was due to a decreased rate of teacher praise across
        time in the comparison group, rather than an increase of praise in the intervention group.
        Studies have shown that teachers in general express less praise toward students with
        externalizing behavior and that the level of praise deteriorates across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610387431">Beaman &amp; Wheldall, 2000</xref>). Thus,
        the intervention seems to have buffered a natural decline in praise, an effect that also was
        reported in Metropolitan Area Child Study Research Group and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610387431">Gorman-Smith (2003)</xref>. Nevertheless, it was
        disappointing that the teachers in the intervention group failed to increase the absolute
        level of praise, especially since contingent praise is a core strategy in the intervention
        program. The reason for this failure is not known, but a possible explanation is that
        teachers in general have been shown to provide most praise contingent upon student academic
        responses, rather than prosocial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610387431">Beaman &amp; Wheldall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1063426610387431">Van Acker et al., 1996</xref>). Because the intervention
        program did not directly target academic skills, the failure to increase the level of
        teacher praise may have been due to lack of setting events (i.e., correct academic responses
        from students).</p>
      <p>The intervention effect on student externalizing behavior was more evident in the
        observational measure than in teacher ratings. Perhaps the BM intervention changed actual
        behavior but did not alter the teachers’ perception of the targeted students. A possible
        explanation is that teacher ratings are less sensitive to the present context, resulting in
        more susceptibility to expectation effects and other forms of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426610387431">De Los Reyes &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>). This explanation is
        supported by the significant intervention effects on the class-wide BREB rating, in contrast
        to the ratings of individual students (CTRS). When completing the BREB rating, the teachers
        consider the targeted students’ present behavior in relation to that of his or her
        classmates. This process may be less susceptible to biases compared to individual ratings,
        in which teachers only can consider a student’s behavior in relation to their recollection
        of that student’s earlier behavior.</p>
      <p>Unlike teacher praise, change in teacher reprimands correlated with student behaviors and
        mediated the intervention effects. This is in accord with previous studies that have
        demonstrated stronger effects of teacher negativity on student externalizing behavior,
        compared to effects of teacher support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610387431">Clunies-Ross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426610387431">Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1063426610387431">Silver et al., 2005</xref>). An explanation to this contrast
        can be found in the numerous studies of reciprocal interactions by Gerald Patterson and
        colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1063426610387431">Patterson, 1982</xref>).
        They have shown that the function of a certain behavior (e.g., positive interactions) has a
        different implication than the absolute frequency or strength of that behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610387431">Granic, O’Hara, Pepler, &amp; Lewis,
          2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610387431">Granic &amp; Patterson,
          2006</xref>). Thus, some behaviors need to be assessed and analyzed in moment-to-moment
        observations rather than through regression analyses of pre–post scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1063426610387431">Van Acker et al. (1996)</xref> applied this
        theoretical framework in a study of the reciprocal relationship between teacher and
        behaviors among high-risk students. They found that teacher reprimands were highly
        contingent upon student externalizing behavior. Teacher praise, on the other hand, was
        delivered noncontingent upon student prosocial and academic behaviors. Even if the observers
        in this study coded contingent praise from teachers, the specific reciprocal functions of
        teacher and student behaviors were not taken into account, as in observations of
        moment-to-moment interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610387431">Granic &amp; Patterson, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>The relative lack of intervention effects on the secondary outcome measures was
        disappointing, but maybe not surprising, considering the brief nature and limited scope of
        the intervention. A possible explanation for the differential effect on positive and
        negative peer nominations is that negative peer appraisals have been shown to be more stable
        across time (i.e., harder to change) compared to positive appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610387431">Johnston et al., 1988</xref>). Furthermore, it has been
        shown that the effect of teacher–student interactions, which were altered in this study, is
        greater on positive than on negative appraisals from peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426610387431">Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Willson, 2001</xref>). Although there
        was a significant intervention effect on teacher-rated hyperactivity, that result has to be
        interpreted with caution considering the difference between the groups at pretest and that
        no observational measure was collected for hyperactivity.</p>
      <p>Of previous school-based intervention studies, the most relevant comparison to this study
        probably is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone et al.
          (2009)</xref>, in which a similar FBA-based BM intervention was evaluated in a randomized
        controlled trial. The effect size on student externalizing behavior was <italic>d</italic> =
        0.44 at posttest, which was similar to the findings in this study. A strength of the
        investigated intervention in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone
          et al. (2009)</xref> was the team-based approach and inclusion of an elaborative fidelity
        check with continuous control of the implementation procedure. Another strength was that the
        consultation partly involved direct observation of the teachers in the classroom settings,
        which generally has been shown to have a greater effect on teacher behavior compared to
        group consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1063426610387431">Noell et al.,
          2005</xref>). However, the intervention model used in the present study required less
        invested time by the teacher consultants. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610387431">Iovannone et al. (2009)</xref>, the time a consultant spent
        on a case was 12 hours plus five meetings that ranged between 30 minutes and 2 hours. As a
        consequence, each consultant used between 15 and 22 hours per teacher, compared to about 6
        hours per teacher in this study. This issue is of great importance, considering the lack of
        well-trained consultants and financial resources available for school-based mental health
        (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1063426610387431">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). On
        the other hand, the intervention model in the present study requires 20 to 30 active
        training hours during a semester for each participating teacher, which may be demanding for
        regular education teachers. When implementing this type of teacher training intervention the
        use of school-wide models with systems-level support may therefore be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1063426610387431">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>A strength of this study was the use of an active comparison group. Although the attention
        provided to the teachers in the two conditions was not entirely comparable, it was
        nevertheless a methodological advantage to use a credible intervention as comparison. This
        is especially important in relation to teacher ratings, which are more susceptible to bias
        compared to more objective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426610387431">De
          Los Reyes &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>). Another strength of the study was the external
        validity, which was due to the fact that the participants were recruited from a large number
        of schools in diverse settings. It could be argued that the validity of the results is
        limited to the Swedish context. In comparison to the United States, for example,
        externalizing problems may be less prevalent in the student population and students in
        Sweden usually stay with the same teachers for longer periods of time. The finding that the
        intervention effects were more pronounced at follow-up also implies that this type of
        intervention primarily is applicable in contexts where teachers stay with the same students
        at least for 2 years. Alternatively, the results point to the possibility that there may be
        general advantages in terms of teacher–student relationships, and development of student
        behaviors in school systems where students change teachers less frequently. Nevertheless,
        the fact that the vast majority of school-based intervention studies have been conducted in
        North America calls for studies from other cultural contexts.</p>
      <p>There were also some limitations of the study, which primarily were related to the
        observational measures. The interrater reliability was only assessed during the initial
        training of the observers. Therefore, it is not certain that the reliability of the
        observations was preserved across measurement points. However, the stable correlations
        between the daily teacher ratings and the observer ratings support the reliability and
        validity of the observations. Although the daily teacher ratings generally supported the
        validity of the observations, there was a troubling lack of support for the observer rating
        of teacher praise. One reason for this may be that the observers estimated the amount of
        praise twice daily, unlike teacher reprimands that were coded through continuous event
        recordings. Estimates of praise were used because the frequency of contingent praise was
        expected to be low. A second reason may be that teacher praise to high-risk students has
        been shown to occur with no conditional relation to student behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1063426610387431">Van Acker et al., 1996</xref>). Another limitation of the
        study was the number of observation periods at each measurement point. Although the absolute
        amount of observed time was sufficient on each occasion (4–5 hours), the reliability would
        have been stronger with shorter observation periods during several days at each measurement
        point. The reason for choosing to conduct the observations during a single day was mainly
        logistic and due to lack of funding for observers. There was also a limitation with regard
        to the teacher ratings of student behaviors. One of the outcome measures (BREB) was a scale
        developed by the research group. A more widely used and established scale would have been
        preferred. The reason for choosing BREB was that no suitable published class-wide scale of
        student externalizing behavior was found when the study was conducted.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, there are two major contributions of this study. First, it is one of the few
        randomized controlled trials of FBA-guided BM. Second, the results support the effectiveness
        of FBA and BM, when implemented in a standardized fashion with limited involvement of
        external consultants. With regard to the lack of similar studies, there is a need for
        further investigations of school-based interventions that can be disseminated with limited
        involved costs and resources. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426610387431">Kazdin (2008)</xref> points out that the debate about
        evidence-based intervention research so far has focused on issues related to efficacy and
        effectiveness. He states that less often discussed is the more salient issue, namely, that
        most students in need of interventions do not receive service at all. Thus, this study is an
        important step in developing intervention models that enable students in need of service to
        gain access to effective FBA and BM.</p>
