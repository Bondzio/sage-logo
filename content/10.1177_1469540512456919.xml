<p>Given the growing transitional character of food, on its way from farm to fork, a rising number of people and institutions affect what we eat, governing how food is produced, consumed and distributed day-to-day. The sociological response to these transformations lead to a conceptualization of food as a dynamic field, crucial to the understanding of how we negotiate production and consumption as specific and meaningful sets of activities. In this article, I suggest applying the recent conceptualization of practice theory in order to understand the increasing complexity of food issues. I start by illustrating some basic sociological works on consumption of food quality, then I present the main outcome of a qualitative research study about the commercial cooking in a Northern Italian city. The issue of food quality and the effects of its social construction on consumers habits are eventually discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469540512456919" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Back in 1995, in a far-seeing paper, Ferguson and Zukin posed a rhetorical question about the absence of a sociological paradigm to analyse food, hitherto a subject considered only by anthropologists, historians or psychologists. They also reminded us how the ‘transitional’ character of such a topic, ‘moving from the raw to the cooked, from the eye to the mouth, from the bare minimum necessary for survival to egregiously conspicuous consumption’ (1995: 196) probably made it even more difficult for the sociological community to address such a subject. Fifteen years later, we can easily understand the growing transitional character of food, as on its way from farm to fork it changes hands many times, often crossing continents. In fact, an increasing number of people and institutions affect what we eat, governing how food is produced, consumed and distributed day-to-day. Yet, while long-standing actors such as the largest food retailers gain more and more power, new actors from civil society such as consumer associations show resistance to such trends, promoting community control over food and farming. The sociological reaction to these social transformations maybe doesn’t accomplish what Ferguson and Zukin wanted, but it has certainly made its way to a conceptualization of food as a dynamic field, crucial to the understanding of how we negotiate production and consumption as specific and meaningful sets of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469540512456919">Warde, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540512456919">Ashley et al., 2004</xref>). However, most researchers involved in this still-under-construction sociological work about food continue to emphasize the economic power of major institutional actors such as transnational corporations or, when they happen to mention culture, it is often just in relation to consumers. This trend has eventually caused the discipline to split into two different scientific arenas – a sociology of food and a rural sociology – separating the ‘knowing food’ issue from the ‘growing food’ one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512456919">Goodman and DuPuis, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This article aims to deal with recent literature about the most fruitful efforts to overcome this dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540512456919">Murcott and Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540512456919">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>), going beyond the explanations that look either at the economic institutional forces or the reflexive consumers. After a brief review of the most recent contributions that have tried this route, the article will present the so-called ‘practice turn in contemporary theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512456919">Schatzki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512456919">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>) and its possible and profitable sociological application to the field of food studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540512456919">Halkier et al., 2011</xref>). Then, in order to critically build the argument, a short discussion of an empirical application to a specific national case will be offered, questioning the value of practice theory when researching the production of (food) quality in the particular case of commercial cooking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540512456919"><title>The practice turn in contemporary food studies</title>
<p>In order to overcome the dichotomy between ‘agro-food theory’ and the ‘sociology of food’, scholars recently started to consider the opportunity to investigate production and consumption of food within the same framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540512456919">Murcott and Campbell, 2004</xref>). A diffuse theoretical and mostly empirical discontent grew, in fact, because the ‘sociology of food’ couldn’t account for most institutional changes in global corporate power in the food industry, while the ‘agro-food theory’ soon understood how both the commodity system and corporate industry couldn’t be analysed outside the networks of meaning and micro-moralities within which they are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540512456919">Phillips, 2006</xref>). Since then, there have been a significant number of theoretical endeavours to fill this gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540512456919">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>). Although the literature is quite composite, it may be useful to sketch here three different solutions proposed in the past decades.</p>
<p>A first very much discussed attempt to reconnect production and consumption in the field of food is generally imputed to Fine and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540512456919">Fine et al. 1996</xref>) who presented the theory of System of Provisions, according to which vertical structuring in food production and horizontal relationships in food consumption should be factored in as they are necessarily built up reciprocally. Despite one of the standpoints of this conceptualization indeed being the connection between meanings attributed to foodstuff and its organic peculiarity, most critics concentrate on the lack of consideration for the materiality of food, and propose a second way out to the production–consumption debate. In fact, drawing on Actor–Network theory and other contributions to sociology of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540512456919">Latour, 2005</xref>), Goodman and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512456919">Goodman and Watts, 1997</xref>) argue for an integrated approach to overcoming the dichotomy between nature and culture, where materiality and human agency work symmetrically for the construction of socially differentiated food-networks of producers and consumers. In this theory, a multiplicity of actors are mobilized, with multiple interrelated rationalities. Finally, a third framework of analysis, Convention theory has been applied to the food sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540512456919">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>). Closely allied to Actor–Network theory and relying on political and moral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540512456919">Boltanski, Thevenot, 1991</xref>) it shares with this perspective the assumption of a mutual agreement among participants (producers and consumers) in creating networks of coordination as opposed to the simple imposition of a dominant party. This ‘coordination’ is intended to give rise to ‘conventions’ supported by formal and informal institutional forms, which bind acts together and fix mutual expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512456919">Salais and Storper, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>All in all, those three attempts to investigate the food sector illustrate respectively an economic-driven perspective (System of Provision), a science-driven one (Actor–Network theory) and a politics-driven one (Convention theory). In spite of their quite obvious differences, I’d like to focus now on what they actually have in common. A couple of issues, in fact, reappear constantly in this debate as the main arguments at stake:
<list id="list1-1469540512456919" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The encounter between ‘human’ and ‘non-human’ and the relational positionality between the two, which entails the so-called process of embodiment as much as the different social valorizations attributed to the two.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The governance of different mobilizations of resources, notwithstanding whether this governance comes back to either systems, networks or conventions. This leads to mapping the power relations that address how foodstuff and humans mobilized thorough the agro-food network end up in a consumer’s body and mind.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In this light, the quite recent examination of a practice turn in contemporary theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512456919">Schatzki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512456919">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>) seems to perfectly answer the question of how to explicitly keep the previous two issues together in the same framework. Variously nuanced, the notion of practice portrays action as an ongoing embodied and situated social process, which is inevitably confronted with the temporality and spatiality of social experience, networks and structures. Moreover, a model of practice appears to be particularly useful for studying economic processes and especially economic agency not just without relying on the primacy of individual rational choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540512456919">Sassatelli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512456919">Warde, 2005</xref>) but mostly because it manages to highlight the political effects of identity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512456919">Trentmann, 2007</xref>). As Reckwitz put it, since ‘a practice is […] a routinized way in which bodies are moved, objects are handled, subjects are treated, things are described and the world is understood’ (2002: 250), the relational link between ‘human’ and ‘non-human’ stands for a crucial concern in a theory such as this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540512456919">Pickering, 2001</xref>). At the same time, whereas social agents are considered to be carriers of practices – the individual being merely the intersection point of many practices him-/herself – they are rather a ‘consequence of the nature of the social organization of practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512456919">Warde, 2005</xref>). The question of how agents are positioned within a practice and, in addition, how the latter is positioned itself across a broad range of practices become a second crucial issue of the theory. In the present case, then, these two issues will bring us to consider the cooking practice both inside the kitchen, where the manipulation of foodstuff is crucial, and outside the kitchen, where the representation of foodstuff is equally essential.</p>
<p>Finally, I suggest that food social practices could be a crucial device in order to sociologically investigate the food sector considering both the ‘human and non-human relationality’ and the ‘governance of different mobilization of resources’ as two sides of the same empirical phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540512456919"><title>Food quality as a field of social practices</title>
<p>As illustrated above, the recent sociological literature on food issues has tended to solve the complex ‘transitional’ character of food recalled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512456919">Ferguson and Zukin (1995)</xref> by joining production and consumption matters in the same theoretical framework. The general idea is that relationships from both these two sides of the food sector are inextricably intertwined in the process of food ‘valorization’ and they simply can’t be investigated separately. Now what is significant is that this valorization is increasingly taking the shape of a process of ‘qualification’, where quality become a category to evaluate competing systems for the delivery of food as well as new procedures for guaranteeing food standards and different criteria for selecting and judging foodstuff used by consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540512456919">Harvey et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, quality should be treated as something made, not given, whereby there is a set of competing forces, emerging from the products themselves and from the social characteristics of the persons pronouncing judgments, from which a particular value called quality can be constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540512456919">Harvey et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Such a process of ‘qualification’, then, can be investigated according to two different analytical dimensions. First, it should imply a field of mutual positioning of human subjects and non-human objects and materials involved in the process. Second, according to a dynamic perspective of the same field of positions, it should imply the competing forces that are at stake in order to rule the process. Hence, food quality as a (battle)field of social practices consists in <italic>a given coordination of human and non-human resources in a particular place and time that is open to a change according to the mobilization of such resources due to the power relations that emerge from this coordination</italic>.</p>
<p>Food quality is then considered a by-product of particular social practices as long as it coincides with a particular positionality within a social field of institutionalized standards that the practices of food production and consumption themselves contribute to fixing, each according to different power relations. In this light, the social definition of food quality emerges empirically from a process of transformation of a bunch of material <italic>qualities</italic> of food (biological, organic, etc.) into a unique symbolic value named <italic>quality</italic>. Of course, the same process could happen retroactively, when a legitimate definition of <italic>quality</italic> assigns centrality back to a bunch of material <italic>qualities.</italic> For example, the specific case of ‘pizza napoletana verace’, which quite recently became part of a food quality scheme (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) translates the exact dimensions of the disc-shaped dough into an essential feature of quality, in the same way as the quality scheme of the ‘mozzarella di bufala’ (Protected Designation of Origin) converts the specific attribute of the fresh milk into a universal sign of quality itself.</p>
<p>Such a theorization of food quality marks a difference from most classical sociological approaches to food, interested either in final consumers (Lupton, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540512456919">Gronow, 2004</xref>) or dedicated to agro-business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512456919">Arce and Mardsen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540512456919">Winter, 2003</xref>). In fact, it focus rather on the ways in which different subjects or objects (as suggested by Actor–Network theory) in different fields of practices compete for the authority (as highlighted by Convention theory) of defining their actual character. The outcome of this process of institutionalization of a differentiated field of practices of production and consumption of food is, then, to empower and disempower particular sets of resources, considered a mixture of human and non-human assets.</p>
<p>Now, in order to show how to accomplish such an analysis, I present a case study on commercial cooking in Italy, as a particular food social practice, taken from an empirical research project into Italian commercial cuisine and the relative institutionalization of a ‘territorial’ version of food quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469540512456919">1</xref></sup> The purpose of carrying out this research was to particularly examine the effects of the mobilization of sets of resources from production to consumption and vice versa starting from the social practice of commercial cooking, in order to interpret how every chef positions themselves in the field, not only among the others professionals, but especially with regard to non-human assets.</p>
<p>According to many practice theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512456919">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>), cooking is just one of the so called ‘integrative’ practices, ‘the more complex practices found in and constitutive of particular domains of social life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540512456919">Schatzki, 1996</xref>: 98). These are distinguished from ‘dispersed’ practices, including ‘describing, explaining, questioning, reporting, examining and imagining’ (1996: 91), that can take place within and across different domains or subfields. In other words, cooking as a professional practice can only take place inside a professional kitchen of any kind of commercial activity. Therefore, it is first necessary to illustrate <italic>the structure</italic> of this ‘particular domain’ inside which commercial cooking takes place. This illustration coincides indeed with the display of the mutual positioning of human and non-human resources highlighted above. Then, it becomes possible to investigate <italic>the dynamic</italic> of the same ‘particular domain‘, looking for the power relations featuring the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469540512456919"><title>A case-study of a ‘territorial’ version of food quality in a northern Italian city</title>
<p>In order to first give the heuristic dimension to the field of power where the culinary practice analysed is situated, I must start from the historical trajectory of the field itself. I chose to study the gastronomic field of a particular northern urban centre in Italy because it illustrates the empirical pattern of the broader national field as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540512456919">Benporat, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512456919">Capatti and Montanari, 2005</xref>). The socio-historical analysis of the progressive institutionalization of the Italian gastronomic field presents, in fact, a couple of interesting features, especially when compared to the French and the American contexts.</p>
<p>In the case of French gastronomic field, many researchers have already shown how commercial cooking led to a shared definition of food quality – later known as <italic>nouvelle cuisine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540512456919">Rao et al. 2003</xref>) – on the basis of a national-oriented market and the hegemony of the pre-revolutionary cuisine resulting from the central political influence of the Parisian court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540512456919">Boudan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456919">Ferguson, 2004</xref>). By contrast, the lack of a comparable national political situation coupled with the commercial primacy given to the trade between different county towns contributed to the Italian gastronomic field being structured in a very different way, on a regional if not urban basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512456919">Capatti and Montanari, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, the actual structure of the food supply-side is still mostly based on small businesses with a low rate of capital-intensive production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540512456919">ISMEA Report, 2009</xref>), where innovation still relies on highly human-embodied competences.</p>
<p>Such structural features of the field and the relative orientation they entail towards investments in local raw materials can be discovered as well in the character of the professionals who inhabit such a field. Therefore, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512456919">Fine’s ethnography of restaurant work (1996)</xref> in a US ‘second-tier metropolitan area’, the research focused on a similar urban context in northern Italy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1469540512456919">2</xref></sup> in order to capture a sample of cooks that ‘are sociologically interesting [just] because they are not elite artists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512456919">Fine, 1996</xref>: 16). In this case, they are supposed to build up quality standards within their job practice and basically without any given formal tradition from schools or disseminated by authoritative media criticism. Although, unlike the case of the American gastronomic field accurately examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512456919">Ferguson and Zukin (1998)</xref>, where financial and symbolic investments in schools and gastronomic criticism indeed played a significant role in the definition of an ‘American’ commercial cooking practice, in the Italian case neither of these institutional resources have actually been implemented. Until recently, in fact, the majority of schools where cooks are trained as semi-qualified workers and the national media that only invested in gastronomic criticism as a marginal part of their editorial mission left a blank space for the construction of quality standards in commercial cooking that could only be filled by the domestic memories and the embodied experience of each individual cook. Accordingly, despite the growth of expenditure on eating out, the demand-side still presents one of the highest rates of food consumption at home in the EU area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540512456919">ISMEA Report, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From this point of view, the situation of the subjects that I interviewed seemed not very different from their American colleagues, analysed by Gary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512456919">Fine (1996)</xref> or by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512456919">Ferguson and Zukin (1998)</xref> in the case of New York. However, there is an important difference in the case I’m discussing: while in the American context the employment of institutionalized economic and cultural resources (for example, the opening of schools of cooking, following the French pattern) has made possible – first of all politically – the development of an ‘American’ culinary practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512456919">Ferguson and Zukin, 1998</xref>), in the Italian case completely different means – in terms of resources and constraints – have eventually led to a similar process. From a close examination of my interviews, it is quite clear that it is a specific combination of embodied cultural capital – in terms of family origins – and social capital – in terms of reciprocal trust with their employees –support and stabilize the practices of quality in the gastronomic field.</p>
<p>As I am interested in the analysis of the production of food quality through the lens of culinary practice, I shall focus on the reconstruction of the particular starting point usually described by chefs as crucial in the history of their careers. The first of the following extracts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1469540512456919">3</xref></sup> is taken from the story of a cook whose family, for more than 20 years, has kept working in a small valley in the urban hinterland:<disp-quote>
<p>The very beginning was twenty years ago … […] the choice was perhaps … not really balanced … the idea was to do something innovative at that time, but always linked to that … <italic>that was a bit of our history</italic> … […] to be sure, it has remained [a lot] of that period and of that experience, in us, in some particular way, because our parents definitely have continued to help us for some years since then … So about that experience <italic>what remains for sure is a very strong bond with the local agriculture and with our farmers, right the farmers of our valley</italic> … (Family Cook 2, Outback)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In cases like this, although the reference to the cook’s family as a central starting point is presented here as a natural part of the local environment, nevertheless the particular connection between agricultural production and the gastronomic supply is clearly highlighted, a specific connection that could be provided only by his own restaurant, properly designed to be the material version of such a symbolic connection.</p>
<p>In other cases, however, it is just the cook’s family and his relative dining experience that can be regarded as the main reference where the origin and motivation of his career is located:<disp-quote>
<p>well … to my family, the practice of cooking has always been important … in the sense that eating at home was the moment when you were all together … and then, both lunch and dinner … all together … we were a family of seven persons with grandparents, and so it was an important time that one when we sit at the table … my aunt was always home and cooked, my mum had the shop, so … I spent so much time with my aunt … and it’s been just then that it started this passion seeing her cooking every day, and very actual regional cuisine, most of the time … (Restaurateur Cook 3, City Centre)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, it is not only the geographical position between hinterland and city centre, but also the kind of biographical path accumulated and tied in a particular site, situation or a group of people, that makes a difference in the various stories of those chefs. From the first point of view, for those who have a personal trajectory strongly linked to a specific location, the culinary practice is mostly described by linking the criteria of quality to the characteristics of their own territory, which is represented, at the same time, as both the instrument and the ultimate goal of the cooking practice:<disp-quote>
<p>the soul of our cuisine is … well … when I was a kid, I used to go … I mean, I didn’t work in a restaurant … but I used to go hunting for mushrooms, just like I actually did this morning … I used to go in the wood and all of a sudden a particular smell came out from a chestnut grove immediately after the rain … or the tiny inkling of … undergrowth, or even the mushroom reek that usually came out … well … such a sensation, such particular light breeze last since I was a boy … or maybe the smell I felt when I squeezed a grape of ‘vermentino’ wine, from our soil … that I could feel the fragrance … I mean … I still do it, 40 years later … and I try to let feeling the same smell and fragrances in my restaurant … in my dishes … that’s what I call <italic>the soul</italic> … <italic>of my territory</italic> … definitely … without that, nothing would make sense to me […]. (Commercial Cook 1, Male, Outback)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As one can see, at this point in the story a particular emphasis on scents, smells and the ability to ‘directly’ manipulate the fruits of the land emerges: in this case, this kind of cook is <italic>in the position of being able to spend these resource</italic>s, emphasizing olfactory and tactile component of the food.</p>
<p>Here, the ethnographic fieldwork may help to illustrate this very crucial perspective on the manipulation of foodstuff. As Fine noted, certainly every kitchen has its ‘share of distinct smells, touches, sounds and tastes’ (1996: 239); nevertheless, during my fieldwork, I could well understand how there was something more about smell and touch for the cooks I followed in their work. Two different cooks, working in two different kind of kitchens, share, in fact, a specific value assigned, respectively, to the tactile and olfactory aspect of the cooking practice.</p>

<p>[Three hours before the dinner, L and M are preparing the line, cutting vegetables and making sauces and flavourings. I’m looking around the kitchen, standing between them while L is explaining the kind of customers they usually serve.] While L is talking to me, I start looking at his hands involved in what seems to be a very complex job: he is manipulating some stuffing he has just prepared in order to make some fish balls. I follow the process while he goes on telling me some story about a noisy customer; he starts picking a very small piece of stuffing from a bowl, putting it in his left hand and rolling it until he come out with a perfect micro-sphere. After he completed about thirty fish balls in less than three minutes, I interrupt him asking: ‘How can you be sure they’re not going to split up when you’re frying them?’ He seems to think about my (weird?) question, then tells me: ‘They never did, it’s all about the way you roll them. I guess I roll them just like my mother used to do, so they never split up or anything’. Then he starts rolling again and tells me: ‘In fact, I mean … it’s always about raw materials, of course, but this is the only place you can find this kind of rolling, my friend …’.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540512456919"><title>Excerpt 2 - (Restaurateur Cook 3, Male, City Centre)</title>
<p>A, Head Cook<disp-quote>
<p>[Early in the morning, I’m with A who let me follow him during his shopping session at a farmers’ market in the city centre.] When we approach a stand with a lot of colourful vegetables I’m about to stop, thinking he is going to have a look at such a wonderful collection of veggies; but he keeps walking until he reaches a very small stand, apparently not at all tempting. He smiles gently at the owner who immediately suggests three different kinds of green salads to him: accordingly he starts smelling one after another for almost three minutes, eventually picking one. Once we leave, I can’t help but ask him ‘I thought you would have picked the good-looking vegetables, they would have looked amazing once in the dish, wouldn’t they?’ He looks at me, quite disappointed, and answers: ‘Well, I only trust my sense of smell. That’s it. I wonder if a beet will smell like it should, when I pick it … I’m not a photographer, I’m a cook: my taste and my smell are my whole cooking, eventually’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, they explicitly position themselves on the opposite side to the standardized media discourse focused on the visual component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1469540512456919">4</xref></sup> At the same time, once they move away from the logic of large-scale production with a good distance between raw materials and manufacturing processes, those cooks bring into play their ability to present themselves as manipulators of ‘original’ scents and smells, a specific skill where food cultivation and food preparation become closer and closer to each other.</p>
<p>This originality can come from the environment in which the cook develops but, in different ways, it can also be derived from the routines of the cook’s domestic cuisine, as described by this restaurateur-cook from the city centre:<disp-quote>
<p>[the decision about how to prepare a dish] also depends on the mood … a year ago, for example, I prepared a fine dessert that I still have on the menu now … it was a sweet rose syrup that helped me to remember my parents’ one … in fact, they ran a very old grocery store, here in Genoa, a long time ago … and I grew up amid drugs and spices and all of these things, right? … also a lot of people used to come to buy from my dad and my grandfather … and my dad personally did the rose syrup … […] then I thought about making a dessert starting from that syrup […]. (Restaurateur Cook 3, City)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Again, these same scents, smells and tactile memories become the reference and measurement of the flavour to be found in the practice of cooking. The same smells and tactile memories will be those that the cooks intend as the ultimate ‘ingredient’ to bring within their own cookery and the one in which they will eventually look for confirmation in the judgement of their customers:<disp-quote>
<p>so that for whoever happens to taste it [a particular dessert made with a local fruit], quite often, his judgement goes like this: ‘it reminds me of when I was a baby … because […] these are sensations that take me back and so on … and I like this … I mean … it sounds nice when a customer tells you he remembers his past thanks to your dishes … mostly because it’s the exactly same sensation I feel when I cook … often the same memories … (Commercial cook, Male, City Centre)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The ethnographic fieldwork may help again to illustrate the specific relationship built between humans actors and artefacts inside such a particular outline of cooking practice. Of course, cooks always ‘prepare the meals through a substantial use of physical tools the positioning and accessibility of which in the surrounding have an important influence on the structure and ongoing organization of the activity itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540512456919">Galatolo and Traverso, 2007</xref>). The following excerpt will show the particular perspective those kind of cooks maintain about technological equipment and the consequences of its participation in the social definition of quality.</p>

<p>R, Assistant Cook; G, Head Cook<disp-quote>
<p>[I’m in the kitchen with R and A, 20 minutes after the dinner has been served. We are drinking some very good red wine, relaxing and talking freely. I’m handling a siphon, playing with it.] R starts looking at me and the siphon, then he turns to G saying: ‘I hate that crap, every time I’ve got to deal with it … it’s just annoying …’.  I smile and wait for G to answer. He looks first at R, then he looks at me, finally saying: ‘I don’t like either that crap, man … it’s definitely not my idea of cooking to <italic>dope</italic> food with air or whatever. I mean, I feel like cheating, you know … but it’s just like with fire or water … you need them to transform raw materials … you only need to be able to <italic>control</italic> all these elements, if you want not to be controlled by them, if you know what I mean …‘.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such an accent on both the symbolic and material investment of a class of subjects (here, commercial cooks in a present urban area) on a set of objects, materials and technologies (local raw materials, kitchen utensils and procedure seized on domestic competencies) and a relative shared concept of what cooking ‘actually’ means (linked to the memories of a person or to a territory) eventually stand for a mutual positioning within a practice of human and non-human resources, in the sense illustrated above.</p>
<p>All in all, this explains how the institutional context contributes to situate a cultural practice such as cooking, precisely in the sense described by the concept of the field power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512456919">Bourdieu, 1992</xref>). The specific structuring of the category of food quality in the urban context discussed here allows us to find a sort of reverse path to the one described, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456919">Ferguson (2004)</xref> in his analysis of the field of French gastronomy. The culinary practice studied comes from a complete reversal of the social hierarchies of legitimacy operating in the French case. Instead of having schools and guides that are able to transform some ‘cooks’ into ‘chefs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456919">Ferguson, 2004</xref>), it quite the opposite seems to happen in the Italian case. Here, we are witnessing a rather positive encoding of the first term at the expense of the second, so that the very definition of quality is socially constructed symbolically (in the stories of subjects) and structurally (through institutional agencies), around the same figure of the ‘cook’, considered to be a subject alternative to the logic of industrial cookery as much as to those of the French high-cuisine tradition.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the social definition of food quality has been fabricated – together with other social forces inside the gastronomic field – mixing the particular professional features of commercial cooks with the relative meaning assigned to some foods over others, the social representations of restaurants, the particular technologies to be used in food transformation and, last but not least, a particular set of consumer identities. All of these assets, finally, emerge and, at the same time, come to be analytically decipherable within the same food social practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540512456919">Miller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512456919">Warde, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec8-1469540512456919"><title>Made in Italy or taste in Italy? A discussion</title>
<p>In the previous discussion based on data from empirical research in a northern Italian urban area, I tried to show how food quality can be investigated starting from the same particular social practice of commercial cooking. In that case, a particular ‘territorial’ version of food quality emerged not only as a result of a specific agronomic reference or as a symbolic power exerted by a specific class of subjects, but rather more as a much more complex mobilization of ecological, institutional and biographical resources. We’ve just seen above, how specific smells coming from the <italic>terroir</italic> are presented as a sort of treasure transmitted from past family life and how they eventually become an institutional standard for the definition of food quality, for example when embodied in food quality certification schemes or when embodied in the evaluations of food guidebooks.</p>
<p>Such quality, thus, becomes the object itself of commercial trade as illustrated in the case of the work of cooks in restaurants. They appear specifically involved in gathering together the different parts of the food production process as a guarantee of quality itself for consumers. The following ethnographic excerpt about the preparation of a very traditional recipe called ‘cappon magro’ seems to be a good illustration of such an arrangement in commercial cooking practice.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1469540512456919"><title>Excerpt 4 - (Restaurateur Cook 3, Male, City Centre)</title>
<p>A, Head Cook<disp-quote>
<p>[It’s 6.10 in the morning, I’m with A at the underground open-air fish market near the sea port. He’s waiting for a private fisherman who apparently works as a sort of personal supplier to him arriving with a particular kind of sea bass and some crayfish.] While waiting, A tells me about the trick to choosing the best fish, but when his friend arrives A seems to just trust his supplier, never looking inside the bag. [It’s 8.40 in the morning, I’m with A at a very small kitchen garden near his wife’s mother house, where he’s looking for a bunch of vegetables.] While his mother-in-law is picking the vegetables, he keeps telling me about the features of vegetables freshness, but once again he doesn’t even look at the bag. [It’s 11.25, I’m inside the kitchen, A is going back and forth between the cookers and the knife apparently with a sort of rhythm.] A starts putting together different ingredients in a plate, combining the ‘cappon magro’. He is using, almost at the same time, his hands, a couple of different knives, a small pot with vegetables and every once in a while he checks the oven for another recipe he is preparing. Before I can ask him anything about this sophisticated coordination of movements and timing, he looks at me, saying: ‘You see … the only secret to the recipe of the ‘cappon magro’ is about the care of it … of course, only professionals can really care about it … giving it the attention, the time and the precision it deserves … I mean only professionals can care for every single ingredient <italic>from the cradle to the grave</italic>, if you know what I mean.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, it becomes empirically visible how a specific mobilization of human resources (choosing and trusting specific suppliers) and non-human assets (choosing and practicing the cooking instruments) from all the parts of the production activity is addressed towards <italic>a process of empowerment of their position over other subjects in the food system</italic>, namely large-scale industry, on the one hand, and amateur cooks, on the other.</p>
<p>The practices and the accounts of commercial cooks show how these subjects tend to highlight the olfactory and tactile dimensions of their practice over the visual ones on which the dominant discourse of the media is usually focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512456919">Bell and Valentine, 1997</xref>). At the same time, they try to take advantage by staying away from the capital-intensive production where raw materials and finished products are more and more outdistanced. Rather, they insist on their exclusively individual skill to provide a cuisine where cultivation and cooking are factored into the same practice.</p>
<p>According to what we can see from the above analysis, the most significant social product of culinary quality-oriented practice is to convey to the figure of the commercial cook – and to his/her kitchen, his/her resources, his/her employees, etc. – the greatest number of these different processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1469540512456919">5</xref></sup> Along with this, it leads to repositioning the objects, places, technologies and subjects that are associated with them. If in the industrial culinary practice, for example, these moments should be more and more separated, located in different places and linked to different technologies, some commercial cooks present themselves as capable of governing – symbolically and structurally – a number of these processes. In this way, they have secured themselves – with the complicity of various institutional actors that support the integration of this practice – a sort of monopoly over the legitimate processes of ‘qualifying’ foodstuff.</p>
<p>In other words, the capability to accumulate multiple processes becomes more and more equivalent to the very social definition of quality itself – in fact associated increasingly with the expression from ‘farm to fork’.</p>
<p>Consequently, while the contested notion of food quality is publicly encoded with a strong <italic>attribution</italic> to territorial origin and then considered as a given set of resources that are exclusive possessions of a particular environment with specific agronomic features, the latter is rather often absent, as in the case examined above. The local version of the food quality is in fact much more understandable as the by-product of the <italic>acquired</italic> system of personal relations of trust built around the figure of the cook, derived, in turn, from a certain endowment of embodied cultural capital sustained, again, by an emerging institutional framework.</p>
<p>When we observed or listened to the cooks, from the point of view of their restaurants, emphasizing the importance of recalibrating the whole production chain on the culinary moment, as well as the relevance of a thorough knowledge of how to handle or smell certain foods, clearly there was at the stake the possibility of building a space for new consumers geometrically calibrated on their capabilities and skills.</p>
<p>The sociological analysis of food quality starting from commercial cooking as a food social practice allows us to focus on the ongoing process of opening and closing of this particular domain to new resources, so that the field of genres and styles it produces – the field of quality – is intended as a field of social inclusion and exclusion: first, of course, for consumers. Hence, to stay with my empirical example, many of the distinctions embodied in the subject of the ‘cook’ can also be found in the provision policies and the marketing strategies, until they start to be embedded in job contracts and in food laws or food quality schemes, and become institutional standards to evaluate cultural investments in public and private schools and economic investments in particular gastronomic genres. Finally, the sociological analysis of the practice of commercial cooking bring us to the social reconstruction of a broader <italic>governance of food quality</italic>, addressed alongside the frame of territoriality and, finally, available, once again, as <italic>an institutional device for consumers to get used to the gastronomic social space</italic>.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1469540512456919"><title>Conclusion: De-humanizing (consumer) theory</title>
<p>The routes by which food reaches many of us imply, as suggested, a meticulously organized network of human and non-human resources. On its journey from farm to fork, food changes many hands, it often crosses many countries and it is increasingly subjected to screening to keep it safe during all its journeys. These new processes are re-shaping the power relations within the food system. This way to look at the food sector seems then to concern two sides of the same coin: the human/non-human networks of social agents involved and the shifting balance in the governance of the food system. Both of these can be factored in the same theoretical framework of <italic>food social practices</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the theory of social practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512456919">Schatzki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512456919">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>) helps food studies to move beyond such classical perspectives focused on food as a cultural consumption object oriented for more or less reflexive consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540512456919">Douglas and Isherwood, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540512456919">Appadurai, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540512456919">Cook and Crang, 1996</xref>) as well as such theories that consider food as the product of a more or less capital-intensive system of provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540512456919">Fine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540512456919">Salais and Storper, 1997</xref>). Rather, the sociological investigation of <italic>food social practices</italic> allows us, first of all, to apply different possible theoretical aspects, from the sociology of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540512456919">Latour, 2005</xref>) to political sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540512456919">Mardsen, 2000</xref>), to consumption studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512456919">Warde, 2005</xref>). Second, this framework would help to de-humanize theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540512456919">Pickering, 2001</xref>), so to speak, and particularly (food) consumer theory, moving the focus from the individual to the social practices responsible for the production of (food) quality. That’s only possible as long as the social agent – producer or consumer – is never treated as the only subject of the practices he/she accomplishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540512456919">Bourdieu, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512456919">Schatzi et al., 2001</xref>); the consumer is rather only one of the multiple human and non-human components of these practices.</p>

Ultimately, the research comprised a set of ethnographies in six restaurants, an historical reconstruction of the national gastronomic field, a discourse analysis of media coverage on food issues and, finally, 42 in-depth interviews with key actors from both the urban and the national scale.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1469540512456919"><label>2</label><p>I quote here some passages from a larger body of interviews with a selection of ‘commercial cooks’ – so called because they carry out their activities in the kitchens of restaurants in Genoa city centre, a medium urban centre in the north-west of the state, with about 600,000 inhabitants. Their selection was justified by taking into account the spatial variable (near/far from the city centre), the commercial variable (‘osteria’/tavern/restaurant) and, finally, the organizational variable, distinguishing between ‘restaurateur cooks’ (property owners or individual managers), ‘employee cooks’ (bound by an employment contract with the property) and ‘family cooks’ (owners or operators along with family members). The interviews aimed to trace the biographical and the professional trajectory of the cooks in order to reconstruct the narrative presentation of culinary practice. The fieldwork was conducted between September 2005 and January 2007, producing a total of 42 interviews, accompanied by some ethnographical sessions, aimed at urban cooks and ‘experts’ in the food sector (journalists, writers, critics, celebrity chefs) at national and regional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512456919">Domaneschi, 2007</xref>).</p></fn>
