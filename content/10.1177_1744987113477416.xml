<p>The psychological impact of a cardiac event includes anxiety and depression, poor sexual quality, and diminished sexual satisfaction. Few measures capture psychosexual recovery following a cardiac event. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the Sexual Self-Perception and Adjustment Questionnaire (SSPAQ) among cardiac patients (<italic>N</italic> = 128), measuring sexual anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. Scale-level content validity was 0.97. After item analysis, 28 items were retained; Cronbach’s alpha is &gt;0.90, indicating item appropriateness for the combined scale (0.97). A four-factor model was supported with each of the subscale items accounting for at least 64% of the variance. Construct validity comparing sexually active to inactive showed those inactive had significantly lower sexual self-perception. The SSPAQ is a cohesive measure of sexual self-perception, and findings suggest each subscale can be used independently for measures of sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction, and may be useful in research and clinical settings.</p>

<p>Psychological concerns after a cardiac event contribute to diminished quality of life (QOL) and often negative physical functioning. As part of physical functioning, sexual function is important in intimate relationships, frequently contributing to perceptions of satisfaction and QOL. While overall anxiety and depression have been measured in relation to sexual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113477416">Kazemi-Saleh et al., 2007</xref>) and sexual satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113477416">Nicolosi et al., 2004</xref>), these variables do not adequately capture the contribution of anxiety and depression to the sexual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987113477416">Steinke and Swan, 2004</xref>). Fear of resuming sexual activity after a cardiac event is frequently reported by patients, often leading to delay in return to sexual activity, that can span weeks to months or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113477416">Kazemi-Saleh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987113477416">Steinke and Swan, 2004</xref>). Some patients mistakenly believe that sexual activity is no longer possible after a diagnosis such as myocardial infarction. While sexual activity may not be possible for some with unstable/advanced cardiac disease or heart failure, the majority of cardiac patients successfully return to sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987113477416">Kostis et al., 2005</xref>). Including discussion of sexual functioning as part of patient education and discharge planning is recommended.</p>
<p>Assessment of sexual concerns by nurses and other health care providers is important to patients and their partners, but often overlooked in practice (Barnason et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113477416">Byrne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987113477416">Ivarsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2011</xref>). Such assessments can serve as a bridge to discussing sexual concerns, and to assessing any anxiety, fear, or depression. Using objective measures for assessment can assist providers in tailoring information to the patient’s individual concerns and in making referrals for sexual therapy when needed. Measures that specifically identify psychosexual concerns are necessary for more accurate assessments and to guide sexual counselling in practice. Therefore, this study evaluated the psychometric properties of a questionnaire that specifically measured sexual self-perception and adjustment in cardiac patients, including these psychological variables. Sexual self-perception is viewed from a psychological perspective and reflects the individual’s view of themselves as a sexual being. Closely intertwined with sexual self-perception are the sub-concepts of sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction, and these are important measures in the instrument tested in this study.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1744987113477416"><title>Literature review</title>
<sec id="sec3-1744987113477416"><title>Psychosexual concerns</title>
<p>Sexual activity and sexual satisfaction have been the focus of most measures. Studies have validated the importance of sexual activity, and experiencing a cardiac event does not preclude having a satisfying sexual relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113477416">Eyada and Atwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113477416">Kutmec and Yurtsever, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987113477416">Levine et al., 2012</xref>). Delay in returning to sexual activity has been noted, however. Reasons for not returning to sexual activity include depression, patient or partner anxiety, fear of another cardiac event, or marked changes in sexual desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113477416">Eyada and Atwa, 2007</xref>). Greater depression has been linked with being less sexually satisfied in those with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987113477416">Mosack et al., 2011</xref>), and the presence of sexual dysfunction influenced the frequency of sexual activity, which also affected sexual satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113477416">Nicolosi et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, women with coronary artery disease who reported sexual satisfaction had better physical health and less depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987113477416">McCall et al., 2008</xref>). As with depression, those myocardial infarction (MI) patients with higher anxiety tended to be less sexually satisfied, with 42% of the variance in anxiety explained by sexual satisfaction in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987113477416">Steinke and Wright, 2006</xref>). Similar to men, hypertensive women’s sexual function ratings were lower than healthy women, with greater sexual dysfunction in women who were older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113477416">Kutmec and Yurtsever, 2010</xref>). One challenge is finding accurate measures for sexual satisfaction, as those sexually active and not active may both describe being sexually satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987113477416">Steinke and Swan, 2004</xref>). Even those cardiac patients who are not sexually active describe intimacy and connectedness with their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987113477416">Marcuccilli et al., 2011</xref>), and their ratings of sexual satisfaction might therefore be similar to those sexually active reporting sexual satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987113477416"><title>Psychosexual measures</title>
<p>Measures are needed that specifically and accurately capture psychological and physical variables that contribute to positive sexual adaptation. The design of successful sexual counselling interventions is dependent on accurate assessment of psychosexual variables to better understand the nature of sexual concerns and to build interventions that support the individual in return to sexual activity after an acute illness, such as a cardiac event. While sexual satisfaction has been studied to a greater extent, other aspects of sexual self-perception such as sexual anxiety, sexual depression, and sexual self-efficacy have only been recently studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113477416">2012</xref>). These studies provide some beginning understanding of psychosexual effects on sexual activity.</p>
<p>Measures of sexual self-perception such as sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction have been described in the psychological literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113477416">Snell, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113477416">2001</xref>), but use of these specific measures in medical populations has been limited. In patients with heart failure and healthy elders, sexual self-concept, sexual anxiety, and sexual self-efficacy predicted sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, having greater sexual self-efficacy and less sexual anxiety, being younger and married were significant predictors of sexual activity, but sexual depression was not significantly related to sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>). We believe, however, that measuring sexual depression may be useful in establishing depression related to sexual activity versus that caused by other factors.</p>
<p>A pilot study using a sexual counselling intervention found that MI patients’ (<italic>N</italic> = 10) sexual anxiety scores were stable from baseline to 8-weeks post-MI, and sexual depression scores improved slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2012</xref>). Sexual self-efficacy scores were reflective of moderate self-efficacy and similar from baseline to 8 weeks. Conversely, sexual satisfaction scores were low at 8 weeks, illustrating that the sexual relationship continued to be impacted over time. Of interest, partners (<italic>N</italic> = 3) of MI patients had higher sexual anxiety and sexual depression, but better self-efficacy. Sexual satisfaction was low, similar to MI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2012</xref>). The study sample was small; therefore, results need to be further validated.</p>
<p>The literature provides some evidence that specifically measuring psychosexual variables may be useful. It was determined that some changes in the original subscales by Snell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113477416">2001</xref>) were needed prior to further testing. Prior research revealed that cardiac patients had difficulty understanding the response set and a redundant item in the sexual anxiety subscale was confusing to participants. Additional items were added prior to testing in order to have the most robust instrument possible that would capture the variables of interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the Sexual Self-Perception and Adjustment Questionnaire (SSPAQ) and the related subscales in cardiac patients. Research question: How reliable and valid is the SSPAQ using measures for internal consistency, content validity, and construct validity?</p>

<sec id="sec5-1744987113477416" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec6-1744987113477416"><title>Design and sample</title>
<p>This study used a non-experimental, descriptive, survey design. The variables measured by the SSPAQ were sexual satisfaction, sexual self-efficacy, sexual anxiety, and sexual depression, along with sexual activity in a cross sectional sample of cardiac patients. Human subjects’ approval was obtained from two medical centres and university institutional review boards. The researchers informed the participants, using a cover letter accompanying the survey about the study objectives, that their participation was voluntary, and that they could withdraw at any time. Participants were recruited from two medical centres through lists of patients meeting study criteria and as identified by medical records staff using ICD-9 diagnostic codes. To be included in the study, participants needed to be age 25 and older (expected to be in a stable sexual relationship at this age), able to read and write English, and previously hospitalised during a 1-year period with specific cardiac diagnoses. Diagnoses included coronary artery disease (CAD), acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, MI, heart failure (HF), coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), and implanted devices such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker. The sample for this analysis (<italic>N</italic> = 128), testing the reliability and validity of the SSPAQ, was derived from the parent study of 336 participants, and those who had complete responses on the SSPAQ. Comparisons were made for those sexually active (<italic>n</italic> = 100) to not sexually active (<italic>n</italic> = 28).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987113477416" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>A list of patient names and addresses was generated by medical records staff and provided to the principal investigator and a code number assigned for mailings. The list was destroyed after study mailings and follow-up were completed. The initial study questionnaire was accompanied by a cover letter from the respective administrative nursing director from each medical centre and from the investigators, and with return postage. A reminder postcard was sent to all prospective participants 1 week after the initial mailing, and a second mailing to those with non-returned questionnaires at 3 weeks after the initial mailing. Code numbers were not recorded during data entry to maintain anonymity and all identifying information such as names and addresses were destroyed after follow-up and data analysis was completed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987113477416"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>This revised instrument is based on the Multidimensional Sexual Self-Concept Questionnaire (MMSCQ), developed by Snell, and used in a variety of populations, the majority of which are non-medical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113477416">Snell, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113477416">2001</xref>). In prior research, selected subscales of the instrument have been used in cardiac populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113477416">2012</xref>), and reliability of the MSSCQ in both general and cardiac samples ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113477416">Snell, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113477416">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>). Beginning evidence from these studies indicate that sexual anxiety, sexual self-efficacy, sexual satisfaction, and to a lesser extent, sexual depression may play a role in adjustment and behaviours related to sexual activity. Use of the instrument in cardiac populations revealed the need to refine the instrument response set and selected questions. Permission was obtained from Snell to revise the instrument, including his request to rename the revised instrument (Snell WE Jr., 2011, personal communication). The original response set asked the participant to rate each item as to how characteristic it was of them. Responses varied from ‘not at all characteristic of me’ to ‘very characteristic of me’. Participants often had difficulty in understanding this terminology; therefore, for this study, the response set was revised, ranging from ‘always’ to ‘never’. In addition, the sexual anxiety subscale of the MSSCQ had a redundant item that was used as a validity check in the original 100-item instrument. A new item was substituted for the redundant item and 10 additional items were added (2–3 items per subscale) for validation testing of the revised instrument. In addition, two double-barreled items from the MSSCQ were reworded. The intent of the changes were to add psychometrically sound items to the subscales and to maintain at least five items on each subscale, with an equal number of items among subscales.</p>
<p>A higher score on each subscale indicates a greater proportion of the attribute of interest, for example higher sexual anxiety or depression and greater sexual self-efficacy and satisfaction, with scores for each subscale ranging from 7 to 35. The total SSPAQ score ranges from 28 to 140. For the total score, the sexual anxiety and sexual depression subscale scores were converted, such that a higher total SSPAQ score reflected positive sexual self-perception and adjustment. Readability of the questionnaire was established with the Flesch Reading Ease of 67.8 and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 6.5.</p>
<p>Sexual activity was defined as sexual intercourse in the last 2 months, including vaginal, finger or anal penetration, or oral sex. Participants rated the frequency of sexual activity, ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘more than twice a week’. For this analysis a new dichotomous variable was created to compare participants not sexually active to sexually active, regardless of the frequency of sexual activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987113477416"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Sociodemographic questions were evaluated using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, as appropriate. All analyses were completed using PASW Statistics 18, Release 18.0.2 (2 April 2010) by IBM SPSS Software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987113477416"><title>Reliability and validity testing</title>
<p>Content validity was assessed by an expert panel made up of five nurse researchers and one clinician with expertise in the constructs being measured. Assessment of content validity was conducted for the 11 new items for the SSPAQ. Experts rated the relevance of each item on a four point scale of ‘1 = not relevant’ to ‘4 = highly relevant’. The individual item content validity index (CVI) was 0.83–1.00, with 9 items at 1.00. The scale level CVI was 0.97, indicating that items were highly relevant.</p>
<p>Correlation matrices were constructed for item analysis and for each subscale. Reliability testing with coefficient alpha was used to measure internal consistency and to determine if items were representative of the underlying factors for sexual self-perception. A higher value indicates greater internal consistency.</p>
<p>Factor analysis was used to estimate construct validity. This approach allows for the clustering of related variables for a given construct, for example, sexual anxiety. Therefore, like items were grouped together that measured the underlying attribute or construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113477416">Polit and Beck, 2012</xref>). It was expected that items would cluster around the four latent variables of sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction. Principal component analysis was used to test the relationship among these four latent variables and the manifest variables (items) to confirm the hypothesised factor structure. The cut-off point of greater than 1.00 was used for factor extraction eigenvalues, and using the scree test, a sharp drop in the percentage of explained variance helped determine the appropriate termination point between factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113477416">Polit and Beck, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, construct validity was assessed using a known group technique to assess how groups might differ on a critical attribute related to a known characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113477416">Polit and Beck, 2012</xref>). In this study, as expected, some individuals completed the questionnaire even though they reported no sexual activity. Thus, sexual activity status was used as the known group (variable), and those sexually active were compared to those not sexually active. It would be expected that these groups would differ on the variables of sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction. Differences in mean scores on the subscales were compared using <italic>t</italic>-tests for unequal groups.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987113477416" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>All respondents (<italic>N</italic> = 128) who completed all questions on the SSPAQ were included in this analysis. Participants were predominantly male (75%), had a mean age of 61 years (SD 11.47, range = 31–90), mostly non-Hispanic White (90%), married (73%), in a long-term relationship (<italic>M</italic> = 32 years, SD 25.20), and well educated, with 68% having attended some college or had a college degree. Self-reported cardiac conditions included CAD (64%), angina pectoris (12%), MI (56%), CABG (54%), HF (23%), ICD (9%), and permanent pacemaker (13%). Of the sample, 78% reported being sexually active and in stable relationships ranging from 32 to 47 years.</p>
<p>Estimates of internal consistency reliability of the SSPAQ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987113477416">Table 1</xref>) and for the subscales (factors) ranged from 0.90 to 0.93, and 0.97 for the total scale. As a measure of construct validity, factor analysis with principal component analysis without rotation tested the relationship among the four latent variables of sexual anxiety, sexual self-efficacy, sexual satisfaction, and sexual depression. Items (manifest variables) for each subscale were used to confirm the hypothesised factor structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987113477416">Table 1</xref>, eigenvalues for each of the subscales ranged from 4.45 to 4.90, indicating a one factor model for each subscale, as all other eigenvalues were below 0.80. Factor loadings for each of the four factors in the model ranged from 0.522 to 0.938.

<p>As an additional measure of construct validity, the known group technique was used to test group differences on the critical attribute of sexual activity, comparing those sexually active to not active for each subscale and total score of the SSPAQ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987113477416">Table 2</xref>). All <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Those sexually active had lower mean scores for sexual anxiety and sexual depression, reflecting less sexual anxiety (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and less sexual depression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) when compared to those not sexually active. Sexual self-efficacy and sexual satisfaction scores were higher in those sexually active, suggesting positive sexual self-efficacy (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and sexual satisfaction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).

<p>Results support the reliability and validity of the SSPAQ as a measure of sexual self-perception and adjustment in a cardiac population. Patients with the most common cardiac diagnoses were included, adding strength to the study and a sample that is more likely to reflect the general population with cardiac disease. The SSPAQ is the first instrument to evaluate psychosexual concerns in a cardiac population, besides prior work using the MSSCQ subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113477416">2012</xref>). To promote independent use of each subscale, we expanded the number of items from the original five items of the MSSCQ to seven items on the SSPAQ, while maintaining internal consistency of the instrument and subscales.</p>
<p>This study verified the independence of the subscales that were modified from the MSSCQ. The SSPAQ is a cohesive measure of sexual self-perception, and our findings suggest that each subscale can be used independently for measures of sexual anxiety, sexual depression, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual satisfaction. The instrument and subscales are easily administered in a short amount of time, therefore making it usable in both research and busy clinical settings. In clinical settings, the instrument could be used as a bridge to discussing sexual concerns with patients and partners.</p>
<p>In this study, sexual self-efficacy had the highest mean score of all the subscales, followed closely by sexual satisfaction for those cardiac patients who were sexually active. This is consistent to prior results using the MSSCQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that changes in the items did not adversely affect the sensitivity of the instrument in its modified form. Similarly, the total sexual self-perception and adjustment score was similar to the total sexual self-concept score in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Scores on the SSPAQ for those sexually active reflected lower sexual anxiety and sexual depression compared to those not sexually active. Findings for sexual anxiety were similar to a prior report, while the present study yielded significant findings for depression that were not found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113477416">Steinke et al., 2008</xref>). The addition and refinement of items for subscales may have enhanced the ability to detect significant differences.</p>
<p>Those not sexually active had more sexual anxiety and sexual depression, with lower sexual satisfaction and sexual self-efficacy. Some patients who are not currently sexually active, but who wish to be active, may need support to improve sexual self-efficacy. A study of physical activity and self-efficacy interventions found that providing instruction, action planning, and reinforcing progress towards a behaviour are positive strategies in promoting self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987113477416">Williams and French, 2011</xref>), and may be useful in support of sexual self-efficacy. Enhancing sexual self-efficacy may in turn yield more positive sexual satisfaction, and less sexual anxiety and sexual depression, as improvement in the sexual relationship occurs. Therefore, it would follow that assessment by health care providers using the SSPAQ might be an important step in evaluating sexual concerns and in supporting sexual self-efficacy and return to sexual activity.</p>
<p>Further, it is recognised that sexual anxiety and other sexual concerns may persist over time and may be impacted by a variety of factors. A study of CABG patients found that age, disease duration, EuroSCORE, sexual knowledge and partner communication influenced sexual quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113477416">Lai et al., 2011</xref>), illustrating that measurement of multiple demographic and comorbid factors may also be useful in understanding sexual perceptions. Comparison of sexual self-perception and adjustment by cardiac diagnosis would be useful as the SSPAQ is further evaluated.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1744987113477416"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>While the results of this study indicate reliability and validity of the instrument, testing with a larger, more diverse sample of cardiac patients is encouraged. It is unknown to what extent the cardiac condition influenced the scores on instrument subscales. Those with chronic conditions such as heart failure may reflect differences in scores when compared to those with an acute condition such as MI. Further testing with a larger sample would allow for sub-group testing. In addition, there were unequal groups for those sexually active and not sexually active, and ideally greater representation by those not sexually active would be desirable. A known group technique was used in our analysis to examine hypothetical differences for those sexually active or not active based on our prior research and the literature, which adds some credibility to our findings. In this study, we did not seek to establish convergent or divergent validity, although in future work a comparison to overall anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy could further refine the validity of the SSPAQ.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987113477416" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, findings from the present study support the use of the SSPAQ subscales independently or used in totality, providing a valid and reliable measure of sexual self-perception and adjustment in cardiac patients. The strength of the instrument is the ability to specifically measure psychosexual constructs, not captured in general measures of anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. Knowing which patients are more sexually anxious or depressed for example, would help guide patient education and counselling, allowing the nurse and other health care providers to spend more time with those patients having the greatest concerns. In addition, health care providers might use the instrument to not only assess sexual concerns, but also to provide a non-threatening way to introduce the topic of sex with patients and partners.</p>
<p>Future research might expand the use of the SSPAQ with a larger sample of women, those more ethnically diverse, partners, and perhaps in other populations, as the instrument is not specific to cardiac diagnoses alone. Research from other countries world-wide indicates that sexual concerns among cardiac patients across populations are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113477416">Kazemi-Saleh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113477416">Kutmec andYurtsever, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113477416">Nicolosi et al., 2004</xref>); therefore, the use and validation of the instrument in other countries would serve to further understanding of psychosexual concerns. Nurses are often at the forefront in assessing psychological issues among patients; therefore, the SSPAQ provides another tool for assessment as part of quality patient care.</p>
