<p>In the nearly 40 years since Paul Watzlawick, John Weakland, and Richard Fisch wrote the original edition of this book, a lot has changed in the field of family therapy, although, consistent with this text’s description of typical “change,” not much <italic>has</italic> changed. Family therapy continues to focus routinely on individual problems rather than on relational issues or broader systemic patterns in which problems often persist. This book turns conventional family therapy practice on its head and focuses on creating categorical change.</p>
<p>The book includes 11 chapters that are organized into three parts. The first part consists of two chapters and highlights the theoretical perspectives of persistence and change at individual (i.e., member) and systemic (e.g., group, class) levels as well as the practical applications of these perspectives. The authors begin by presenting two theories, each describing different types of change: (a) theory of groups, which posits that a group consists of members and that changes implemented by any combination of its members are in degrees rather than in paradigmatic shifts (referred to as <italic>single-order change</italic>) and (b) theory of logical types, which proposes that systemic change (referred to as <italic>second-order change</italic>) is a major categorical shift from one state to another. The former is best described by the presented axiom, “The more things change, the more they remain the same,” suggesting that group members who try to change according to assumed rules will only find themselves in the same situation or with the same problem. To implement systemic change, there necessarily needs to be a change in fundamental assumptions that have been established by the group; this type of change is often only created by an external group member or an unexpected situation. In the second chapter, the authors explain the specific concepts of these two complex mathematical/philosophical theories using various examples, such as sociopolitical revolutions, rules in linguistics, and a seemingly impossible-to-solve problem set.</p>
<p>In the second part, which consists of four chapters, Watzlawick and colleagues introduce and describe three generally mishandled approaches in dealing with problems: (a) denying that the problem exists, (b) attempting to change a situation that is unchangeable, and (c) attempting to make a first-order change that only maintains or intensifies the problem. An example of the first approach is seen when families and politicians often create myths that deny the existence of problems or failed promises in an attempt to create a socially acceptable façade. The second, labeled the <italic>utopia syndrome</italic>, contrasts the first approach by, instead of not recognizing a problem, seeing a solution where there is none possible. The authors provide several of its variants, such as a person who perpetually plans for the worst to happen, is unhappy when it does not occur, and manifests in his own mind progressively unsolvable hurdles. The final way of mishandling problems, the <italic>paradox</italic>, is an impasse that results when dealing with a problem (e.g., child refusing to do homework) by attempting a seemingly direct solution (e.g., mother requesting that the child <italic>want</italic> to study). Overall, these three approaches demonstrate that it is extremely difficult to effect systemic change by making first-order changes within the bounds of particular systemic assumptions.</p>
<p>So how does one make categorical, second-order change? The final part of the book, consisting of five chapters, provides some resolve by outlining effective principles. For example, it is suggested that often unexpected situational modifications and paradoxical approaches can help shift one’s focus from the difficulty in dealing with a particular problem to a solution. In addition, reframing or changing, one’s conceptual or emotional perspective of a so-called problem in a way that still fits the facts of the situation can be useful for achieving second-order change. In Chapters 9 and 10, the clinical practitioner will find the most obvious practical gems with examples shared from the authors' family work in the Brief Therapy Center (although this in no way suggests that the rest of the book is unworthy of study). It may be difficult for some tentative practitioners to attempt the techniques described in these chapters, but the bigger set of strategies provided in these examples is in questioning the problem, understanding the patterns that have maintained the problem, formulating concrete goals, and attempting solutions that target the persistence patterns rather than the identified “problem.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Change</italic> offers a major contribution to individual perspectives in general and the field of family therapy in particular. It is a relatively small book packed with knowledge (i.e., gems) that would be useful for any advanced graduate student, family therapist, or layperson interested in the underpinnings of persistence and change. Although this book is the same as the first edition (with the minor exceptions of it being in paperback and the addition of the foreword by Bill O’Hanlon), it remains a classic that can be revisited and can be beneficial at various points in one’s career and personal life.</p>
