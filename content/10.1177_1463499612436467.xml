<abstract>
<p>Neuroanthropology is a new kid on the academic block. It seems to offer a methodological and conceptual synthesis, which bridges current fault lines within anthropology, both as discipline and as departments. We are not convinced that it will deliver on these grounds. However, it has the potential to open up novel ways to do and think ‘experimental anthropology’, as a method, as an object of study and as a research aesthetic. This approach, we argue, is probably not neuroanthropological – it may simply be anthropological.</p>

<body>
<p>We are grateful for the invitation to provide a commentary for this exciting special issue. The papers chosen, each in their own way, reveal that something new is happening in the scientific descriptions of what we as humans are. At stake is a discussion of how nature relates to culture, and culture to nature. If Bruno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499612436467">Latour (1993)</xref> was right in identifying a nature-culture separation at the heart of the modern constitution this debate may, in fact, be negotiating a key balance in the contemporary world as we know it.</p>
<p>It is high time that this discussion confronts a more mainstream anthropology audience. As convincingly argued in Reyna's piece, the discussion touches on a schism that has been central to the discipline, ever since its inauguration more than 100 years ago. This is also apparent in Whitehead's narrative of the coming of age of an anthropologist. These contributors identify a tension that created fault lines of non-communication, right inside academic departments. At stake are ontological discussions about the nature of (human) reality and epistemological discussions on how to gain knowledge. Settling these issues has many ethical and societal implications: how to educate kids, how to understand psychiatric disorders and, in general, how to build social realities (ethics). The fact that the discourse engages with epistemology, ontology and ethics may suggest that, fundamentally, cosmology is at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2003</xref>). We believe that the brain is important in these discussions, but perhaps the way forward may be more about looking at particular research practices, <italic>experiments</italic>, than at <italic>brains</italic> per se.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1463499612436467"><title>An ontological checklist: The nature of human reality</title>
<p>Dominguez argues that what we really need is <italic>cultural neurophenomenology</italic>, that is, ‘a theory of the experiential and neurobiological aspects of cultural activity’ to create a ‘neural theory of culture and a cultural theory of the brain’. We are not convinced that what we need are more theories, and will say more about this later. However, this call for ‘cultural neurophenomenology’ provides a minimal and very useful claim: humans have experiences, they have brains, they are embedded in cultural contexts, and somehow, these different factors interact with each other. This may not appear very controversial, but, as effectively argued by all the papers in this issue, not all recent research traditions investigating the human survive this ‘ontology checklist’.</p>
<p>Some positions seem to deny the importance of the biological as anything but a physical instantiation somehow linking into the body before the body becomes too experiential, lived in, and imbued with meaning. Some seem blind to the existence of an experiential domain. This effectively derives people of an ability to use experiences for anything. For example, to communicate with each other about something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499612436467">Frith 2007</xref>), or to act on experiences, thereby creating a space for agency that is more complex than simply deciding whether one chooses to follow instructions and press a button (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499612436467">Roepstorff and Frith 2004</xref>). Some insist on cognitive universalism and give too little credence to the cultural (nicely illustrated in Turner's paper), while others reinforce cultural differences effectively as natural kinds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1463499612436467">Vogeley and Roepstorff 2009</xref>), thereby running the risk of parsing people into distinct cultural groups that bear resemblance to classical distinctions of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499612436467">Martínez et al. 2011</xref>). Many take as an ontological given that effective causal chains run only one way, either from the biological to the experiences (cf. Francis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499612436467">Crick's (1994)</xref> provocative claim ‘you are nothing but a pack of neurons’), from the experiential to the biological (cf. certain strands of transcendental phenomenology; see Dominguez's paper, this issue) or from the cultural to everything else, as in a straw man version of cultural relativism. We therefore propose that humans have experiences, that they have brains, that they are embedded in cultural contexts, and that, somehow, these different factors interact with each other. This proposal provides an important ‘ontology checklist’ that can be used to assess various approaches to knowledge about the human.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499612436467"><title>Some epistemological challenges: What defines the experimental?</title>
<p>The major claim of this special issue is that neuroimaging can provide a useful tool for the anthropologist. A similar idea was previously espoused by cognitive psychologists who believed, among other things, that brain data would resolve disputes between different accounts of mental processes. This aim has proved very difficult to fulfill. It is notoriously easy to over-interpret brain imaging data and many have fallen into statistical and logical traps created by underpowered studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499612436467">Kriegeskorte et al. 2009</xref>) and attempts to make reverse inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1463499612436467">Poldrack 2006</xref>). Avoidance of such traps requires that brain imaging data be collected in the context of well designed and tightly controlled experiments. The problem highlighted here is even greater for anthropology than that for psychology since we need to include culture as well as experience and behavior in our studies of the brain.</p>
<p>The most difficult issue, then, is how one would gather knowledge about these different levels. It is this problem that makes the enterprise so complex. In any research field, there is an obvious tension between the ideals of method and the realities of the research. For experiments, it is very much about control of those factors that make the experiment possible: control of the variables studied, of the technologies applied, of the experimental design. It does not take much experience as a researcher, or as a fieldworker in a laboratory setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499612436467">Latour and Woolgar 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2001</xref>), to realize that the research process is rarely just like that. Experimental research is, it is increasingly clear, a complicated practice, a <italic>bricolage</italic> tinkering with the possible elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499612436467">Pickering 1995</xref>) to make things work. In the everyday reality of lab work, the ideal experiment to end all experiments and settle discussions once and for all seems usually a utopian dream. In reality, it only seems to exist in hindsight, in that painful realization that only after one has struggled to create some facts from the usually somewhat messy data does one know how one should really have constructed the experiment.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the realities of fieldwork are very far from the naive ‘Malinowskian’ ideal of pitching the tent among the natives who readily share their daily life and intimate secrets with the omnipresent and omnipotent fieldworker. As tales from the field tell again and again, it is usually a matter of frustration, of uncooperative or over-cooperative informants who follow their own agendas, of loneliness, boredom, of making the most of those events which suddenly occur. Tensions between disciplines, such as those described in the papers here, may be based on idealized views of what the research practice is all about.</p>
<p>In our research group, we have tried to counter this by making people from different disciplines do very concrete research projects together, as a way to get out of stereotyped views. It is not easy, and there may be some important lessons to draw from how it gets complicated.</p>
<p>Following Hastrup, Dominguez argues that a key lesson from anthropology has been to bring into scientific discussion the importance of lived experiences. We entirely agree. This is of key importance, not least because it creates a conceptual space for agency and interaction in between structures in the world and structures in the mind.</p>
<p>There is, however, a challenge as to how to translate this into a ‘classic’ experimental setting. Shaun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499612436467">Gallagher (2003)</xref> has argued that one may <italic>frontload</italic> concepts into an experimental design. Bahador Bahrami, one of our colleagues, tried that when he took a standard psycho-physical task and embedded it into a communicative, collaborative scenario, where people were allowed to discuss with each other, if they disagreed on their solution to the same task. Our finding was that being able to freely share experiences, i.e. to talk about what they had each seen, allowed the pairs to do better on the task than individuals, at least under certain rather well-defined conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499612436467">Bahrami et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In a paradigmatic study, Antoine Lutz, Francisco Varea and colleagues used individual experiences of task performance, that is, ‘what did it feel like when you did x?’, to structure the analysis of EEG data in a visual task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499612436467">Lutz et al. 2002</xref>). They found that using these experiential accounts as ways to structure the data analysis gave meaningful clusterings of the data, indicating that it indeed sometimes pays off for an experimenter to trust the subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1463499612436467">Jack and Roepstorff 2003a</xref>). These may be small steps towards coming up with experiments which survive the ontology checklist, and are often framed in script-report rather than ‘stimulus-response’ terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499612436467">Jack and Roepstorff 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>But one would limit oneself, if the contribution from anthropology was only about helping psychologists and cognitive scientists to do better experiments. In fact, in our experience, this mainly works at an early stage of the research process, when one tries to identify relevant questions to ask. It is, however, one thing to help asking novel questions, which take interaction and experience seriously; it is quite another to come up with concrete and feasible experiments which may help address these questions using a particular method. While anthropologists may have some skills in the former, usually, very little in their actual training qualifies them well for the latter task.</p>
<p>In fact, once one gets into the necessary nitty-gritty details of experimental design and subsequent data analysis, the anthropological intervention seems rarely very useful in its own right. So much of this work is a matter of identifying and dealing with confounds and alternative explanations. More often than not, it exposes to the anthropologist all the many potential confounding factors and ordering effects that in the view of other disciplines for very good reasons may question the validity of his or her work. On the other hand, the more these factors come to structure the experiments, the further one tends to get away from an understanding of ‘lived experience’, of the kind that the anthropologist would be happy with. Somehow, ratings of pain on a 5-point scale don't really give a thick description of what it is like to have electrical currents through your chin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499612436467">Abrahamsen et al. 2010</xref>). We read an undertone of frustration about what it is like to go experimental in Dominguez's and Whitehead's papers. When one, as an anthropologist, tries, out of the best of intentions, to go down the experimental route, one runs the risk of experiencing a double failure. On the one hand, one may be selling out on what anthropology is good at but, on the other hand, one is not gaining the rigor and/or style which is required for other experimentalists to take one seriously.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are other ways to do experimental anthropology. Just as ‘cultural anthropology’ is about studying cultures, not making culture, one reading of ‘experimental anthropology’ is an anthropological study of experiments. Dominguez (this issue) makes an important contribution to experimental anthropology in this sense. By following up on an earlier claim that imaging experiments transform subjects into objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2002</xref>), he shows how it is indeed possible, at least on paper, to close the circle and get back to the subjects, by taking seriously their experiences. This form of ‘experimental anthropology’, where anthropologists use tools and tricks of the trade to understand experiments as a very peculiar human practice, is potentially fruitful and productive. Our intuition is that ethnographically mapping human experiments, with or without scanners, as particular forms of intersubjective and interobjective practices may show how agency gets redistributed from the individual actors to the script that frames the experiment. In that sense, experiments may remind us of rituals, and it is no wonder that those who use experiments to identify agency find very little of it inside the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499612436467">Roepstorff and Frith 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a third sense in which anthropology may become – or, probably, always was – experimental. It can be an aesthetics of research practice, experimental in the sense of trying out new ways of writing, new ways of being in the field, or novel forms of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499612436467">Marcus 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2011b</xref>), such as using films as an experimental tool, which is fed back to the community to elicit new forms of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499612436467">Suhr et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499612436467">Suhr and Otto 2011</xref>). Combining this third sense of <italic>experimental</italic> with the first sense of <italic>experimental</italic> allows for ‘experimental experimental anthropology’ that tries out new ways to work experimentally in an anthropological setting. One example could be to take experiments to the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499612436467">Konvalinka et al. 2011</xref>). If one examines both the results emerging from experiments and the social setting and questions which experiments generate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499612436467">Astuti 2007</xref>), one may be outlining an anthropological research practice that is simultaneously experimental in all three meanings, as research aesthetic, as method and as object of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2011b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499612436467"><title>Front-loading concepts and models</title>
<p>We earlier introduced Shaun Gallagher's idea of <italic>front-loading concepts into experimental designs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499612436467">Gallagher 2003</xref>). That idea was presented as part of a discussion on how phenomenology and neuroscience could relate to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499612436467">Jack and Roepstorff 2003b</xref>). Gallagher's suggestion is that ‘the results of phenomenological investigations can be used in the design of empirical ones. Concepts or clarifications that have been worked out phenomenologically may operate as a partial framework for experimentation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499612436467">2003</xref>: 85). This approach may be translated also to the current discussion. This entails that <italic>concepts</italic> are used as vectors that move between different levels of investigation, experimentation and explanation, both in the field and in the lab. This is not the right place for a full exposition of this argument, but we will briefly indicate three potential candidates for such moves.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1463499612436467"><title>Predictive coding: A Bayesian interpretation of the (neuro)-hermeneutic circle?</title>
<p>We find both in Dominguez's paper and in Turner's paper an underlying assumption that people make sense of, and indeed construct, particular worlds. In interesting ways, these discussions resonate with a state-of-the-art discussion in cognitive neuroscience: the claim that a key work of the brain is to predict events in the world, and that these predictions rely on models of their surroundings that allow predictions to be made and tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499612436467">Friston 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499612436467">Frith 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2004</xref>). However, the fact that notions of models, predictions, and anticipations may work well both at a neural level and at a cultural level is not a guarantee that they <italic>mean</italic> the same, and that one may seamlessly move them from one domain to another. We have begun to front-load a notion of predictive coding into experimental and conceptual work both on basic and more complex cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499612436467">Hohwy et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499612436467">Hohwy and Rosenberg 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1463499612436467">Vuust et al. 2009</xref>). These Bayesian models can be seen as resolving the problem of the hermeneutic circle, since the whole (i.e. the prior) determines how the parts are understood but, at the same time, the parts (via prediction errors) modify the whole. In human cognition, a key element is the ability to share and exchange such models for interpretation. This allows for cultural shaping of cognitive processes, mediated via sharing of implicit and explicit framework for understanding. The apparent ease with which ideas of modeling, anticipation and prediction may also resonate with discussions in anthropology suggests that there is important work to do in figuring out the uses and limitations in these conceptualizations, both in the field and in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499612436467">Roepstorff et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1463499612436467"><title>One function of rituals: Synchronized arousal mediating group cohesion?</title>
<p>One of our colleagues, the anthropologist Dimitris Xygalatas, who studied fire-walking rituals in different settings, has argued that in a ritual setting, both performers and related spectators experience synchronized high arousal, and that this could be a key element in the efficacy of rituals in creating group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1463499612436467">Xygalatas 2008</xref>). We front-loaded that idea into an experimental investigation of spectators and fire-walkers talking part in a ritual in Spain, and we used measures of heart beat as a very simple proxy for arousal. Using well established mathematical models, we found that related spectators and fire-walkers shared a level of synchronization in the patterns of heart rhythms over the ritual, which was not seen in non-related spectators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499612436467">Konvalinka et al. 2011</xref>). This finding does not attempt to reduce a particular ritual to a measure of physiology, but it suggests that front-loading a basic anthropological concept, rituals work on groups, into an experimental design may allow for very concrete investigations to be made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1463499612436467"><title>Neural implementations of cultural dimensions of the self?</title>
<p>In parallel with the attempt to turn <italic>neuroanthropology</italic> into a novel subdiscipline, another group of researchers has tried to create <italic>cultural neuroscience</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1463499612436467">Chiao 2009</xref>). Interestingly, there is very little overlap between these two attempts which seem to have developed independently. A key topic in cultural neuroscience concerns how relating to ‘the self’ may elicit different cultural responses between different proclaimed cultural groups, typically ‘East Asians’ and ‘Westerners’. The approach challenges claims for cognitive universalism by attempting to demonstrate that the neural substrates of selfhood may be culturally dependent and contextually modified. However, at another level the approach, unintended but problematical, may come to reify very abstract notions of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2011a</xref>). The story of how a particular cognitive task, built on ascription of trait adjectives (e.g. ‘Are you <italic>trustworthy?</italic>’), came to be a tool for eliciting neural dimensions of the self is in itself instructive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1463499612436467">Zahavi and Roepstorff 2011</xref>). This demonstrates very succinctly how front-loading a concept into an experimental design may in itself carry unintended implications, which may need to be discussed at the meta-level of what script the experiment is actually enacting. For both anthropologists and neuroscientists the findings, which are currently emerging, call out for careful conceptualizations. On the one hand, it challenges neuroscientists to understand how contextual effects and personal experiences can affect brain activity underlying specific self-related processes, and to what extent these patterns may be shared within and differ between particular cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499612436467">Ma et al., in preparation</xref>). On the other hand, it challenges anthropologists to revisit classical discussions on patternings of culture and putative relations between biology and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499612436467">Roepstorff et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1463499612436467"><title>Neuroanthropology or experimental anthropology?</title>
<p>The title of this special issue, <italic>Neuroanthropology</italic>, suggests that it is indeed possible to straddle the conceptual divide, to bring knowledge from one domain to the other. We agree. It is worth trying to develop novel strands of knowledge that weave across the apparent cleft, and we hope that this paper and the rest of the special issue may be one element in creating such patterned textures.</p>
<p>However, we are not convinced that what the field currently needs is the naming of a new hybrid discipline such as <italic>neuroanthropology</italic>. This suggests a grand theory of how, on an abstract level, the cultural, the experiential and the neurological relate to each other. We believe that something else is more important, something at the same time less ambitious and perhaps more difficult to provide. We need novel cases that can examine and illustrate <italic>how</italic> these factors interrelate in concrete settings. We need questions and models that can be tested in the field and in the lab, and we need to formulate potential mechanisms as a way to gain a better foothold. There may be dialectics at stake here, but the dialectics may be a matter of sending questions, approaches and models back and forth. We need to develop a metalevel discourse that can grasp what happens when experiments and concepts travel. This approach is, we argue, not <italic>neuroanthropological</italic>, it is simply <italic>anthropological</italic>. If there is a need for a specific identifier, it could be an ‘experimental anthropology’ that will attempt to maintain the three meanings of experimental: as a method, as an object of study, and as a research aesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499612436467">Roepstorff 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Reyna (this issue) suggests that going back to Boas may be one useful way to move the field forward. We would not disagree (see another use of Boas in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499612436467">Roepstorff et al. 2010</xref>). In fact, there are interesting ways in which current discussions mirror those that took place at the turn of the last century. Reading up on these may provide directions for taking current discussions further. However, we are not convinced that this would also entail a neo-structuralism, which is mainly concerned with identifying links between structures in minds and structures in the world. Taking that approach may precisely miss out on the experiential domain, and this has important implications for how one may understand agency, subjectivity, and communication. Structuralist approaches have long been criticized for bracketing out the person in an attempt to identify structural parallels between worlds and minds. We think this may be problematic, on several levels. Within the anthropological tradition it runs the risk of forgetting important lessons developed in the discipline, e.g. the importance of taking seriously and indeed representing experiential domains. On a cognitive level, such an approach runs the risk of missing out on what may appear to be the most important function of human consciousness: our ability to use experiences as anchor points for actions and to share them with others in the process of constructing worlds that are both mental and social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499612436467">Frith 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499612436467">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499612436467">Roepstorff and Frith 2004</xref>). A neo-structuralism may thereby fail the ontological checklist outlined above. Ultimately, it may be unable to capture humans as persons, and this seems not to be a good starting point for anthropology.</p>
<p>If instead of outlining abstract theories one would attempt the dangerous process of constructing one potential bridge, what would it, then, look like? Our suggestion is to start out with joint research projects, do things together, and then be sensitive both to the type of facts and the types of contexts produced by going experimental.</p>
