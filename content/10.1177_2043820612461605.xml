We are inescapably immersed in these worlds and constantly shaped by them. Attaining impartial detachment or pure objectivity is impossible. As soon as we embark on any systematic investigation of the environment, we are immediately faced with decisions: What scales of enquiry seem necessary? What forms of data are counted as valid? What boundaries should we impose around networks of causality? The disciplinary traditions we follow and are familiar with may often make some of these decisions for us, or at least make them more instinctive. Geographers have different heuristics to biologists. But then, how do we decide which disciplines matter for our object of enquiry? If we want to understand the decline of coral health, for example, do we establish a team of marine ecologists, oceanographers, and climate scientists or a team of development geographers, environmental economists, and toxicologists? Same problem – different expertise – different answers.</p><p>These dilemmas of enquiry and analysis present themselves across all systematic investigations. They are particularly acute when studying environmental phenomena which entangle human and non-human worlds and which emerge from causal networks which are continuous from global processes to individual minds. Yet the decisions made by humans about the scales, data, and boundaries of their enquiry powerfully shape what is known about their environment. These decisions also frame the forms of remedial actions which may seem logical and necessary. Imagine two studies of hurricane Katrina which devastated the southern US coastline in 2005. One study asks the question: ‘Was hurricane Katrina caused by anthropogenic climate change?’ and the other asks: ‘Why were there so many deaths caused by hurricane Katrina and why was it those particular victims?’ Finding answers to both these questions might well be important, but the answers offered through these two systematic investigations would carry radically different implications for both politics and policy. In whose interests then are these different questions being asked?</p><p>The decisions scientists and social scientists take when studying the world are always politically charged. We should never think that disputes about environmental knowledge are the disputes merely about matters of fact. They are nearly always disputes about ‘matters of concern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612461605">Latour, 2004</xref>) or ‘matters of conversation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612461605">Jasanoff, 2010</xref>). The environment is made political before it is ever made factual.</p><p>Fully recognising these axioms, Shannnon O’Lear has written a powerful introductory student text about the politics of environmental knowledge, observed through the twin lenses of scale and power. O’Lear offers a series of rich stories that reveal the matters of concern – the exercise of power – underlying apparently banal environmental problems or frequently valorised solutions. She shows, for example, how oil and gas pipelines function as conduits of power, how (often fictitious) carbon offsets serve entrenched corporate interests, and how the international promotion of biofuels changes the balance of power between farmer, landowner and distant vehicle manufacturer; and scale matters too. As she observes ‘Climate change is constructed, or conceived and understood, in different ways by various actors at multiple scales’ (p. 41). The power effects of different scales of climate change knowledge are not always acknowledged; i.e., depending on the scale of construction – global, regional, local, individual – environmental knowledge can enable or disable different forms of policy interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612461605">Hulme, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Take the example of planetary boundaries as put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612461605">Rockström et al. (2009</xref>). These authors offer a global kind of knowledge to delineate a ‘safe operating space’ for humanity, expressed in terms of nine boundaries that must not be transgressed – climate change, biodiversity loss, excess nitrogen and phosphorus production, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, global consumption of freshwater, change in land use for agriculture, air pollution, and chemical pollution. Globalised knowledge breeds globalised power and so the implication of their argument is to authorise global forms of political authority. ‘There will need to be an institution . . . operating . . . above the level of individual countries to ensure the planetary boundaries are respected . . . [it] would be the ultimate arbiter of the myriad trade-offs that need to be managed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612461605">Steffen et al., 2011</xref>, p. 6). This is an aspiration which is taking shape as the Earth System Governance project of the International Human Dimensions Programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612461605">Biermann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Converting emergent scientific knowledge of the physical Earth system into planetary boundaries that ‘must be respected’ is a classic case of how global knowledge obscures the concern O’Lear expresses about scale and power relationships in regard to the environment. These nine putative global boundaries are the matters of concern dressed up as matters of fact. They are loaded with implicit values and ethical judgements. Why should ‘these’ boundaries guide global political action over and above other ‘boundaries’, which may not have global system knowledge to objectively shape them – for example, arresting genocide, establishing universal access to basic health care, eliminating human trafficking, and stabilising wealth inequalities. All these also have environmental repercussions (and constraints), but are rooted in different conceptions of the relationship between knowledge, scale, and power.</p><p>Why does all this matter? I believe with O’Lear that all students of geography or environmental sciences should be required to take courses in environmental politics – but why? She offers one answer at the end of her book: ‘. . . if we can understand more clearly why we believe what we believe, or why we do what we do, it is likely that we will make and encourage better choices in our interactions with the environment’ (p. 207). This is the virtue of reflexivity – of thinking about how we think and reflecting on why we act – which presumably is as valuable in thinking about environmental concerns as it is in other areas of public life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612461605">Sunstein, 2009</xref>).</p><p>But why is such reflexivity valorised? Why do we need to understand how forms of power and scale shape the narratives of environmental change in which we believe and through which we seek to act? O’Lear would say it is to equip us and those coming after us to challenge the first simple explanations and solutions for environmental change that come along. ‘Science can predict the future’, ‘pricing carbon is good’, and ‘hybrid cars are better for the environment’. Maybe, too, reflexivity animates forms of democratic citizenship that are suspicious of all forms of veiled or centralised power – whether this be exercised by government, scientists, lobbyists or corporates.</p><p>Yet, even with well-informed and reflexive citizens, we are still left with a dilemma – not now the one mentioned earlier about how we make sense of the reality of the complex world around us: what questions to ask, what disciplines to use, and what data to collect? But the enduring dilemma about the normative basis used to promote, justify, and execute specific actions in the world. O’Lear claims that ‘there is not necessarily one “right” way to approach the environment at all times and in all cases’ (p. 206), which we could reinterpret as claiming there is no one rational way of managing the planet. If this is true, then the human dilemma is about finding a common basis for moral action in the world: what forms of authority – political, scientific, and religious – mandate certain ethical stances in relation to the goals and forms of environmental policy?</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612461605">Harris (2011)</xref> in his recent book <italic>The Moral Landscape</italic> offers the view that there is a rational scientific basis for exactly such a common moral position. Morality – decisions about what is right and what is wrong – can be discovered through scientific enquiry just as surely as can cures for Alzheimer’s disease or how to produce biofuels from marine algae. We may not be there yet, but we will be. For Harris, the move he makes to reach this conclusion is to elevate the advancement of human well-being as the arbiter of moral action in the world – whether this be individual or collective behaviour or whether this be social or environmental policy. Since human well-being has correlative physical states in the brain, the new sciences of the mind will discover, not just how we ‘could’ act to solve environmental problems but how we ‘should’ act to solve them.</p><p>I remain unconvinced by the sweep of Harris’ argument, not least because the advancement of human well-being as the sole source of moral guidance leaves unanswered the very same questions of scale and power which O’Lear explores in her book. Is it maximising individual well-being or the collective well-being of 7 billion people? And who is to choose? What are the implications of granting to science the power to discern between right and wrong actions? I would also add a further concern about which O’Lear says less – intergenerational equity. In Harris’ rational ethics, how does science discover how one should weigh the well-being of those alive today against the well-being of those who will be alive in 50 years time?</p><p>If I am right and Harris is wrong, then we are still left with the dilemma of the moral basis for ethical action in the world – whether this be about guiding environmental interventions or about any other form of political action. It is one thing to promote a critical reflexivity about the environment – which is something <italic>Environmental Politics: Scale and Power</italic> does very well. It is quite another to offer an ethical paradigm to guide environmental action in the world. ‘Ethics’ as a third lens through which to view the politics of environmental knowledge would have been a welcome addition to O’Lear’s excellent book.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612461605"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Biermann</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Betsill</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> (<year>2010</year>). <article-title>Earth system governance: a research framework</article-title>. <source>International Environmental Agreements</source> <volume>10</volume>, <fpage>277</fpage>–<lpage>298</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612461605"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <source>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</source>. <publisher-loc>London, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Bantam Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612461605"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hulme</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>Problems with making and governing global kinds of knowledge</article-title>. <source>Global Environmental Change</source> <volume>20</volume>(<issue>4</issue>): <fpage>558</fpage>–<lpage>564</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-2043820612461605"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jasanoff</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>A new climate for society</article-title>. <source>Theory, Culture and Society</source> <volume>27</volume><issue>(2/3)</issue>: <fpage>233</fpage>–<lpage>253</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr5-2043820612461605"><citation citation-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Latour</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2004</year>) <article-title>Why has critique run out of steam?
