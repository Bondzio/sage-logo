<p>This book presents a historical study of the development of four liberal professions (physicians, engineers, lawyers and accountants) in four European countries (France, Great Britain, Germany and Italy), covering a period of over two centuries from the nineteenth to the beginning of the twenty-first century. The book aims to expose the historical complexity of the formation and development of these professions in Europe and explore the process of the entry of women into these fields. It is organized accordingly into five chapters. Four of these map the development of professions – law (Chapter 1), medicine (Chapter 2), engineering (Chapter 3) and accountancy (Chapter 4) – in each country, while Chapter 5 explores the entry of women into these professions.</p>
<p>The book argues that the professionalization process in Europe is better characterized by its discontinuity, instability and asymmetry than by its regularities. The author identifies a number of ‘internal’ or endogenous factors and two main ‘external’ or exogenous factors (the state and crises) which, she argues, shape the formation and development of liberal professions. Using examples from the four countries, the book successfully shows that the process of professionalization is not linear, nor does it have readily identifiable characteristics, i.e. not only does the impact of various factors differ from country to country, but the process also differs significantly over time within each national context. This interplay of internal and external factors is also used to explain gender dynamics within these professions.</p>
<p>Several previous attempts have been made to explore European and Anglo-Saxon systems of professions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913477959">Burrage and Torstendahl, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913477959">Svensson and Evetts, 2010</xref>). What differentiates this book from other literature is that, while it relies on a number of concepts from the sociology of professions, it also maps the process of the development of professions in Europe in the tradition of historiographic studies, a perspective that is particularly helpful for understanding the historical dynamics and the contextual embeddedness of the formation of these professions. The historical approach means that the book focuses less on the issue of definitions or the identification of systematic characteristics of professions, but instead offers a chronological narrative and valuable descriptions of historical developments, which allow us to understand the process of professional change, the elements that shape it and the contextual embeddedness of this change.</p>
<p>Several important themes are integral to the author’s argument and appear throughout the book. Malesta explores various factors that shape the formation of professions and suggests that, while factors internal to professions (e.g. factors which allow them to defend jurisdictions or gain status) remain the main drivers of their development, external factors, particularly the state and crises, also contribute significantly to the (trans)formation of professions. Interestingly, the historical illustrations in the four cases of European professions point clearly to the interconnectedness of external and internal factors, suggesting that it is their combination that uniquely shapes professional development. For example, the development of each of these professions is a story of the jurisdictional disputes within the profession (divisions within the legal profession exist in every country [Chapter 1]), but these disputes are clearly shaped by the historical context of each country. For example, the state plays a crucial role in the process of jurisdictional formation, but in some contexts it directly regulates and sets rules (e.g. in Italy and France), while elsewhere professions actively seek and negotiate the state’s mandate to allow them to protect their market niche and exclude other ‘rival’ professions (e.g. in the British context).</p>
<p>The role of the state in the development of professions is another major theme of the book and is examined in its complexity and over time. The relationship between professions and the state indeed determines the relative power of professions (e.g. the ability for and extent of professional self-regulation), but the nature of the struggle for professional power and autonomy is distinctive to each cultural, economic and political context. The author clearly demonstrates the existence of different state–profession relationship regimes, ranging from heavily centralized state regulation of professions to a high level of professional autonomy. However, she concludes that the presence of a strong state does not necessarily imply a complete lack of professional autonomy. Moreover, as is clear from the examples of Italian lawyers (Chapter 1) and French medics (Chapter 2), professions may actively support state regimes when it is to their advantage and in line with their ethics. The book is certainly successful in exposing the non-linearity and heterogeneity of the professionalization process in Europe. It provides a convincing illustration that the role of the state and the position of professions varies not just across cultures but can also change significantly over time within a single national context. In Italy, for instance, the law profession was relatively self-regulating in the late nineteenth century; that autonomy was eroded during the Fascist regime and partially restored to independence later in the twentieth century (Chapter 1). In the UK, the (neo)liberal project of the twentieth century resulted in attempts to challenge the traditional monopolies of the professions (Chapter 2). Exposing such differences within and across countries shows the heterogeneity of professionalization strategies and adds weight to the author’s argument about the instability of the characteristics of this process.</p>
<p>The discussion of the importance of the second ‘external’ factor – the role of crisis – further complements the picture of professional development in Europe. Analysis of the role of crisis (i.e. economic, social and political moments of change) is woven into the general fabric of the discussion in each chapter and shows that events such as wars, revolutions and economic disasters significantly affect the development of professions. The implications of the same event can differ from country to country (e.g. the Second World War significantly affected professional autonomy in Nazi-regime states, but had little such impact in Britain and France [Chapters 1–4]). The author also illustrates that the effect of crises can vary for different professions within a single context (for example, in Germany the aftermath of the Second World War was different for medicine [Chapter 2] than for accounting or engineering [Chapters 3 and 4]). This discussion effectively contributes to the overarching argument of the asymmetry and discontinuity of professional development.</p>
<p>The last chapter (Chapter 5) examines the role of crises and the state in relation to the final theme of the book, the historical circumstances of women’s entry into professions. The author argues that the exclusion of women was due mainly to factors internal to professions and shows how professions across cultures resisted women’s entry through professional hierarchies, patriarchal traditions and closure regimes. Ample evidence suggests that professionalization was a masculine project, regardless of the national context. The inclusion of women in professions seems to have been due mainly to exogenous factors, e.g. equality laws in education, the welfare state, the aftermath of revolutions and wars. The book particularly emphasizes the role of the state in the emancipatory project. While the argument about external influences is persuasive, it would be interesting to be given more details about the circumstances of changes in state policies and legislation; the impression is that states were very eager and proactive in redressing gender imbalance, but perhaps there is a more complex and critical story to tell here.</p>
<p>The definitive strength of the book is its ambition to show the development of four different professions over time and to present a cross-cultural comparison of four national contexts. Such a comparative historical account allows us to pinpoint the differences and commonalities in the development of European professions, as well as to discern a complex picture of change, characterized by non-linearity and a lack of uniformity in the professionalization process. However, the strength of the book is its weakness. The description of four contexts at times results in an overwhelming amount of information, while the accounts of some crucial events would benefit from a more detailed analysis. Furthermore, despite a very convincing illustration of the effect of the state and crises on women’s entry and position in professions, the book portrays a very broad picture of these processes. It would be interesting to unpack the gender story of each profession in more detail. The gender theme appears to be an ‘additional’ element, rather than an integral part of the main story of the development of professions: even symbolically, it is left towards the end of the book. This is, indeed, a reflection of women’s history within European professions. However, it reproduces their ontologically ‘adjacent’ position, albeit inadvertently. Overall, though, the book is a very useful addition to the extant literature on professions and clearly contributes to the field by providing an overview of the historical patterns of professional development.</p>
