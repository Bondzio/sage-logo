<abstract>
<p>The Department of Health in England introduced mandatory reporting of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteraemia in June 2011. We sought to determine the preventability of Gram negative bacteraemias and the efficacy of using <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteraemia as a surveillance tool. A six-month prospective study evaluated the preventability of Gram negative bacteraemias. Two investigators independently classified bacteraemias as preventable or not preventable. There were 141 bacteraemias (122 episodes) in 118 patients in the study period. <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most frequently isolated organism. Thirty five episodes (28.7%) were community onset, 24 (19.7%) hospital onset and 63 (51.6%) were healthcare-associated. Three bacteraemias (2.5%) were thought to be probably preventable and 21(17.2%) were thought to be possibly preventable. Factors associated with preventability by multivariable analysis included presence of a urinary catheter or central venous catheter and dependent functional state. A significant number of Gram negative bacteraemias were thought to be preventable, especially in patients with urinary catheters and central venous catheters. Surveillance of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteraemias is an insensitive and non-specific method for identifying preventable Gram negative bacteraemias. We propose that targeted surveillance of patients with urinary catheters and central venous catheters in situ could help reduce infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gram negative bacteraemia is associated with a mortality rate in excess of 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412470014">Kang et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412470014">Micek et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412470014">Enoch et al, 2011</xref>). This is of concern because the number of Gram negative bacteraemias is rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412470014">Albrecht et al, 2006</xref>) and the incidence of resistance is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412470014">D’Agata 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The Department of Health in England introduced mandatory reporting of <italic>E. coli</italic> bloodstream infections in June 2011. This followed a year on year rise in <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteraemias in England and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412470014">Health Protection Agency, 2012</xref>). The introduction of mandatory surveillance and targets for meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) bacteraemias in 2001 led to significant reductions in cases. It is recognised that a proportion of Gram negative bacteraemias are potentially preventable. Two methods have previously been used to identify preventable hospital acquired infections. One method involves measuring nosocomial infection rates before and after implementing a prevention programme. Another method involves prospectively reviewing the medical records and evaluating their preventability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412470014">Bonnal et al, 2010</xref>). This method has previously been found to be moderately reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412470014">Michel et al, 2004</xref>). We sought to determine the preventability of all Gram negative bacteraemias in our hospital over a six-month period by prospectively assessing the medical notes using a validated tool. We also sought to determine the efficacy of using <italic>E. coli</italic> as a surveillance tool to target preventable Gram negative bacteraemias.</p>

<sec id="section2-1757177412470014" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p><bold>Setting:</bold> Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a district general hospital with approximately 600 beds including acute medical, surgical (general and orthopaedic), elderly care, women’s services and intensive care. It covers a predominantly semi-rural population of 450,000 people in Cambridgeshire, England with approximately 75,000 admissions per year.</p>
<p><bold>Study design and patients:</bold> A prospective study of all Gram negative bacteraemias occurring for the six months commencing 1 January 2011 was performed. Approval for the study was obtained from the trust’s audit committee.</p>
<p><bold>Variables:</bold> Demographic data, clinical details and the antibiotic history were obtained from laboratory and microbiology records and medical, nursing and pharmacy notes as well as the patient administration system. Data obtained included age, gender, number of hospitalisations in the preceding year (including other hospitals), comorbidities (leg ulcers, open wounds, cardiac disease, intravenous drug use, alcohol abuse, renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage ≥2 or raised serum creatinine &gt;120µmol/L), neurological disorder, diabetes, anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;115g/L), malignancy, liver disease, immunosuppression (receipt of cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressant or &gt; prednisolone (30mg/day or equivalent), McCabe score, Charlson score, antibiotic history (in the preceding three months and post-bacteraemia), intravenous line usage (central and peripheral), urinary catheter usage, primary outcome data (death at one week and 30 days) and secondary outcome data (requirement for ITU, requirement for surgery and recurrence).</p>
<p><bold>Definitions:</bold> Bacteraemias were counted as one episode if they occurred within 14 days of a previous result (with the same organism and antibiogram). Subsequent episodes occurring after this time were considered new episodes and regarded as recurrences if this was with the same organism and antibiogram. Blood cultures growing more than one organism were defined as mixed. Community-onset bacteraemia was defined as that occurring within 48 hours of admission if the patient was not transferred from another hospital, whereas hospital-onset bacteraemia was after this period. Healthcare-associated bacteraemia was defined as that occurring within 48 hours of hospital admission from a patient who had previously been admitted to hospital in the preceding year or was admitted from a nursing/residential home. A preventable episode (or preventability) was defined as an unintended bacteraemia that was caused by healthcare management or as a failure to meet the reasonably expected standard of care.</p>
<p><bold>Microbiology:</bold> Microbiology data were obtained from the laboratory information system. All blood cultures were processed using the BacT/Alert 3D system (bioMérieux UK Ltd, Basingstoke, UK). Organisms were identified to species level by API20E or API20NE (bioMérieux UK Ltd, Basingstoke, UK).</p>
<p><bold>Standard:</bold> We used a questionnaire derived from a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412470014">Bonnal et al, 2010</xref>) to evaluate the preventability of Gram negative bacteraemias on a six-point Likert scale, where 1 indicated ‘almost certainly preventable’ and 6 ‘almost certainly not preventable,’ according to accepted criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412470014">Bonnal et al, 2010</xref>). Bacteraemias with a score of 1, 2 or 3 were classified as certainly, probably or possibly preventable and those with scores of 4, 5 or 6 as possibly, probably or certainly not preventable. One investigator (DAE or DAM) prospectively first discussed each case with the clinician and/or nurse in charge of the patient and assigned a score between 1 and 6 prior to the identity of the organism being available. In a second step, these two investigators reached agreement regarding preventability through discussion and assigned a score between 1 and 6. In a third step, 20 medical notes were randomly selected and retrieved six months later and reviewed independently and blind of the initial result to reduce intra-observer bias and a score assigned. Examples of evaluations are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412470014">Box 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p><bold>Statistical analysis:</bold> All forms were anonymised before computer entry. Patients were categorised into two groups: those with preventable bacteraemia (1–3) and those with non-preventable bacteraemia (4–6). We assessed characteristics of patients in the two groups using Chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables as appropriate and <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to separately determine predictors of preventable bacteraemia. Variables in the multivariable model included demographics such as age and gender, onset of infection (healthcare associated or hospital acquired vs. community acquired), source of infection (urine or biliary tract), organisms (<italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Proteus</italic> spp.), risk factors such as urinary catheterisation, residence in nursing or residential home, attendance by a district nurse, dependent functional state, indwelling catheter (central line), presence of chronic wound, and having a neurological disease. Comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hemiplegia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure were also included. All tests were two-tailed, and a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Data were analysed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 11 (StataCorp 2011).</p>
<p>Sensitivity, specificity and negative and positive predictive values were obtained for conditions thought to be associated with preventability.</p>

<title>Patient population</title>
<p>There were 141 bacteraemias (122 episodes) in 118 patients in the study period. Four patients had recurrences. The ages ranged from 0–98 years (median 75; interquartile range 59 to 82); 65 (53.3%) were male. Thirty five episodes (28.7%) were community onset, 24 (19.7%) hospital onset and 63 (51.6%) were healthcare-associated. Most episodes (80) were in medical patients followed by surgery (20), oncology (14), and others (8). The source was urinary tract (61 episodes), biliary tract (19), unknown (16), pneumonia (12), bowel (6), central venous catheter (CVC; 4), and one each of pancreatitis, liver abscess, diabetic ulcer and skin and soft tissue infection. The results are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412470014">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was the most frequently isolated organism (75 episodes) followed by <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp. (21), <italic>Proteus</italic> spp. (9), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (8), <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (4), <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp. (3), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. (2), <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. (2), <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (2) and <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (1). There were 17 bacteraemias mixed with skin flora (coagulase negative staphylococci (6), viridans type streptococci (2)) or bowel flora, (<italic>E.</italic> faecalis (5)). One of the <italic>Klebsiella</italic> bacteraemias and four of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteraemias were mixed (with <italic>Proteus</italic> spp. and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. (2), <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp. and <italic>Proteus</italic> spp. respectively).

<title>Preventability</title>
<p>Three bacteraemias (2.5%) were thought to be probably preventable (Lickert scale 2). This included two bacteraemias related to inappropriate urinary catheter usage in hospitalised patients (one <italic>E. coli</italic> and one <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>) and an infected HCAI-onset pressure ulcer in a diabetic patient living in a nursing home (<italic>P. mirabilis</italic>). Twenty one (17.2%) were thought to be possibly preventable (Lickert scale 3), including eight <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp., seven <italic>E. coli</italic>, seven <italic>Proteus</italic> spp., two <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and one each of <italic>Providencia</italic> spp., <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and <italic>C. koseri</italic> (including mixed cultures). Four of the 21 episodes were hospital onset; three were related to urinary catheter use and one was related to CVC use. Fifteen were HCAI-onset, including 10 which were related to urinary catheter use, three were CVC-related, one cholangitis and one unknown. Two community onset cases were related to urinary catheter care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412470014">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The remaining 98 episodes (80.3%) were considered to be not-preventable (Lickert scale 4–6). These included 68 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 12 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp., six <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, three <italic>Serratia</italic> spp., and three <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp.. Seventeen were thought to be possibly not preventable, 56 probably not preventable and 25 were definitely not preventable. Seven of those thought possibly not preventable were hospital-onset, nine were healthcare-associated and one was community onset.</p>
<p>Factors associated with preventability by bivariate analysis included urinary source, presence of a urinary catheter or CVC, attendance by a district nurse, dependent functional state, chronic wound/ulcer, previous myocardial infarction and cardiac failure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412470014">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Overall, there was good concordance between investigators. Only one discrepancy was observed between DAE and DAM between a score of 2 and 3 (eventually valued as a 3) and six discrepancies between values 5 and 6, but there were no discrepancies between 3 and 4. Reviewing the 20 cases retrospectively found one discrepancy (valued as a 4 initially but changed to a 5 on review).</p>

<title>Outcome</title>
<p>Twelve patients required ITU and 11 required surgery. Four developed a recurrence. The mortality at one week was 13.1% and at one month was 20.5%. There were no differences in these parameters between preventable and non-preventable bacteraemias (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412470014">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-1757177412470014" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gram negative bacteraemia is common and is increasing in prevalence; we have previously reported 203 episodes for the year 2008–9 in our institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412470014">Enoch et al, 2011</xref>), with similar increases noted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412470014">Albrecht et al, 2006</xref>). The reason for this increase is not entirely clear but might be due to an ageing population with greater morbidity and linked to more frequent invasive procedures including urinary, intravascular and biliary instrumentation. Another population-based study, however, suggested the rise in <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteraemias from 3.4/10, 000 bed days in 1999 to 5.7/10, 000 bed days in 2011 may be due to an increase in resistant organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412470014">Schlackow et al, 2012</xref>). There was no increase in susceptible strains over the same period. Gram negative bacteraemia is also associated with significant mortality and morbidity despite appropriate antibiotics.</p>
<p>In this study we report that almost a fifth of Gram negative bacteraemias (24; 19.7%) were probably or possibly preventable. Multivariable analysis suggested many of these were associated with an invasive device such as a urinary catheter or CVC and a dependent functional state. We also found that <italic>E. coli</italic> is a poor marker of preventability as it is insensitive and non-specific. Other organisms (for example, <italic>P. aeruginosa, Proteus</italic> spp. and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp.) are also insensitive but are more specific. Confining reviews to hospital-onset cases also failed to improve sensitivity.</p>
<p>Urinary catheter use was not surprisingly found to be a significant risk factor associated with bacteraemia. The urinary catheters were found to be unnecessary in the two episodes considered to be preventable. Although both of these cases were in hospitalised patients, it was much harder to ascertain the necessity of the catheter in community-onset bacteraemias. This was predominantly due to lack of awareness of the need for the urinary catheter in the community (compared to the hospital) and poor documentation. Our study also suggests that preventive strategies cannot just target hospital cases. Whilst five bacteraemias related to urinary catheters were in hospitalised patients, 12 were in patients from the community. Of the four CVC-related bacteraemias that were thought to be preventable, three were HCAI-onset. This study therefore suggests that resources should be targeted towards tackling inappropriate urinary catheter use in both the hospital and community setting.</p>
<p>Our data are similar to a recent study from London which found that 19% of <italic>E. coli</italic> were potentially preventable, and most of these were due to urinary catheter use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412470014">Underwood et al, 2011</xref>) but higher than a study that suggested only 4.8% of 1372 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteraemias were preventable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412470014">Melzer and Welch, 2012</xref>). However, neither study stated how they determined preventability and also did not differentiate HCAI infections from community-onset cases.</p>
<p>We used only one of several methods to assess the preventability of bacteraemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412470014">Bonnal et al, 2010</xref>). We accept there are several limitations to this method, including subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412470014">Michel et al, 2007</xref>), though previous studies have found it to be moderately reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412470014">Michel et al, 2004</xref>). We discussed the case with the clinician or nurse in charge of the case and used two independent clinicians plus a further retrospective review to reduce the chances of bias, but this will not have eliminated it. Nevertheless, our chosen method has highlighted the importance of improved care of patients with urinary catheters and CVCs in the hospital and community. Care of patients with urinary catheters is being addressed in England by the recently introduced NHS Safety Thermometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412470014">Harm Free Care, 2012</xref>). Another limitation of our study is that it was performed in a single centre, so the results may not be applicable to other institutions. Of note is the low rate of ESBL-producing organisms. There has been no rise in antimicrobial resistance since 2008–9 (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412470014">Enoch et al, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412470014">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Collecting all the data from the medical notes took approximately 10–15 minutes per patient (additional to seeing and assessing the patient prior to the study). Discussing the case with the medical and nursing staff could potentially take a similar length of time for patients with difficult or complicated cases.</p>
<p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteraemia is increasing; as a measure of the burden of ill-health being caused by this organism surveillance of the organism is useful. However as the amount of <italic>E. coli</italic> that can be prevented is this and other similar studies 20% of the total, its use as a quality indicator or management target is more limited. Limiting surveillance to any single Gram negative organism or only hospital onset cases is also insensitive.</p>
<p>Our study supports the role for further interventions to improve the care of patients with urinary catheters and CVCs. It also suggests that surveillance targeting patients with urinary catheters and CVCs in situ would improve sensitivity and specificity and be a more time-efficient strategy that may ultimately help reverse the rising trend of Gram negative bacteraemias.</p>
