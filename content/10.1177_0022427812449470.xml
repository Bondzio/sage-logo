<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>This study examines the effect of prison visitation on the probability of inmate misconduct.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Our sample is an admissions cohort of over 7,000 inmates admitted to Florida correctional facilities between 2000 and 2002. The authors conducted multilevel analyses of the week-to-week association between officially recorded disciplinary infractions and prison visits, including spousal, significant other, parental, relative, and friend visits.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The probability of an in-prison infraction declines in anticipation of visits, increases immediately following visits, and then gradually declines to average levels. This pattern is relatively consistent across visitors and infraction types but is strongest for spousal visits and contraband infractions. More frequent visits are associated with a more rapid postvisit decline.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>If visits reduce the pains of imprisonment or increase social control, then these effects may be too short-lived to create lasting improvements in the behavior of individuals while incarcerated. Future research should attempt to replicate and explain these findings and examine the longer term effects of visitation on inmate adjustment during and after incarceration.</p>

<p>Two goals of prison systems are to operate in ways that promote internal safety and order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427812449470">Bottoms 1999</xref>) and to improve reentry outcomes for released inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427812449470">Cullen and Jonson 2012</xref>). Accordingly, effective prison administration requires structuring the prison experience to promote compliance with prison rules and ultimately encourage desistance from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812449470">Turner et al. 2007</xref>). Theories of prison order and desistance suggest that offenders with ties to conventional society should commit fewer infractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427812449470">Visher and Travis 2003</xref>). Strong ties to significant others should legitimate and reinforce prosocial norms while also reducing the pains of imprisonment and, in turn, any paradoxical criminogenic effects of incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427812449470">Nagin, Cullen, and Jonson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812449470">Turner et al. 2007</xref>). It thus may be problematic that inmates’ social ties often were tenuous preprison and are further eroded by incarceration-imposed separation and stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427812449470">Kazura 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812449470">Uggen, Manza, and Behrens 2004</xref>). Strengthening inmates’ ties could be an important means of reducing in-prison infractions and potentially increasing the odds of desistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427812449470">Tewksbury and DeMichele 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Prison visitation is one of the most prominent potential means of using inmates’ own ties to society to improve their in-prison behavior. Indeed, visitation programs are ubiquitous in American correctional facilities because they are widely perceived to reduce crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427812449470">Maruna and Toch 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, and despite the practical and financial burdens that visits place on visitors and facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427812449470">Christian 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812449470">Comfort 2008</xref>), we know surprisingly little about whether and how visits actually affect inmates’ behavior. Not only do few empirical studies exist on the topic but also studies to date yield inconsistent findings, with some identifying beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812449470">Borgman 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo and Bakken 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427812449470">Ellis, Grasmick, and Gilman 1974</xref>), others harmful effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo, Bakken, and Karle 2004</xref>), and still others null effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427812449470">Clark 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812449470">Holt and Miller 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427812449470">Jiang and Winfree 2006</xref>). The effect of visitation on in-prison behavior thus remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this article, we shed light on the effects of prison visits on inmates’ behavior by examining inmates’ disciplinary records in the weeks surrounding visits from family and friends. To this end, we first draw on criminological work on inmate relationships and the prison experience to develop competing hypotheses about visits’ effects. We then describe the potential utility of a focus on individual change and the timing of this change. Finally, we test our hypotheses using data on a large admissions cohort of Florida inmates and a within-person design that helps us isolate the impact of visitation and examine the timing of infractions in relation to visits. We also consider multiple types of visitors and infractions and other possible contingencies.</p>

<title>Reducing Misconduct by Reducing the “Pains” of Imprisonment</title>
<p>Strain- and deprivation-centered models of prison misconduct are central to scholarship on inmate adjustment. These models posit that prison conditions raise the risk of misconduct by taxing inmates’ coping skills and creating pressures to act out against the staff who impose those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427812449470">Blevins et al. 2010</xref>). Corrections staff thus could reduce misconduct by providing inmates with diversions from the “pains” of incarceration and by reducing the contrast between prison and the outside world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427812449470">Sykes 1958</xref>:63). Diversions that provide both a means of prosocial goal attainment and a sense of normalcy may be especially effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research shows that inmates find it particularly difficult to adjust to separation from loved ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812449470">Adams 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812449470">Ross and Richards 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812449470">Uggen et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427812449470">Ward and Kassebaum 1965</xref>). Under strain theory, this separation could represent either a loss of valued contact with significant others or a new noxious stimulus, namely social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427812449470">Blevins et al. 2010</xref>). Visits could reduce the chances of misconduct by providing inmates with access to valued others, emotional support, relief from isolation, and a distraction from the other discomforts of confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812449470">Adams 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo and Bakken 2002</xref>). Visits at the least appear to make inmates feel more supported. For example, when parents visit detained juvenile offenders, juveniles’ depressive symptoms decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427812449470">Monahan, Goldweber, and Cauffman 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Correctional facilities are unique places to observe social ties’ effects on behavior. Most explanations of ties’ short-term effects on street offending involve norm setting, rule enforcement, and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427812449470">Horney, Osgood, and Marshall 1995</xref>). Notably, most inmate-visitor ties existed prior to incarceration and apparently were insufficient to prevent it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812449470">Holt and Miller 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427812449470">La Vigne et al. 2005</xref>). Yet, inmate accounts suggest that preexisting relationships take on new importance when individuals are incarcerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812449470">Maruna 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812449470">Uggen et al. 2004</xref>). For motivated inmates, incarceration creates new opportunities to strengthen close relationships by providing a “time out” from street concerns and resources for addressing addictions and other distracting problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>: 189; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812449470">Comfort 2008</xref>). Prison visits thus could have the dual functions of lessening deprivation and of reinforcing inmates’ involvement with conventional social institutions, which in turn could reduce subsequent misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>These possibilities notwithstanding, some scholarship, including qualitative inmate accounts, lead to the opposite prediction. As we describe next, repeated reminders of life on the outside could increase the strains of imprisonment and thus the likelihood of inmate infractions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022427812449470">
<title>Do Repeated Separations Turn “Doing Time” into “Doing Hard Time?”</title>
<p>Efforts to reduce deprivation-induced misconduct through prison visits assume that visits cause lasting declines in feelings of deprivation. This assumption may not hold if the source of deprivation is the separation itself, given that separation will occur again at the end of each visit. After visits, inmates again lack physical access to loved ones and the diversion of contact with the outside. In a related but distinct complication, they also may be left with intensified reminders of the lives that continue without them. Indeed, children’s aging, partners’ loyalty, and other similar topics are common inmate concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812449470">Comfort 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427812449470">Fishman 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>). Feelings of strain and deprivation thus could be quite high immediately following visits.</p>
<p>Some qualitative research supports this possibility. One of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen’s (1998</xref>:128) interviewees describes how visitors’ departures remind her of the realities of her confinement:<disp-quote>
<p>You do have warmth when you are laughing and talking with your family members, but then when it is time for them to get up and go, you have to go back to your cell. When they are going back to the free world and it don’t feel so nice. To see them have to walk out of a door and you can’t walk with them. It is almost not worth it to have them visit.</p>
</disp-quote>A visitor interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427812449470">Fishman (1990</xref>:154) reports similar feelings: “I’m feeling okay until the visit is over…When I get home, I call him and he’s so depressed. I wish he could walk out the door with me.” Some inmates withdraw from their families because concentrating simultaneously on serving one’s sentence and on one’s past life back at home “makes you do hard time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>:129; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427812449470">Richards and Jones 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427812449470">Schmid and Jones 1993</xref>). These accounts suggest that feelings of loss and deprivation, and in turn the risk of prison misconduct, could increase following visits.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if visits’ effects operate via informal social control, then these effects should be beneficial and lasting despite inmates’ negative postvisit feelings. Social control works through the gradual development of “stakes in conformity” and increasing potential costs to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427812449470">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>), and it relies more on significant others’ mental presence than on their physical presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427812449470">Hirschi 1969</xref>). Visits might not be intensive enough to cause meaningful increases in control, but from this perspective they should not have harmful effects. What remains unknown is which result—a decrease or an increase in misconduct—occurs.</p>

<title>Visits and Inmate Behavior: Adapting an Approach From “the Outside”</title>
<p>Despite the practical and theoretical importance of visitation as a potential behavior management tool, we do not yet know whether and how inmate behavior changes in response to visits. Work on this topic is further complicated by the fact that visited and unvisited inmates probably differ in many other respects. For example, the odds of visits and infractions may vary by characteristics of inmates or their past relationships or by facility policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427812449470">DeLisi 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427812449470">Steiner and Wooldredge 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427812449470">Wooldredge and Steiner 2009</xref>), and researchers rarely have measures of all of these potential confounds.</p>
<p>One potentially useful approach comes from studies of the within-individual effects of social ties on street offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427812449470">Blokland and Nieuwbeerta 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427812449470">Horney, Osgood, and Marshall 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427812449470">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). These studies assess the impact of ties by comparing individuals’ offending during periods when they have a tie to their own offending when during periods they do not have one. This method is well-suited for studies of visits’ effects because it eliminates an entire category of potential confounds, namely all factors that do not change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427812449470">Johnson 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427812449470">Winship and Morgan 1999</xref>). For example, a facility’s security level might explain why that facility’s infraction rate is higher or lower than another facility’s, but it could not explain why an inmate in that facility commits infractions during some weeks and not others. A focus on within-inmate change is easily adapted to the study of the timing of the effects of visits and to the examination of potential delays, growth, or decay in the effects of visits over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812449470">Osgood 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427812449470">Laub, Nagin, and Sampson 1998</xref>). As we next describe, this approach also would allow visitation researchers to examine additional research questions that remain unaddressed by prior studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022427812449470">
<title>Previsit Trends in Infractions: Behavior as Usual?</title>
<p>The theory and scholarship reviewed earlier concern changes in inmate behavior following visits, but researchers studying individual change over time also raise the possibility of anticipatory effects of life events. For example, fiancés may begin to change their behavior in preparation for marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427812449470">Laub et al. 1998</xref>). Similarly, the effects of visitation may not depend on the visitor’s physical arrival. In Florida, for example, visits’ impact could begin previsit because correctional staff can use restrictions on visitation privileges as a behavior management tool (Fla. Admin. Code R 33-601.731, 33-602.222). The promise of visits could be an especially useful tool because incentives and disincentives work best when they are linked to inmates’ normative commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427812449470">Bottoms 1999</xref>). From a deprivation perspective, the thought of impending visits could reduce deprivation-induced misconduct by distracting inmates from their current conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427812449470">Toch and Adams 1989</xref>). From a control perspective, if inmates value face-to-face contact with their significant others, then they should be reluctant to risk losing it by committing disciplinary infractions. It thus is possible that any beneficial effects of visitation emerge before the visitor arrives. Accordingly, studies are needed that can assess this possibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022427812449470">
<title>Visitation Effects: Which Visits, Which Infractions, and When?</title>
<p>Although past work has not systematically examined contingencies in the visit-misconduct relationship, it does suggest that this relationship could vary by factors such as the identity of the visitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>), the type of outcome examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427812449470">Steiner and Wooldredge 2009</xref>), and the intensity or frequency of inmate-other contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812449470">Holt and Miller 1972</xref>). Examinations of these contingencies could provide important information for staff wishing to use visits as a behavior management tool, as well as checks on the robustness of visits’ effects. Furthermore, as described above, in-prison experiences like visits could affect misconduct either by changing inmates’ experiences of the pains of imprisonment or by changing their commitments to conventional social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>). In some instances, these two theoretical perspectives lead to different predictions about variation in visitation effects, so examinations of this variation could have theoretical implications as well. Below, we examine the following specific ways in which visitation effects may vary.</p>
<sec id="section6-0022427812449470">
<title>Effects of Different Visitors</title>
<p>If visitors affect misconduct by providing an escape from or a reminder of the burdens of imprisonment, then any close associate may do. A finding that even visits from distant relatives and friends change the risk of infractions could indicate that visitors’ main impact is on inmates’ general feelings of isolation and deprivation. In contrast, if visits affect misconduct by altering inmates’ bonds, then visits from closer kin such as spouses, who are most central to theories of informal social control, could have the greatest impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>). Inmates do express more concern about immediate family than they do about other relatives and friends (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812449470">Uggen et al. 2004</xref>). A finding that closer relatives have greater effects on infractions could indicate that visits work by changing inmates’ ties to conventional social institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022427812449470">
<title>Effects on Different Infractions</title>
<p>Visitation could differentially predict different types of infractions. Inmates tend not to specialize in specific types of infractions, and any rule violation can be interpreted as a sign of rebellion against the conditions of imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427812449470">Toch and Adams 1989</xref>). Accordingly, generalized effects of visits could indicate that visits affect misconduct by altering inmates’ exposure to or perceptions of the deprivations of imprisonment. Social control theory has been used to explain a similarly wide range of deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427812449470">Horney et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427812449470">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). That said, under this theory people conform because deviance disappoints and alienates significant others, so visits may affect only infractions that inmates believe are likely to disappoint or alienate visitors. Although visitors might well disapprove of criminal acts that occur in prison, they may not be as likely to disapprove of noncriminal acts that nonetheless constitute infractions (e.g., a failure to follow particular rules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427812449470">Camp and Gaes 2005</xref>). Visits thus could have weaker effects on minor infractions than they do on serious infractions. Finally, visitors could facilitate misconduct by bringing inmates illegal items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427812449470">Petersilia 2003</xref>), which also could create infraction-specific (i.e., contraband) effects of visits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022427812449470">
<title>Effects by Frequency of Visitation</title>
<p>The effects of individual visits also could vary by their overall regularity. Theory and research suggest that chronic strain has the greatest effects on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427812449470">Agnew 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427812449470">Slocum, Simpson, and Smith 2005</xref>). Infrequent or irregularly spaced visits may not provide enough support, relief, or diversion to reduce deprivation and thus misconduct, especially if part of the reduction stems from the expectation or anticipation of visits. Similarly, for visits to reduce misconduct by increasing informal controls, they would need to occur often enough to allow the gradual development of bonds and to prevent prisonization (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>). However, once developed, social control should not cease to constrain inmate behavior at the end of visiting hours, when feelings of deprivation may reemerge. Less variation in individual visits’ effects by overall visit frequency could reflect lasting effects of visits on inmates’ conventional attachments and commitments.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>In this study, we examine the effects of prison visits on inmates’ disciplinary infractions. We go beyond past studies by using data from a large statewide sample of inmates, by using a strong within-person design to rule out an entire class of potential confounds, and by examining both the direction and the timing of visits’ effects. A central contribution of the study is the examination of potential anticipatory effects of visits. Finally, our large sample and detailed measures of visits and infractions allow us to test whether visits’ effects on infractions vary depending on the visitor, the type of infraction being examined, or the frequency with which inmates are visited. These contingency analyses address the robustness of any visitation effects and can help narrow the list of potential mechanisms that account for those effects.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0022427812449470">
<title>Data</title>
<p>We use data from the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) Offender-Based Information System (OBIS), a department-wide database used to track and manage correctional inmates from intake to release. The database features inmate-level information, including inmates’ demographic characteristics, criminal histories, and current offenses, and event-level information, including the dates and types of individual inmates’ disciplinary infractions. Between November 1, 2000 and April 30, 2002, the FDOC also recorded the dates of personal visits and inmates’ relationships to their visitors. Our sample is all inmates admitted and visited between those dates, with two caveats. First, because the visitor approval process takes about 1 month, we excluded inmates who served less than 4 weeks. This delay is partly because visitors must undergo criminal history background checks before they are approved (Fla. Admin. Code 33-601.715). Second, because some of our questions involve the spacing of visits, we excluded inmates who received only one visit during the data collection window.</p>
<p>We created an inmate-week file containing one row for each week that each inmate was incarcerated during the study window.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427812449470">1</xref></sup> This data structure is ideal for detailed investigations of the timing of behavioral effects of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812449470">Osgood 2010</xref>). To account for the visitor approval process, we excluded the first 4 weeks of each inmate’s stay. Our resulting sample size is 339,180 observations on 7,787 inmates.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section13-0022427812449470">
<title>Disciplinary infractions</title>
<p>Using the event dates recorded in the OBIS, we created a dichotomous indicator of whether or not each inmate committed a <italic>disciplinary infraction</italic> during each week. In some models, we examine separately different types of infractions. Using event dates and details from the OBIS, we created dichotomous indicators of whether during each week each inmate committed a <italic>violent infraction</italic> (e.g., fighting, assault), a <italic>defiance infraction</italic> (e.g., disobeying orders, disrespecting officials), a <italic>contraband</italic>
<italic>infraction</italic> (e.g., possession of contraband or drugs), or a <italic>supervision</italic>
<italic>infraction</italic> (e.g., unauthorized absence, being in an unauthorized area). These five indicators are our dependent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022427812449470">
<title>Visits</title>
<p>The OBIS event dates indicate whether or not inmates received visits during each week. In most models we examine the impact of being <italic>visited</italic> by anyone. In some models, we examine separately the impact of being <italic>visited by a spouse</italic>, <italic>visited by a romantic partner</italic>, <italic>visited by a parent</italic>, <italic>visited by another relative</italic>, or <italic>visited by a friend</italic>. We examine spousal and partner visits separately because different types of romantic partners have different effects on offending outside of prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427812449470">Siennick and Osgood 2008</xref>). As in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo and Bakken 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>), visits from children were very rare; only 180 inmates received them. Although we include children’s visits in our global visitation measure, we could not examine them separately.</p>
<p>We wish to examine within-individual changes in infractions at various time points in relation to visits. To this end, we measure visits as sets of dummy variables rather than as single dichotomous indicators. The variable “visited this week” equals 1 if a visit occurred during that inmate-week and 0 if no visit occurred during that inmate-week. We also created indicators flagging each of the 6 weeks leading up to a visit and each of the 6 weeks after a visit. The variables “<italic>x</italic> weeks to visit” and “<italic>x</italic> weeks since visit,” where <italic>x</italic> = one to six, equal 0 unless the inmate-week in question is <italic>x</italic> weeks before or after a visit, in which case they equal 1. For example, if an inmate was visited during the10th week that we observed him or her, then that inmate scores 1 on the “visited this week” variable for that inmate-week, 1 on the “1week to visit” variable for his or her ninth inmate-week, 1 on the “2 weeks to visit” variable for his or her eighth inmate-week, and so on. Visitation variables equal 0 for inmate-weeks not falling within 6 weeks of a visit. Each model thus includes 13 predictors representing visits: six indicating whether or not this inmate-week preceded a visit by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks, respectively, one indicating whether or not a visit occurred during this inmate-week, and six indicating whether or not this inmate-week followed a visit by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks, respectively. The reference category is weeks outside of this visitation window. The coefficients for these variables thus represent the difference between the log-odds of an infraction during specific weeks surrounding visits and the log-odds of an infraction during other weeks.</p>
<p>Twenty-four percent of visits occurred within 6 weeks of another visit. Some inmate-weeks surrounding those visits thus score 1 on both previsit and postvisit indicators. The previsit and postvisit trends in infractions could differ for these visits. We created a set of 12 dichotomous variables indicating whether each of the 12 weeks preceding and following each visit <italic>overlapped</italic> with the previsit or postvisit window of another visit. Notably, each inmate in our sample had at least one nonoverlapping visitation window.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022427812449470">
<title>Time-varying control variables</title>
<p>In our research design, potential confounds are external factors that change over time and that could be associated with changes in visits and with changes in infractions. We control for <italic>week of incarceration</italic> and for a dichotomous indicator of whether a federal holiday took place during this inmate-week (<italic>holiday week</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022427812449470">
<title>Inmate characteristics</title>
<p>Although time-stable characteristics cannot explain within-inmate behavior change, they could affect our intercepts and our estimates of the effects of average visit spacing. Individual visits may have different effects for inmates who are visited more (or less) frequently. We calculated each inmate’s average number of weeks between visits. We then created two dichotomous inmate-level indicators of <italic>visit spacing</italic>; one indicates whether an inmate scored in the bottom quartile of the average spacing measure, and the other indicates whether the inmate scored in the top quartile of this measure. At the inmate level, we also control for each inmate’s <italic>age</italic> at admission, <italic>male</italic> gender, <italic>race and ethnicity</italic>, <italic>sentence</italic>
<italic>length</italic> (in months), <italic>number of current counts</italic>, and <italic>number of prior convictions</italic>.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812449470">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics for the study variables. Inmates received an average of 11 visits during the study window, and 42 percent committed at least one disciplinary infraction. They were mostly male (89 percent), mostly between 21 and 39 years old (mean = 30), and of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds (50 percent were Hispanic or Black). Most were sentenced to between 1 and 14 years in prison (mean = 5½ years).</p>

<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>We estimate two-level random effects logistic regression models using the statistical software package HLM 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427812449470">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>). These models predict disciplinary infractions from the sets of dummy variables representing the occurrence of a visit, upcoming visits, and visits in the recent past, and from the control variables. Our longitudinal design allows us not only to examine the timing of visitation effects but also to rule out all time-stable selection factors by comparing individuals to themselves under different conditions. We do this by adding individuals’ means on the inmate-week-level visitation predictors as additional inmate-level explanatory variables. These means act as control variables, leaving the coefficients for the inmate-week-level variables to be determined only by within-individual change in those variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812449470">Osgood 2010</xref>). This corresponds to a fixed-effects analysis within people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427812449470">Allison 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812449470">Halaby 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427812449470">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>). We similarly preserve the meaning of our week of incarceration variable by controlling for its average at the inmate level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812449470">Osgood 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We measure visitation using sets of dummy variables, so we present results from multiparameter Wald tests of the joint significance of groups of visitation indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427812449470">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>). All of our models include terms for residual variation in individual intercepts, to allow for stable individual differences in infractions. We control for week of incarceration to help rule out maturation as a threat to validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812449470">Osgood 2010</xref>). Except for the visit spacing variables (which appear only in one model), we grand mean centered all inmate-level variables and both inmate-week-level control variables. Our intercepts thus can be interpreted as the log-odds of an infraction during weeks outside of the visitation window for a typical inmate (scoring average on all centered variables).</p>
<p>Our first and main model features our global measures of visitation and infractions. Second, we substitute different outcomes into this model to examine the effects of visitation on different types of infractions. Third, we examine the effects of different types of visitors on our global measure of infractions. The samples for these models are limited to inmates who ever experienced the type of visit being examined. For example, we assess the effects of spousal visits among inmates who were ever visited by spouses. Finally, we examine whether visits have different effects when they occur frequently versus infrequently. We do this by (1) adding to our main model our indicators of overlap between two different visitation windows, and (2) adding to our main model cross-level interactions between our inmate-level visit spacing variables and our inmate-week-level visit variables.</p>

<p>The intercept reveals that the average weekly probability of an infraction outside of the visitation window is .016 (exp[–4.150]/(1 + exp [–4.150]) = .016). The log-odds of an infraction are significantly lower during the 3 weeks immediately preceding a visit (logistic <italic>b</italic> = −0.270, −0.459, and −0.654 for 3, 2, and 1 week prior respectively, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). They are significantly higher during the 4 weeks immediately following a visit (logistic <italic>b</italic> = 0.466, 0.343, 0.245, and 0.323 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks afterward respectively, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Wald tests of the joint significance of coefficients confirm that inmates’ previsit risk of infractions is significantly lower than is their usual risk (χ<sup>2</sup> = 239.44, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and that their postvisit risk is significantly higher than is their usual risk (χ<sup>2</sup> = 135.23, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). An additional Wald contrast confirms that inmates’ postvisit risk of infractions is higher than is their previsit risk (χ<sup>2</sup> = 121.50, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427812449470">Figure 1</xref> illustrates these findings. It shows that the predicted probability of an infraction declines gradually over the 3 weeks leading up to a visit. Just before the visit, it is 48 percent lower than the baseline probability (.008 vs. .016). The probability spikes dramatically the week after the visit, when it is 58 percent higher than baseline (.025 vs. .016). It then declines gradually over the following weeks. By the sixth week after the visit, the probability of an infraction is statistically indistinguishable from the baseline probability (logistic <italic>b</italic> = .029, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<title>Different Infractions, Similar Effects of Visits</title>
<p>Does visitation have similar effects on different types of infractions? We predicted separately each of four types of infractions from the global visitation indicators and the control variables; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812449470">Table 1</xref> for descriptive information about infraction types. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022427812449470">Figure 2</xref> shows the resulting predicted probabilities (regression estimates are not shown but are available upon request). As the differing heights of the lines suggest, the baseline probability of infractions is greatest for defiance (.008), smallest for contraband and supervision infractions (.002 each), and in between for violence (.004). The probability of each type decreases previsit, is lowest the week before the visit, increases sharply the week after the visit, and gradually returns to baseline. The <italic>t</italic> tests for the coefficients reveal that the log-odds of each outcome are significantly lower than average for each of the 3 weeks leading up to a visit and significantly higher than average for each of the 4 weeks after (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with two exceptions: The significant decrease in contraband infractions begins 4 weeks before visits, and the significant increase in violence lasts 5 weeks after.</p>

</fig>
<p>Regarding the magnitude of these effects, contraband infractions show the greatest proportional change in probability surrounding visits, though they are not the most prevalent infractions overall. The probability of such an infraction is 77 percent lower than usual (.001) the week before a visit, and 130 percent higher than usual (.005) the week after a visit. The proportional change in probability is smallest for defiance, the most common infraction type; it is 36 percent lower than average (.005) the week before a visit and 43 percent higher (.011) the week after a visit. The proportional changes in violence (− 67 percent and + 61 percent) and supervision infractions (− 41 percent and + 87 percent) are in between. This indicates that visits alter trends in multiple forms of misconduct in similar ways, though their effects appear strongest for contraband infractions.</p>

<title>Different Visitors, Similar Effects on Infractions</title>
<p>Do visits’ effects depend on who is visiting? In five separate models, we predicted whether inmates committed any disciplinary infraction from indicators of whether they received one of the five types of visitor. Each analysis included only the subset of inmates that had received the type of visit in question; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812449470">Table 1</xref> for descriptive information. These samples thus are smaller than our full sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427812449470">2</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022427812449470">Figure 3</xref> suggests, they also have varying base rates of infractions (e.g., inmates who were ever visited by spouses had the lowest overall rate of misconduct).</p>

</fig>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022427812449470">Figure 3</xref> shows the resulting predicted probabilities of an infraction before and after each type of visit (regression estimates are not shown, but are available upon request). Visits from all five significant others appear to decrease the probability of an infraction in the weeks before the visit and increase it the week following the visit. Ten Wald tests of the joint significance of coefficients confirm that before each type of visit inmates’ risk of infractions is significantly lower than their usual risk and that after each type of visit their risk is significantly higher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427812449470">3</xref></sup> The magnitudes of the different visitors’ previsit effects appear comparable: Friends produce the smallest proportional decrease (− 38 percent, from .016 outside of the visitation window to .010 the week prior to the visit) and relatives produce the largest (− 53 percent, from .012 to .006). The magnitudes of the postvisit increases vary more: Friends again produce the smallest change (a + 26 percent increase in probability, to .020) and relatives produce the second largest change (+ 54 percent, to .019). Spouses appear to have the largest postvisit effect. Among inmates ever visited by spouses, the probability of an infraction is 135 percent higher the week after a spousal visit (.018) than it is during an average week (.008). Interestingly, the probability does not gradually decline after a spousal visit as it does following other types of visits, but instead increases again 4 weeks out. Spouses are not the most common visitors, but when they do visit they visit especially frequently. We next examined interactions between visitation and the frequency of visits in predicting infractions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0022427812449470">
<title>Effects of Visits Depend on Their Frequency</title>
<p>Do the effects of individual visits depend on their spacing? We added to our main model our overlap indicators indicating whether each inmate-week was simultaneously within 6 weeks of two different visits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427812449470">4</xref></sup> The indicators were jointly significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 20.94, <italic>df</italic>= 11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; full results are available upon request). Predicted values indicated that the substantive effect of this overlap is to hasten the postvisit decline in infractions. For example, when two visits occur 4 weeks apart the probability of an infraction spikes dramatically the week after the first visit but resembles the baseline probability the second and third weeks after the first visit.</p>
<p>What happens when inmates accustomed to frequent visits experience longer lags between visits? We added to our main model inmate-level indicators of whether inmates were visited relatively frequently (i.e., their average visit spacing was in the bottom 25 percent) or relatively infrequently (i.e., their average visit spacing was in the top 25 percent) and interactions between these indicators and the inmate-week-level visitation indicators. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427812449470">Table 3</xref> shows the results. The “main effect” of frequent visitation indicates that frequently visited inmates have a lower baseline risk of infractions than do inmates with typical visit spacing (logistic <italic>b</italic> = −.187, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<p>Inmates in the frequently visited group have a typical visit spacing of less than 4 weeks, and their previsit trend is significantly different from the trend of inmates with average visit spacing (χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.35, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). When they do go more than 4 weeks without a visit, their log-odds of infractions are significantly higher 5 and 4 weeks prior to a visit (logistic <italic>b</italic> = .329, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and logistic <italic>b</italic> = .434, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 for interactions of frequent visitation with 5- and 4-week indicators, respectively). Their gradual decline in infractions does not catch up with the decline for the average group until the week just before the visit (logistic <italic>b</italic> = .165, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Frequently visited inmates’ postvisit trend also differs from the average group’s (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.03, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). They show the same initial increase, but their gradual decline is interrupted by a second increase 5 weeks after the visit (for interaction term, logistic <italic>b</italic> = .603, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>The previsit trend in infractions for infrequently visited inmates is indistinguishable from the trend for the average visit spacing group (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.37, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), but their postvisit trends differ (χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.00, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). After a visit, they alternate between their baseline log-odds of infractions and elevated log-odds, but show no gradual decline. Taken together, these results suggest that in general, infractions decline before visits and increase after visits no matter what the visits’ frequency. However, closely spaced visits are associated with faster postvisit declines, inmates accustomed to frequent visits show an increase but no gradual decline after experiencing less frequent visits, and inmates who are visited infrequently also show an increase but no orderly and gradual decline over the weeks following visits.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies of inmate-family contact and of families’ roles in reentry suggest that many inmates’ significant others are willing to help and support them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427812449470">Visher and Travis 2003</xref>). Prison visitation programs seek to capitalize on inmates’ existing social relationships to reduce prison misconduct and help inmates prepare for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427812449470">Maruna and Toch 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427812449470">Tewksbury and DeMichele 2005</xref>). We found that visits’ effects on inmate misconduct are more complex than many authors have anticipated. Among our large, statewide sample of visited inmates, the risk of a disciplinary infraction gradually declined in the weeks leading up to a visit. However, the risk of infractions increased dramatically the week after a visit, and then gradually returned to normal. These countervailing effects would be masked in cross-sectional studies and could explain the mixed findings of past studies on this topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427812449470">Ellis et al. 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427812449470">Jiang and Winfree 2006</xref>), which have not examined the timing of visits’ effects.</p>
<p>Our findings counter predictions that the support and diversion provided by visitors will necessarily reduce inmates’ feelings of deprivation and in turn their misconduct. Visits may well serve those functions, but they may not have the lasting effects needed to produce sustained improvements in behavior. If impending visits reduce misconduct by alleviating feelings of loss and isolation, those feelings appear to return—perhaps even more acutely—when visits end and inmates are again isolated and deprived of contact with loved ones. This contradicts the idea that a porous prison means an easier sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812449470">Adams 1992</xref>). Importantly, with time, inmates appear to recover from visitors’ departures, perhaps because they settle back into prison routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812449470">Ross and Richards 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We could not examine the mechanisms behind visits’ effects, but our results provide suggestive evidence. Visitors of all relations produced similar effects, and visits affected risk for a wide range of infractions. The generalized previsit decline in infractions suggests that inmates anticipate visits and are reluctant to jeopardize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427812449470">Toch and Adams 1989</xref>). The generalized postvisit increase is consistent with a reaction to the pains of incarceration and rebellion against the corrections staff who impose those pains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427812449470">Blevins et al. 2010</xref>). Finally, we suspect that any harmful effects stem from the separation itself, because more closely spaced visits accelerate the postvisit decline in risk. Still, social control could play a role, as it does in relationships’ effects on crime outside of prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427812449470">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). For example, it is possible that the effects of social control depend more on significant others’ physical presence than scholars might expect; consistent with this, we find larger postvisit increases after visits from spouses, the most central agents of informal social control.</p>
<p>Corrections staff may wish to maintain previsit declines in infractions, or to at least minimize postvisit increases. One solution could be modifying existing visitation programs to make visits more frequent and regular, because frequent and regular visits appear to temper the postvisit increase in misconduct. Weekly or biweekly visits, for example, might sustain the previsit decrease and limit the potential for a subsequent increase. Changes from typical visit spacing for frequently visited inmates appear problematic, so efforts to maintain routine visiting schedules for individual inmates might help. Also, other prison programs might buffer against negative effects of visitation. For example, education and other “normalizing” programs can provide similar diversions and productive uses of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>). Involving inmates in such programs in the weeks immediately following visits might prevent negative postvisit reactions.</p>
<p>This study has limitations. Like most past studies on this topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427812449470">Clark 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427812449470">Ellis et al. 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812449470">Holt and Miller 1972</xref>), ours uses data from a limited geographic area, we could not test the mechanisms behind visits’ effects, and our measure of infractions comes from prison records, which could partly reflect staff detection and discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427812449470">Hewitt, Poole, and Regoli 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427812449470">Light 1990</xref>). We doubt that measurement bias could fully explain our findings, because staff probably do not systematically reduce their monitoring and recording of infractions in the weeks leading up to visits, but this remains a limitation nonetheless. Finally, although we use a within-person design, other prison experiences and conditions could covary from week to week with both infractions and visitation, and thus could confound our results. Past work says little about the time-varying correlates of visitation and thus about what the relevant confounds might be, but this issue deserves further study.</p>
<p>We suggest several directions for future research. First, scholars should attempt to replicate and expand on our results. Especially useful would be studies examining different populations, different measures of visitation and misconduct, and more potential time-varying confounds. Because past studies yield mixed evidence regarding children’s visits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427812449470">Jiang and Winfree 2006</xref>), scholars should examine whether our findings hold for those visits. In addition, inmates who commit any one type of infraction are likely to commit others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427812449470">Toch and Adams 1989</xref>), so scholars could examine visits’ effects on infraction diversity. For example, contraband increased most following visits and could influence inmates’ involvement in other infractions and in the larger inmate power structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427812449470">5</xref></sup> We also encourage self-report studies of visits and misconduct, both for replication purposes and because self-report surveys could collect information about subjective aspects of inmates’ social ties.</p>
<p>Second, scholars should examine the mechanisms behind visitation effects. Here, too, self-report studies would be useful, although creative uses of official data could be informative. For example, lawyers’ and other officials’ visits would also provide a diversion from prison life, so it would be interesting to know whether they produce the same change in infractions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427812449470">6</xref></sup> Third, we need more research on the conditions under which visits might produce lasting behavioral gains. This could include experimental or quasi-experimental studies of visits’ spacing and frequency. It also could include examinations of the joint effects of visitation and other programs, for example counseling programs or programs related to education and other conventional institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812449470">Harer 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, although most studies of inmates’ relationships focus on spouses and offspring (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812449470">Comfort 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427812449470">Fishman 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427812449470">Jiang and Winfree 2006</xref>), and spouses’ departures appear especially difficult for inmates, most inmates are unmarried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427812449470">Mumola 2000</xref>) and children’s visits are relatively uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427812449470">Casey-Acevedo and Bakken 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812449470">Owen 1998</xref>). Our inmates’ most common visitors were their parents (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427812449470">Tewksbury and DeMichele 2005</xref>), who had similar effects on infractions yet are less often studied. We encourage researchers to broaden examinations of inmates’ social networks to include not only partners and children, but also extended families and other significant others.</p>
<p>In closing, we repeat other scholars’ calls for more research on how in-prison events affect offender adjustment and, more broadly, prison order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427812449470">Bottoms 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427812449470">Nagin et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427812449470">Visher and Travis 2003</xref>). Prison visits help inmates maintain their relationships until their release, when they will be even more dependent on relatives and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812449470">Bales and Mears 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427812449470">Visher et al. 2004</xref>). Still, despite the potential long-term benefits of visits, they remain intense events that take place under constrained and unnatural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427812449470">Arditti 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812449470">Comfort 2008</xref>). Our findings on the timing of visits’ effects may help corrections personnel improve visitation programs and better anticipate and manage inmate misconduct. Given the apparent benefits of visits for inmates’ postrelease lives, it is worth understanding when, how, and for whom they will have effects.</p>

<p>We chose person-weeks as our unit of analysis for two main reasons. First, exploratory analyses revealed week-to-week changes in infractions surrounding visits. Second, although wardens can make individual exceptions, visiting hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each Saturday, Sunday, and federal holiday so visits are highly concentrated on weekends. Barring overcrowding of the visiting area, visitors may stay for the entire duration of visiting hours. There are no limitations on the frequency of visits, but no more than 15 people may be on an inmate’s approved list of visitors. Some contact is ordinarily allowed (e.g., brief hugs and kisses) but conjugal visits are not.</p>
