<title>Objective</title>
<p>Vestibular function tests are often undertaken before cochlear implantation, in part to help select the side of surgery.

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>The records of 177 adult recipients of a unilateral cochlear implant were reviewed retrospectively in 2 groups. Group A included patients with an implant in the ear with worse or similar caloric responses. Group B included patients with an implant in the ear with the stronger caloric response. All patients underwent preoperative bithermal caloric testing: a clinically significant difference was defined by a 20% lateral canal paresis. They were assessed postoperatively by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and supplementary questions.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599812442059">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifty-seven percent of both groups reported dizziness in the first 7 days postoperatively. At 2 months, 20% of group A and 34% of group B experienced some dizziness. Fourteen percent of group A and 10% of group B felt that cochlear implantation had resulted in impaired balance. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores of 86% of group A (median score 0) and 76% of group B (median score 10) corresponded with low handicap. None of these results differed significantly between groups A and B.</p>

<p>Although cochlear implantation has been accepted as a safe procedure, the insertion of an electrode into the cochlea can have an adverse effect on vestibular receptors, resulting in dizziness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812442059">1</xref></sup> Subjective postoperative dizziness is said to affect between 2% and 47% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442059">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812442059">3</xref></sup> Patients usually recover from these symptoms, but this may be slow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442059">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electrode insertion results in anatomic and physiologic changes in the saccule, utricle, and the semicircular canals, which lead to documented impairment of the peripheral vestibular system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812442059">5</xref></sup> and increased dizziness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812442059">6</xref></sup> The exact mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been described, but several theories exist. The lateral wall and the fluid space are breeched during the cochleostomy. The introduction of the electrode array may damage the basilar membrane, produce perilymph leakage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812442059">7</xref></sup> and alter the pressure in the inner ear. Despite this, electrode placement alone is not thought to be the only factor responsible for postoperative dizziness, as in many cases, the onset of dizziness is delayed, suggestive of secondary changes in vestibular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442059">4</xref></sup> When patient and surgical factors were examined, there was no significant relationship between extent of intracochlear drilling, etiology of hearing loss, type of implant used, depth of electrode insertion, scala of placement, and postoperative dizziness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812442059">8</xref></sup> Pathological studies examining temporal bones from those who have had cochlear implants would suggest a high frequency of cochlear hydrops and saccule collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812442059">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In patients undergoing unilateral cochlear implantation, the selection of side will depend on a number of factors such as duration of deafness, degree of hearing loss, and anatomy. Vestibular function may also influence the decision. To reduce the risk of dizziness, we implant the side with the worse vestibular function where possible, other factors being equal. A combination of vestibular function tests is routinely carried out preoperatively in some cochlear implant centers as an aid to determine the optimal side for implantation. The current literature surrounding cochlear implantation and vestibular function remains inconclusive, with some studies suggesting that unilateral cochlear implantation does not result in significant adverse affects on the vestibular system, whereas other studies report vestibular dysfunction in 74% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812442059">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812442059">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many studies have used a variety of vestibular laboratory and clinical tests both pre- and postoperatively to assess vestibular function. Although laboratory and clinical tests yield objective data, this may not necessarily correlate with patients’ experiences. Some studies also have used the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and study-specific questionnaires to assess dizziness from the patients’ perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812442059">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812442059">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812442059"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812442059">11</xref></sup> There is little if any relationship between the measured postoperative decrease in peripheral vestibular function and patients’ perception of dizziness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812442059">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812442059">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we document our patients’ perceptions of dizziness after cochlear implantation using the DHI and our own questionnaire. In doing so, we aim to determine whether cochlear implantation in the ear with better vestibular function results in more severe perception of dizziness than implanting the ear with equal or worse vestibular function.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812442059" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was retrospectively undertaken at the West of England Cochlear Implant Programme (Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK). This is a tertiary center that provides cochlear implantation for the southwest of England. The records of all adults receiving unilateral cochlear implants between 1997 and 2009 were examined by 2 specialist registrars in otolaryngology.</p>
<p>All patients underwent routine neurotologic examination, including the Romberg, Unterberger, and Dix-Hallpike tests and the Halmagyi head thrust. Preoperative pure-tone audiometry and auditory brainstem responses were recorded in all patients. Prior to caloric testing, patients were asked to discontinue any vestibular suppressants for at least 48 hours. Otoscopic examination was undertaken to confirm that all ears were wax free. Tympanometry (Welch Allyn GSI-33 Middle Ear Analyzer; Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York) confirmed that tympanic membranes were intact and not hypermobile (compliance ≤1.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Patients with dysconjugate eye movements, history of recent ear or eye surgery, or other contraindications to caloric testing (eg, epilepsy) were excluded from the videonystagmography (VNG) and caloric testing.</p>
<p>All patients underwent a standard test battery. Tests were performed in this order: spontaneous/gaze-evoked nystagmus, smooth pursuit tracking, random saccades, and bithermal caloric irrigation with water. Eye movements were recorded using the ICS-ChartR system (4-channel) and ICS-480 water caloric irrigator (both GN Otometrics, Oxon, UK) in dim lighting conditions. Additional tests (eg, neck positional testing) were performed on some patients if deemed appropriate from the patient history but were not analyzed for the purposes of this study. Caloric test parameters and order of irrigations were in accordance with the British Society of Audiology Recommended Procedure (BSA, 2010). A cover over the VNG goggles during irrigation prevented visual suppression of vestibular responses. Patients were instructed to keep their eyes open throughout recording, and mental alerting was encouraged immediately after each cessation of irrigation. After irrigation with warm water, the ears were otoscopically examined for a “flush” sign to confirm that irrigation had adequately stimulated the tympanic membrane.</p>
<p>Each caloric response was measured in terms of the maximum slow-phase velocity (SPV) of the nystagmus in degrees per second (°s<sup>−1</sup>). For each patient, canal paresis (CP; %) was calculated from all 4 irrigations (ie, warm and cool water for each ear), using the summary statistic by Jongkees et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812442059">12</xref></sup>:</p>

<p>where WR is warm stimulus in the right ear, WL is warm stimulus in the left ear, CR is cool stimulus in the right ear, and CL is cool stimulus in the left ear.</p>
<p>In accordance with the BSA Recommended Procedure, no arithmetic correction was made for spontaneous nystagmus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812442059">13</xref></sup> A canal paresis of 20% or more was interpreted as clinically significant.</p>
<p>From these results, the patients were classified into 2 groups. Group A consisted of those patients in whom there was no significant difference in vestibular function or in whom the ear with worse function was implanted. Group B consisted of patients in whom the ear with better vestibular function was implanted.</p>
<p>To compare these groups’ perception of dizziness, we used 2 questionnaires. All patients were asked to fill in the questionnaires in their own homes without any intervention from their family or any clinician. The completed questionnaires were returned in a prepaid addressed envelope. The first questionnaire was the DHI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812442059">14</xref></sup> The DHI, used to evaluate self- perceived handicap due to dizziness, consists of 25 questions, which are grouped into domains that look at the emotional, functional, and physical aspects of dizziness. The answers provided generated a score between 0 and 100—the higher the score, the worse the perceived handicap. These scores were subdivided into mild (0-39), moderate (40-69), and severe (70-100). This helped to categorize the patient’s level of functional impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812442059">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second questionnaire was developed in house to assess the duration of symptoms after surgery. This questionnaire was not previously validated but consisted of 4 simple questions related to the duration and severity of dizziness after cochlear implantation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812442059"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Dizziness Handicap Inventory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812442059"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> shows that postoperative DHI scores were generally low in both groups and were not significantly different, either clinically or statistically. Eighty-six percent of the DHI scores for group A and 76% for group B fell into the category of mild symptoms (DHI 0-39). The difference between the numbers of patients in each group falling into the mild category was not significant (χ<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>P</italic> = .45). No correlation between age and DHI score was found in our patient sample. Spearman rank correlation was 0 (95% confidence interval [CI], –0.19 to 0.18; <italic>P</italic> = .98).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study adds to the evidence base presented by other authors suggesting that cochlear implantation of the ear with better vestibular function does not result in increased dizziness compared with implanting the ear with poor vestibular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812442059">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812442059">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In total, we had 111 replies to our questionnaire, which represents a sizable patient cohort. The DHI was used as it is a well-recognized, standardized, reliable, and validated measure of patients’ perceptions of dizziness and how it affects their lifestyle. We added 4 questions specifically pertaining to the duration of dizziness in relation to cochlear implantation rather than just vertigo. These questions were not tested for reliability or validity.</p>
<p>The key results of this study are that there appears to be no significant difference in the incidence of short- or long-term dizziness or in the DHI between our 2 groups of patients. The DHI scores from both groups indicated that the majority of patients experienced a low level of handicap representing mild symptoms after implantation, which was not clinically significant. By this we mean patients from the 2 groups did not have a level of functional disability from their dizziness that would affect their lifestyle. In other words, implanting the ear with better vestibular function does not appear to result in more severe dizziness.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown a correlation between the age of the patient and his or her DHI scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812442059">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812442059">16</xref></sup>; no such correlation was found in our cohort. Curthoys et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812442059">16</xref></sup> suggest that the reason for this may be because older patients may take longer to recover because of delayed central compensation. It is not clear why our study did not demonstrate this. It may reflect differences in surgical techniques, which were not specifically examined by our study. It is perhaps most likely to result from the generally low DHI scores. As very few patients had severe dizziness, a larger study of greater power would be required to demonstrate any such correlation.</p>
<p>A significant minority of both groups A and B experienced preoperative dizziness, but there was no difference between the 2 groups. It seems likely that many patients with cochlear dysfunction also have vestibular dysfunction, although the exact cause is often unknown. In 1 study, 53% of patients had preoperative vertigo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812442059">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has not directly addressed the issue of delayed-onset dizziness, which has been documented in up to 40% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812442059">18</xref></sup> The cause of such dizziness is often unknown, but up to 2% develop benign positional paroxysmal vertigo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812442059">19</xref></sup> Such dizziness is usually self-limiting and occurs within the first few months, which is well within the follow-up period of this study.</p>
<p>Because persistent or severe dizziness is rare regardless of preoperative caloric function, it appears that caloric testing cannot be used to predict which patients are likely to have severe symptoms or require postoperative balance therapy.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that this is a retrospective study that has inherent limitations. We were not able to obtain preoperative DHI results, which would allow for matched comparisons. We also did not obtain postprocedure caloric testing, which would allow for further matched comparisons, because it was not part of our routine practice and the test is unpleasant for many patients. Ideally, we would have liked to compare the DHI and caloric tests preprocedure, postprocedure, and after implant switch-on. In addition to the DHI, we chose to use supplementary questions that were not validated. Future studies could use the Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812442059">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a significant risk of recall bias given the variable time between surgery and assessment. There is also the risk that those patients who suffer from dizziness are more likely to have replied to the survey.</p>
<p>Lateral canal paresis calculated from bithermal caloric testing was used as a marker of vestibular function in our study as it is the most widely available and accepted method for assessing vestibular function. This means that the function of the utricle, saccule, and other semicircular canals was not tested. In addition, caloric testing may not entirely reflect the physiological function of the lateral canal as it mimics only low-frequency stimulation. Future studies could include other methods of vestibular investigation such as vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, magnetic scleral coil testing, rotatory chair, and force platform posturography. The study did not control for differences in surgical technique, nor was the selection of side randomized. The distribution of DHI scores does raise the possibility that the number of patients with moderate or severe handicap might be slightly higher in group B, but our patient cohort was not large enough to demonstrate that. This does not change the fact that the vast majority of patients in both groups had little or mild dizziness.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations of the study, it is clear that although dizziness is common, it is usually short-lived and mild after cochlear implantation. The underlying reasons for this are not clear; one could speculate that cochlear implantation is not as traumatic to the vestibular system as initially thought or that central compensation occurs quite quickly. In those with more persistent dizziness, this does not appear to be any worse or significantly more frequent if the ear with better vestibular function has been implanted. Some studies have even shown improvement in both balance function and postural stability following cochlear implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812442059">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812442059">21</xref></sup> We suggest that caloric testing is of limited value in the selection of side for unilateral cochlear implantation.</p>
