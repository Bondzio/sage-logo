<abstract>
<p>Social-class discrimination is evident in many societies around the world, but little is known about its impact on the poor or its role as an explanatory variable in the link between socioeconomic status and health. The current study tested the extent to which perceived discrimination explains socioeconomic gradients in physical health. Participants were 252 adolescents (51% male, 49% female; mean age = 17.51 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03 years) who participated in Wave 3 of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the developmental consequences of rural poverty. Physical health was operationalized as allostatic load, a measure of cumulative wear and tear on the body caused by overactivation of physiological systems that respond to stress. Mediation analyses suggested that 13% of the effect of poverty on allostatic load is explained by perceived discrimination. The findings suggest that social-class discrimination is one important mechanism behind the influence of poverty on physical health.</p>

<body>
<p>Research has consistently demonstrated an inverse association between income and mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612439720">Adler &amp; Rehkopf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612439720">Matthews &amp; Gallo, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, childhood poverty is linked to a range of subsequent physical-health outcomes, including cardiovascular and neuroendocrine markers of physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612439720">Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, Chen, &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>; Evans, Miller, Chen, &amp; Seeman, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612439720">Shonkoff, Boyce, &amp; McEwen, 2009</xref>). Despite widespread negative feelings toward the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612439720">Fiske, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612439720">Lott, 2002</xref>) and long-standing social-class divisions around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612439720">Rank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612439720">Sennett &amp; Cobb, 1993</xref>), surprisingly little research in the social and behavioral sciences has considered the influence of social-class discrimination on health. This study addressed this gap by examining perceived discrimination as an explanatory variable in the link between poverty and physical health.</p>
<p>One important health outcome in research on the impact of poverty and stress is <italic>allostatic load</italic>. It is defined as the wear and tear on the body resulting from chronic overactivation of physiological systems that maintain the body’s equilibrium in the face of physical or social demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612439720">Ganzel, Morris, &amp; Wethington, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612439720">McEwen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612439720">McEwen &amp; Gianaros, 2010</xref>). Allostatic load combines indicators of health across multiple physiological domains (e.g., cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic) and therefore serves as an indicator of physiological dysregulation prior to the onset of specific clinically relevant disease. Given that many disease states do not become manifest until later in life, allostatic load is a particularly important measure of health among children and adolescents. Poverty and cumulative risk are associated with increases in allostatic load, and this association suggests that chronic environmental stress gets under the skin to create measurable changes in physiological processes that portend eventual morbidity and early mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612439720">Evans &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612439720">Seeman, Epel, Gruenewald, Karlamangla, &amp; McEwen, 2010</xref>). However, little is known about the specific mechanisms linking poverty to health over the life course, and research considering the role of discrimination in this relationship is lacking.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797612439720">
<title>Perceived Discrimination as a Mechanism for the Effects of Poverty</title>
<p>Although a relatively large and growing literature has examined the influence of racial discrimination on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612439720">Fuller-Rowell, Doan, &amp; Eccles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612439720">Mays, Cochran, &amp; Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612439720">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2008</xref>), very little work has focused on the impact of social-class discrimination. In fact, only one study has examined whether perceived discrimination might explain the effects of poverty on the poor: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612439720">Kessler, Mickelson, and Williams (1999)</xref> found that perceived discrimination partially mediated the association between poverty and mental health among adults. Despite pervasive negative treatment of groups with low socioeconomic status (SES) in many societies, and despite substantial research documenting a gradient in health across socioeconomic groups, to our knowledge no studies have considered perceived discrimination as an explanation for SES-related disparities in physical health. The investigation reported here tested the hypothesis that perceived discrimination accounts for part of the link between poverty and physical health.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0956797612439720">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 252 adolescents (51% male, 49% female; mean age = 17.51 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03 years) who participated in Wave 3 of an ongoing longitudinal study of rural poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612439720">Evans &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>). At initial recruitment (mean age = 9.17 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.13 years), approximately half of the sample lived at or below the federal poverty line. The other half had family incomes 2 to 4 times the poverty line, the income level of the majority of American families. In accord with the demographics of the region, 92% of the sample were White.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0956797612439720">
<title>Poverty</title>
<p>Each participant’s family income and household size were assessed at each wave of data collection (ages 9, 13, and 17 years). Family history relating to income and household size was also assessed for each 6-month period of the participant’s life. Proportion of life in poverty from birth through age 17 years was calculated using the U.S. federally defined poverty level for the participant’s household size. Current level of poverty was defined as the income-to-needs ratio (the ratio of family income to the federally defined poverty level for the participant’s household size) at age 17 years. These two indicators of poverty were standardized and averaged such that higher scores indicate higher levels of poverty (α = .77). Proportion of life in poverty and current level of poverty were combined because both were expected to influence exposure to social-class discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612439720">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0956797612439720">
<title>Perceived discrimination</title>
<p>Responses to three items were used to assess discrimination at Wave 3: “People treat me differently because of my background”; “I feel I am excluded from certain activities because of my background”; and “People do not respect me because of who I am” (α = .73). These items drew on existing measures of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612439720">Contrada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612439720">Kessler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612439720">Williams, Yu, Jackson, &amp; Anderson, 1997</xref>) to capture perceptions of differential treatment, exclusion, and lack of respect, respectively. Participants rated the items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Because the reason for negative treatment is often not clear to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612439720">Sue, 2010</xref>), the scale was designed to assess general discriminatory treatment based on participants’ background and did not require that participants attribute this treatment to their social class. This measurement strategy captured substantial variability in discrimination and was in line with our goal of empirically testing the link between poverty and perceived discrimination (rather than asking participants to report only discrimination attributed directly to their socioeconomic background).</p>

<sec id="section7-0956797612439720">
<title>Allostatic load</title>
<p>Allostatic load was calculated by summing the number of physiological parameters (0–6) for which the participant scored in the top quartile of risk. Although the use of a quartile cutoff is arbitrary, additive measures of allostatic load effectively predict morbidity and mortality end points and appear to capture physiological dysregulation across a wide range of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612439720">Juster, McEwen, &amp; Lupien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612439720">Karlamangla, Singer, McEwen, Rowe, &amp; Seeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612439720">Seeman et al., 2010</xref>). The following six parameters were assessed in Wave 3 of the study: resting diastolic and systolic blood pressure; overnight levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol; and body mass index (BMI). Resting blood pressure was measured with six automated readings (Dinamap Model Pro 100, Critikon, Tampa, FL) taken every 2 min while participants sat quietly. Participants provided overnight urine samples (all urine between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.). Epinephrine and norepinephrine were assayed from the urine samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612439720">Riggin &amp; Kissinger, 1977</xref>), and cortisol was measured with a radioimmunoassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612439720">Contreras, Hane, &amp; Tyrrell, 1986</xref>). Creatinine was also assayed to control for differences in body size and incomplete urine voidings. BMI was calculated from anthropometric measurements (kilograms per meter squared).</p>

Correlations among poverty, discrimination, and allostatic load were all significant and in the expected directions. Gender was not significantly correlated with any of the study variables. Non-White race (0 = White; 1 = non-White) was associated with higher levels of poverty (<italic>p =</italic> .014), but was unrelated to perceived discrimination or allostatic load. Given the small number of non-White participants in the study, no effects of race on perceived discrimination or allostatic load were expected. However, because of previous research demonstrating that race, gender, and age have effects on perceived discrimination and allostatic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612439720">Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, &amp; Bound, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612439720">Kessler et al., 1999</xref>), these variables were included as controls in the models described next.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612439720">2</xref></sup>

The significance of the indirect effect of poverty on allostatic load through perceived discrimination was tested using the delta method to compute the standard error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612439720">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). The indirect effect was found to be significant (β = 0.028, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.014, <italic>p =</italic> .049). Thus, the hypothesized links in the mediation model were significant, and a significant portion of the association between poverty and allostatic load was accounted for by perceived discrimination.</p>

<p>Additional analyses were conducted to address the possibility that obesity drove the effects of poverty on perceived discrimination. Findings from these analyses confirmed that poverty was a significant predictor of BMI (<italic>b</italic> = 1.73, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, the effect of BMI on perceived discrimination was not significant, and after controlling for the effects of BMI on perceived discrimination, the effects of poverty on allostatic load remained (<italic>b</italic> = 0.120, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.055, <italic>p</italic> = .030). This finding suggests that the stigma associated with obesity did not drive the effects of poverty on perceived discrimination, as measured in this study. This lack of an effect is not surprising because our measure of perceived discrimination was not designed to capture discrimination based on body weight. We also found that after we partialed out the effects of BMI on allostatic load (<italic>b</italic> = 0.348, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.063, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the effects of perceived discrimination remained significant (<italic>b</italic> = 0.228, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.093, <italic>p</italic> = .014). In light of research on gender differences in the effects of poverty and discrimination on health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612439720">Lahelma, Martikainen, Laaksonen, &amp; Aittomäki, 2004</xref>), we also tested for a moderating influence of gender. Gender was not found to moderate the influence of poverty or discrimination on allostatic load.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Before this study, researchers had not explored discrimination as an explanation for socioeconomic gradients in physical health. This topic is of particular importance given the growing body of research demonstrating clear disparities in health across socioeconomic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612439720">Adler &amp; Rehkopf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612439720">Matthews &amp; Gallo, 2011</xref>). This study begins to address this gap by showing that perceived discrimination accounts for a significant portion of the association between poverty and allostatic load (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612439720">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, the findings suggest that discrimination may be one important mechanism behind SES-related health inequalities.</p>
<p>In addition to the overall mediation results, each of the individual links in our model is noteworthy. First, our findings are consistent with existing research on SES-related gradients in child health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612439720">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612439720">Evans et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612439720">Shonkoff et al., 2009</xref>). Persons growing up in poorer families have more physiological dysregulation, as indicated by higher levels of allostatic load. We have also extended this research by showing these SES-related gradients during adolescence—specifically, at age 17. Second, with respect to the link between poverty and perceived discrimination, our findings are consistent with our methodological perspective that broadly worded measures of discrimination can capture important aspects of social-class discrimination. Furthermore, although poverty is linked to obesity, which has its own stigma, we found that there is also a stigma associated with poverty or social class after the effects of obesity are statistically controlled. Last, the results demonstrate a significant association between perceived discrimination and allostatic load. This finding is consistent with the idea that discrimination can be a chronic social-environment stressor that over time has a detrimental impact on physiological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612439720">Fuller-Rowell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612439720">Mays et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612439720">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the analyses presented here show an important link between perceived discrimination and physical health, testing the specific mechanisms underlying this effect was not within the scope of this investigation. Furthermore, although the role of obesity was explored, other third-variable explanations for the observed associations cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the pathways through which discrimination, in the context of poverty, leads to physical-health outcomes, as well as individual differences in these associations, are important topics for future research. We believe that it will be important for researchers examining these questions to try to account for individuals’ unique emotional and coping responses, as well as for the impact of these responses on mental health and health behavior. Furthermore, another promising direction for research will involve capturing physiological reactivity to social rejection or unfair treatment. Measures of such reactions will enable exploration of specific biological pathways linking discrimination to longer-term health outcomes and may suggest important ways in which early adversity combines with differential social experiences to create SES-related disparities in health.</p>
<p>The issue of why poverty is linked to unfair treatment or perceived discrimination is another important area for future research. We believe that research on how children and adolescents develop an understanding of social class and occupational diversity will help to shed light on the roots of social-class discrimination. For example, the degree to which youth are exposed to messages suggesting that social class is socially determined rather than individually controlled may be one important factor influencing attitudes toward more and less privileged groups.</p>
<p>Some additional limitations of the current study should be noted. First, although this study has several methodological strengths, such as the use of prospective data with objective measures of poverty and physical health, because perceived discrimination and health were measured concurrently, and no experimental manipulation was used, causal attributions are not possible. Also, because the study was conducted on a moderately sized sample of rural adolescents, the findings may not generalize beyond this ecological context or age group. In addition to corroborating the findings longitudinally and across contexts, future research should explicitly examine the potentially unique dynamics of social-class discrimination in specific settings. For example, when there are relatively few low-SES adolescents within a particular school environment, it is conceivable that these individuals stand out more from their peers and that this could make social-class discrimination more severe. If this is the case, then in urban school contexts, where often a majority of students are from low-SES backgrounds, the effects of poverty on physical health may be less influenced by social-class discrimination and instead may be influenced by other detrimental factors associated with concentrated poverty.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that many forms of unfair treatment based on social class or other characteristics will not be recognized or labeled by the victim as discrimination. Furthermore, even when discrimination is recognized or suspected, the reason for the unfair treatment is often unknown. As a result of these attributional complexities, self-report measures of discrimination are likely to capture only a small portion of the actual unfair treatment that occurs, and thus estimates of the link between perceived discrimination and health are likely to be low. Although the methodology used in this study represents one important measurement strategy, it would be useful for researchers to develop additional ways to address methodological challenges inherent in measuring discrimination. For example, considering variability in health at the group level (across social settings that are known to differ on key variables relating to discrimination) may be one promising approach. Another useful perspective may be to consider the health sequelae of specific attributions relating to negative social experiences. For example, does it matter for health whether an individual perceives discrimination based on gender, age, ethnicity, or social class? And what happens when an individual perceives discrimination against him- or herself to be based on two of more of these characteristics?</p>
<p>Overall, the findings of this study show that social-class discrimination may be one mechanism underlying social gradients in health. Given the lack of research on this topic, the findings suggest that social-class discrimination is an important area for future research, and that underlying societal ideologies relating to wealth and social class can be an important locus of intervention.</p>
