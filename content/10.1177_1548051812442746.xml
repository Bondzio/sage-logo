<abstract>
<p>This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs’ founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs’ external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors’ prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Managerial responses to organizational performance decline have received extensive scholarly attention as part of the larger strategic adaptation literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442746">Ketchen &amp; Palmer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442746">McDonald &amp; Westphal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442746">McKinley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1548051812442746">Zammuto &amp; Cameron, 1985</xref>). Often termed <italic>turnaround strategies</italic>, such responses generally range from retrenchment (cost cutting/asset reduction) to strategic reorientation or innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Barr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Duhaime, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442746">Pearce &amp; Robbins, 1993</xref>). With some exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442746">Arogyaswamy, Barker, &amp; Yasai-Ardekani, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812442746">Pajunen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1548051812442746">Rosenblatt, Rogers, &amp; Nord, 1993</xref>), the majority of studies viewed organizational turnaround from the strategic choice perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442746">Child, 1972</xref>), mainly as a rational process in which top managers respond to strategic misalignment and shifting external environmental realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Mone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442746">Lohrke, Bedeian, &amp; Palmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812442746">Stopford &amp; Baden-Fuller, 1990</xref>). More specifically, past work generally focused on (a) identifying the causes of organizational performance decline and (b) formulating and implementing turnaround strategies that fit the source/type of performance decline (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker, Patterson, &amp; Mueller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442746">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442746">Lohrke &amp; Bedeian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051812442746">Schendel &amp; Patton, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>This study contributes to the turnaround literature by improving our understanding of the relationship between executive leadership and corporate turnaround. More specifically, it examines the influence of founder status and the external board appointments on the likelihood of a corporate turnaround. We focused on these two predictors because past turnaround research has not previously examined them, and our current understanding of the managerial characteristics that distinguish turnaround and bankrupt firms does not include these two important issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442746">Lohrke et al., 2004</xref>). In general, we seek to understand how two important managerial characteristics influence both the turnaround process and its outcome in declining firms. First, we investigate whether declining firms that are led by founder-CEOs are more likely to successfully turnaround their performance than those that are led by non-founder-CEOs. We sought to investigate this particular managerial characteristic in part because of the emphasis by the business press (i.e., <italic>Fortune, Business Week, Forbes, Wall Street Journal</italic>, etc.) on some high-profile involvement of prominent CEOs (e.g., Steve Jobs of Apple, Inc., Michael Dell of Dell, Inc.) in their respective companies’ turnaround efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442746">Birger, 2006</xref>). Second, we also seek to empirically examine whether the extensiveness of a declining firm’s CEO external board appointments in other firms significantly increase the likelihood of successful corporate turnaround.</p>
<p>In investigating the above-mentioned two managerial characteristics, we draw extensively from upper echelons/strategic leadership theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812442746">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442746">Hambrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>), resource dependence theory (RDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812442746">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), and the burgeoning literature on board of director interlocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442746">Geletkanycz &amp; Hambrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1548051812442746">Westphal, Seidel, &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1548051812442746">Zajac, 1988</xref>). In the following sections, we will first briefly discuss the existing empirical evidence on the role of top managers in corporate turnaround. Then, we will introduce specific, theory-driven hypotheses on the role of CEO’s founder status and external board appointments in successful corporate turnarounds.</p>

<title>Role of Top Executives in Corporate Turnaround</title>
<p>A significant portion of the scholarly work in turnaround literature has focused on understanding and explaining (a) the antecedents and consequences of organizational decline (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442746">Cameron, Kim, &amp; Whetten, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812442746">Ferrier, Fhionnlaoich, Smith, &amp; Grimm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1548051812442746">Weitzel &amp; Jonsson, 1989</xref>) and (b) active managerial responses to organizational performance decline, often termed as <italic>turnaround strategies</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812442746">D’Aveni, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812442746">Ford &amp; Baucus, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442746">Ketchen &amp; Palmer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442746">Lohrke &amp; Bedeian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442746">McDonald &amp; Westphal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812442746">Mone, McKinley, &amp; Barker, 1998</xref>). Over the past three decades, researchers have extensively explored various types of turnaround strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; Schecter, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442746">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442746">Morrow, Johnson, &amp; Busenitz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442746">Pearce &amp; Robbins, 1993</xref>) along with the role of leadership dynamics in turnaround and non–turnaround firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Barr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442746">Clapham, Schwenk, &amp; Caldwell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812442746">Filatotchev &amp; Toms, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). For example, some scholars have studied, top management team causal attribution during performance decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Barr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Patterson, 1996</xref>), top management team replacement and board characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>), as well as attitudes toward strategic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442746">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>). Other researchers have paid closer attention to structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Mone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442746">Chesley &amp; Huff, 1998</xref>) and strategic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442746">Lohrke &amp; Bedeian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442746">Morrow et al., 2004</xref>) determinants of successful turnarounds.</p>
<p>The overall consensus among turnaround researchers is that top management change is an important component of successful turnaround. Such assertion assumes that the incumbent management during the firm’s performance decline is not always capable of formulating and executing successful turnaround strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442746">Bibeault, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442746">Hofer, 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442746">Bibeault (1982)</xref>, for instance, argued that effective turnaround of a declining firm calls for the replacement of the incumbent managers with new and presumably competent top management team that can make the necessary organizational action with full authority.</p>

<title>Founder-CEOs and the Likelihood of Corporate Turnaround</title>
<p>The role of founder-CEOs in strategic decision making and organizational performance has been a focus of a number of studies in the past. Specifically, researchers have examined the relationship between CEO’s founder status and corporate governance structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442746">Daily &amp; Dalton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442746">He, 2008</xref>), strategic decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442746">Ahn, Chae, Song, &amp; Cho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442746">Fahlenbrach, 2009</xref>), strategic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442746">Fischer &amp; Pollock, 2004</xref>), and firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442746">Adams, Almeida, &amp; Ferreira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812442746">Daily &amp; Dalton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442746">Fahlenbrach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442746">Jayaraman, Khorana, Nelling, &amp; Covin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442746">Ling, Zhao, &amp; Baron, 2007</xref>). A substantial portion of the research evidence is concentrated on the role of founder-CEOs in organizational founding and initial public offering (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442746">Fischer &amp; Pollock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812442746">Jain &amp; Tabak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442746">Nelson, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the literature on founder-CEOs has also emphasized on the role that they play during the transformation of the venture from a start-up stage to a large, established organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812442746">Begley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442746">Ling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1548051812442746">Wasserman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1548051812442746">Willard, Krueger, &amp; Feeser, 1992</xref>). Along with the scholarly attention, the business press has discussed the merits of having a founder-CEO as the leader of business organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442746">Birger, 2006</xref>). For example, Jon Birger of <italic>Fortune Magazine</italic> observed that the average stock return of 26 <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 firms that are led by founder-CEOs were 7% higher than the overall <italic>Fortune</italic> 500’s average return between 1995 and 2005.</p>
<p>In this study, we argue that declining firms that are led by founder-CEOs have a better likelihood of performance turnaround than those declining firms that are led by non-founder-CEOs. There could be a number of explanations for this assertion. Performance decline often triggers organization-wide crisis that can affect both organizational and external stakeholders such as shareholders, creditors, and suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442746">Arogyaswamy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812442746">Pajunen, 2006</xref>). In such critical situations, founder-CEOs can play a positive role by formulating a comprehensive turnaround strategy and communicating this strategy to both internal and external parties in order to garner the required resource support. In fact, past research suggests that founder-CEOs tend to be more visionary and possess greater personal emotional attachment to the organization compared with professional, non-founder-CEOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1548051812442746">Wasserman, 2003</xref>). As such, founder-CEOs may have more legitimacy in representing the company in times of a crisis than a professional (non-founder-) CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442746">Fischer &amp; Pollock, 2004</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442746">Fischer and Pollock (2004)</xref> found that at the time of initial public offering, firms led by founder-CEOs with equity ownership had lower chance of failure. In addition to the reputational and institutional influence founder-CEOs have, some studies have also suggested that founder-CEOs often have more equity ownership in the firm, which results in more influence in the key strategic decisions of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442746">Jayaraman et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of corporate turnaround, a founder-CEO should be more capable than a non-founder-CEO at effecting the change necessary to turn a company around. In sum, we believe that declining firms that are led by founder-CEOs will have higher likelihood of corporate turnaround because (a) founders are more capable of exerting influence in the strategic decision-making process and (b) founder-CEOs can create symbolic legitimacy and confidence among external stakeholders who are often sources of critical resources in times of crisis. Hence, we hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>External Board Appointments and Likelihood of Corporate Turnaround: Resource Dependence and Board Interlock Perspectives</title>
<p>Given our emphasis in this study on the role of CEO’s external board appointments in predicting the likelihood of corporate turnaround in declining firms, we used RDT and literature on board interlocks as our theoretical lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442746">Casciaro &amp; Piskorski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442746">Daily &amp; Dalton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442746">Westphal, Boivie, &amp; Ming Chng, 2006</xref>). The following is a brief discussion of each of these theoretical perspectives as well as the proposed theoretical explanation as to why external board appointments play a positive role in successful corporate turnaround.</p>
<p>Originally introduced to the management literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812442746">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref>, RDT is one of the major schools of thought in organization theory. The proponents of this theory argue that organizations are dependent on the external environment for critical resources and are actively engaged in responding and shaping their environment for the purpose of minimizing such dependence as well as acquiring critical resources needed for achieving their objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442746">Boyd, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442746">Hillman, Withers, &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>). As such, RDT assumes that (a) organizations are part of a broader environment that controls critical resources needed to achieve their objectives and (b) organizations are capable of manipulating and changing the external environment to acquire resources. Specifically, interorganizational power imbalance and mutual dependence are the two important dimensions of the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442746">Casciaro &amp; Piskorski, 2005</xref>). RDT posits that the organization is capable of playing an active role in responding to and shaping the environment in order to secure those resources deemed critical for achieving its objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442746">Aldrich &amp; Pfeffer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812442746">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051812442746">Pfeffer (1972)</xref>, for instance, argues that organizations employ several strategies to manage their environment (decrease uncertainties and increase munificence). These strategies include co-optation, interorganizational relationships such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, aggressive political activities, as well as executive succession. Co-optation refers to a mechanism of diffusing the influence of powerful external parties by incorporating their representatives in the organization’s governing board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442746">Hillman, Cannella, &amp; Paetzold, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812442746">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>). A joint venture is an interorganizational relationship characterized by high level of joint resource investment and sharing of knowledge-based (tacit) resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442746">Das &amp; Bing-Teng, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051812442746">Wassmer, 2010</xref>). A higher form of dependence-reducing strategy often discussed in RDT is merger. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051812442746">Pfeffer (1972)</xref>, organizations actively engage in vertical integration (merger) to reduce symbiotic interdependence (i.e., dependence on raw material suppliers and/or distribution outlets) and horizontal merger to reduce commensalistic interdependence (i.e., competitive pressure). Organizations’ active and aggressive use of political actions to influence and shape their environment has also received significant empirical support in the RDT literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442746">Hillman, Zardkoohi, &amp; Bierman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812442746">Peng &amp; Luo, 2000</xref>). These studies in general indicate that firms that cultivate and maintain strong ties with governmental and political entities see a significant improvement in their market share and profitability. Finally, past research in RDT has also examined the impact of executive succession in reducing the external dependency of the organization. Specifically, some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442746">Arthaud-Day, Certo, Dalton, &amp; Dalton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812442746">Guthrie, Grimm, &amp; Smith, 1991</xref>) have shown that executive succession is often associated with changes in external environmental contingencies.</p>
<p>Along with the extensive theoretical and empirical developments in RDT, there has been a significant research emphasis on interorganizational networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442746">Haunschild, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1548051812442746">Westphal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1548051812442746">Westphal &amp; Zajac, 1994</xref>). Specifically, scholars have investigated the nature and impact of “interlocking board directors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442746">Carpenter &amp; Westphal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442746">Geletkanycz &amp; Hambrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812442746">Ruigrok, Peck, &amp; Keller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1548051812442746">Westphal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1548051812442746">Zajac, 1988</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442746">Geletkanycz and Hambrick (1997)</xref> empirically examined the link between external ties of executives and their strategic choice using data from 55 firms in the computer and packaged industries. The finding of their analyses generally suggested that executives’ intraindustry network ties (i.e., ties within their industry) is positively associated with strategic conformity, whereas executives’ network ties outside of the industry tend to relate with organizational strategies that are not always consistent with the overall industry strategy. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1548051812442746">Westphal et al. (2001)</xref>, in their longitudinal study of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies, found that firms with board members of companies that imitate competitor strategies are more likely to do the same in their own industry. In this study, we argue that the extensiveness of CEOs’ external board appointments could be an important determinant of corporate turnaround performance since such interorganizational executive linkages provide critical information and other resources that are needed to formulate and implement successful turnaround strategies.</p>

<title>Sample and Data Sources</title>
<p>The general population of this study is all U.S. manufacturing firms (SIC Code 2000-3999) that experienced survival-threatening performance decline during 1985 to 2005. We further restricted the population of the study by using the following two criteria: (a) the firms considered for the study are all U.S.-based firms, which allows for a more homogenous population and enhances comparability across firms and (b) all the firms considered are publicly traded corporations. This is because studying publicly traded corporations facilitates better access in terms of data collection. Since our goal is to empirically investigate the likelihood of corporate turnaround among declining firms, we used a matched sample design. The final sample contained 41 pairs of matched firms, one half of which had achieved a turnaround from poor performance, while the other half had declared bankruptcy. This approach has been widely used in bankruptcy and turnaround studies in the past (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442746">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; D’Aveni, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). There were three steps in creating the matched sample design: First, we identified all manufacturing firms that had experienced survival-threatening performance decline and turnaround among the study’s population. We adopted a six year window to study performance decline and turnaround consistent with past research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). Based on previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Duhaime, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Patterson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>), we used the following criteria to identify turnaround firms from the study’s population:</p>
<list id="list3-1548051812442746" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>At least 3 consecutive years of industry-adjusted return on asset (ROA) below the risk-free rate of return (i.e., the rate of return that can be earned if invested in financial instruments with negligible amount of risk). This ensures that there is both (a) an extended performance decline and (b) this decline is not a continuation of previous performance downturn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442746">Morrow et al., 2004</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442746">Altman’s (1983)</xref> bankruptcy prediction <italic>Z</italic> score of less than 3.0 for at least 1 year of the decline period. Altman’s <italic>Z</italic> score is used here to ensure that the performance decline is severe enough to threaten the survival of the firm and warrant strategic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Mone, 1994</xref>). This measure is widely used to assess a firm’s financial health and predict the likelihood of bankruptcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Mone, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442746">Barker &amp; Patterson, 1996</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442746">Altman (1983)</xref>, lower values in general indicate higher risk of bankruptcy and that a score less than 3.0 suggest high likelihood of bankruptcy in the short term.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At least 3 consecutive years of increasing and positive ROA above the risk-free rate of return as part of the performance recovery. Declining firms that have this consecutive increase in their ROA for at least 3 years are identified as turnaround firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). The increase in ROA considered in this criterion does not necessarily occur in an increasing pattern but must be above the minimum threshold (i.e., risk-free rate of return).</p></list-item></list>
<p>We applied the above-mentioned three criteria to the Standard &amp; Poor’s COMPUSTAT database for the period 1985 to 2005, and 100 firms were identified as meeting the sample selection criteria outlined above. Missing information on the predictor variables reduced the final sample to 41 firms that experienced serious performance decline and subsequent turnaround. The resulting sample size is small relative to the total number of public companies in the database, but the selection criteria are conservative measures of both distress and of turnaround, increasing the likelihood that the firms included in the sample were (a) undergoing significant and extended distress during the sampling window and (b) actually experienced extended and meaningful financial turnaround. Reducing the sampling window to 4 years (i.e., 2 years of subpar performance followed by 2 years of positive performance) would have increased the sample size, but also increased the likelihood that selected firms were not undergoing significant financial distress or turnaround.</p>
<p>Once the turnaround firms were selected, we identified matching firms that had experienced declining performance and had declared bankruptcy during the same period (1985-2005). Firms were matched based on sharing the same 4-digit SIC code, as well as firm size and product market characteristics. Such a matching approach is consistent with previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; D’Aveni, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). We obtained information on firm size, product/service offerings, and scope from company annual reports and COMPUSTAT and Mergent Online databases. The final sample of the study includes 41 declining firms that were able to successfully turnaround and 41 others that declared bankruptcy. Although the firms included in the final sample are drawn from 9 different 2-digit SIC codes, the top three industries in terms of final representation in the sample are <italic>electronic and other electric equipment</italic> (SIC-36) with 26 companies, <italic>industrial machinery and equipment</italic> (SIC-35) with 20 companies, and <italic>measurement instruments and related products</italic> (SIC-38) with 16 companies.</p>

<title>Founder status</title>
<p>We collected data on founder status for each of the sample firms from annual proxy statements (FORM DEF 14A), the <italic>Business Week</italic> company profile database, and company websites. Consistent with earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442746">Daily &amp; Dalton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442746">Fahlenbrach, 2009</xref>), we defined <italic>founder status</italic> as a dichotomous variable with “1” if the CEO is a founder or cofounder of the company and “0” otherwise.</p>

</sec>

<sec id="section13-1548051812442746">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We controlled for <italic>firm size, organizational slack</italic>, and <italic>proportion of outside directors of board of directors</italic> in the statistical model. Past research has found that firm size affects the capacity of organizations to make the necessary adjustments amid a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442746">Flynn &amp; Staw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812442746">Tushman &amp; Romanelli, 1985</xref>). Firm size is measured by the logarithm of total number of employees to normalize skewed distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). Organizational slack has been identified in the turnaround literature as an important factor influencing the firm’s ability to execute effective turnaround strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442746">Barker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). Consistent with past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; D’ Aveni, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442746">Morrow et al., 2004</xref>), organizational slack is measured as a ratio of total debt to total equity (<italic>Debt/Equity</italic>) for each year during the decline period (1985-2005) since this ratio represents (a) borrowing capacity and leverage and (b) the ability of the firm to raise capital to implement the requisite strategic and tactical actions underlying the respective turnaround strategy. Hence, the higher the ratio, the lower the level of organizational slack and vice versa. Studies both in the turnaround and general strategy literature indicate a significant empirical support for the relationship between the proportion of outside board directors and extent of strategic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442746">Hambrick &amp; D’Aveni, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442746">Mueller &amp; Barker, 1997</xref>). The proportion of outside directors on the board was calculated as the number of outside (nonmanager) directors divided by the total number of directors for each year of the decline period (1985-2005). Data for the control variables were collected from COMPUSTAT and Mergent Online databases.</p>

<p>To test our hypotheses, we used a logistic regression analysis with maximum likelihood estimation since the dependent variable of the study, likelihood of corporate turnaround, is a dichotomous variable with “1” indicating a turnaround and “0” indicating bankruptcy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442746">Table 2</xref> presents the results of the logistic regression analysis. Firm size, organizational slack, and proportion of outside directors were included as covariates in the model. Hypothesis 1 proposed that founder status is positively related to the likelihood of corporate turnaround such that declining firms that are led by founder-CEOs are more likely to turnaround than those that are not. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442746">Table 2</xref>, founder status was not a significant predictor of likelihood of corporate turnaround in all 6 years of consideration (both the first 3 years of decline and the following 3 years of turnaround). Hence, we did not find support for Hypothesis 1. As such, we did not find statistically significant support for the argument that founder-CEO led declining firms are more likely to turnaround than those that are led by a non-founder-CEO.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 proposed that the extensiveness of declining firm’s CEO external board appointment is positively related to the likelihood of corporate turnaround. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442746">Table 2</xref>, the contribution of external board appointment variable to the overall model over and above the covariates was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 22.778, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for the first year; χ<sup>2</sup> = 18.036, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for the second year; χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.289, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for the third year; χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.717, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for the fourth year; χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.148, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for the fifth year; and χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.719, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for the sixth year). The overall correct classification for all the six models was above 62% (72% for Year 1; 64.6% for Year 2; 62.2% for Year 3; 64.6% for Year 4; 64.6% for Year 5; and 73.2% for Year 6). We looked at the exponentiated logistic regression coefficients for assessing the magnitude of the change in the odds of the dependent variable since the regular beta coefficient is less useful in interpreting the results of our analysis. Accordingly, the change in odds can be calculated as follows: <italic>Percentage change in odds</italic> = (<italic>Exponentiated coefficient</italic> − 1) × 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442746">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>). For instance, the beta coefficient for CEO’s external board appointment variable in Year 1, according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442746">Table 2</xref>, is 1.036, which corresponds to an exponentiated coefficient of 2.819. This means that a one unit increase in CEO’s external board appointment will increase the likelihood of corporate turnaround by 181.9%. Similarly, for Years 2 to 6, a one unit increase in CEO’s external board appointment will increase the likelihood of corporate turnaround by 107.2%, 76.8%, 77.3%, 87.8%, and 71.6%, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have explored the influence of CEO’s founder status in the contexts of organizational founding or established firms. Our study contributes to the literature by examining the influence of founder-CEOs in a turnaround context. More specifically, this study investigated the effect of founder status and the extensiveness of CEO’s external board appointments on the likelihood of successful turnaround using a matched sample of 82 bankrupt and turnaround firms. The results of our logistic regression analysis revealed that the extensiveness of CEO’s external board appointment significantly increase the likelihood of successful turnaround among declining firms. A major line of theoretical argument for such a significant relationship is that CEO’s external board appointments, as major types of social network ties, could be important conduits through which the declining firm accesses external resources and information that is crucial to formulate and implement an effective turnaround strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442746">Geletkanycz &amp; Hambrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442746">Hillman et al., 2009</xref>). This is consistent with past research on the influence of external stakeholders on corporate turnaround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442746">McDonald &amp; Westphal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812442746">Pajunen, 2006</xref>). For example, in their study of 241 industrial and service firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442746">McDonald and Westphal (2003)</xref> found that in periods of poor organizational performance, CEOs rely on external advice networks and general social network ties. More specifically, they found that CEO’s social network ties have an adverse effect on the extent of change in corporate strategy, thereby concluding that CEO’s advice networks in poorly performing companies contribute to a detrimental downward spiral.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442746">Geletkanycz and Hambrick (1997)</xref> studied how executives’ intra- and extraindustry network ties influence the extent of strategy conformity and deviance among sample firms in the Computer and Food Processing industries. Their findings suggest that executives’ intraindustry ties are significantly related to strategic conformity, whereas extraindustry ties are associated with strategic deviance. These and other studies in the board interlock literature suggest that executives’ external network ties play an important role, first as sources of information and critical resource support and second as strong influences on focal firm’s strategy and decision making. Collectively, the empirical evidence suggests that presence of network ties provide CEOs with critical resources and information that facilitate the development and implementation of more innovative or less industry conforming strategies. Our finding in this study contributes to the turnaround literature by highlighting the importance of external board appointments of executives as important social mediums through which critical information, advice, and other external resource support can be transferred.</p>
<p>Although we found significant empirical support for CEO’s external board appointment as a predictor of the likelihood of corporate turnaround, the results of our analysis did not indicate a significant relationship between CEO’s founder status and the likelihood of corporate turnaround. Although more turnaround firms were led by founder-CEOs than bankrupt firms as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051812442746">Table 1</xref>, there was no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of corporate turnaround between turnaround and bankrupt firms. There could be theoretical and methodological explanations. First, we suspect this finding could be due to low statistical power associated with our sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 82). Nonetheless, based on our sample, we conclude that the presence of founder-CEOs did not significantly improve the likelihood of performance turnaround in declining firms.</p>
<p>In summary, past studies in this area suggest that founder-CEOs contribute better to firm performance mainly because of the high level of passion, technical expertise, and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442746">Adams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442746">Nelson, 2003</xref>). These attributes could help them generate more critical resources and formulate more effective strategic decisions that ultimately improve firm performance. Contrary to this line of argument, our study did not find a significant relationship between founder-CEO status and likelihood of turnaround. Such a nonsignificant finding could perhaps suggest that founder-CEOs under turnaround situations might not necessarily be associated with more motivation, skill, and legitimacy. For example, under turnaround situations founder-CEOs might lose their legitimacy because of their long tenure and commitment of status quo. This is consistent with the common consensus among turnaround researchers that long-tenured top managers of declining firms lose their support and confidence in the midst of the urgent demand for change in leadership. Founder-CEOs might face changing governance structure such as boards. For example, they might face less supportive boards. Scholars have found that founder-CEO-led firms had the tendency to have CEO duality, low proportion of outside directors, and higher top managers’ equity stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1548051812442746">Ranft &amp; O’Neill, 2001</xref>). The board change might inhibit the exercise of founder-CEOs’ skill, ability, and resources. Another challenge for founder-CEOs in declining firms is that, under turnaround situations, they might lose their network centrality in decision making or lose support from their directors. We believe that one of the ways that founder-CEOs uses their skills and abilities is through their network centrality among top management teams and board of directors. Network centrality relates to the degree of direct communication between CEOs and other top managers and the degree of involvement of CEOs in other top managers’ communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442746">Kelly, Athanassiou, &amp; Crittenden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>However, high-profile founder-CEOs that come back as CEOs to turnaround their firms might get totally different responses from stakeholders. For example, they might enjoy higher level of goodwill and support from other corporate managers and external stakeholders. This can facilitate the utilization of founder-CEOs’ skills, qualities, and network resources that can help successfully turnaround the declining firm.</p>
<sec id="section16-1548051812442746">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>As in any study, there are a number of limitations to our research findings. First, the criteria we used to identify turnaround firms are stringent. Consequently, there could be a chance that we left out other declining firms that did not necessarily “fit” with our specific criteria. Second, we only looked at publicly traded manufacturing firms and therefore did not include service firms in our final sample. Finally, the final matched sample of turnaround firms does not include firms from other countries, so essentially our findings and conclusion tends to reflect the U.S. experience. These and other limitations notwithstanding, this study showed that declining firms with CEOs that have more external board appointments increase the likelihood of corporate turnaround. Future studies should extend this line of inquiry and perhaps explore the institutional context of corporate turnarounds. This could specifically mean studying the impact of the media and key external stakeholders in the turnaround process. Future studies could also explore the role of founder-CEOs in the corporate turnaround process. Currently, there seems to be a gap in the turnaround literature in terms of understanding the nature and dynamics of the role founder-CEOs play in reversing survival-threatening performance decline.</p>
<p>Since we found evidence that the number of external board appointments for the CEO affects the probability of turnaround, we feel that this unexplored area is worthy of further inquiry. In this study, we looked at a count of the external board appointments, but it would be interesting to look at qualitative differences between various appointments to determine if, for example, appointments in more closely related industries increase the chance of turnaround. As well, it would be interesting to see if the performance or strategy of companies on whose boards the CEO serves has any impact on the likelihood of company turnaround.</p>
<p>There has been a growing discussion in the business press regarding the nature of the role founder-CEOs play in improving company performance in general and managing serious organizational crises (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442746">Birger, 2006</xref>). Moreover, there has been a consistent assertion among the practitioner community (turnaround consultants, in particular) that declining firms attempting to turnaround need a strong and unambiguous leadership that plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategic responses to organizational crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1548051812442746">Slatter, Lovett, &amp; Barlow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1548051812442746">Whitney, 1987</xref>). This line of argument also emphasizes the necessity of such leadership in terms of providing a clear signal to the declining firm’s stakeholders that “take charge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442746">Lohrke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812442746">Miller &amp; Friesen, 1977</xref>). In light of such argument, would founder-CEOs make better leaders in times of major organizational crises such as sustained performance downturn? This remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>In addition, the discussion on network centrality and governance structure and their impacts on founder-CEO effectiveness might suggest that CEO duality could be an important factor for founder-CEOs to effectively exploit their skills, abilities, motivation, and network advantages. Future research can test the impact of CEO duality on founder-CEOs’ actions and behaviors in terms of strategy formulation. Researchers in the future could also directly measure the advantages associated with founder-CEOs such as motivation (e.g., equity stake as the proxy), ability (e.g., previous turnaround experience, entrepreneurial ability), and legitimacy. Researchers could also examine the processes that could affect the work of founder-CEOs. For example, researchers can examine the impact of board size and composition as well as strategic decision-making process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study empirically examined the relationship between two important managerial characteristics (i.e., founder status and extensiveness of CEO’s external board appointments) and the likelihood of successful turnaround among declining U.S. manufacturing firms. The results of our analysis suggest that declining firm CEO’s external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of successful turnaround. Overall, our findings suggest that in times of performance decline, interorganizational linkages serve as critical sources of information and other relevant resources that can be used to formulate and implement successful turnaround strategies.</p>
