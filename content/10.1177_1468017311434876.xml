<p>There is widespread acknowledgment in the literature that selection processes for admissions to social work programmes in the UK, and elsewhere in the world, are varied and not well supported by a good evidence base. A number of factors appear to influence patterns of social work student application and recruitment to universities. A common aspiration is that admissions processes should be designed to ensure quality and consistency, whilst being mindful of social work values, as well as the coping with the demands of social work employers and stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>). Social work educators (both college and agency based) play a ‘gatekeeping’ role in terms of monitoring the suitability of students at the beginning point of their professional career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311434876">Miller &amp; Koerin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434876">Ryan, Fook, &amp; Hawkins, 1995</xref>). Central to this gatekeeping exercise is the development of processes and measures that enable the selection of students, who are viewed to be sufficiently motivated and skilled, to pursue a career in social work. The term ‘suitability’ is often used in admissions processes to select those applicants who demonstrate positive attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311434876">Shaw, 1977</xref>), but this is an elusive concept that is difficult to define and apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311434876">Miller &amp; Koerin, 1998</xref>). Other attributes, including integrity, honesty, self-awareness, comfort with emotions of self and others, recognition of dilemmas, respecting diversity, though listed as important by programmes, are also extremely difficult to operationalize in interview processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434876">Ryan et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Social work programmes tend to use a variety of assessment tools during the admissions process. For example, it has been argued that an assessment of previous academic performance appears to be the most valid predictor for successful outcomes for social work students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311434876">Dunlap, Henry, &amp; Fraser, 1998</xref>; Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311434876">Pelech, Stalker, Regehr, &amp; Jacobs, 1999</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that academic ability is a regularly used metric in social work admissions, not just in the UK, but for example in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434876">Ryan et al., 1995</xref>) and in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311434876">Gibbs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311434876">Ryan, Habibis, and Craft, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311434876">Tam, 2003</xref>). Assessment through exams is another method used in some countries, as in the case of Mexico (Hernáández &amp; Dunbar, 2007).</p>
<p>Another assessment method involves the use of personal statements. Findings from a study which examined the scoring of personal statements used by an MSW programme in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311434876">Glenmaye &amp; Oakes, 2002</xref>) indicated that scores on the personal statement bore little association with later performance. This finding was also reflected in a study of medical students’ academic outcomes in the first year of their degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311434876">Ferguson, Sanders, O’Hehir, &amp; James, 2000</xref>). The researchers, however, noted that care needed to be taken in the interpretation of the findings as the students had not yet participated in a clinical placement.</p>
<p>Many programmes take account of the applicant’s personal and work experiences to judge suitability for social work education. However, in the same study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311434876">Glenmaye and Oakes (2002)</xref>, such background characteristics were not viewed to be good predictors of performance. Other evidence suggests that reliance on previous performance as a predictor of positive educational and student practice placement outcomes may prove problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311434876">Pelech et al. (1999)</xref> argue that experience may precipitate a misguided sense of social work competence and lead to a diminished openness to learning.</p>
<p>Interviews are also commonly used in social work admissions processes, particularly in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311434876">Dillon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>). They tend to be designed to assess a range of attributes, including motivation, interest in, and capacity to practise social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311434876">Edwards &amp; Foster, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434876">Ryan et al., 1995</xref>). Universities appear to value the use of interviews; they may also be viewed positively by applicants who use the experience to make a judgement about choosing one programme over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311434876">Edward &amp; Foster, 1980</xref>). It is, however, not altogether clear if they have an adequate evidence base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311434876">Kropf, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311434876">Tam, 2003</xref>), for example in their capacity to measure required outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311434876">Edwards &amp; Foster, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311434876">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017311434876">Symons &amp; Morgan, 1987</xref>). In some unrefined formats interviews are perceived to be a biased and discriminatory selection tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311434876">Bridges, 1996</xref>; Taylor &amp; Balen, 1995) and that they have no bearing on future performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311434876">Munro, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, it has been argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311434876">SWAP, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311434876">Taylor &amp; Small, 2002</xref>) that reliable, structured scales may improve the application process and enhance assessment. One way of addressing these potential weaknesses is to use complementary processes such as group interviews, and other written assessments to select students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311434876">Dillon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Social work programmes generally seek to attract applicants with diverse backgrounds, depending on the geographical location of the programme and the need for a more culturally competent workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>). It would appear, however, that some selection processes can exclude and disadvantage certain groups. For example, selectivity bias may advantage middle-class applicants and those already involved in mainstream social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311434876">Shaw, 1977</xref>). Conversely academic criteria can disadvantage Black and Ethnic Minority students as well as those from non-traditional backgrounds, or with lower previous education attainments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311434876">Hussein, Moriarty, Manthorpe, &amp; Huxley 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311434876">Moxley, Najor-Durack, &amp; Dumbriguel, 2000</xref>). A recurrent issue for social work programmes is in finding ways of accommodating the needs of students with disabilities during the admissions process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311434876">Hussein et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, social work recruitment processes in universities attempt to address a variety of problematic issues, often not well understood. These vary between gatekeeping functions, finding ways of recruiting socially diverse applicants and in ensuring that the entrants will be sufficiently trained and educated to perform the social work role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017311434876"><title>Background to the study</title>
<p>The following study of a social work admissions process, described below, took place in Northern Ireland, one of four countries that comprise the United Kingdom and which enjoys a range of devolved governmental powers, one of which is the provision of social work education. Social work education, policy and practice have been shaped by a prolonged experience of political conflict and tentative steps towards engagement with disadvantaged communities (Pinkerton &amp; Campbell, 2002). The impact of sectarianism has negatively affected the delivery of much health care, social care and housing provision in Northern Ireland. In some cases, services are divided and used separately by Protestants and Catholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311434876">Campbell &amp; Duffy, 2008</xref>). Although religious identity tends to be a predominant signifier of difference (there is a large minority of Catholics and small majority of Protestants), national identities are more nuanced. Results from a recent Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey highlight a percentage increase in the numbers who perceive themselves to be Northern Irish (rather than Irish or British) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017311434876">NILTS, 2009</xref>). On a more positive note, health and social care services are delivered within an integrated service and there is a strong community sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311434876">Acheson, 2010</xref>). There are relatively small but growing numbers of ethnic minority communities with other religious beliefs whose needs are often neglected in social work education and service provision.</p>
<p>These are the social, economic, political and organizational contexts that provided the backdrop to the study described below. In 2004 a new Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) became the standardized qualification for all qualifying social work students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311434876">Wilson &amp; Kelly, 2010</xref>). At the time of the current study, two universities, Queens University Belfast (QUB) and University of Ulster (UU), provided about 280 full-time equivalent places across two BSW degrees. The majority of students follow a conventional three-year BSW, with a minority of relevant graduates placed on an ‘accelerated’ two-year route. Systems of social work education and training in Northern Ireland are characterized by strong partnership arrangements, monitored by the regulatory body, the Northern Ireland Social Care Council. These arrangements also apply to admissions processes where academic, admissions and agency staff share responsibilities for management and operational matters.</p>
<p>The application process is as follows. Students apply through the UK University Application System (UCAS). Applicants are then asked to complete a 600-word statement, explaining why they are interested in social work. This statement is then assessed using a standardized scoring system. If successful at this stage, applicants are then interviewed. The overall figures for the year (2008/9) in which the present study was carried out were as follows. There were 832 applicants for the three-year BSW and 230 applicants for the two-year route, totalling 1062. Of these, 937 passed their statements, leading to an offer of interview. A small number of students (less than 2%) did not turn up for interview or were interviewed twice (a regional agreement means that most students were interviewed at one or other university, based on postcode data, but some preferred to attend two interviews, presumably as part of a judgement that they would have a better chance of success).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311434876"><title>The study</title>
<p>In the years since the BSW was introduced to Northern Ireland, no research has been carried out to examine the background characteristics of applicants and their views of the admissions process. The study reported below surveyed the total population of students who entered QUB and UU for the academic year 2008/9. Questionnaires were designed to capture demographic data, including age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, educational and work experiences. A number of Likert scales and free text response questions were used to elicit students’ views on their experiences of the admissions process, from first application, personal statement, interview process and communication of results. The questionnaires were administered to all new students at the two universities within one month of their enrolment. Data from the responses to demographic details and responses to Likert scales were inputted to the software package SPSS to enable the analysis and description of key variables. A series of descriptive statistics were generated in relation to key themes and are represented in tables and figures in the Findings section below. Qualitative responses were read by the authors from QUB and UU to check for dominant, repetitive themes. The independent scrutiny of data by individual authors ensured consistency in the extrapolation of themes and agreement on the key issues generated from the data. In total, 203 completed questionnaires were returned, representing a response rate of over 70 percent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017311434876"><title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings are presented as follows. Quantitative findings that report descriptive statistics are reported in a series of tables and figures located in Appendix 1 at the end of the paper. Qualitative findings are reported using illustrative quotations.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1468017311434876"><title>Demographics</title>
<p>The age profile across the two universities was similar with a mean age in the mid-20s, and a range of 18–50 years<bold>.</bold> Of the combined sample, 84 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 170) was female and 16 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 33) male. A further analysis of the QUB and UU cohorts indicated that UU had a greater proportion of males who were admitted in this census year. These findings are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311434876">Table 1</xref>.
</p>
<p>Ninety-eight percent of the sample described their ethnic identity as White, 1.5 percent as European and 0.5 percent as ‘other’. The largest proportion of respondents (48%) viewed themselves to be Irish, 24% as Northern Irish and 26% as British. Respondents were asked to state their perceived religion. Sixty-four percent of the combined sample stated that they were Catholic, and 30.6% Protestant, whilst 4.5% viewed themselves to be in an ‘other’ category. These findings are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468017311434876">Table 2</xref>.
</p>
<p>The difference in balance between Protestants and Catholics can be partly explained by the catchment areas for the two institutions. QUB students tend to be drawn from populations in the east of Northern Ireland (with more ‘balanced’ populations of both Protestant and Catholic), whereas students who attend the UU programme are drawn from predominantly Catholic areas in the west of the region.</p>
<p>Data were also gathered about qualifications attained prior to commencement of the social work degree programme. Fifty-seven percent of respondents had attained a degree, 23 percent ‘A’ levels and 7.9 percent had participated in access foundation-level programmes. These findings are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017311434876">Figure 1</xref>.
</p>
<p>Respondents from both universities were also asked how often they had applied to the social work degree programme. Seventy-one percent reported that they had applied on one occasion, 25 percent on two occasions and 3 percent on three or more occasions. In addition, students were asked to indicate if they had previous experience of paid employment and/or volunteered in a non-paid capacity. The large majority (91%) confirmed that they had had gained work experience either in a paid or voluntary capacity. However, it must be noted that the question did not enquire whether this had been exclusively in social care sectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017311434876"><title>Evaluation of the admissions processes</title>
<p>Students were then asked to rate the various aspects of the interview process using a series of Likert-style questions, and open questions to elicit free text commentary.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311434876"><title>Personal statements</title>
<p>The majority of the student cohort (60%) reported a high level of satisfaction with the use of personal statements. These findings are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468017311434876">Figure 2</xref>.
</p>
<p>Twenty-eight percent of all respondents provided further comments to support these views on the use of personal statements. The majority of comments (<italic>n</italic> = 46) focused on how the process helped applicants structure their ideas prior to interview. They also tended to agree with the purpose of the personal statement, to help programmes decide how to select applicants for interview:<disp-quote>
<p>I thought it was a very satisfactory way of being able to put forward a good representation of myself.</p>
<p>I think that the personal statement is a useful way to determine whether or not the applicant actually understands social work and can also determine how much the applicants want to study social work.</p>
<p>I was very satisfied as it helped me realize why I wanted to do social work and I elaborated in my interview.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, 11 applicants stated that they had reservations about the effectiveness of the personal statement. Some felt that the word count was too restricted, others thought that the statement could be used as an opportunity for the applicant to falsify information.<disp-quote>
<p>With the use of an informed teacher, anyone can write a good statement, the interviews are more important.</p>
<p>Personal statements are not really a good way to select for interview. People can copy statements elsewhere and get to the interview stage to the detriment of someone who may be a far better candidate.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017311434876"><title>Participants’ views on the interview process</title>
<p>More than 80 percent of the joint cohort stated that they were satisfied or most satisfied with the interview process. This finding is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468017311434876">Figure 3</xref>.
</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of these respondents offered comments to support these views. A number reported that the interview environment had been relaxed and conducive to a meaningful rapport between interviewers and candidates. In addition, some felt that preparing for the interview had prompted them to research the area of social work and tested their ability to think and reflect in a stressful situation.<disp-quote>
<p>It allowed us, the interviewees, to assess ourselves and to really see if social work is for us. It also helped us think on the spot when different scenarios were asked. It showed us how we would handle certain situations.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, three respondents reported that the knowledge required to answer the questions might not be easily anticipated by the applicant at the interview stage.<disp-quote>
<p>Difficult questions … would expect such questions at a job interview after completing a social work degree.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, four respondents stated that they felt unwelcome and slightly intimidated by the interview experience.<disp-quote>
<p>I felt that the interview panel could have been more welcoming and engaged more in conversation with me.</p>
<p>More fluid conversation could have been used at the beginning of the interview to relax the applicant.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others stated that the interview was either too long (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or that not enough time had been allocated to the interview (<italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468017311434876"><title>Satisfaction with communication process</title>
<p>A small majority (51%) of respondents were highly satisfied with how they were communicated with by the universities throughout the admissions process. However, almost 14 percent of the overall cohort expressed some dissatisfaction with levels of communication. These findings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468017311434876">Figure 4</xref>.
</p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent of respondents offered open text information to support these views. Almost half of those who responded to the question (<italic>n</italic> = 25) offered positive comments:<disp-quote>
<p>Queens informed me every step of the way.</p>
<p>Staff at UU Magee were very informative and took the time to answer queries by phone and email … course director and admin team.</p>
<p>Anytime I was contacted, or contacted UU I found those I communicated with very helpful.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, of the 30 candidates who responded negatively to this question, the greatest majority felt (26) that that the period of waiting time for the result of interview had been very long and that this had precipitated anxiety and stress.<disp-quote>
<p>After the interview, the communication was dreadful … it took far too long.</p>
<p>The length of time that the applicant has to wait for a decision is long and leaves the applicant extremely nervous.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468017311434876"><title>Suggested improvements</title>
<p>Thirty-one percent of respondents offered views on how these admissions processes could be improved. Just over half of responses (<italic>n</italic> = 32) suggested that, following interview, the communication of decisions should be quicker:<disp-quote>
<p>Updates of the process after interview and before discovering acceptance/rejection, for example information if you’ve been shortlisted.</p>
<p>Inform students if they are on the reserve list to prepare them.</p>
<p>If someone has not got an offer but is on the reserve list they should be made aware of this.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec11-1468017311434876"><title>Overall satisfaction with selection process</title>
<p>More than three-quarters of the joint cohort indicated that they were satisfied or most satisfied with the selection process. These findings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468017311434876">Figure 5</xref>.
</p>
<p>Seventeen percent of the student respondents chose to provide additional comments in relation to their overall experience of the selection process. The majority of comments (<italic>n</italic> = 21) expressed a range of positive experiences during the admissions process. However, five respondents identified problems caused by the admissions process, including anger at not being successful in earlier admission attempts, to dissatisfaction with the length of time taken to communicate outcomes, and unhelpful responses to requests for information when unsuccessful.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1468017311434876" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of key themes emerged from these findings in terms of i) socio-economic variations in the backgrounds of successful applicants and ii) their views of the admissions process.</p>
<p>A gender breakdown of applicants indicated that a similar proportion of men were successful (16%) in comparison to those noted in other UK studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>). An unexplained finding was the slightly higher rates of men entering the UU programme when compared to the QUB programme. Further analysis of the local factors that may explain these variations is necessary (for example, in terms of nuances in career advice to high school students or patterns of access through non-conventional academic routes).</p>
<p>A notable demographic characteristic of Northern Irish society is the small (although growing) proportion of ethnic minority communities who live in this part of the UK. This trend is not reflected in the ethnic background of respondents in this survey, with 98 percent describing themselves as White. This is quite dissimilar to the ethnic characteristics of social work education cohorts recorded in studies of student admission and progression trends elsewhere in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311434876">Hussein, Moriarty, &amp; Manthorpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>). If, as we expect, greater numbers of new migrant groups seek to live in Northern Ireland, then programme providers and regulatory authorities need to find ways of dealing with this imbalance in social work student applicants from ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>Northern Irish society has been adversely affected by the negative impact of sectarianism on many aspects of life and human relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311434876">Kelly &amp; Sinclair, 2005</xref>). Somewhat paradoxically, given the profession’s commitment to challenging discrimination, this is a relatively neglected issue in the social work curriculum in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311434876">Campbell &amp; Duffy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311434876">Campbell &amp; Healey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311434876">Smyth &amp; Campbell, 1996</xref>). In terms of perceived religion, the highest proportion (65%) of respondents in this cohort considered themselves to be Catholic and 31 percent as Protestant. These differences are largely consistent with statistics on previous cohorts. In terms of the overall population, Catholics, disproportionately, tend to find places in social work programmes in Northern Ireland. We can only speculate about the reasons for this. It may be, for example, that the choice of a professional career in social work fits more easily with what is perceived to be, historically, the aspirations of a more marginalized social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311434876">Smyth &amp; Campbell, 1996</xref>), or that employment patterns dictated by the political economy shape career choices. Of further note was how respondents viewed their nationality. In the current study 48 percent perceived themselves to be Irish, 26 percent British and 24 percent Northern Irish. In Northern Ireland, there has been a widely held popular presumption that religion and nationality are closely overlapping identities (Protestants are Unionists and Catholics Nationalists). Increasingly however, individuals from different religious backgrounds increasingly view themselves as Northern Irish. The responses of this cohort in the current study reflect these mixed identities.</p>
<p>Previous education and prior qualifications are important variables in helping us understand how students enter social work education and training, as well explaining aspects of progress and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434876">Holmström &amp; Taylor, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311434876">Hussein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311434876">Hussein, Manthorpe, &amp; Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311434876">Hussein, Moriarty, Manthorpe, &amp; Huxley, 2006</xref>). In the current study, 57 percent of successful applicants had already obtained a second class honours degree, with some of these populating the three-year programmes offered by the institutions. These trends appear to mirror other UK studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434876">Moriarty &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>). Many social work programmes in the UK, and some in other parts of the world, take into account the applicant’s life or work experiences during the admissions process. Results from the current study found that 91 percent of the respondents had experience in a voluntary or paid activity although it was not reported whether this was in a social care setting. There is a need, however, to better understand why and how programmes use such experience as predictors of good outcomes in education and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311434876">Glenmaye &amp; Oakes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311434876">Pelech et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>We now wish to focus the second part of our discussion on the admissions processes used in Northern Ireland, and the views of successful applicants reported in the Findings section. In this jurisdiction an extended personal statement is used to select candidates for interview. This provides the applicant with the opportunity to expand upon their motivation for social work, to indicate their knowledge of social work role and function as well as their understanding of the social work curricula. Some studies have found that using personal statements in professional programmes to predict future learning and practice outcomes are tentative at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311434876">Glenmaye &amp; Oakes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311434876">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311434876">Watson (2002)</xref> views this method as helpful in enabling selectors to consider past achievements and not just performance at interviews. Students’ views on the use of personal statements in this Northern Irish study indicated that a majority (60%) were also satisfied with the use of the personal statement for selection purposes. However, a minority of students expressed some dissatisfaction and raised doubts about their use in the admissions process, particularly around the possibility that it may not be the applicant who completes the statement.</p>
<p>In the current study there were mixed reactions about the use of interviews to select students. Most respondents expressed their satisfaction with the interview process they had experienced (although, as we point out in the study limitations section below, this may not be surprising given that these were the successful students who were accepted by the programmes). Some respondents found the style of interviews to be relaxed and informal, and others thought that the pressurized nature of the interview environment enabled them to ‘think on their feet’. This may not always be the case, and some talented applicants may fail under such stress whereas those who have good interview skills may not be the most appropriate in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311434876">Watson, 2002</xref>). Although interviews may be the most common form of assessment of applicant suitability for social work education, it is important that there are quality assurance processes in place to ensure that bias and discrimination does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311434876">Bridges, 1996</xref>; Taylor &amp; Balen, 1995). As with other aspects of the admissions process, programmes should ensure, as much as possible, that there is evidence to demonstrate that the interview process delivers high quality students who are equipped for the challenging world of social work education and practice. The use of standardized measures and post-hoc studies of student progress may help in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311434876">SWAP, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311434876">Taylor &amp; Small, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>How universities communicate with applicants throughout the interview process can shape future students’ views about fairness, and encourage improved applications. Over half of applicants in the current study used free text opportunities to explain how they were communicated during the admissions process. They were particularly praiseworthy of administrative staff who were perceived as supportive and helpful. On the other hand, there were a number of negative experiences reported, including concerns about the lengthy period of time between interview and acceptance. Such experiences have been corroborated in other studies. Good quality systems of information giving can allay anxiety, promote confidence at the interview stage and support prospective students in reapplying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311434876">Watson, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468017311434876"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>The findings from this study report on a cross sectional study of two cohorts of students. We cannot, therefore, extrapolate these findings to the wider population of all applicants to social work programmes. Two possible sources of bias were identified: questionnaire construction bias and selection/omission bias. In order to minimize questionnaire bias, the questions were clearly formatted in closed, Likert and open styles with clear categories and simple non-jargon language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311434876">Choi &amp; Pak, 2005</xref>). The design of the study indicated obvious selection bias in the composition of the sample (via omission of non- successful candidates). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311434876">Shuttleworth (2009)</xref> notes, there are occasions when ‘omission bias’ is often ‘unavoidable’, particularly in surveys which examine specific populations. From the outset, the study did not plan to survey the unsuccessful applicants due to accessing and cost issues. Similar studies have used small, non-representative samples to explore the experiences of students entering health care and social care undergraduate and postgraduate programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017311434876">Clark, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311434876">McNelis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311434876">Watson, 2002</xref>). Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311434876">McNelis et al. (2010)</xref> considered the views of students who had participated in admission to a nursing programme in the University School, Indiana. Whilst the small-scale survey (<italic>n</italic> = 165) engendered non-generalizable results from applicants, the findings did provide a useful snapshot of student opinion as regards the admission process. Likewise, it is recognized that, whilst findings from the current study are not representative, they do provide information which is relevant to the design and administration of local admission procedures that may be compared with other similar processes in national and international contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468017311434876" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings from the current study have informed regional discussions about how social work admissions processes in Northern Ireland can be improved. The difficulties in recruiting men and applicants from ethnic minority communities have been recognized for a number of years. The Northern Ireland Social Care Council, in liaison with regional partnerships, is currently initiating outreach activity with ethnic minority organizations to encourage more applicants from these groups. In addition, changes have been made to the way decisions are communicated to applicants on the basis of the findings from this study. For example, a standardized approach is now used in providing information at the end of interviews which explains the different stages of offer and acceptance (depending on suitability score and rank ordering when all interviews are completed). Furthermore, all those who read personal statements and lead interviews are required to attend regional workshops to ensure that equal opportunities procedures are being adhered to and that consistent approaches are used in the interview process (for example, in terms of the use of prompts, and protocols around interview time and consistency in scoring). Perhaps the most radical departure from existing practice is the suggestion that the use of personal statements may be replaced by a ‘theory to practice’ test conducted under examination conditions, a method designed to ensure that access to interview is based on the applicant’s own written ideas.</p>
<p>The current study suggests that there are some merits to the way that the social work admissions process is delivered in Northern Ireland. It would be foolish to assume, however, that improvements cannot be made. As pressure mounts to deliver ever more efficient and evidence-based systems of student admissions to universities, and at a time when policy-makers and the wider public expect programmes to deliver high quality, well qualified social workers, the debates about how admissions processes can be refined will continue. The use of more rigorous approaches to evaluating these processes and reflection upon other international approaches can only enhance our understanding of this crucial aspect of social work education and workforce planning and development.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1468017311434876"><title>Research ethics</title>
<p>This study was an evaluation of a regional social work admissions process and was judged by researchers to be of low risk to respondents. The regional admissions partnership committee (which included academics, university admissions officers and social work managers responsible for training) was consulted about the study from inception to completion. The questionnaire included information for respondents about the purpose and outcomes of the study. This information also provided advice to respondents about their freedom to choose to answer any or none of the questions, prior to completion of the survey. Respondents were not required to provide names and all completed questionnaires were anonymously coded prior to the analysis of data.</p>
