<abstract>
<p>Children with special health care needs face many barriers to oral care and are at high risk for oral disease. School nurses are in a unique position to promote oral wellness in this vulnerable population. Collaboration between school nurses and dental hygiene faculty resulted in the formation of a partnership between a university-based dental hygiene program and two special education districts in rural southern Illinois. Senior dental hygiene students participated in a school-based service-learning project that provided dental examinations, preventive services, and education to children with special health care needs. Evidence-based behavioral interventions were used to teach children to comply with oral procedures. School nurses mentored dental hygiene students in behavior management of children. Dental exams were provided to 234 children from four special education schools with the majority receiving cleanings and fluoride.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental care is reported to be the greatest unmet health care issue among children with special health care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511432473">Beil, Mayer, &amp; Rozier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511432473">Oredugba &amp; Akindayomi, 2008</xref>). School nurses can play an integral role in improving the oral health, and subsequently the overall health of this population. A plethora of obstacles prevents the most vulnerable children from attaining oral care, thus children with special health care needs have more oral disease than their typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>). Effective models of school-based oral care delivery systems can be implemented to address the oral needs of this population. Additionally, collaboration with dental hygiene and dental schools can help reduce barriers to care by establishing service-learning experiences in the provision of care.</p>
<p>In an interview survey involving 40,840 caregivers of children with special health care needs, 81% of the children needed preventive dental care and 24% needed other dental treatment within a 12-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>). Lewis identified that children with certain diagnoses including Down syndrome, other forms of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism encounter greater difficulty obtaining needed dental care. The exact reason for this disparity in access to care is unclear. In Lewis’ study, parents reported high cost and lack of insurance as primary barriers to preventive oral care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>). According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) Risk Assessment Guidelines, children who cannot perform daily oral hygiene are considered in the highest risk category for oral disease and require more frequent and intensive preventive services (Beil et al., 2009) Therefore, those children with the most severe disabilities tend to have the greatest oral health needs and are the most underserved.</p>
<p>There are multiple factors that provide barriers to oral care for the population of children with special health care needs, and the factors are well documented in the literature. Reasons include inadequate training for providers, inadequate Medicaid or SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) reimbursement rates for providers, unavailability of providers who are willing to treat, unprofitable oral procedures due to extended time required for the services, unpredictable and challenging behaviors displayed by children with special health care needs, and the perceived unimportance of oral health in comparison to the child’s other challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511432473">AAPD, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432473">Fenton, Hood, Holder, May, &amp; Mouradian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511432473">Hernandez &amp; Ikkanda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511432473">Holder, Waldman, &amp; Hood, 2009</xref>). Numerous studies show dentists, dental hygienists, dental students, and dental hygiene students feel unprepared or underprepared when it comes to caring for various populations of children with special health care needs. Surveys of dental and dental hygiene students indicate a lack of didactic and clinical opportunities as key contributing factors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511432473">Dehaitem, Ridley, Kerschbaum, &amp; Inglehart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511432473">Delucia &amp; Davis, 2009</xref>; Holder et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511432473">Mabry &amp; Mosca, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511432473">Ozar, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511432473">Dehaitem, Ridley, Kerschbaum, and Inglehart (2008</xref>), most U.S. dental hygiene programs include didactic information about the treatment of patients with special needs, but less than 50% of programs require their students to gain clinical experiences with this population. Fourth-year dental students from five U.S. dental schools were surveyed. Fifty-one percent stated they had no clinical experience providing care to patients with intellectual disabilities and 60% reported they had little to no confidence that they could adequately provide treatment to this population. Dental hygienists were also surveyed and it was found that 73.5% felt that they were insufficiently trained to provide care to cognitively challenged patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511432473">Delucia &amp; Davis, 2009</xref>). Lack of proper training in behavior management of individuals with intellectual disabilities causes some providers to refuse to treat them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432473">Fenton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511432473">Keselyak, Simmer-Beck, Bray, &amp; Gadbury-Amyot, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>). As a result, children with the most complicated behaviors experience greater barriers to access to dental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432473">Lewis, 2009</xref>). Children with disabilities are often eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, which creates another barrier to oral care; Many parents and caregivers have difficulty finding a dentist who will accept their child as a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432473">Fenton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511432473">Kuthy, McQuistan, Heller, Riniker-Pins, &amp; Qian, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Children who exhibit challenging behavior in the dental environment require either effective behavioral management approaches, restraint, or sedation for oral care services to be delivered. A variety of behavior-analytic techniques have proven effective in managing uncooperative behaviors in the dental and medical environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511432473">Cuvo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432473">Cuvo, Goddard, Huckfeldt, &amp; DeMattei, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511432473">DeMattei, Rehfeldt, &amp; Graudins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511432473">Hernandez &amp; Ikkanda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511432473">Prabhu, Nunn, Evans, &amp; Girdler, 2010</xref>). Although experiments have successfully shown behavior-analytic techniques change challenging behavior, the techniques are not commonly used to the extent they could be in dental practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511432473">Hernandez &amp; Ikkanda, 2011</xref>). Instead, voice control and tell-show-do are the two most commonly used behavior management approaches practiced in dental environments. More aversive techniques involving restraint are sometimes used to control challenging behavior. A recent survey of members of the AAPD found that 50% of the members believed the hand-over-mouth exercise (HOME) was an acceptable technique to control behavior and 41% believed the AAPD should continue to include HOME in their clinical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511432473">Oueis, Ralstrom, Miriyala Molinari, &amp; Casimassimo, 2010</xref>). Other forms of restraint include various wraps, boards, and mouth props to restrict movement. Light, moderate, and deep sedation are other approaches to behavior management, but access to sedation dentistry is limited throughout the United States. According to Prabhu et al. (2010), waiting time for a sedation appointment can range from 1 to 24 months; lack of transportation and the need to travel long distances to dental appointments create barriers to care. Use of restraint and sedation are accepted practices in dentistry, but risks are involved with both.</p>
<p>School nurse involvement in school-based dental centers facilitates access to oral care services for many children with special health care needs who otherwise may have limited or no opportunity for oral care. School-based dentistry provides easy access for students in a familiar environment and may support academic outcomes by maintaining the physical and emotional health of students and directly improving academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511432473"><italic>Comprehensive Oral Health Services</italic>, 2011</xref>). Through portable or mobile dental equipment, one significant barrier to oral care can be eliminated by creating a temporary dental environment in the school. Furthermore, when schools and community agencies build collaborative partnerships with dental and dental hygiene schools, multiple benefits emerge for all involved. Underserved children receive care, future oral health providers develop skills, and school nurses and personnel have greater involvement in creating a healthier child. Establishing effective service-learning programs strengthens the workforce by preparing oral health professionals to provide care for children with special health care needs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511432473">Keselyak et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The overarching purpose of the project was to improve the oral wellness of children with special health care needs and provide dental hygiene students experiences and skills in behavior management of children with special health care needs through collaboration with school nurses. The Dental Hygiene Program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC) received a grant from the Illinois Children’s Healthcare Foundation to strengthen the capacity of their existing Medicaid dental clinic, the Community Dental Center. One objective of the grant was to provide examinations, educational, and preventive services to children enrolled at two local special education districts. The second objective was to provide a dental home at the SIUC Community Dental Center for those Medicaid-eligible children with special health care needs who needed one. Third, to provide service-learning experiences to senior dental hygiene students through rotations to the four special education schools within the two school districts. The fourth objective was to teach children who are frightened and unaccustomed to dental care how to cooperate with oral care procedures by utilizing an evidence-based behavioral approach that had been developed by faculty and graduate students from the SIUC Behavior Analysis and Therapy graduate program and SIUC Dental Hygiene faculty.</p>

<sec id="section2-1059840511432473">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A cover letter, medical histories, consent-to-treat, and a behavioral questionnaire were developed and approved through the SIUC Human Subject’s Committee. Initial contact with the two school districts was made through the school nurse of one special education school district and through the director of special education in the second district. Both individuals wrote support letters to assist with securing the grant, and later assisted with the development of the memorandum of understanding that was signed by the school districts and SIUC. Two of the four schools provided special education to children enrolled in kindergarten through eighth grade, with one of these two providing special education to children to age 22. The third school was a regular education high school that had a classroom categorized as “severe and profound.” Students from this classroom were the only students from this high school who were included in the project. The fourth school enrolled preschool children ages 3–5 who were identified to be “at risk.” The preschool was operated by the special education district and possessed one classroom for preschoolers with diagnosed disabilities. The other children enrolled were allowed admittance based on the results of a screening that indicated deficit areas and high-risk factors.</p>
<p>School nurses distributed the medical history and consent-to-treat forms that were sent home for parents’ or caregivers’ signatures. Only those children who returned the signed forms participated in the dental project. The school nurse, the dentist, and the dental hygiene faculty collaborated on medical conditions that warranted a medical consult prior to the child receiving oral care procedures. The SIUC Community Dental Center Medical Consult form was completed and signed by the dentist and the school nurse informed parents or caregivers that the child’s physician needed to determine whether prophylactic antibiotic premedication was needed prior to the dental cleaning.</p>
<p>The SIUC Community Dental Center dentist, along with the dental hygiene faculty, and a student worker completed the school examination within an 8-day period. Each child received an oral examination using a dental chair, a dental light, and a disposable mouth mirror. When needed, a dental explorer was use to assist in the diagnosis of dental caries. No x-rays were taken. Oral findings were recorded on the Illinois School Examination form and on an SIUC Community Dental Center clinic form. One copy of the Illinois School Examination form was retained for the child’s SIUC Community Dental Center dental record, and the original was given to the school nurse. The additional clinic form was sent home to the parents or caregivers explaining the findings and recommendations for further dental care, if necessary. Also, a written description of the child’s cooperation was included along with comments regarding oral hygiene findings. All children’s oral health needs were identified as: (a) needing no treatment; (b) needing preventive treatment (i.e., cleaning, sealants, and/or fluoride); (c) needing restorative treatment; or (d) needing urgent care. Additionally, the behavior of the children was scored as acceptable, improvable, or unacceptable, based on his or her cooperation during the oral examination.</p>
<p>The school nurses and classroom teachers mentored the dental hygiene students, and offered guidance and approaches that were effective in managing behavior for each individual. The dental hygiene faculty had been trained in desensitization approaches and other basic behavioral techniques by SIUC Behavior Analysis and Therapy faculty and graduate students during collaboration on previous related research projects. Dental hygiene students used behavioral management techniques including contingent rewards, verbal praise, picture prompting, escape extinction (preventing the child’s escape from the aversive situation which would otherwise be a form of positive reinforcement), differential reinforcement (reinforcing only the desired behaviors), and modeling.</p>
<p>Prior to bringing each child into the “dental environment” that was set up at the child’s school, the dental hygiene students and faculty reviewed the behavioral survey that had been completed by the parent or caregiver. Information gleaned from the survey provided insight such as the child’s likes, dislikes, fears, preferred toy or item that could be used as positive reinforcement, tooth brushing habits, and oral sensitivity issues. Discussion with the school nurse provided additional insight about the child’s typical behavior along with the child’s disability. The school nurse assisted with communication for children who were hearing impaired or had other communication disorders.</p>
<p>Portable dental equipment was used to create a “dental environment” in a room that was designated by the principals of the schools. At the end of each day, the equipment was broken down and stored in a small space so the room would be available for use by school personnel when dental services were not being provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511432473">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Parents and caregivers reported the child’s disability on the medical history. Autism was the most commonly reported disability (27%), followed by seizure disorder or epilepsy (9%), hearing impairment or deafness (8%), Down’s syndrome (5%), mental retardation or intellectual impairment (5%), communication disorder (5%), emotional or behavioral disorder (5%), attention deficit disorder or learning disability (4%), cerebral palsy (3%), other developmental disability (3%), and traumatic brain injury (3%). Thirty-three percent of the children did not have a disability listed. All of these children were enrolled in the preschool where placement was based on risk factors rather than documented disability.</p>
<p>Over a 2-year period, 245 consent-to-treat forms were signed and returned to the school nurses. Of the consenting responses, 234 (95.5%) children from four special education schools in two rural southern Illinois school districts received an oral examination by the SIUC Dental Hygiene faculty dentist. Five students were absent during the days the dental exams were being conducted and six students had behavior that made the examinations impossible. Once the examinations were completed and treatment was prescribed by the dentist, the preventive services (dental prophylaxis, fluoride, and sealant application) were completed under general supervision by the dental team; presence of the dentist was not required. The dental team consisted of four senior dental hygiene students and the supervising dental hygiene faculty. The dental team provided care at the schools 8 hr each week for 12 weeks during the 2010 and 2011 spring semesters. When services were complete at one school, the dental team would transport the equipment and supplies to the next school. Each dental hygiene student participated between three and six times for a total of 12–24 clinic hours. By the end of the project, a total of 32 dental hygiene students had participated. Examinations and treatment were completed within 24 weeks.</p>
<p>Children’s behavior was scored at the completion of the dental examinations as acceptable, improvable, or unacceptable, based on behavior during the exam. Results show that 63.7% had acceptable behavior and complied with the instructions and age appropriate expectations during the dental exam. In contrast, 17.5% of the children displayed uncooperative behavior, but the dentist was able to complete the dental examination. The behavior of these children was scored improvable. Unacceptable behavior was displayed by 18.8% of the children during the examination. The children identified as having improvable or unacceptable behavior were targeted for behavioral intervention. When challenging behavior was displayed by children, desensitization and other basic behavioral techniques were used to manage the behavior, establish the expectation for the child’s behavior, and teach the child skills needed to comply with the dental procedures.</p>
<p>While a dental prophylaxis (cleaning) was attempted on all children who received an examination, a prophylaxis was completed on only 73%. A partial or incomplete dental prophylaxis was performed on 30 children (13%). These children exhibited challenging behavior, but with multiple attempts using desensitization strategies and other basic behavioral techniques, a partial cleaning was completed. Approximately, 15% of the children presented with severely resistant behavior and no treatment was provided. Examples of the resistant behaviors included refusal to come into the room, refusal to sit in the dental chair, refusal to open mouth, refusal to allow a toothbrush, or mouth mirror to be placed in the mouth, escape, and hitting or kicking. The dental team, along with the school nurses and teachers, used a variety of applied behavioral techniques to encourage cooperation of the children who resisted.</p>
<p>Through the use of behavioral intervention, compliance with the dental procedures increased for many children. Although 59 children never developed acceptable behavior, marked improvement was demonstrated with multiple sessions for 22 children. Below are accounts of the radical changes that were observed in three young boys with name changes to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>Caleb was 7 years old, has a diagnosis of autism, and has limited functional language. He verbalizes nonsensical words and makes unusual and rapid utterances. He has a history of aggressive behavior such as hitting, throwing things, screaming, and escape. Caleb pulled away or turned his head if someone approached his mouth with a tooth brush. He would not brush his teeth, nor would he let his parents or teachers brush his teeth. Caleb’s behavior began to noticeably change once the school nurse encouraged his classroom teacher to offer positive behavioral interventions contingent upon his cooperation with the dental procedures. With the promise of computer time, Caleb agreed to sit on the dental chair. During following sessions, he allowed the dental hygiene student to brush his front teeth while his teacher counted to ten. Plenty of verbal praise was offered and he was allowed to leave the dental environment (negative reinforcement) to return to the classroom for computer time. Thirty minutes later, Caleb was brought back to the dental environment for another session. Again he allowed his teeth to be brush for the count of twenty. This type of progress continued until he allowed most of his teeth to be brushed for several consecutive 20 s intervals at one sitting. Although a complete cleaning was not accomplished, and his behavior needed additional improvement, he is now allowing his classroom teacher to brush his teeth.</p>
<p>Conner was 4 years old, nonverbal, and has cochlear implants. He displayed an unusual fear of the dental environment. When he and his classmates visited the dental environment as a group, he was extremely withdrawn and began crying loudly when his teacher signed for him to sit in the dental chair. After multiple sessions using modeling, positive reinforcement, contingent rewards, and picture prompts, Conner appeared to have overcome his aversion to the dental environment. He complied with the dental cleaning and application of fluoride varnish with acceptable behavior, and left the room with a look of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Ten different attempts over 5 days (approximately 2 hr) were made to get 6-year-old Hayden to sit in the dental chair. He allowed the dental hygiene students to brush his teeth with a power brush and apply fluoride varnish while he was standing, but he refused to sit in the dental chair. After identifying a reinforcement that he would work for, Hayden complied with the demand of sitting on the chair. Promising Hayden that he could take home a toy tape measure from the toolbox elicited the desired behavior. His behavior needs further improvement, but eliciting the target behavior was an accomplishment. Hayden has a diagnosis of autism.</p>
<p>Dental decay was detected in 85 children (36%) with approximately 10% in need of urgent restorative care, root canals, or extractions. Correspondence was sent home notifying parents or caregivers of the need for further dental care and the urgency if appropriate. Dental decay is a chronic progressive condition that can result in abscesses, significant loss of tooth structure, and severe pain.</p>
<p>Dental hygiene student feedback in reflective essays confirmed the value of the educational experiences. All of the students wrote about the uniqueness of the learning environment and the diverse experiences they encountered while working with the children with special health care needs. Another common theme that emerged was the increased confidence the students gained through the experiences. The following are excerpts from three students’ reflective essay.<disp-quote>
<p>
Student 1: I was able to put myself in challenging situations and gain valuable experience for the future in working with children in this population. I worked one-on-one with one boy in particular who screamed and hit me and grabbed the toothbrush out of my hand and threw it across the room in our first meeting. The last time I saw him, he took a powered toothbrush and turned it on, and brushed his teeth. I literally had tears in my eyes. It was an extremely rewarding experience to know that this little boy may now allow his teeth to get brushed and because of that, his quality of life has improved. I worked with many kids who went beyond all expectations and allowed us to brush, scale, and seal their teeth. I was able to observe the trouble they had allowing us in such an intimate area of their body and how they overcame it. They also really loved praise and encouragement, so it was wonderful to be able to provide it.</p>
<p>
Student 2: I think that the special school rotations were one of the most humbling experiences I have ever encountered. I am very thankful to have met and worked with amazing children, teachers, and nurses. I think that if it weren’t for the rotation, the process of working with children with autism or special education needs will still be a mystery. One of the best experiences about special school rotations is not only encountering and working with the wide range of children but also the fact that I get to participate in a true teamwork environment. When a group of people have the same vision and/or goals—the overall working process is a lot more pleasant and smooth.</p>
<p>
Student 3: I was able to work with mild to severely affected patients with autism, Down syndrome, mentally retardation, physical disabilities, and some behavioral disabilities. I was also able to work one on one with a girl in a desensitization process, which was an amazing learning experience. With the special schools rotation you encounter many problems or “road blocks” with every patient. Sometimes you are able to get through it and move on and sometimes you just have to stop and try again later. Every child was at a different level, and it was great getting to learn how to work with so many disabilities. I loved getting to help and hopefully make a difference in these kids’ lives.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The outcomes of this project demonstrate the multiple benefits that emerge when partnerships form between school nurses and a university dental hygiene program. Results corroborate Fenton, Hood, Holder, May, and Mouradian (2003) who claim that interprofessional collaboration is necessary to promote oral health for children with special health care needs. Not only did children with special health care needs benefit from the collaboration, but so did the dental hygiene students and the future workforce. Service-learning opportunities that provide mentoring by professionals in the field have been associated with enhanced clinical reasoning, problem solving, time management, and interpersonal communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511432473">Barnett, et al. 2008</xref>). The multidisciplinary team approach allowed students to be mentored by nurses and special education teachers who demonstrated management approaches that are effective and familiar to the children. Also, dental hygiene students were able to learn from faculty ways to integrate treatment techniques and realistic expectations for both the children and the clinician. When dental hygiene and dental students are better prepared in the management of children with special health care needs, the effectiveness of the workforce can be improved.</p>
<p>Teaching children with special health care needs how to cooperate with dental procedures will increase the opportunity for oral wellness. Children who allow their teeth to be brushed daily will likely develop less oral disease, and may be more likely to receive treatment in a general dentist office instead of requiring sedation or restraint by a specialist. When children are comfortable in the dental environment and comply with professional procedures, scheduling appointments will be easier for parents and caregivers. Teaching children with special health care needs to cooperate with daily oral hygiene is one way to support the child’s overall wellness, and the school environment can take an active role.</p>
<p>In Illinois, dental exams are mandatory for children entering grades kindergarten, second and sixth. Providing oral care in the school environment is one way to help schools, parents, and caregivers meet this requirement. Also, it provides an opportunity for school nurses to promote and disseminate oral health education to administrators, teachers, students, parents, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Dental hygiene and dental schools are located throughout the United States and all are required to provide didactic and clinical education for patients with special needs. Since January 1, 2006, dental and dental hygiene schools have been required to comply with new accreditation standards concerning educational requirements. The Commission on Dental Accreditation requires that dental and dental hygiene programs ensure didactic and clinical opportunities to better prepare dental professionals for the care of individuals with special care needs so that graduates are competent in assessing and managing the treatment needs of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840511432473">Waldman, Fenton, Perlman, &amp; Cinotti, 2009</xref>). Collaborating with special education districts is one way for dental educators to provide a diverse population of patients who have special needs.</p>
<p>Currently in the United States, there are 325 entry-level associate’s or bachelor’s degree programs, 57 bachelor’s degree-completion programs, and 20 master’s degree programs for dental hygiene education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511432473">American Dental Hygienists’ Association, 2011</xref>). There are over 60 dental schools in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511432473">American Dental Association, 2011</xref>). School nurses are in an excellent position to initiate service-learning collaborative partnerships that will improve access to oral care and oral wellness of the children they serve.</p>
<p>Although the SIUC Community Dental Center was recommended to parents and caregivers as a referral site for follow-up dental care, parents may have chosen to seek dental services elsewhere or not at all. To date, 15 children have received dental care at the SIUC Community Dental Center. Data are not available to indicate whether children sought follow-up care at other dental facilities. According to school nurses and teachers, there is a need for effective parental intervention to support follow-up dental care. This school-based project only provided feedback and referral information in writing to parents and caregivers, which may be less effective than sharing the information face-to-face. Not having the opportunity to discuss the importance of follow-up care with parents and caregivers may account for the low number of children who receive treatment for dental needs identified in the examination.</p>
<p>This project is an example of an effective model of a school-based oral care delivery system that can be replicated and implemented to address the oral needs of this population.</p>
