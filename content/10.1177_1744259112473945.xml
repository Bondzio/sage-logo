<abstract>
<p>Behavioural, physiological and psychological adaptive processes are presumed reasons for the discrepancies between predicted mean vote and observed comfort votes during field studies. However, few are known about the individual portions of these processes. An experimental design was developed, which aims at identifying those portions and is meant for climate chambers with operable windows facing the exterior. This article looks in detail at behavioural and physiological reactions together with their effect on the perceived level of comfort. By means of multivariate regression analyses, these reactions are analysed in order to assess differences due to variations in indoor/outdoor conditions as well as the number of interactive opportunities. One of the results shows that the restriction to keep the window closed is counterbalanced by an increased amount of physiological reactions, such as an increased level of skin temperature, together with an increase of still permitted actions such as drinking. The results highlight the importance of detailed insights into single aspect of adaptive processes for a better understanding of the phenomenon called ‘adaptive comfort’. Such approach is novel and important because a detailed knowledge and quantification of the occupant’s comfort perception in naturally ventilated buildings permits a planning with less uncertainty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The observation of comfort perception votes differing from those predicted, for example, by Fanger’s (1970) predicted mean vote (PMV) model, led to the development of the adaptive comfort model (see, for example, Nicol and Humphreys, 2002). The latter is based on the hypothesis that these differences are due to behavioural, physiological and psychological adaptive processes (Auliciems, 1981; De Dear et al., 1997; Humphreys and Nicol, 1998). Fanger and Toftum (2002) proposed to include a factor ‘e’ related to the expectation of the occupants. Such factor would deal with psychological processes. In addition, Yao et al. (2009) developed the concept of an adaptive coefficient, <italic>which reflects a human’s adaptive functions such as behavioural and psychological adaptation</italic>. However, besides giving a statistical approximation of the general effect of such adaptive processes on the thermal perception vote, few is known about the individual portions of the three types of adaptive processes to this effect.</p>
<p>Changing clothes, opening windows or using fans are behavioural adjustments in order to adjust the heat balance. These behavioural aspects can be related to psychological reactions to stimuli as a coping mechanism of human beings. Physiological processes include acclimation, which can be divided into physiological reactions (e.g. sweating and vasodilation) and into adaptive processes to repeated stimuli (e.g. increased sweat volume with lowered loss of salt) (e.g. Hori, 1995; Parson, 1993). De Dear et al. (1997) described psychological adaptation as habituation and expectation.</p>
<p>Another factor, perceived control, was mentioned by Nikolopoulou and Steemers (2003). Having control over incidents and conditions in the environment and external stimuli is a need of humans (Fischer and Stephan, 1996): perceived control is the perceived ability for changing incidents effectively. The consequence can be the feeling of stress. Stress is described in several theories.</p>
<p>The amount of research related to the three adaptive processes decreases from the physiological reactions over the behavioural reactions to the psychological ones and interrelations are not addressed.</p>
<p>The objective of the research project presented here is the extension of the so-called static (the occupant is treated as a passive recipient of thermal stimuli (De Dear, 1997)) comfort models based on the representation of human thermoregulation in such a manner that they incorporate adaptive (re-)actions of the occupant. As a first step, an experimental design was developed for climate chambers connected to the exterior by means of operable windows (Schweiker et al., 2012).</p>
<p>This article explores the data gathered by a first implementation of this experimental design in summer 2010 with respect to the observed physiological, behavioural and psychological reactions. The research questions dealt with here are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1744259112473945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Whether and how much are the physiological, behavioural and psychological reactions influenced by indoor conditions, outdoor conditions and/or the number of interactive opportunities?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what degree do they influence on the thermal sensation vote (TSV)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The detailed knowledge and quantification of the occupant’s comfort perception with their reactions to various conditions permits a planning of so-called energy-saving concepts with less uncertainty. In addition, this would allow the designer of new buildings or retrofitting projects to concentrate on improving the most influential aspects (if applicable) and to increase thereby the thermal comfort and productivity of the individual office worker or occupant.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1744259112473945">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>For the first experimental phase, the following design was applied as described in detail in Schweiker (2012).</p>
<sec id="section4-1744259112473945">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In total, 21 male students were chosen as subjects based on their health conditions. Furthermore, they had to be younger than 31 years due to the higher probability of increased thermal expectations in this age group according to Bischof et al. (2002).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1744259112473945">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The subjects were asked to work on their own during eight non-consecutive days (in the following called sessions) for 8 h (from 9 p.m. till around 4.30 p.m. with 30-min lunch break) each in an office cell between June and September 2010.</p>
<p>These sessions were divided into six different conditions as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259112473945">Table 1</xref>. Conditions 0, A and B refer to the assumed degree of short-term acclimation and thermal conditions inside the office cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112473945">Figure 1</xref> shows a representation of the conditions with respect to the outdoor running mean and indoor operative temperature. The lines represent the acceptable conditions according to the categories I–III as defined in DIN EN 15251 (2007). The 0 condition was meant as baseline condition, where the subjects are not adapted to warm conditions, and the office cell is neither cooled nor heated with indoor conditions being within the acceptable operative temperatures according to the adaptive comfort standard. In condition A, the subjects are not adapted to warm conditions, but the office cell is heated by means of a ceiling panel without the subjects being informed about it. Compared to the acceptable conditions defined in DIN EN 15251 (2007), the operative temperatures are above those defined as acceptable for class I buildings. Condition B refers to adapted subjects and an office cell that is neither cooled nor heated as in condition 0. Due to higher outdoor temperatures, the operative temperature indoors is higher than in condition 0 but within the acceptable conditions defined in DIN EN 15251 (2007). The distinction between the conditions with adapted subjects and non-adapted subjects was based on a weighted running mean of the daily mean outdoor temperature (with <italic>α</italic> = 0.8) calculated according to DIN EN 15251 (2007). A running mean temperature below 20°C refers to conditions 0 and A, while those above were sorted as condition B.</p>

<p>Conditions i+/i− refer to the degree the behavioural adaptation processes were permitted. In condition i+, the subjects had the chance to adjust their clothes, open/close the window, move the external shading device and/or use a ceiling fan. In contrast, except for the adjustment of clothes, none of those actions was permitted in condition i−, and in addition, the level of clothing the subjects had to wear when entering the climate chamber of the University Wuppertal in the morning was communicated to them before the respective session.</p>
<p>In most sessions, two subjects were present at the same time. During their stay inside the office cell, the heart rate, skin moisture, skin temperature and core temperature were assessed. During the lunch break, the subjects had to leave the office cell, and lunch was provided in a standardized form consisting of two sandwiches. In order to avoid a distortion of the results due to a low indoor air quality, the ventilation rate was maintained at three air exchanges per hour for all sessions.</p>

<sec id="section6-1744259112473945">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The physical properties of the room were recorded with an AHLBORN comfort meter at a 2-min interval. The outdoor conditions were logged by a weather station on top of the adjacent building. The running mean outdoor temperature was calculated for each day based on the outdoor data according to DIN EN 15251.</p>
<p>During the sessions, the clothing level and the amount of liquids consumed were recorded. Also, the behaviour with respect to the state of the window, the fan and the sun shading device was collected.</p>
<p>Three times a day the core and the skin temperature and the skin moisture were stored with a medical device. The core temperature was measured at the beginning and at the end of the day. Skin and clothing surface temperatures and the subjects’ posture were evaluated by an infrared camera. The heart rate was recorded continuously. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744259112473945">Table 3</xref> gives an overview of devices and intervals for the physiological values.</p>

<p>Different kinds of questionnaires were completed before and during the sessions in order to gain a good description of the subjects themselves and their feelings. At the start of each session, paper–pencil-based questionnaires were handed out containing, for example, several items related to the thermal expectation, the clothing level and the general sense of physiological well-being (Frank, 2010). The thermal sensation, preference and acceptance as well as the self-assessment manikin (SAM) for self-perceived level of pleasure, arousal and dominance (Lang et al., 1993) were evaluated every hour via a computer-based questionnaire. The thermal acceptance was judged on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (comfortable) to −4 (not comfortable at all). The thermal sensation and preference votes were collected by a 7-point scale each, which were verbally labelled from −3 to +3 from very cold to very warm/very much cooler to very much warmer. The question ‘What is the temperature doing with you at the moment?’ was answered by rating on a 9-point scale of SAMs, that is, a picture-based emotional rating scale. At the end of each session, thermal perception and sensation (Bischof et al., 1999) were recorded.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112473945">Figure 2</xref>, the conditions during the sessions with respect to operative temperature and running mean outdoor temperature could not be conducted as planned (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112473945">Figure 1</xref>), so that conditions 0, A and B cannot be regarded as distinct conditions. This was mainly due to the few control opportunities of the indoor conditions. Therefore, the following procedures were chosen as analysis methods for the data related to three types of adaptive processes.</p>

<p>including the operative temperature, T<sub>op</sub>, the running mean outdoor temperature, T<sub>rm</sub>, a binary variable representing the interaction type of the session (i− = 0, i+ = 1) and the coefficients, b<sub>1</sub>–b<sub>21</sub>, together with the constant a. T<sub>op</sub> is thereby taken as replacement for the differences in the indoor conditions and T<sub>rm</sub> for the outdoor conditions generated through the application of the experimental design. In addition, the subject ID was added as a factor variable to the models. These variables have been included because the data are based on repeated measures of few subjects (17). Therefore, the addition of the subject ID is meant to deal with all differences due to individual preferences or characteristics. Even though, day-to-day changes in the physiological and psychological constitution cannot be neglected by such procedure, a high number of individual differences are thought to be included in such variables.</p>
<p>Such models allow the following observations:</p>
<list id="list2-1744259112473945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The coefficient and significance level of T<sub>op</sub> represents the change in the dependent variable due to different indoor conditions, while all other factors remain the same;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>For the interaction type, the influence of control opportunities can be observed;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The values for the subject ID give an idea related to individual differences.</p></list-item>

<p>In addition to the models based on the whole data set, individual models were developed for the subsets containing the data from one of the two interaction types. Even though the interaction type is included as a variable in the models based on the full data set, the comparison between models derived from the two distinct conditions leads to further insights.</p>

<p>with all variables included in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1744259112473945">equation (1)</xref> except the interaction type. This is because the models for the state of window, fan and sun shading are based solely on the data from the i+ sessions because those actions were not permitted during the other sessions.</p>
<p>In addition, also the clothing level of the occupants and the state of the other two controls were included in the model. That is, for the first time, the window opening behaviour is set in relation not only to the indoor and outdoor conditions as done by various authors (see, for example, Haldi and Robinson, 2009; Rijal et al., 2008) but also to the clothing level and other interaction types.</p>

<title>Analysis of psychological aspects</title>
<p>The different questions concerning thermal comfort and feelings were analysed separately, each with one analysis of variance (ANOVA) (2 × 3 design). The ANOVA is a statistical instrument to evaluate the influence of independent variables (here: control and type of session) on dependent variables (here: thermal sensation, performance, …). Also, interactions between these variables can be examined. With this procedure, the part of random variation is compared to the part of systematic variation, which can be traced back to the independent variables. In case the systematic variation is higher than the random variation, there is a significant difference between the tested groups. The F-test is used in this context and can be transformed to a level of significance denoted by the letter ‘p’. The value of ‘p’ describes the probability that there are no differences between the tested conditions.</p>

Compared to the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259112473945">Table 2</xref>, it can be observed that the operative temperatures are not equal in conditions 0 and A as planned. The operative temperatures are equal between A and B which was not planned. However, they are not equal as planned between conditions A and B and comparing the i− with the i+ sessions. Condition B as well as the i− sessions are warmer compared to condition A and the i+ sessions, respectively. During the A session, this is due to the ability to open the window and improve thereby the indoor conditions by means of incoming cool outdoor air compared to the superficially heated indoor air.</p>

For the model of the window state, the data from the two existing windows were aggregated. Whenever one of them was tilted or open, the overall state was taken to be open. Looking at the model for the window opening behaviour, all variables except the state of the sun shading device turn out to be highly statistically significant. The same is true for the model of fan state. The model for the sun shading state needs to be observed with cautiousness due to its intercept being not statistically significant and the huge error term assigned to it, which – besides significant variables – leads to random outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This investigation focuses on an experimental design in order to investigate adaptive processes in human beings. Effects of having control over the thermal environment and different thermal conditions inside and outside the building cell were tested. Schweiker et al. (2012) discuss the developed experimental design itself, which is therefore excluded from this article. It should be mentioned that there might be other variables influencing the observed differences such as the outdoor temperature during the morning, differences between those having had control before compared to those who never had it or discomfort due to glare effects during the i− sessions, when no measures to avoid it where allowed. These aspects should be kept in mind when following the discussion. Further in-depth analysis will be conducted once more data are gathered through a continuous application of the developed experimental design; this article is meant to give a first overview of the data and to discuss first tendencies.</p>

<title>Clothing level</title>
<p>The models presented for the clothing level suggest that the adaptation of clothes cannot be fully suppressed by the method applied, that is, by telling the subjects on the phone 1 week before a session that they were allowed to wear only a certain level of clothes. However, the dependency of the clothing level on the outdoor conditions was lowered by a factor of 3. It would be interesting to investigate further whether such relationship applies to real-office environments with or without dress codes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the regression model for the i+ sessions, for which no clothing level was demanded, is similar to the regression model for the clothing level given by De Carli et al. (2007)</p>

<p>While the intercept is equal, the slope is smaller in case of the study by De Carli et al. One reason could be that the outdoor mean temperature was used in the study by De Carli et al., while the running mean of the outdoor temperature was used in this article.</p>

<title>State of window, fan and sun shading device</title>
<p>The logistic regression models presented here cannot be compared to the various models presented in the literature mentioned above. This is due to the addition of the interaction with other behavioural actions. Such addition is arguable and needs to be looked at more in detail in further analyses.</p>
<p>Noteworthy is the negative sign for T<sub>rm</sub> in the model of the fan state. This could signify that there is less fan usage with prolonged periods of warm outdoor conditions, that is, an adaptive effect. However, further analyses are necessary to support or reject this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the first implementation of this experimental design was based on an all-or-nothing basis, that is, the subjects were allowed to interact with window, fan and sun protection or with none of them. For future implementations, a more fine-grained variation in the number and type of interactive opportunities, including, for example, personal ventilation systems, would be meaningful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1744259112473945">
<title>Amount of liquid intake</title>
<p>Comparing the intercept of the i− model with that of the i+ model, a difference around 0.5l can be observed, with the higher value present in the i− model. This suggests that the restriction of interactive opportunities is counterbalanced by an increased intake of liquids in order to maintain thermal equilibrium.</p>

<title>Core and skin temperature</title>
<p>The differences between the i− model and the i+ model signify a higher thermal strain to the thermoregulatory system in case less interactive opportunities are available. A further careful analysis of the data is necessary to verify whether this effect is due to other physical variables such as an increased air velocity in the i+ session or due to a higher level of stress imposed by the non-permitted actions.</p>

<sec id="section32-1744259112473945">
<title>Level of skin hydration</title>
<p>The running mean temperature gets statistically highly significant in the derived regression models. According to these models, the level of skin hydration increased with a higher running mean temperature. This is congruent with literature on physiological adaptation to heat (see, for example, Hori, 1995 or Pandolf, 1998), which states an increased sweat volume with lowered salt concentration as physiological adaptation to heat.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1744259112473945">
<title>Heart rate</title>
<p>The coefficient for the running mean temperature is significant for the i+ model of heart rate but not for the i− model. Furthermore, its sign is negative for the former but positive for the latter. A negative sign implies a lower heart rate with all other variables being the same in case of a higher running mean temperature. This is in accordance with Hori (1995), who states that a repeated exposure to heat reduces the observed increase in heart rate due to high temperatures. Even though this has to be investigated further, the difference between the i+ and i− models might also show a difference between closely controlled buildings without occupants’ interaction and naturally ventilated buildings.</p>

<sec id="section34-1744259112473945">
<title>Psychological aspects</title>
<p>Subjects also rated their subjective feelings concerning the temperature with a visual-based questionnaire (SAM). People feel happier (SAM valence) in case they have control over the environment. Control seems to be related to perceived self-efficacy and subjective well-being (Oesterreich, 1981) in case indoor temperature rises moderately.</p>
<p>In session A, in which subjects worked in a thermal environment that was warmer than the prediction of the adaptive comfort model, the perceived arousal was higher in case the subjects had no control. This is according to Fischer and Stephan (1996). If people have control over their environment, it is possible to influence the amount of stimulation. Perceived dominance was also rated differently in relation to the different types of sessions and conditions of control: having control over the thermal environment leads to a high level of perceived dominance. However, without control, people feel less dominant, which was observed especially in session A and in session B, where thermal conditions are nearly the same, when indoor temperature is higher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-1744259112473945">
<title>Thermal sensation and preference vote</title>
<p>The TSVs are also dependent on conditions of control. In case subjects have control over the thermal conditions, they feel more ‘neutral’ inside the office cell during the day, and only in case of high outdoor temperatures, they feel a little bit warmer. Compared to the conditions of no control, they felt about 1 point warmer on ASHRAE scale in all type of sessions. Therefore, it seems that an increased level of control can influence the thermal sensation in naturally ventilated offices. Concerning the thermal preference votes, control is likewise an influencing factor. Subjects rated their thermal preference as cooler in case they have no control. This describes more satisfaction with the thermal environment.</p>

<sec id="section36-1744259112473945">
<title>Individual differences</title>
<p>Looking at the statistical significance and the magnitude of the coefficients assigned to the factors of the variables related to the subject ID allows us to get an impression concerning the variation and effect of individual differences on each of the dependent variables. Starting with the models related to the clothing level, the range of the coefficients, for example, for the model based on all data, is with 0.23 CLO similar to a 10-K change in the running mean outdoor temperature (10 × 0.025). This shows the importance to carefully address and consider individual differences in this case. Looking at the other regression models presented in this article in the same manner, a factor of 5–20 in the magnitude between individual differences, and, for example, the operative temperature, can be observed for all models.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>For the first time, data from experiments designed to give detailed insights into single aspect of the adaptive processes were analysed by means of ANOVA and multivariate analyses. Subjects have worked about 8 h for 8 days in this office. Effects of having control over the thermal environment and different thermal conditions inside and outside the building cell were tested.</p>
<p>It can be seen that having control over the thermal environment is an important item concerning the feeling of comfort. The possibility of using fans, sun shading devices and windows makes people feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>In general, the restriction in interactive opportunities such as opening a window leads to an increased amount of physiological reactions such as an increased level of skin temperature or skin hydration. In addition, still permitted actions to balance the thermoregulation system such as drinking are performed more often.</p>
<p>The running mean of the mean outdoor temperature was statistically significant for all observed behavioural and physiological reactions except the amount of liquid intake, the skin temperature measured at the forehead and the TSV. However, it turned out to be statistically significant for the sessions with an increased number of interactive opportunities, which supports the distinction made between buildings with and without the opportunity for the occupant to open a window.</p>
<p>This observation is supported by the variable related to the type of session with respect to the interaction. Except for the level of clothing and the amount of liquid intake, this variable is highly statistically significant. The regression model for the TSV as dependent variable states a difference of one category due to this factor, that is, the availability of control opportunities leads to a 1 point lower sensation of the thermal conditions on the 7-point ASHRAE scale. This highlights the importance of interaction opportunities as a measure to increase the thermal sensation.</p>
<p>Perceived arousal is not significantly higher in case of having no control, but in session A, a difference is shown: higher perceived arousal is evaluated without having control than in case of having control. Further investigations are necessary to understand the relationships between thermal conditions and arousal. For the Yerkes–Dodson law, it is perhaps necessary to investigate the relationship between arousal and performance for every person separately because of different levels of optimum performance.</p>
<p>In addition, individual differences between the subjects are highlighted, which lead to variations in the outcome variables related to changes between 5 and 10 K in the physical variables. Such individual differences have to be explored further.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results presented are based on a rather small sample due to a first implementation of the newly developed experimental design. Further implementations and analyses are encouraged in order to verify the results described here. The authors therefore invite researchers dealing with adaptive comfort studies to apply the introduced experimental design to their settings and to share their results. In order to gain further detailed knowledge about the coherence, specific analyses of separate types of sessions and the impact on the subjective assessments together with moderator variables like sensitivity to climate will be examined in the near future. In this context, further analyses will be conducted in order to assess the validity of the results presented here by carefully assessing the differences in the physical conditions.</p>
