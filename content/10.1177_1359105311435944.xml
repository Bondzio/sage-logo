<abstract>
<p>We tested whether framing a message as a gain or loss would alter its effectiveness by using a dichotic listening procedure to selectively present a health related message to the left or right hemisphere. A significant goal framing effect (losses &gt; gains) was found when right, but not left, hemisphere processing was initially enhanced. The results support the position that the contextual processing style of the right hemisphere is especially sensitive to the associative implications of the frame. We discussed the implications of these findings for goal framing research, and the valence hypothesis. We also discussed how these findings converge with prior valence framing research and how they can be of potential use to health care providers.</p>

<p>Predicting how an advertisement will affect the desirability of a product or service is a central goal not only for marketers and advertising agencies but also for health care providers, emergency information officials and anyone needing to communicate important information. Essential for this task is an understanding of how the ‘frame’ of a message will influence its effectiveness. A frame is a person’s conceptualization of the outcomes, acts and contingencies associated with a particular choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311435944">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981</xref>). While several different types of framing manipulations exist, a distinction relevant to persuasive messages is made between attribute and goal framing. Both vary the positive (gains) or negative (losses) valence of information that remains objectively equivalent but each is driven by different psychological processes and they are functionally distinct (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311435944">Keren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref> for a review). In attribute framing, for example, a positively valenced attribute frame for the product of beef might describe it as 85% lean whereas the negatively valenced frame would describe the same beef as 15% fat. Individuals are typically asked to provide preference ratings for the framed products, and positively framed attributes tend to elicit higher product ratings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311435944">Levin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311435944">Levin and Gaeth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1988</xref>). These results (gain &gt; loss) have been found in most attribute framing studies and a reversal has generally not been found (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311435944">Piñon and Gambara, 2005</xref>). Thus, attribute framing effects can be accounted for by associative processes – positive frames increase and negative frames decrease product ratings by associating the product with the desirable or undesirable aspects of the attribute, respectively. This pattern is typically reversed, however, in response to goal framed messages.</p>
<p>In goal framing, a gain framed message might state: ‘The higher the SPF you use, the less you will be harmed by the sun’s rays.’ The corresponding loss framed message would then state: ‘The lower the SPF you use, the more you will be harmed by the sun’s rays.’ While both messages provide the same information about the relationship between SPF level and the amount of harm the sun’s rays can do, they do so in subjectively different ways. In studies involving goal framing, participants typically read either a gain or loss framed message and then rate how likely they are to adopt the behavior being promoted; this rating is used to indicate which message is the most persuasive. Contrary to findings for attribute framing, in goal framing, loss versus gain framed messages have typically been found to be more persuasive (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One notable exception to this pattern of findings for goal framing involves messages promoting health behaviors that can be regarded as either prevention or detection behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311435944">Rothman and Salovey, 1997</xref>). Generally speaking, prevention behaviors (e.g. sunscreen use, condom use) are those that infer relatively little risk and reduce or eliminate the possibility of a health issue that one does not already have. Detection behaviors (e.g. mammography screening, breast self-examination) on the other hand are seen as relatively riskier because they are meant to detect the presence of a health issue one already has. While these definitions are sometimes stretched – some objectively low risk behaviors (e.g. HPV vaccination) are included with detection behaviors because they involve subjectively more risk – a number of studies have found typical goal framing effects (loss &gt; gain) in regard to detection behaviors but a reverse effect (gain &gt; loss) for prevention behaviors like the one used in the current study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311435944">Detweiler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311435944">Rothman et al., 1993</xref>). This pattern of results is consistent with prospect theory, which predicts that individuals will tend to be risk-averse when information is framed in terms of gains but risk-seeking when framed in terms of losses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311435944">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311435944">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of more than one meta-analysis, however, call the reliability of these findings into question (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311435944">Piñon and Gambara, 2005</xref>). In these reviews, an advantage for loss versus gain framed messages was found in the vast majority of studies. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311435944">Piñon and Gambara (2005)</xref> analysis, for example, the estimated effect size for goal framing was <italic>d</italic> = .44, with no reverse effects reported and the majority of studies belonging to the health domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al. (1998)</xref> identified several instances in which no goal framing effect was observed and suggest that the effect could reverse in some low risk situations, but argue that the vast majority of studies have found loss versus gain framed messages to be more effective, regardless of the amount of risk entailed. Thus, while the current study employs a goal framed message regarding sunscreen use, we make the relatively normative prediction that loss versus gain framed messages will be more effective.</p>
<p>So <italic>why</italic> does the typical pattern of response differ between attribute and goal framing? Several distinctions between these manipulations may each contribute. For instance, goal framing varies numerous linguistic and contextual cues not manipulated in attribute frames, and presumably involves processes in addition to the associative process involved in attribute framing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref>). One of these processes, which many researchers view as underlying the goal framing effect, results in ‘loss aversion’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311435944">Gamliel and Herstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311435944">Keren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al., 1998</xref>). According to this loss aversion account, the potential gains individuals typically see in adopting a given behavior (gain frame) are relatively less than the potential losses they face if they do not engage in the behavior (loss frame); thus, because ‘losses loom larger than gains’ loss framed messages are typically more persuasive than gain framed messages. Loss aversion does not, however, appear to play a role in attribute framing. Instead, only an associative process that encodes the critical information contained within the frame with the positive or negative valence of the frame is required to account for typical attribute framing effects (gain &gt; loss).</p>
<p>Furthermore, attribute frames tend to involve the relatively simple manipulation of a single numeric value (a percentage) whereas goal frames vary the positive or negative valence of multiple message arguments that may or may not include a numerical element. This may make it easier to infer the logical opposite of attribute versus goal framed messages (i.e. infer that 85% lean ground beef implies 15% fat ground beef), which would have different consequences for product ratings between framing types. That is, according to the functional diagrams for each type of framing provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311435944">Levin et al. (1998)</xref> gain versus loss attribute frames influence product ratings in opposite directions whereas goal frames influence ratings in the same direction. Because of this, inferring the logical opposite of an attribute frame will tend to draw ratings together and reduce the overall framing effect whereas inferring the opposite of a goal frame will only increase its effectiveness. Thus, goal frames and attribute frames differ both in the number and types of processes involved, and in how each type of frame functions. Therefore, it is not clear how or even if manipulations affecting attribute frames would affect goal frames. In the current study, we investigated how relative hemispheric activation (induced via dichotic listening) would influence responses to a goal framed message.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105311435944">
<title>Hemisphere activation</title>
<p>The left and right hemispheres process information differently from one another – the right hemisphere processes information in a relatively holistic/contextual fashion whereas the left hemisphere processes information inferentially/analytically (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311435944">Banich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311435944">Friedman and Forster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311435944">Levy, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311435944">McElroy and Seta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311435944">Ornstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311435944">Van Lancker and Kempler, 1987</xref>). Building on these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al. (2010b)</xref> proposed that the holistic/contextual style of the right hemisphere is not likely to de-contextualize a frame making it especially conducive to the associative implications of the frame for choices and evaluations. In contrast, the inferential/analytical style of the left hemisphere is not tied to the framing context and is likely to decontextualize the situation, thereby neutralizing the associative implications of positive and negative frames. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311435944">McCormick and Seta (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al. (2010b)</xref> used an attribute framing manipulation to test this position. The role of associations is clearly seen in this manipulation in that characterizing a product in a favorable way (e.g. water is 99% pure) tends to evoke positive associations whereas characterizing the same product in an unfavorable way (water is 1% impure) tends to evoke negative ones (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311435944">Levin and Gaeth, 1988</xref>). The activation of these positive or negative associations leads to a ‘valence consistent shift’ in evaluations; the product is evaluated more positively when framed in a favorable versus unfavorable manner. This differential processing of contextual information account was supported; an attribute framing effect was found when information was initially processed in a participant’s right hemisphere but not when the same information was processed in the left hemisphere.</p>
<p>Would similar results be observed for goal framed messages? Because goal framing, like attribute framing, varies the positive or negative valence of information that remains objectively equivalent, differences in susceptibility to the associative implications of the frame between the left and right hemispheres seem likely to be important for goal framing as well. If the right hemisphere is more susceptible to the associative implications of the frame then differences in how people respond to positively or negatively valenced information should be more pronounced when right versus left hemisphere processing is enhanced. This effect should be observed independent of whether the loss frame is more or less effective than the gain frame. If the loss frame is more effective, as it should be if negative associations are more salient than positive ones, then we should find that individuals who initially process the message in the right-holistic (contextual) hemisphere should be most affected by the loss frame. On the other hand, when the message is initially processed in the left-inferential (analytical) hemisphere, the frame should not matter or should have less of an influence because associations between the frame and the message are relatively less direct and less influential in this hemisphere. If findings, however, support predictions from prospect theory then the direction of the framing effect would differ; the gain frame would be most effective. Nevertheless, as long as associations play a critical role in determining the strength of the goal framing effect, we should still observe a stronger framing effect when right hemisphere processing is enhanced. Thus, from our account, we do not predict whether the loss or gain frame will be most effective. Rather, the critical prediction is that the framing effect will be stronger when right versus left hemisphere processing is initially enhanced.</p>

<title>Valence hypothesis</title>
<p>The greater number of persuasive arguments and contextual cues manipulated in goal versus attribute frames may allow for affect to play a greater role in determining message persuasiveness. Certainly, the personal relevance of many goal framed messages (e.g. HPV vaccine, condom use) would seem to generate a greater amount of affect than the product features often described in attribute frames. This might result in a pattern of results for goal framing that is more consistent with the valence hypothesis than previously observed for attribute framing. According to this hypothesis, the left hemisphere is relatively more sensitive to positive information whereas the right hemisphere is more sensitive to negative information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311435944">Alfano and Cimino, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311435944">Canli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311435944">Davidson, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311435944">1995</xref>: 361–387). Support for this view has been found in a number of brain imaging studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311435944">Canli et al. (1998)</xref> presented participants with images that were either positive or negative in valence and measured brain reactivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Positive pictures included a happy couple, brownies, and puppies, whereas negative pictures included crying people, spiders, and a gun. When controlling for arousal, greater activity was observed in the left versus right hemisphere in response to positive images, but the reverse was true for negative images. Thus, in addition to differing in their overall processing style, the hemispheres differ in their sensitivity to positive and negative information. A persuasive advantage for one frame over the other seems likely to arise from this difference in sensitivity as information is likely to be processed more thoroughly and efficiently in the hemisphere that is relatively more sensitive and more active; this increased processing should result in more extensive cognitions which are expected to increase persuasiveness similar to elaboration effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311435944">Petty and Cacioppo, 1984</xref>). For goal framed messages, this should result in an advantage for gain versus loss framed messages initially presented to the left hemisphere but an advantage for loss versus gain framed messages presented to the right hemisphere. The current study will begin to investigate whether the valence hypothesis or a differential processing account of contextual information more accurately predicts responses to lateralized goal frame messages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359105311435944">
<title>Summary and predictions</title>
<p>According to the differential processing of contextual information account, the relative effectiveness of framed information depends on whether it is processed inferentially/analytically in the left hemisphere or holistically/contextually in the right hemisphere. When information is processed in the left hemisphere, associations between the frame and the message are less direct and less influential, framing effects should be diminished or non-existent, and gain and loss framed messages should be equally effective. When the same information is processed holistically/contextually in the right hemisphere, however, individuals should be especially sensitive to the associative implications of the frame, and framing effects should be enhanced. Alternatively, the valence hypothesis predicts that gain framed messages should be more effective when processed in the left hemisphere but loss framed messages more effective when processed in the right hemisphere because the respective hemispheres are relatively sensitive to positive or negative information. Thus, both perspectives predict a significant framing effect when information is presented to the right hemisphere but they make different predictions for left hemisphere presentation – no framing effect is expected from the former perspective but from the latter, gain versus loss framed messages are expected to be rated significantly higher.</p>
<p>To test which view more accurately accounts for lateralized responses to goal framed messages, participants in the current study were presented with either a gain or loss framed message regarding sunscreen use in either their left or right ear, creating a 2 X 2 between subjects design. A dichotic listening task with white noise played in the unattended ear was used to present the message.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1359105311435944">
<title>Participants, design, and procedure</title>
<p>One-hundred and fifty-nine undergraduate students received partial course credit for their participation in the current study; two were excluded from the analysis, however, because they reported hearing loss in one ear, and three others were removed as the result of an outlier analysis (studentized residuals &gt; 2.5 for each). Thus, 154 participants were included in the main analysis. Individuals generally participated in groups of four. The message frame (gain or loss) and the hemisphere in which the message was initially processed (left or right) were varied in a 2 X 2 between subjects design.</p>
<p>After giving informed consent, participants were briefed on the procedure and essentials for taking part in the experiment. Then, to reduce any distractions, they were asked to wait outside of the lab while one person at a time, selected randomly, was exposed to one of four experimental conditions. Each participant listened to the message using headphones. Before the message was presented, however, handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh handedness inventory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311435944">Oldfield, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>A dichotic listening task was used to present a gain or loss framed message to the desired hemisphere – the message was played in the left ear and white noise was played in the right ear when the message was intended to be processed in the right hemisphere, and the reverse was true in the left hemisphere condition. This procedure has been shown to be a reliable means of inducing relative activation of the contralateral hemisphere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311435944">Stefanatos et al., 2008</xref>). The message promoted sunscreen use and was similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311435944">Detweiler et al. (1999)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1359105311435944">Appendix</xref>). Some information from the website of the American Cancer Society was included to ensure that the information was current. When the message finished playing, participants completed a five item measure of behavioral intentions and several comprehensibility items. Behavioral intentions have been shown previously to be a good indicator of actual behavior (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311435944">Hendriks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311435944">Pietersma and Dijkstra, 2011</xref>). After finishing these items participants were debriefed and released.</p>

<title>Measurement items</title>
<p>A five item questionnaire similar to the one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311435944">Detweiler et al. (1999)</xref> was used to assess behavioral intentions. Responding on a nine-point scale, participants were first asked ‘How likely are you to use sunscreen at the beach this summer?’ (1 = Not At All Likely, 9 = Very Likely); this question served as the main dependent variable of the study not only because it came first but also because it seemed to be the most relevant to participants’ intentions to adopt sunscreen use. Next, they were asked ‘How often do you intend to use sunscreen during daily activities?’ Responses to this item were given on a nine-point scale where 1 represented ‘Never’ and 9 represented ‘Always’. Subsequent questions included: ‘How many times would you apply sunscreen during the course of a full day at the beach (i.e. 10 am to 4 pm)?’ ‘What type of skin product do you intend to use this summer? Circle one: None, Tanning Oil, or Sunscreen’ and, if they circled Sunscreen, ‘What SPF do you plan to use?’</p>

<title>Comprehensibility items</title>
<p>Four additional items were included to ensure that both the task and the messages were understandable and that there were no systematic differences between conditions. These items were: ‘How difficult was it to hear the message on the headphones?’ (1 = very easy, 9 = very difficult), ‘Were you distracted from listening to the message?’ (1 = not at all, 9 = extremely), ‘Did you understand what your task was?’ (1 = completely, 9 = not at all), and ‘Overall, how comprehensible was the message?’ (1 = completely, 9 = not at all).</p>

<title>Main analysis</title>
<p>Participants’ likelihood ratings were submitted to an ANOVA with Hemisphere (left or right) and the Message Frame (gain or loss) entered as between subjects factors. This analysis revealed a main effect for Hemisphere <italic>F</italic>(1, 150) = 6.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, qualified by a significant Hemisphere X Frame interaction <italic>F</italic>(1, 150) = 4.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311435944">Table 1</xref> for means). Follow-up comparisons revealed a significant effect for the message frame when messages were initially presented to the right hemisphere, with the loss frame proving to be more effective than the gain frame <italic>t</italic>(77) = −2.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04, <italic>d</italic> = –.49, but no framing effect when the same messages were initially presented to the left hemisphere <italic>t</italic>(73) &lt; 1. Later analyses in which the participant pool was restricted to right-handers only, women only or to right-handed women only proved to be substantively similar, with no change in the overall pattern of means; these results attest to the reliability of the current findings in that no meaningful difference was observed when the population was more or less homogeneous. Subsequent analyses conducted on the other dependent measures failed to reveal a consistent pattern of results, and no other effects reached significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Participants in the current study were presented with either a gain or loss framed message in either the left or right hemisphere. It was predicted that if a differential processing of contextual information account provides the best explanation of hemispheric influences on goal framed messages, when messages were presented to the right-contextual hemisphere a significant effect for the frame would be found but that when the same messages were presented to the left-inferential hemisphere little or no framing effect would emerge. If, however, the valence hypothesis provides the more accurate account, gain versus loss framed messages would be most effective in the left hemisphere with the reverse being true in the right hemisphere.</p>
<p>Consistent with the differential processing of contextual information account, the difference in participants’ responses to gain versus loss framed messages was significantly greater when initially presented to the right than the left hemisphere. Specifically, loss frame messages (<italic>M</italic> = 6.97) were rated significantly higher than gain framed messages (<italic>M</italic> = 5.70) in the right-contextual hemisphere, but virtually no difference was observed for the same messages in the left-inferential hemisphere (<italic>Ms</italic> = 7.13 and 7.38, respectively). This relative difference in framing magnitude is consistent with previous work on attribute framing, supporting evidence that suggests the hemispheres differ in their susceptibility to associations between the frame and information contained within the frame (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al., 2010b</xref>). Apparently, because associations are relatively less direct and less influential when left hemisphere processing is enhanced, the message frame had little impact and ratings did not differ between conditions. Conversely, because associations are especially salient when right hemisphere processing is enhanced the message frame did have an impact and ratings differed between conditions. Furthermore, the direction of the framing effect also supports a ‘loss aversion’ interpretation – because losses loom larger than gains, the loss framed message was more persuasive than the gain framed one. In contrast, no support was observed for the valence hypothesis. This may have been due to the subtlety of our framing manipulation or that an insufficient amount of affect was generated to detect effects consistent with this hypothesis. Such results may be more likely when an especially affect laden decision is made, but future research will be needed to address this issue.</p>
<p>These results, along with those for risky-choice and attribute framing, all provide evidence that framing effects involve the manipulation of valence and are all stronger when right hemisphere processing is enhanced even though all of these framing manipulations involve different procedures and different processes; risky choice framing is another type of valence framing manipulation that involves a choice between a risk free and a relatively risk-seeking option, but was not discussed in the current article because it does not readily lend itself to use in persuasive messages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311435944">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311435944">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981</xref>). Nevertheless, conceptually similar results have been found for risky-choice framing in that typical framing effects were observed in the right but not left hemisphere conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311435944">Gallagher and Dagenbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311435944">McElroy and Seta, 2004</xref>). One commonality linking the three is that, for all three to be effective, perceivers must associate the frame with the message. That the right hemisphere is especially likely to make the association may be why logically similar findings – especially strong framing effects – have now been obtained for attribute framing, risky-choice framing and a goal framing manipulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311435944">Gallagher and Dagenbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311435944">McCormick and Seta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311435944">McElroy and Seta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the view proposed here and in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311435944">Seta et al. (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">2010b</xref>) papers is conceptually similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311435944">McElroy and Seta’s (2004)</xref> dual process account of risky-choice framing effects. Both views argue that framing effects, like the ones produced by risky-choice manipulations, are more effective for the contextually sensitive right versus analytically sensitive left hemisphere. The difference between the views lies in the role of associations. The account used here identifies a specific aspect of the context – associations – that is especially important for understanding when valence framing effects will be most effective. Thus, although hyper sensitivity to context increases the strength of framing effects for both accounts, it is the differential sensitivity to associations that alters the strength of framing effects for diverse manipulations, such as attribute, goal and risky-choice frames.</p>

<title>Application</title>
<p>In this article, we report results using a traditional dichotic listening manipulation. This type of manipulation is not especially conducive to applied settings, however, in that it is not practical to present different sounds to each ear. Nevertheless, our findings can be used to stimulate research using manipulations that are easily applicable. One such manipulation, stemming from Double Filtering by Frequency theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311435944">Ivry and Robertson, 1998</xref>), alters the relative frequency of a message that is heard binaurally by presenting background sounds that contain frequencies that are either higher or lower than the one provided by the message (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311435944">Gallagher and Dagenbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al., 2010b</xref>). Although this procedure can be used to present messages in everyday situations, a more applicable one is based on frequency amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311435944">McCormick and Seta, 2011</xref>). In this manipulation, participants listen to a message under ostensibly normal listening conditions – both ears are used and the same information is played in both ears. No headphones or other apparatus is required. Thus, participants enjoy a ‘normal’ listening experience and are unaware that anything unusual has occurred. Because of this, there is no reactance to the manipulation and it should be possible to use frequency amplification in applied settings. In health videos, whether viewed on DVD or on the internet, and in radio and television health advertisements are just some of the areas in which frequency amplification might be used. For health care providers and others, this could mean an increase in the number of people engaging in healthy behaviors. Given that this manipulation was only recently introduced, however, future work will be required to determine its effectiveness in real world situations.</p>

<sec id="section15-1359105311435944">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some might argue that recent neurological and affect-focused research has provided a more detailed view of hemispheric differences than the one provided in this article (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311435944">Gadea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311435944">Howard and Reggia, 2007</xref>). While this may be true, it is not the case that initial activation of one of the hemispheres is not useful in that this procedure has produced different responses across a variety of domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311435944">Janiszewski, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311435944">Ley and Bryden, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311435944">McElroy and Seta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al., 2010b</xref>). Further, it is not clear how any specific area of the brain could be selectively enhanced in an applied setting whereas it is possible to enhance the processing of an entire hemisphere by using procedures derived from Double Filtering by Frequency theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311435944">Ivry and Robertson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One might also argue that the transfer of information between hemispheres is likely to occur early and continuously during message processing, thereby negating the utility of procedures like the one used in the current study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311435944">Bloom and Hynd, 2005</xref> for a review). If this were the case, however, then it is not clear how performance differences could have been observed between hemispheres in any previous lateralization study; the volume of this evidence suggests that the early transfer of information is not the primary factor in determining how judgments and decisions are formed in the brain. Rather, the hemisphere that initially receives information stamps this information with its unique processing style. Furthermore, the asymmetric representation of information responsible for performance differences between the hemispheres may occur at some point beyond the sensory processing stage, obviating concerns about the early transfer of information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311435944">Ivry and Robertson, 1998</xref>). This is why identification but not detection tasks have consistently found hemispheric differences in response to high and low frequency information – the former task requires higher order processing whereas the latter requires only sensory processing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311435944">Kitterle et al., 1990</xref>). In the current study, because responding to framed information required more than sensory processing, we expected that whichever hemisphere received the information first would have a greater influence on the overall response. That is, although both hemispheres are believed to process information that is initially presented to only one hemisphere, the overall response emitted by a participant will be influenced more by the hemisphere that initially receives the information. This allows for the numerous hemispheric differences observed in previous studies, including the greater effect for attribute framing when right versus left hemispheric processing is enhanced (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311435944">McCormick and Seta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311435944">Seta et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>

<title>Hemispheric main effect</title>
<p>The effect for hemisphere, in which messages presented to the left hemisphere were rated higher overall than messages presented to the right hemisphere, may be worth investigating further. The same effect was found when participants indicated the number of times that they would use sunscreen and how important the issue of skin cancer is to them, making it the most consistent finding overall (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .02). Although speculative, one possible explanation is that the left hemisphere has a relative advantage in processing language and this allowed participants in the left hemisphere condition to process the message more efficiently and thoroughly than those in the right hemisphere condition. Certainly, a left hemisphere advantage in processing language has been well documented (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311435944">Foundas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311435944">Gregory et al., 2009</xref>). If messages were processed more efficiently/thoroughly in the left hemisphere and this mimicked elaboration effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311435944">Petty and Cacioppo, 1984</xref>) then message ratings should be expected to increase. In our view, this effect would be independent of the effect of processing differences between the hemispheres as the left hemisphere’s advantage for language pertains primarily to the content of the message, whereas the difference in persuasiveness due to processing styles is more the result of how information is presented (e.g. the frame). Future work will be needed, however, to determine the viability of this interpretation.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In the current study we investigated how the effectiveness of a framed message would be affected by selective presentation to either the left or right hemisphere and found that framing effects occurred when right – but not left – hemisphere processing was initially enhanced. These results were consistent with previous work using different framing manipulations, suggesting that these manipulations share some of the same psychological processes (associations). Finally, we discussed how these findings may be of use to health care providers.</p>

<p>According to the American Cancer Society, currently, more than one million skin cancers are diagnosed each year in the United States, most of which are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Exposing yourself to the sun is the surest way to get skin cancer. If you use[don’t use] sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, you decrease[increase] your chances of damaging your skin and bringing on an early death. UVB rays alter the DNA of your skin. If this affects the genes that control skin growth, skin cancer may be the result. Basically, protecting[not protecting] yourself from the sun will[won’t] help you stay healthy. UVA rays help age skin cells, so using[not using] sunscreen also decreases[increases] your risk for prematurely aged skin. The higher[lower] the SPF you use, the less[more] you will be harmed by the sun’s rays.
