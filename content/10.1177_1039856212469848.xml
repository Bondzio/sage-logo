<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome traditionally linked to schizophrenia. It is commonly associated with mood disorders and can also arise secondarily to a medical condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212469848">1</xref></sup> We describe a patient who presented with catatonia following relapse of a major depressive episode and who was found to have a co-morbid acute coronary syndrome, ‘Takotsubo cardiomyopathy’.</p>
<p>The patient was a 75 year old female with a past history of a major depressive episode with psychotic features whose index episode occurred 18 years ago. At that time, she was trialled on several antidepressants and received 11 ECT treatments with suboptimal response, before responding to moclobemide. She had remained stable until this relapse.</p>
<p>Her mental state deteriorated in the months leading to admission, resulting in her seeing her general practitioner (GP), who changed the antidepressant to escitalopram. She then had an inpatient medical admission due to concerns about confusion, hypertension and poor oral intake. When seen by consultation-liaison psychiatry, she displayed depressive symptoms, persecutory delusions and agitation. A thorough medical review was unremarkable apart from a mild hyponatraemia of 131 mmol/l. After a brief medical admission, she was transferred to the aged psychiatry inpatient unit, where she deteriorated rapidly over 72 hours with progressive psychomotor retardation, and became essentially mute. Given the acute decline, repeat medical investigations were performed in preparation for anticipated urgent ECT. We met with her family, who felt that this presentation mimicked the index episode. They were reluctant for their mother to receive ECT, given the past poor response. We discussed alternatives, which included a transfer to a medical ward for intravenous hydration, use of intravenous lorazepam for catatonic features and a nasogastric tube for nutrition and to provide medication.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed an abnormal ECG with ST elevation in V2–V5 and T-wave inversion in V4–V6. Cardiac enzymes showed a raised troponin of 3.85. Our patient was virtually mute and did not or could not communicate pain or distress. A diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome was made and the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit. Echocardiogram revealed extensive apical akinesis in the left ventricle as well as hyperdynamic basal left ventricular contractility. An angiogram was normal. The cardiology team’s diagnosis was Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The ECG and cardiac enzymes normalised.</p>
<p>In relation to her psychiatric management, the patient was commenced on lorazepam 1 mg t.d.s. and olanzapine 5 mg nocte. Moclobemide was titrated to a dose of 300 mg b.d. Within 24 hours, she began to improve. Her oral intake increased and she began to speak again. She was initially disorganised in thought and preoccupied with delusions of guilt and persecution. She was transferred back to the aged psychiatry inpatient unit after five days. She improved gradually and was discharged after a month. She subsequently returned to her premorbid level of functioning and remained well. A follow up echocardiogram was unremarkable.</p>
<p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy that mimics acute myocardial infarction and involves a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212469848">2</xref></sup> The Japanese name ‘Takotsubo’, meaning ‘fish pot for trapping octopus’, was coined due to the echocardiogram appearance of apical ballooning accompanied with a normal or hypercontractile base of the ventricle. The syndrome is also known as ‘stress cardiomyopathy’ or ‘broken heart syndrome’, as it is often precipitated by or associated with emotional stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212469848">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212469848">3</xref></sup> Around one-third of patients have no identified preceding stressful event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212469848">4</xref></sup> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also thought to be most common in post-menopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212469848">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been suggested that catecholamine excess, or an abnormal response to circulating catecholamines, is partially responsible for the syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212469848">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212469848">3</xref></sup> This might account for the association of the syndrome with heightened emotional stress. Other possibilities include transient vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction or apical stunning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212469848">2</xref></sup> In our case, it could be postulated that the patient’s anxiety, depressed mood and associated distress precipitated Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Mutism and profound psychomotor slowing were, in our opinion, the reasons why our patient was unable to communicate physical distress.</p>
<p>Treatments with a strong evidence base for use in catatonia are benzodiazepines and ECT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212469848">1</xref></sup> Although we commenced, concurrently, lorazepam, olanzapine and moclobemide, the initial improvement with increased oral intake and resolution of mutism likely reflected the effectiveness of lorazepam. The decision not to proceed with ECT, although clouded by the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), was also influenced by the family’s strong opposition to ECT and the past history of poor response to this treatment.</p>
<p>Another issue that arose was the cause of the catatonia. On balance, the catatonia was likely part of the depressive episode rather than the ACS. The latter, in our opinion, is best explained by a response to psychological distress. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of catatonia secondary to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, organic catatonia is known to respond well to benzodiazepines. Our patient responded quickly to treatment with lorazepam, albeit with olanzapine and moclobemide prescribed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Finally, this case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosing acute medical co-morbidity in patients who present with catatonic features. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained along with a low threshold to review physical examination findings and investigations. The consequences for our patient might have been far worse if, for example, the cause of the acute coronary syndrome was an acute myocardial infarct rather than Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, given that her inability to express physical distress would have likely delayed diagnosis, with a potentially fatal outcome.</p>
