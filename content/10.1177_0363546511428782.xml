<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: The shortage of autogenous grafts has often times been a problem in knee ligament reconstruction. There are little data concerning the use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) as an autograft.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: The AHPLT is a suitable graft with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Descriptive laboratory study and case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: The safety and efficacy of using the AHPLT as an autograft source were evaluated. A cadaveric study was first done to reveal the anatomic profile of the AHPLT, to test its failure load, and to compare it with that of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. Then, a cadaveric harvest study was performed to show it was safe and reproducible. The space between the tendon stripper and the peroneal nerve during harvesting of the AHPLT was evaluated. Lastly, a clinical study was performed to evaluate donor site morbidity. The preoperative and postoperative foot and ankle functions of 92 patients who underwent a variety of knee ligament reconstructions with the AHPLT were followed for more than 2 years and were then evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) to determine the influence of tendon removal on ankle and foot function.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The average failure load of the AHPLT was 322.35 ± 63.18 N, accounting for 97.69% ± 19.48% and 147.94% ± 41.30% of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, respectively. During tendon harvesting, the distance between the head of the tendon stripper and the branching point of the deep peroneus nerve was 4.6 to 10.4 cm. The clinical study showed that the preoperative and postoperative AOFAS scores were 97.4 ± 2.0 and 97.2 ± 1.6 (<italic>P</italic> = .85), respectively, while the FADI scores preoperatively and postoperatively were 96.8 ± 2.2 and 96.9 ± 2.5 (<italic>P</italic> = .91), respectively. No signs of peroneus nerve injury, peroneus longus tendon rupture, or tendinopathy were found.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The AHPLT is acceptable for use as an autograft with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.</p>

<body>
<p>Knee ligament reconstructions are common procedures used to restore knee stability and function. Although there are many theoretical autograft or allograft choices, shortages in the supplies of grafts are often experienced, especially after considering the drawbacks of using allografts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428782">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511428782">37</xref></sup> autogenous bone–patellar tendon–bone grafts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428782">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428782">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428782">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511428782">35</xref></sup> or quadriceps tendon grafts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428782">16</xref></sup> especially for multiligament reconstructions, multibundle single-ligament reconstructions, or revision surgeries. There are few studies in the literature concerning the acceptability of autogenous graft sources other than hamstring tendons, the patellar tendon, the quadriceps tendon, and the fascia lata.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428782">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup> From our perspective, the prerequisites for a tendon structure to be an ideal autograft donor should be that the potential autograft should have an acceptable amount of strength, it should be easily and safely harvested, and its removal from the donor site should not result in any obvious functional impairment.</p>
<p>The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) may represent a potential autograft, as it is superficial in the distal leg and can be easily harvested. However, the PLT has important functions in plantar flexion of the ankle, eversion of the sole of the foot, maintenance of the transverse arch, and steadying of the leg upon the foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428782">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511428782">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428782">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511428782">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511428782">36</xref></sup> Segmental removal of the PLT may result in the functional loss of the peroneus longus muscle. Thus, we wanted to use a split half of the tendon to preserve the PLT and its connection to the muscle. In our pilot study, we found that the anterior fibers of the PLT are longer than the posterior fibers; thus, we wanted to use the anterior half of the tendon as a graft. However, there were very little data concerning the use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) as a suitable graft. Thus, we attempted to determine whether the AHPLT could be an appropriate graft using cadaveric and clinical studies. Our hypothesis was that the AHPLT would be an acceptable autogenous graft with respect to the anatomic/biomechanical profile, safety, and donor site morbidity.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study included 2 parts: a cadaveric study and a clinical study. Between January 2007 and May 2007, cadaveric studies were first performed to evaluate the failure load of the AHPLT and the potential risks associated with the harvesting of the graft. After obtaining the biomechanical and anatomic results from the cadaveric study, we felt satisfied with the strength of the tendon and the low potential risk of harvesting the AHPLT. Thus, we began to use the AHPLT as an autograft in our clinical practice, with approval from our institutional review board; at the same time, we began the second part of this study to evaluate donor site morbidity as well as the influence of tendon removal on the function of the ankle and foot.</p>

<title>Cadaveric Study</title>
<sec id="section3-0363546511428782">
<title>Anatomy and Failure Load Testing</title>
<p>Twenty unpaired, fresh-frozen, human cadaveric lower extremities from patients who died between the ages of 56 and 84 years (median, 73 years) were used to evaluate the anatomy of the AHPLT, with respect to the posterior half of the PLT and the surrounding tissue, and for failure load testing. The specimens were thawed at room temperature and prepared via removal of a 4-cm-wide skin flap along the peroneus longus muscle and tendon from the lateral side of the fibula at its proximal two thirds, through its posterolateral side at its distal one third and the lateral side of the calcaneus, to the underside of the foot. The peroneus longus muscle was exposed and was macroscopically dissected with a focus on the portion of the muscle and tendon above the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus. The PLT was divided into anterior and posterior sections of equal width. The anterior section was transected at the level of the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus and harvested proximally using a 6-mm-wide tendon stripper. A 4-cm-wide skin flap at the medial side of the proximal tibia over the sartorius membrane was then removed. The semitendinosus tendon and the gracilis tendon at its insertion site were then exposed and released from the tibia. The tendons were then harvested using a tendon stripper.</p>
<p>The muscle tissue was scraped off of the 3 tendons. The tendon was first cut near the muscle end at a point where the tendon volume was approximately 50% of its thickest diameter. Then, the length of the tendon was measured, and the result was considered its usable length. After length measurement, each tendon was truncated near the muscle end to produce a 20-cm-long segment for biomechanical testing. Each end of the tendon was sutured with 2 No. 2 polyester sutures in a whipstitch style to give a total length of approximately 15 mm, thus creating a block to securely hold the tendon by the fixation sutures during later testing. The tendons were stored at −20°C until the time of testing.</p>
<p>At the time of testing, the specimens were thawed at room temperature. Instron Series 5500 Loading Frames (Instron Corporation, Norwood, Massachusetts) were used to evaluate the maximal force at which failure occurred and the stiffness of the tendon at a temperature of 25°C ± 2°C and a moisture concentration of 60%. Two special hooks, each with an 8-mm-wide transverse rod, were fabricated for the testing; they were then clamped on the Instron Series 5500 Loading Frames. Two No. 6 polyester sutures were used to strap each tendon end at the medial side of the formerly sutured portion. The tendon was wrapped once around the transverse rod of the hook. The No. 6 polyester sutures were tied to the adjusting rod of the clamps. Through the adjustment of the fixation sutures at the 2 ends, a 10-cm-long tendon segment was left between the 2 rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428782">Figure 1</xref>). With a maximal load of 3000 N, tensile force was applied at a rate of 10 mm/min of material elongation until the point at which the tendon began to rupture. An immediate bias-loading curve was obtained from the connected computer recording system. The failure load and stiffness of the 3 tendons were recorded.</p>

<title>Harvesting Risk Evaluation</title>
<p>A second set of 20 unpaired, fresh-frozen, human cadaveric lower extremities from patients who had died between the ages of 58 and 81 years (mean, 71 years) were used to evaluate the risk of harvesting. The specimens were thawed at room temperature.</p>
<p>A 2-cm-long longitudinal incision was made at the posterolateral side of the fibula and just over the peroneus tendon 2 cm proximal to the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus. The deep fascia was dissected to expose the PLT, which was then levered out of the skin window with a mosquito hemostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428782">Figure 2A</xref>). The tendon was separated into 2 equal parts, anterior and posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428782">Figure 2B</xref>), with another mosquito hemostat. Then, the AHPLT was sutured with one No. 2 polyester suture in a whipstitch style with the distal site as the supposed tendon end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428782">Figure 2C</xref>). With the ankle and foot in plantar flexion and the tendon pulled proximally, the AHPLT was severed at its most distal section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428782">Figure 2D</xref>). Then, a 6-mm-wide tendon stripper was used to harvest the AHPLT in a proximal direction.</p>

<p>At the point at which the muscle was stripped off and the tendon could be pulled out, the pushing motion on the tendon stripper stopped, and the stripper was left in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511428782">Figure 3</xref>). Then, an incision was made along the lateral side of the fibula from the fibular head to the head of the tendon stripper. The common peroneus nerve, in addition to all of its branches around the fibular neck, was exposed, and the site at which the common peroneal nerve gives rise to the deep peroneal nerve was defined. The distance between the tendon stripper and the peroneal nerve was evaluated, especially with respect to the distance between the head of the tendon stripper and the defined branching point of the deep peroneal nerve.</p>

<title>Clinical Morbidity Evaluation</title>
<p>The clinical study consisted of a retrospective study of prospectively gathered data. From July 2007 to January 2008, 100 patients undergoing knee ligament reconstruction with the AHPLT as a graft were included for prospective data collection. Approval from the ethics committee of our institution was obtained.</p>
<p>During that time period, the first primary indication for using the AHPLT was medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction, as we thought it was easier to harvest the AHPLT than to harvest a hamstring tendon. We used the AHPLT for other procedures because of limits in autograft options. The second primary indication for using the AHPLT as a graft was multiligament reconstruction of the knee. In simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, we often used the semitendinosus tendon from the same leg to produce a 4-stranded graft for single-bundle ACL reconstruction and used the gracilis tendon and AHPLT from the same leg to produce a 6-stranded graft for single-bundle PCL reconstruction. In PCL and posterolateral or posteromedial complex reconstruction, we used the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons for single-bundle or double-bundle PCL reconstruction and used the AHPLT for posterolateral or posteromedial complex reconstruction. Other indications for using the AHPLT as a graft included multibundle single-ligament reconstruction, especially double-bundle PCL reconstruction. In PCL reconstruction, the semitendinosus tendon was always sufficiently long and thick to produce a 4-stranded graft to reconstruct one bundle of the PCL; however, the gracilis tendon was generally not long enough or thick enough to produce a graft of sufficient length and width. We often used the AHPLT, in addition to the gracilis tendon, to produce a 6-stranded graft of sufficient length and width to reconstruct the other bundle of the PCL. In double-bundle ACL reconstruction, when we found that the gracilis tendon was too thin while harvesting the semitendinosus tendon (in about 10% of the cases), we harvested the AHPLT and not the gracilis tendon to reconstruct one bundle of the ACL, as we had already found the AHPLT to be thicker, in general, than the gracilis tendon in the aforementioned cadaveric study.</p>
<p>At the time of enrollment, 125 patients with the above-mentioned chronic injuries who were appropriate candidates for use of the AHPLT were informed of the follow-up period of more than 2 years. Nine patients who reported that they were unavailable for this follow-up period were excluded. Sixteen additional patients were excluded for other conditions that would confound the evaluation process (Appendix 1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>). Thus, a total of 100 patients were included in the study. Finally, it turned out that all 100 patients used the AHPLT as the only graft or as a supplement to hamstring grafts.</p>
<p>Of the 100 patients, 92 patients were followed up for more than 2 years. Of the remaining patients, 4 were lost to follow-up because of broken contact, and 4 were lost to follow-up because they lived too far away and were unwilling to come to the clinic for the 2-year examination. The demographic data of the patients who were eventually included are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511428782">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Foot and ankle functions were evaluated according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI). The AOFAS score was recorded as the preoperative score, as this scale is dependent on both patient and physician reports. The FADI score was recorded as a preinjury score, as it is dependent only on the patients. Because some functions, such as walking, squatting, and climbing, might be affected not only by foot and ankle disability but also by the disability of the other part of the leg, the AOFAS and the FADI scores were recorded as an original and an adjusted score. The original score reflected the actual function of the entire leg. The adjusted score reflected only the ankle and the foot. Patients were asked to estimate their functional status if they had no disability to the same lower extremity other than the foot and the ankle. A special rating scale, the Side Movement Level Rating Form, was established to evaluate the side movement level. This rating form involves the 3 most popular recreational activities (ie, basketball, badminton, and table tennis) in our country that involve side movement, with the possible score ranging from 0 to 12 (Appendix 2, available online). The functional status within the last 1 year was evaluated in this form.</p>
<p>The patients scheduled to have MPFL reconstruction were evaluated regarding the function of the knee according to the Kujala, Lysholm, and Marx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511428782">26</xref></sup> rating scales.

<title>Tendon-Harvesting Techniques</title>
<sec id="section7-0363546511428782">
<title>One-Incision Tendon-Stripping Technique</title>
<p>In 93 patients, the AHPLT was harvested using a 1-incision technique, as mentioned in the “Harvesting Risk Evaluation” section. After tendon removal, the thin deep fascia in the incision was closed with a suture, and the wound was then closed.</p>
<p>During the harvesting of the AHPLT using the 1-incision technique, care was taken not to make the incision too distally to prevent uncomfortable friction from the upper edge of the shoe on the incision scar. Care was also taken to prevent the attenuation of the portion of the PLT that is just below the lateral malleolus, which could result in tendinopathy. We found that the PLT can be pulled proximally 1 to 2 cm from a neutral position to plantar flexion of the ankle. Thus, through an incision that was 2 cm proximal to the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus and by pulling the tendon 1 to 2 cm proximally and severing the anterior half, the portion of the tendon that remained under the lateral malleolus (distal to the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus) was kept intact. If the incision was too distal or if the proximal pulling of the tendon was too vigorous, the AHPLT might be harvested below the lateral malleolus. Moreover, care was taken to separate the PLT into anterior and posterior sections and not into medial and lateral sections because it might be difficult or impossible to harvest this part of the tendon if the tendon was spread too wide at its proximal portion, which would prevent the tendon fibers from converging into the tendon stripper. It was easy in most instances because of the oval or flat shape of the tendon and was difficult when the tendon turned out to be round. On the latter condition, the oval or flat section of the PLT was exposed by extending the incision proximally. The time of harvesting the AHPLT in this 1-incision tendon-stripping manner was about 5 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0363546511428782">
<title>Two-Incision Tendon-Peeling Technique</title>
<p>In 7 patients, it was difficult to push the tendon stripper smoothly to harvest the AHPLT. The possible reasons for this difficulty include that the PLT was separated into medial and lateral sections rather than anterior and posterior sections, the proximal tendon fibers were spread too wide, or the fiber volume of the proximal tendon was too high. When this difficulty occurred, we did not push the tendon stripper with maximal force to avoid precutting of the tendon, which would result in a graft that was too short. In this situation, a 1-cm longitudinal incision 5 cm distal to the fibular neck was made over the fibula. The deep fascia was incised until the peroneus muscle could be visualized. A guide pin for graft placement in the ligament reconstruction was placed into this incision in a reverse manner through the underside of the deep fascia and exiting at the distal incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511428782">Figure 4A</xref>). The 2 limbs of the suture braided in the tendon were first pulled subcutaneously and then out of the proximal incision along with the guide pin. By pulling the suture limbs, the AHPLT was peeled away from its counterpart and pulled out of the proximal incision with the attached muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511428782">Figure 4B</xref>). Then, a tendon stripper was used to complete the harvesting of the tendon. Another way to complete the tendon harvesting is scraping the muscle off the tendon. The time of harvesting the AHPLT in this 2-incision tendon-peeling manner was about 10 minutes.</p>

The rehabilitation protocol varied based on the various operations that were performed. For the ankle and foot, range of motion exercises and partial to full weightbearing began immediately after the operation. Heel lifting and ankle everting began 6 weeks after the operation. Jumping and side walking began 6 months after the operation. Return to normal activities was allowed when the ankle exhibited a painless range of motion, the patient exhibited normal or improved balance, the muscle strength returned to that before the tendon was harvested, and the patient experienced no pain with sports-specific functional testing, while considering the functional status of the knee.</p>
<p>Twenty-four months after the operation, a physical examination of the PLT was conducted. One-legged hop was examined, and the patient was informed concerning the result immediately. Then, the patients were asked to estimate their possible 1-legged hop results as if they had no knee disability, and the results were documented as the adjusted results of the 1-legged hop test. The side movement level was also evaluated. The foot and joint functions were evaluated using the AOFAS and the FADI scores. In the evaluation of the level of side movement, as well as the AOFAS and FADI scores, the patients were also asked to estimate their functional status as if they had no disability in the other areas of the lower limb other than the foot and ankle, and the results were recorded as original and adjusted. Functional evaluations of the knee were also performed using the rating scale according to the injury and operations before the reconstruction.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS software (version 14, SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) was used to conduct the statistical analysis of the results obtained from the cadaveric and clinical study. The usable length, failure load, and stiffness of the AHPLT were compared with those of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons mainly to evaluate what percentage of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons the AHPLT was accounting for with respect to length, failure load, and stiffness. The preoperative or preinjury measurement data and the postoperative results were compared using a paired Student <italic>t</italic> test, and those categorical data were compared using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. The level of significance for both tests was set at a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05.</p>

<title>Anatomy and Failure Load Evaluation</title>
<p>In all 20 cadaveric specimens, the peroneus longus muscle was unipennate with the tendon lying on the anterior side. The muscle ends in a tendon that wraps posteriorly around the lateral malleolus of the ankle and then continues under the foot to attach to the first metatarsal. The cross-section of the tendon changes from a thin and flat shape with a maximal width of 11 mm to 25 mm (median, 14 mm) at the tendon-muscle junction to an oval shape at the level of the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus. When the tendon is separated into anterior-posterior halves 2 cm above the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus, the anterior tendon fibers always extend more proximally than do the posterior tendon fibers. The flat shape of the cross-section of the tendon 2 cm above the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus indicates that this is a suitable site for separating the tendon into anterior-posterior sections. In contrast, separating the tendon into a right anterior-posterior section more distally where the tendon is oval shaped was a little bit more difficult. There was no fiber connection between the PLT and any other nearby tendons or deep fascia. There was no obvious interfibril adhesion, and it was quite easy to split the tendon into 2 sections. The thickest part of the tendon was near the tendon-muscle junction instead of near the bone insertion.</p>
<p>The usable lengths of the AHPLT, semitendinosus tendon, and gracilis tendon were 20.2 to 26.8 cm, 24.8 to 31.4 cm, and 22.6 to 27.3 cm, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511428782">Table 2</xref>). During failure load testing, all of the tendons were ruptured near the transverse rod of the hook. The failure load of the AHPLT accounted for 97.69% and 147.94% of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, respectively, while the mean stiffness of the AHPLT accounted for 95.40% and 178.39%, on average, of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, respectively.</p>

<title>Availability and Harvesting Safety</title>
<p>In all specimens, the AHPLT was harvested without any difficulty. The distance between the head of the tendon stripper and the branching point of the deep peroneus nerve was measured to be 4.6 to 10.4 cm, with a median of 6.3 cm. The superficial peroneal nerve was found at a deep level and almost paralleled the moving direction of the tendon stripper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511428782">Figure 5</xref>). The deep peroneal nerve ran in a transverse manner and was nearly perpendicular to the pushing direction of the tendon stripper; thus, it could have been injured when the stripper was pushed inadvertently to the proximal end.</p>

<title>Donor Leg Morbidity</title>
<p>The graft was harvested without difficulty in all of the patients. Seven patients had the AHPLT harvested using the 2-incision technique instead of the 1-incision technique because of an increase in fiber volume in 5 patients and an improper splitting of the tendon in 2 patients. There were no wound infections, deep tissue infections, or injuries to the peroneal nerve observed.</p>
<p>In the final follow-up, one patient had experienced an ankle sprain 15 months after the operation (there was no clear relation found between this ankle sprain and the previous graft harvest), and no ankle or foot injuries were experienced by the remaining patients. One patient complained of a persistent snapping sensation along the lateral ankle with a sense of weakness. One patient had crepitus in the anterior ankle but had no pain or functional impairment. No other patients had newly emerging and/or increasing symptoms or dysfunction of the ankle and foot, specifically of the posterolateral side of the ankle.</p>
<p>Physical examination found no tenderness at the posterior and inferior sides of the lateral malleolus. However, 13 patients had slight numbness around the incision, 9 patients felt somewhat uncomfortable when the incisions were pressed, and 11 patients had a sensation that the skin and the underlayer of soft tissue near the incision were adherent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, hamstring tendons have been widely used in knee ligament reconstruction. In single cruciate ligament reconstruction, the hamstring tendons on the same leg are generally sufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428782">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511428782">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup> However, in some cases, the harvested hamstring tendons are too short or too thin to produce a graft of adequate length and diameter, especially in double-bundle ACL or PCL reconstruction. Although it has been reported that the suitability of the hamstring graft can be predicted using anthropometric measurements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428782">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511428782">38</xref></sup> harvesting a less than optimal tendon is still of concern in clinical practice because of the lack of predictability and the technical problems that can be encountered during harvesting. In cases of a cruciate ligament reconstruction combined with a collateral ligament reconstruction or augmentation, an additional tendon graft is needed for the collateral ligament. Also, in cases of simultaneous single-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction, a 4-stranded graft can be produced from the semitendinosus tendon for one cruciate ligament; however, the gracilis tendon is not strong enough for the reconstruction of the other cruciate ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511428782">41</xref></sup> In these instances, a supplement to the 2 hamstring tendons is needed. While the patellar or quadriceps tendon can be chosen as an additional donor, we are reluctant to interfere with these extension mechanisms given their various possible morbidities. An allograft may also be an acceptable choice; however, it is sometimes not a reliable alternative given the relative shortage of such grafts. Furthermore, unexpected conditions, such as inadequate hamstring tendons and additional ligamentous injury requiring reconstruction or augmentation during operation, are sometimes encountered without the allograft being prepared at the time of operation. Thus, the AHPLT may be a suitable alternative for use in reconstructive procedures.</p>
<p>The peroneus longus muscle plays an important role in the function of the foot and ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428782">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511428782">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428782">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511428782">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511428782">36</xref></sup> To our knowledge, there is only 1 report regarding the use of the PLT in knee ligament reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428782">22</xref></sup> In their study, Kerimoğlu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428782">22</xref></sup> reported no obvious functional impairment after harvesting a segment of the PLT to reconstruct the ACL. However, there are no other data in the literature to prove this. Although we do not know the exact reason it has not been used by other surgeons for knee ligament reconstruction, our concern before using this tendon was that total removal of the tendon would result in possible impairment of foot and ankle function. Thus, to prevent the total functional loss of the PLT, we only removed its anterior half. Furthermore, because the distal section of the PLT is deep in the lateral side and sole of the foot, we proposed to use the part of the tendon that was above the posterior prominence of the lateral malleolus to prevent an extensive operative invasion of the foot.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that the failure load of the AHPLT was comparable with that of the semitendinosus tendon and approximately 1.5 times that of the gracilis tendon. The usable length of the AHPLT was slightly shorter than that of the semitendinosus tendon and comparable with that of the gracilis tendon. This result indicates that the AHPLT can be used as a supplement to the hamstring tendon or as a replacement for it from a biomechanical perspective.</p>
<p>Because of the superficial location of the PLT, it is easier and quicker to expose the PLT than to expose the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. Unlike the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, there is no fiber connection between the PLT and other nearby tendons or deep fascia. Moreover, there was no interfibrillar adhesion found, which indicates that the harvesting procedure for the AHPLT can be performed smoothly. However, because of the increased fiber volume near the tendon-muscle junction, the 2-incision tendon-peeling technique is necessary in some instances. The 5- to 10-minute surgical time for harvesting the AHPLT indicates that these procedures are efficient.</p>
<p>Donor site morbidity can be categorized as a local sensory problem, tissue disturbance, and structural failure. Incision inevitably injures subcutaneous sensory nerves to various extents and may result in numbness and tenderness. Much attention has been given to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve during hamstring tendon or patellar tendon harvesting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511428782">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511428782">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428782">29</xref></sup> In the present study, local sensory problems were also found but considered minor. When the patellar tendon graft has been harvested, local tissue disturbance may result in anterior knee pain. In the present study, adhesion sensation, ankle snapping, and crepitus may also be because of local tissue disturbance. Structural failures, such as patella fracture and patellar tendon rupture after bone–patellar tendon–bone graft removal, have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428782">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511428782">34</xref></sup> In the present study, tendon rupture or tendinopathy was not found. The lack of signs of tendon rupture or tendinopathy may have been because the PLT around the lateral malleolus was not disturbed. The results of the present study showed that the influence of removal of the AHPLT on foot and ankle function was minimal, as assessed through the 1-legged hop test and side movement testing, as well as through a functional evaluation of the foot and ankle. However, the long-term results following removal of the AHPLT still need to be studied.</p>
<p>Major nerve injuries are rare and serious complications. Sciatic nerve and common peroneal nerve injuries have been reported in tendon harvesting near the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428782">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511428782">39</xref></sup> In the present study, the superficial peroneal nerve was found to go in at a deeper tissue level, and it ran almost parallel with the pushing direction of the tendon stripper. The risk of injury to this nerve was relatively low during the harvesting of the AHPLT. However, the deep peroneal nerve was found to run in a transverse manner around the fibular neck and was nearly perpendicular to the pushing direction of the tendon stripper. Thus, it could have been injured when the stripper was pushed inadvertently to its proximal end, although there was a more than 4.6-cm safe zone found between the head of the tendon stripper and the deep peroneal nerve when the pushing movement on the tendon stripper was stopped once the AHPLT could be pulled out. Although we did not find any peroneal nerve injuries in our clinical study of 350 cases through January 2011 using the AHPLT as main or supplemental graft tissue, the risk of peroneal nerve injury should always be taken into consideration during the harvesting of the AHPLT.</p>
<p>Some attention has recently been given to knee ligament reconstruction with the central third quadriceps tendon. Both the quadriceps tendon–patellar bone graft and the free tendon graft are reported to produce good to excellent outcomes with decreased donor site morbidity and even absence of anterior knee pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428782">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428782">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428782">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428782">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428782">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511428782">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511428782">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511428782">30</xref></sup> Although this graft causes the least morbidity of the currently used autograft reconstruction alternatives, the use of this graft compared with the AHPLT still needed to be validated.</p>
<p>This study involved 4 different surgical procedures. For the MPFL reconstruction, the results are comparable with those reported in a recent study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428782">15</xref></sup> The multiligament reconstruction included various ligament compositions. Each composition of ligament reconstructions needs to be compared with those in the literature in future studies. Regarding double-bundle ACL and double-bundle PCL reconstructions with the AHPLT as a supplement to hamstring tendons, the functional results are also comparable with those reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511428782">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428782">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511428782">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the measured failure loads of the hamstring tendons in this study were much lower than the results reported in the study by Noyes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup> The first potential reason for this discrepancy in the literature may be that there are differences between ethnic groups with respect to the hamstring tendon. The second potential reason for this discrepancy is that the cadaveric specimens used in our study were much older than those used in the Noyes et al study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup> The third potential reason may be the method that was used to assess failure load testing. In previous studies, the tendon ends were grasped using serrated clamps,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428782">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup> and the tendon ends were frozen to the clamps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428782">8</xref></sup> However, in the present study, the tendon ends were strapped with sutures, which may have resulted in uneven tension within the tendon fibers and caused the earlier rupture of the tendon fibers. Finally, freezing and thawing may affect biomechanical testing. However, the ratio of the failure load of the semitendinosus tendon to that of the gracilis tendon in this study is similar to those reported in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428782">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reliability of the rating scale for side movement level used in the clinical portion of the study has not yet been proven. During the clinical portion of the study, the preinjury or preoperative functional results were compared with the adjusted postoperative results. However, bias exists in the patients’ self-evaluation of their functional ability in the assumption that they had no problems in the other area of the lower extremity other than the foot or ankle. A variety of procedures, in addition to MPFL reconstruction, were involved in this study to maximize the patient number. However, this might also result in bias in evaluation. In the future, the functional outcome using the AHPLT as a graft for reconstruction should be compared with that of similar procedures using other kinds of grafts. Another weakness of the present study is that we were unable to find a way to specifically evaluate the strength and function of the peroneus longus muscle alone.</p>
<p>The other main weakness of this study was that there were no comparisons among patients who did not undergo PLT harvesting, those who underwent AHPLT harvesting, and those who underwent total PLT harvesting (segmental harvesting). Although a recent study by Kerimoğlu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511428782">23</xref></sup> found signs of regeneration after total removal, the quality and function of the reported regenerated PLT are still unknown. Thus, further study is needed, and we remain reluctant to completely remove the PLT in vivo for fear of irreversible functional loss. The AHPLT is an acceptable alternative for autograft use with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.</p>
