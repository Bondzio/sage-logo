<abstract>
<p>Redistricting cases offer a unique opportunity to test the effects of partisan favoritism in judging and to investigate when partisanship might influence decision making distinctly from ideology. How partisan are federal judges? In an analysis of federal district court cases from 1981 to 2007, this study finds that federal judges are neither neutral arbiters nor crass partisans. Instead, judging in redistricting cases can best be described in terms of constrained partisanship. When redistricting law is clear, judges eschew decision making that furthers their party’s interests. However, where legal precedent is ambiguous, partisan favoritism exacts a strong influence on judicial behavior.</p>

<p>The fight over mid-decade redistricting in Texas received wide publicity across the country. After the political fight ended in 2003, a legal battle ensued in federal court. A three-judge federal district court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421012"><italic>Session v. Perry</italic> 2004</xref>) convened to hear the dispute. With these federal judges cognizant of the attention surrounding the case, the majority opinion began its factual recount of events with this caveat: “We decide only the legality of Plan 1374C, not its wisdom. . . . We know it is rough and tumble politics, and we are ever mindful that the judiciary must call the fouls without participating in the game” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421012"><italic>Session v. Perry</italic> 2004</xref>, 451). At the end of the day, this court’s decision split two to one. The two Republican judges, while expressing concern about the legislature’s choice of action, believed no foul had been committed by the Republican state legislature. The Democratic federal judge voted to strike down what he saw as an unconstitutional plan. On the surface, the <italic>Session v. Perry</italic> federal court resembles the partisan actions of a state legislature, but the question remains, is the apparently partisan behavior of this panel an aberration, or is it representative of federal courts’ decisions in redistricting?</p>
<p>Previous researchers looking at this subject have characterized federal judges in redistricting in one of two ways: as either neutral arbiters or partisan maximizers. This study brings new evidence to the question concerning the role of partisanship in judicial decision making by utilizing a data set of three-judge federal trial court redistricting cases spanning three decades, from 1981 to 2007. Contrary to previous research, this study indicates that federal judges act as constrained partisans in redistricting. Indeed, partisanship exacts an important influence on judicial behavior in these cases, particularly when legal precedent provides no clear answers. This partisanship manifests itself through federal judges’ tendency to strike down redistricting plans drawn up in a process that was controlled by a different political party from that of the reviewing judge. On the other hand, in cases where redistricting law is unambiguous, the law acts as a constraining influence on judges’ partisan inclinations.</p>
<p>This study also examines the important question of how partisan influences can operate distinctly from ideological influences in judging. Because of the uniquely partisan nature of redistricting, partisan influences (favoring one’s own political party in a court case) are not always congruent with a judge’s ideological perceptions of the law. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd’s (1995)</xref> findings, this study employs a more nuanced measurement of ideology to separate out partisan favoritism from ideology in judging.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911421012">
<title>The Consequences of Redistricting and Partisan Judging</title>
<p>Investigating the partisan effects of judicial behavior in redistricting is important because of the legal and political implications such an effect would have for democracy. Numerous studies indicate that redistricting has the potential to affect various political processes, although the nature of these effects (such as incumbency advantage, overall decline in competition, increased polarization in Congress, the effects on participation for redrawn voters, and the distribution of public finances) is complex and often debated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421012">Abramowitz, Alexander, and Gunning 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421012">Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421012">Carson and Crespin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911421012">Hayes and McKee 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912911421012">McKee 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912911421012">Theriault 2008</xref>). While many alleged effects of redistricting are often disputed, the one effect with the broadest consensus among scholars concerns the potential electoral advantage that accrues to a party when it has complete control over the redistricting process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911421012">Cain 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421012">Gelman and King 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912911421012">McKee, Teigen, and Turgeon 2006</xref>). Even scholars who are skeptical of claims that often invoke redistricting as the cause of various political phenomenon concede that “[t]here is no question that partisan gerrymandering can produce a short-term electoral advantage for the party that draws the lines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421012">Abramowitz, Alexander, and Gunning 2006</xref>, 96). Thus, a partisan federal court could use their oversight of redistricting to advantage the electoral prospects of their own political party while diminishing the due process rights of the litigants before their court and failing to adequately balance the equal protection rights of similarly situated voters. This possibility raises legitimate democratic concerns about the regulatory fairness of the current redistricting system, but only a few studies have systematically investigated the role of partisan judging in redistricting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421012">G. Cox and Katz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the lack of empirical work in this area, there has been no shortage of theories or commentary on federal court involvement in redistricting from the public law community (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421012">Bickel 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421012">Dixon 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421012">Ely 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911421012">Levinson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911421012">Powe 2000</xref>). While some public law scholars have been critical of the federal courts’ role in redistricting, others have been rather praiseworthy. Samuel Issacharoff and others have even called for increased court regulation of redistricting to ensure more competitive electoral districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911421012">Issacharoff 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911421012">Issacharoff and Pildes 1998</xref>). Largely absent from this normative debate is a sound empirical understanding of how federal judges have actually been behaving in redistricting cases over the past three decades. In this respect, this study can complement the long normative debate over the federal courts’ role in the process by providing a more objective social scientific understanding of judicial behavior in redistricting.</p>
<p>Judicial behavior in redistricting can also tell us more about the understudied nature of partisan—as opposed to ideological—influences in judging. The judicial literature is replete with studies examining the differences in behavior between judges appointed by Republican or Democratic presidents. Strong differences in voting among Democratic and Republican appointees have been found among a whole variety of legal cases in judicial studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912911421012">Rowland and Carp 1996</xref>). These studies are primarily focused on the effects of ideology in judging, hence the use of presidential party identifications assigned to federal judges rather than the use of a judge’s actual partisan identification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911421012">2</xref></sup> More recently, judicial scholars have turned to more dynamic measures of ideology with the advent of common space scores of judges. However, these efforts are not the same as investigating partisan effects since the concept of partisanship is distinct from ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd 1995</xref>). A finding that shows that judges appointed by Republican presidents decide abortion cases differently from judges appointed by Democratic presidents tells us little about the influence of partisan affect in judging in part because there’s no opportunity for the judge to directly help her or his own political party in an abortion case. In fact, federal judges rarely receive the opportunity to directly affect the electoral prospects of their own party. Yet while election law cases are few and far between in a typical federal judge’s docket, they are often important cases that strike at the heart of the functions of our democracy. In this respect, redistricting cases provide the opportunity to test partisan influences against ideological influences in judging. An example of partisan influence overtaking ideology would be a conservative Republican judge employing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) to declare a Democratic redistricting plan illegal and discriminatory.</p>
<p>There are relatively few published works that quantitatively look at partisan favoritism in the federal courts. One recent study investigating the literature on judicial partisanship reported that “only a limited number of empirical studies expressly examine this issue” of partisan favoritism in judging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421012">Kopko 2008</xref>, 306). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd (1995)</xref> finds some partisan favoritism in federal judicial decisions, but as noted in greater detail below, the story is more complicated—one could interpret his findings as depicting judges akin to neutral arbiters. Lloyd’s study is quite unique and important in its endeavor to examine the effects of partisanship in judging, but it does have some limitations: his data set stops at 1983, it only covers equal protection one person, one vote claims, and at only 44 cases, it is a comparatively small study (the study in this article includes 149 cases ranging from 1981 to 2007). An additional limitation concerns Lloyd’s efforts to separate ideology from partisanship. He accounts for a judge’s ideology by using the party identification of the judge. Of course, at the time of Lloyd’s study, common space scores of federal district judges were not readily available, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421012">Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek (2006</xref>, 49) point out, the party of the appointing president is “too crude a measure to adequately capture” a judge’s ideology, and this point also applies aptly to a judge’s party identification.</p>
<p>In the book <italic>Elbridge Gerry’s Salamander</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421012">Gary Cox and Jonathan Katz (2002)</xref> argue that judges act as partisans in redistricting. In one chapter, they rely on a model with thirty observations from court cases in the late 1960s to show that friendly courts (courts that were of the same partisanship as the state government passing the plan) had a tendency to uphold the state’s congressional plans. But such findings are only suggestive since the analysis was based on a short time period with only a single control variable and too few observations to be definitive. A further note of concern is that G. Cox and Katz include in this analysis the decisions of state courts and various levels of federal courts together, essentially mixing apples and oranges since the forces driving decision making in state and federal courts can be quite different. In their defense, the chapter was not meant to be a definitive study on partisanship in judicial decision making, and their book is not a study in judicial behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911421012">3</xref></sup> Rather, the effort was intended to support assumptions they make about judicial behavior in later models in their book that examine the electoral effects of redistricting. Nevertheless, they conclude that judicial “discretion appears to have been exercised systematically for partisan effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421012">G. Cox and Katz 2002</xref>, 80). In short, they tend to view judges as partisan maximizers.</p>
<p>Studies investigating partisan favoritism in state courts are equally sparse and center primarily on ballot access litigation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421012">Graves 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421012">Kopko 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1065912911421012">Williams 1998</xref>). But these studies offer no consensus on whether partisan favoritism affects judicial judgment. What evidence we do have on partisan bias in redistricting all predates 1983. With better measures of ideology and partisanship now available, and with a greater integration of courts into the regulatory process of redistricting since the 1970s, the following study offers a new perspective on how federal courts oversee redistricting disputes. While redistricting cases are uncommon, they have important electoral consequences, and their study can further our understanding of judicial behavior in other types of partisan political cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1065912911421012">
<title>Models of Judicial Behavior in Redistricting</title>
<p>There are three possible models that might explain judicial behavior in redistricting: the neutral arbiter, the partisan maximizer, and the constrained partisan. These models are based on the three types of redistricting plans faced by federal judges: (1) plans without an obvious partisan imprint, such as those created under divided government or by bipartisan or nonpartisan redistricting commissions (<italic>divided government</italic> plans),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911421012">4</xref></sup> (2) plans created by the judge’s own party if her or his party controls the levers of state government (<italic>same party</italic> plans), and (3) plans created by the judge’s political opponents, if a party different from that of the reviewing judge controls the state redistricting process (<italic>opposing party</italic> plans). Whether judges act as neutral arbiters, partisan maximizers, or constrained partisans depends on their overall empirical responses to the three types of plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911421012">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1065912911421012">
<title>The Neutral Arbiter</title>
<p>If federal judges are neutral arbiters in redistricting, then we should expect them to act in one of two ways. One type of neutral arbiter would follow the law, regardless of what party it favored. Of course, if the law is unclear, this type of neutral arbiter becomes implausible to contemplate. A second type of neutral arbiter would ensure that political parties received equal treatment before her or his court, regardless of what she or he thought the law said. From an empirical standpoint, we would expect neutral arbiters to either (1) strike down opposing party and same party plans at high rates while striking down divided government plans (or nonpartisan plans) at low rates or (2) exhibit no significant difference in their behavioral responses to the three types of plans. The idea that federal judges are mere impartial dispensers of justice in redistricting is supported by some empirical evidence in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd’s (1995</xref>, 417, 418) study. Though Lloyd says that a “strong partisan influence is present” in redistricting decisions, he finds that “partisan-created plans are more likely to be struck down than are nonpartisan plans.” In other words, regardless of their own partisan affiliation, federal judges tended to scrutinize and strike down partisan plans passed by either party (although the propensity was somewhat higher if the plan was drawn up by a different party from the judge). If one emphasizes Lloyd’s findings that federal judges do not like partisan plans of any stripe, then this suggests that judges can be neutral arbiters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1065912911421012">
<title>The Partisan Maximizer</title>
<p>A second model of judicial behavior in redistricting characterizes the federal judge as a partisan maximizer, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421012">G. Cox and Katz’s (2002)</xref> findings suggest. This type of judge would seek to maximize partisan gain for her or his party whenever possible. An empirical representation of this behavior supposes that a partisan maximizer would uphold her or his own party’s plans at very high rates, significantly higher than the other two types of plans. Opposing party plans would be upheld only at very low rates. One federal judge I interviewed in 2006 about the subject of redistricting bluntly suggested that some of her colleagues seemed to operate under this model.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All the cases filed by the liberal Democrats were filed in [City Y]. She was the only judge in [City Y] at that time. My belief is that if you asked her, she would say she is a good Democrat. And she seemed to hold in favor of the plaintiffs a lot. (Interview with a Republican federal judge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421012">2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unlike a constrained partisan, a partisan maximizer would not necessarily feel inclined to follow the case law, even when the law was clear. The partisan maximizer model is not inconceivable when one considers the fact that many federal judges are active in political party organizations before coming to the bench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421012">Baum 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1065912911421012">
<title>The Constrained Partisan</title>
<p>Although previous research and opinion have produced somewhat divergent views of the effects of partisanship in redistricting, new data presented in this study bring some measure of reconciliation to our understanding of partisan affect in judging. To understand the federal courts’ behavior, we have to look at federal trial judges as constrained partisans—constrained by the law, the context of the particular case, and the institutional norms of federal trial courts.</p>
<p>For the constrained partisan, unambiguous legal precedent will often override partisan considerations. Because of strategic or psychological impulses, judges are motivated to follow the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421012">Baum 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911421012">Braman and Nelson 2007</xref>), and, of course, clear legal precedent facilitates this practice. Under the constrained partisan model, a federal trial court judge will tend to follow the law when redistricting precedent is clear, even at the expense of the judge’s party in the case. On the other hand, judges toiling under ambiguous legal precedent are more susceptible to producing a partisan judgment. As redistricting scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911421012">Richard Engstrom (2002</xref>, 70) notes, “Ambiguous criteria are ripe for subjective, result-oriented applications by the reviewing courts [in redistricting disputes].” Motivated by either strategic or psychological forces, judges are more likely to favor their own party in redistricting when a lack of clarity in precedent provides them with that window of opportunity. As is detailed further below, the clearest precedent in redistricting cases is found in the line of cases requiring equal population districts, where the Supreme Court has established specific numerical criteria for guiding lower court decisions. Under a constrained partisan model, one should see little to no partisan favoritism in decision making in cases involving deviations from equal population principles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, where precedent offers no bright line rules (such as in VRA litigation or constitutionally based racial gerrymandering claims), judges are more likely to make decisions influenced by partisanship. In empirical terms, when the law is ambiguous, the constrained partisan facing same party plans and divided government (or nonpartisan) plans would tend to uphold both types of plans at similar rates. The rationale for such behavior would be premised on the fact that federal judges would subject such plans to lesser scrutiny. Divided government plans and bipartisan commission plans often represent compromises among the political parties, and thus in many cases a judge could perceive her or his vote to uphold such a plan as helping her or his own party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911421012">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Same party plans will also be upheld at rather high rates, as federal judges act to help their own party when the law is unclear. Perhaps in such circumstances, judges are less willing to suspect that their political friends in the state legislature violated the law. And, in fact, the case law in redistricting provides a vehicle for judges to uphold same party plans and divided government plans at high rates. Since the earliest cases from the 1960s, the Supreme Court has admonished lower courts to recognize a norm of deference to the actions of a state legislature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912911421012"><italic>Reynolds v. Sims</italic> 1964</xref>, 585). Redistricting precedent since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912911421012"><italic>Reynolds v. Sims</italic> (1964)</xref> and reinforced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911421012"><italic>Growe v. Emison</italic> (1993)</xref> encourages judges to defer to state processes and to enter this political thicket sparingly. This case law provides the perfect excuse, as seen in the 2004 <italic>Session v. Perry</italic> Texas case mentioned earlier, for federal judges to follow their partisan inclinations.</p>
<p>When faced with opposing party plans and ambiguous legal precedent, constrained partisans will show a greater propensity to strike down opposing party plans when compared to same party plans and divided government (and nonpartisan) plans. If a federal judge is hearing a case in which her or his party is the victim of partisan line drawing by the state government, or groups in her or his party receive the short end of the stick in the political map drawing, she or he is more inclined to find the redistricting plan legally invalid, particularly when the law is ambiguous and fails to offer a clear answer. When the law is clear, however, one should see more judicial reliance on legal cues and an absence of partisan favoritism.</p>
<p>In short, the key act in these cases involves the decision to strike down a plan, and the probability a judge will do so is significantly increased when the aggrieved party shares the judge’s party identification. The depiction of these three judicial decision models leads directly to a testable research hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1065912911421012">
<title>Ideological Influences</title>
<p>An important part of this study is to determine how ideology might operate distinctly from partisanship in redistricting cases within the context of all three models just described. Ideology is a significant predictor of judicial behavior in general, and thus it is important to consider how one could expect ideological influences to affect judicial decisions on redistricting. There appear to be ideological divisions within the legal community regarding proper interpretations of various aspects of redistricting law, and such ideological divisions could operate independently of partisan influences. As two law professors have found in a study of VRA cases (a study including a wide variety of voting rights cases, not just redistricting), Republican presidential appointees are less likely to vote for liability when compared to Democratic appointees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421012">A. Cox and Miles 2008</xref>). Thus, one might expect that in the smaller subset of VRA cases involving only redistricting, the same behavior will be seen. More conservative judges should be more skeptical of VRA claims and less likely to find acts of illegal discrimination against minorities, whereas more liberal judges may have a greater tendency to declare redistricting plans discriminatory under the VRA. In disputes involving claims of malapportionment of districts (equal population claims), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd (1995)</xref> used the party identification of the judge as a proxy for ideology, and he ascertained that Democratic judges were more likely to find a violation of the equal population rule than were Republican judges. Lloyd interpreted his findings on this variable as a civil liberties issue, surmising that liberal Democratic judges were more likely to find the notion of equality as having been violated in disputes over equal population districts.</p>
<p>Constitutionally based racial gerrymandering claims unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421012"><italic>Shaw v. Reno</italic> (1993)</xref> decision typically involve white plaintiffs asserting that a majority–minority district violates their equal protection right to have districting lines drawn up without solely relying on the race of the voters in the district. Although quantitative studies on these cases are lacking, the conventional wisdom is that conservative judges are more inclined to find evidence of racial gerrymandering and vote in favor of the white litigants than are liberal judges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421012">Butler 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the neutral arbiter model, where judges eschew partisan favoritism, ideological influences could still be found to dominate judicial behavior since a judge could still act with impartiality toward both political parties while at the same time employing an ideological perception of redistricting law. As Justice Scalia notes, “Impartiality in this sense assures equal application of the law [because] . . . it guarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him in the same way he applies it to any other party (Scalia’s majority opinion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912911421012"><italic>Republican Party of Minnesota v. White</italic> 2002</xref>, 775-76). To illustrate, a conservative Republican judge reviewing a Democratic-drawn redistricting plan that is being challenged under the VRA may uphold such a plan simply because she or he is less likely to recognize the validity of claims of discrimination against minorities in VRA cases, irrespective of the party drawing the plan. Thus, in the above example, the Republican judge’s ideological perceptions of VRA law might dissuade her or him from engaging in a partisan maneuver to strike down a Democratic redistricting plan.</p>
<p>Under a partisan maximizer model, a Republican judge reviewing a Democratic plan in a VRA case may be expected to ignore her or his own ideological inhibitions about the jurisprudence of VRA claims in furtherance of her or his party’s interests by striking down such plans as “discriminatory.” However, under a constrained partisan model, one should expect to find that both partisanship and ideology will have some effect on judicial behavior. For purposes of this study, a judge’s exact motivations for choosing ideology over partisanship (or vice versa) are unimportant, but the central point here is that a constrained partisan does not always ignore her or his own ideology. By using a more dynamic measure of ideology, this study is able to quantify and distinguish with greater precision the effects of ideology from partisanship. Of course, if the law is clear in a redistricting case, then under the constrained partisan model, such ideological influences, like partisan influences, are more likely to be suppressed in a judge’s decision calculus.</p>

<title>Redistricting Cases: Data and Research Design</title>
<p>To investigate the influences of partisanship, ideology, and the law in redistricting decisions, this study relies on an original data set of all federal district court cases on redistricting for state legislative and congressional plans published in LexisNexis (both opinions in the Federal Supplement and those published only online)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911421012">7</xref></sup> from 1981 to 2007, constituting a total of 149 court cases (all involving three-judge panels that include two district judges and one circuit judge) and resulting in an observation set of 447 judges’ votes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911421012">8</xref></sup> The decisions of these three-judge trial courts are not reviewable by the circuit courts, but instead litigants have a right to appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court (and a right to review, as such appeals are not part of the Court’s discretionary docket). The oldest case in the data set is <italic>Hispanic Coalition on Reapportionment v. Legislative Reapportionment Commission</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912911421012">1982</xref>), and the most recent case is <italic>Lance v. Coffman</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911421012">2007</xref>). This time frame allows for the study of redistricting cases in light of the landmark Supreme Court cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912911421012"><italic>Thornburg v.

<p>The dependent variable in this analysis is a judge’s vote to uphold or strike down a state plan in a redistricting case, coded 1 when a judge votes in favor of the state’s plans and 0 when a judge votes to strike down the state’s plans. Logistic regression is used to analyze judges’ votes on plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911421012">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The independent variables in this study and their coding are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421012">Table 2</xref>. To facilitate the estimation of judicial partisanship, this study employs two variables that measure the type of plan the federal judge faces and four interaction variables. The <italic>same party</italic> and <italic>opposing party</italic> variables correspond to whether the party that controls the state redistricting process matches the party of the reviewing federal judge (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421012">Table 2</xref>). The partisanship of the federal judge is not determined by the appointing president but rather is the actual judge’s party identification as recorded by previous judicial scholars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911421012">15</xref></sup> Thus, by example, if a state legislature is run by Democrats and the governorship is also controlled by the Democrats (assuming the governor has a constitutional role in redistricting) and the judge (the observation) is also Democratic, then <italic>same party</italic> would equal a score of 1 and <italic>opposing party</italic> would have a score of 0. This also applies when the party that controls the legislature has sufficient strength to override a gubernatorial veto. If the process is controlled by Republicans, and the judge is Democratic, then <italic>same party</italic> would equal 0 and <italic>opposing party</italic> would equal 1. If the state government were divided (or there was a nonpartisan or bipartisan commission), then both variables would receive zeros. In the model, divided government plans operate as the suppressed category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911421012">16</xref></sup></p>

<p>Another important variable (<italic>ideology</italic>) measures the ideology of the federal judges using common space scores from the Political Ideology Measurement Project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1065912911421012">17</xref></sup> Possible scores range from −1 (<italic>a liberal judge</italic>) to 1 (<italic>a conservative judge</italic>). These common space scores offer a more exact measure of ideology as compared to employing the dichotomous measure of the party of the appointing president, and they allow for a better test of the separate effects of partisanship—represented by the <italic>same party</italic> and <italic>opposing party</italic> variables and their subsequent interactions—and ideology.</p>
<p>The next set of variables in the main model deal with the type of legal claims involved: partisan gerrymandering claims (<italic>partisan gerrymander</italic>); VRA claims, both section 2 and section 5 (<italic>VRA case</italic>); and racial gerrymandering claims (<italic>racial gerrymander</italic>). The legal claims are coded as dummy variables, and some court cases involve multiple legal claims. Equal population claims act as the baseline measure.</p>
<p>Another variable denotes whether the judge is a former <italic>legislator</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1065912911421012">18</xref></sup> A few legislator-turned-federal judges who I interviewed (see note 5) told me that being a legislator helped them review these cases. It is not clear how such an experience might cause these judges to vary from their colleagues, but perhaps former legislators might accord state legislative plans more deference.</p>
<p>The involvement of a redistricting commission in the line-drawing process could positively affect a judge’s perception of the legality and fairness of a plan. Some of the federal judges I interviewed suggested that bipartisan commissions might draw fairer plans. One federal judge likened the standard of review of a commission plan to the very deferential standard given to decisions by administrative agencies. The <italic>commission</italic> variable accounts for the possibility that federal judges might have a greater tendency to uphold redistricting plans drawn by a state commission.</p>
<p>Including diverse legal claims in a single model limits the possibility of meaningful legal variables. But the main model does include a legal variable called <italic>no plan</italic>, which controls for instances where the state failed to adopt a redistricting plan after the decennial census. When no plan exists, state defendants almost never dispute the unconstitutionality of the plan because Supreme Court precedent since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421012"><italic>Baker v. Carr</italic> (1962)</xref> is quite clear about requirements to redistrict after a census, even if other areas of redistricting law are still murky. Normally, arguments in these cases focus on whether the federal court should give the state government more time and defer to state processes.</p>
<p>Another variable tracks whether the case included disputes over congressional redistricting plans (<italic>congress</italic>). Congressional plans may be treated differently because they are subject to more exacting scrutiny in equal population disputes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421012"><italic>Karcher v. Daggett</italic> 1983</xref>) and because of the higher importance attached to the office. Two temporal variables (<italic>1980s, 1990s</italic>) account for redistricting cases as they span across a three-decade timeline (with cases since 2000 as the comparison group).</p>

<title>Legal Ambiguity and Its Effects on Partisanship</title>
<p>For a constrained partisan judge, partisanship should have a greater tendency to manifest itself when redistricting law is ambiguous. Jurisprudence is clearer for some types of claims than others. In analyzing one person, one vote claims, equal population jurisprudence has reasonably clear standards. The Supreme Court set forth very specific numerical guidelines for lower courts to follow regarding acceptable deviations from equal population districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421012"><italic>Brown v. Thomson</italic> 1983</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421012"><italic>Karcher v. Daggett</italic> 1983</xref>). On the contrary, many redistricting scholars point out that VRA jurisprudence is not clear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421012">A. Cox and Miles 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421012">Butler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911421012">Engstrom 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911421012">Karlan 1996</xref>). As illustrated by the most recent Texas case, there is wide disagreement on how to interpret the VRA, both within the five to four decision of the Supreme Court in <italic>LULAC v. Perry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912911421012">2006</xref>) and in both decisions of the three-judge federal district court in the same case (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421012"><italic>Session v. Perry</italic> 2004</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911421012"><italic>Henderson v. Perry</italic> 2005</xref>). The test created by the Supreme Court in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912911421012"><italic>Thornburg v. Gingles</italic> (1986)</xref> for finding VRA violations has been of little help to judges looking for legal clarity since interpretations of this ruling vary widely among the three-judge district courts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1065912911421012">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Racial gerrymandering jurisprudence remained in flux for much of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421012">Butler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421012">Lublin and Voss 1998</xref>). But after the Supreme Court provided greater clarity in the law with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421012"><italic>Bush v. Vera</italic> (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421012"><italic>Shaw II</italic> (1996)</xref>, states became more successful at defending themselves against these cases. O’Connor’s concurrence in <italic>Bush v. Vera</italic> resolved a number of issues for states that theretofore had remained unclear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421012">Butler 2002</xref>, 206-7). And although <italic>Shaw II</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421012"><italic>Shaw v. Hunt</italic> 1996</xref>, 905) seemed to merely reemphasize the <italic>Miller v. Johnson</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912911421012">1995</xref>) standard that race cannot be the “predominant” factor in drawing lines, the practical effect of <italic>Shaw II</italic> suggested that as long as the state also considered race-neutral factors when creating majority–minority districts, the Court would start allowing more racial gerrymanders to pass constitutional muster.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1065912911421012">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Testing the premise that legal ambiguity allows for partisan influence in the larger model requires four additional interaction terms between <italic>same party</italic> and VRA/racial gerrymandering claims and <italic>opposing party</italic> and VRA/racial gerrymandering claims (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421012">Table 2</xref>). In addition, because of the potential for variation in behavior by ideology in some of these cases (especially in VRA litigation), the <italic>VRA case</italic> variable is interacted with the ideology of the judge (<italic>VRA</italic> × <italic>ideology</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1065912911421012">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1065912911421012">
<title>Independent Variables Included in Other Models</title>
<p>In extending the analysis, similar models are run for specific legal claims to test for the effects of legal variables on judicial decision making in the different types of legal claims. For one person, one vote claims, a legal variable is added to that model to account for whether district sizes exceed acceptable legal deviations from the ideal district size. Since 1983, the Supreme Court has set permissible limits for state legislative plans at a maximum deviation of 10 percent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421012"><italic>Brown v. Thomson</italic> 1983</xref>, 842-43), while congressional plans cannot deviate more than 0.69 percent from the ideal district (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421012"><italic>Karcher v. Daggett</italic> 1983</xref>). Judges are allowed some discretion since exceeding maximum deviation sizes is not per se illegal but rather presents only a prima facie case of unconstitutionality. The practical reality of the rule, however, is that judges are usually reluctant to find extenuating circumstances that justify a state exceeding these presumably safe harbor limits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1065912911421012">22</xref></sup> The <italic>exceeds legal deviation</italic> variable is dichotomous, where 1 represents a plan that exceeded permissible population deviations (either 0.69 percent deviation for congressional plans or 10 percent for state legislative plans).</p>
<p>The lack of clarity in VRA jurisprudence militates against constructing any meaningful legal variables. Given that there are so many factors to consider and so many varying interpretations of the statute among the lower courts, any fact or legal nuance might influence a judicial decision in ways that cannot be accurately calibrated. The ambiguity in the law means that no unbiased legal variable can be constructed. Therefore, the model for VRA cases considers only partisan and contextual factors.</p>
<p>A third model covers only racial gerrymandering cases. There are fewer cases here, so this analysis is a bit speculative. In this model, the legal variable is temporal. With <italic>Bush v. Vera</italic> and <italic>Shaw II</italic>, the Supreme Court essentially sent signals to the lower courts to raise the bar on plaintiffs attempting to claim racial gerrymandering against a state plan. The <italic>after Bush v. Vera</italic> variable is dichotomous, and one should expect lower courts to begin upholding more plans challenged on racial gerrymandering charges after this case. To test whether the influences of partisanship vary based on legal ambiguity, the model also includes interaction terms between the partisan variables and <italic>after Bush v. Vera</italic>.</p>

<p>Opposing party judges have a greater effect on decision making in cases involving VRA claims when compared to cases that do not involve the VRA, and this difference is statistically significant. In substantive terms, when a federal judge is reviewing a redistricting plan of the opposing party in a VRA case, the probability that the judge will vote to uphold the plan decreases by 28 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1065912911421012">23</xref></sup> In other words, the circumstance of a judge reviewing the opposite party’s plan in certain types of legal claims significantly increases the odds that the state will lose. Conversely, no similar effect is seen when federal judges are reviewing plans passed by their own party. There is no significant difference between judicial treatment of <italic>divided government</italic> and <italic>same party</italic> plans in VRA cases. The results of the “all cases” model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421012">Table 3</xref> suggest that the partisanship of federal judges is constrained, so that it affects judicial behavior only when the law is unsettled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1065912911421012">24</xref></sup> If judges were crass partisan actors, with their only goal being the maximization of their own party’s interests, then they should uphold their own party’s plans at rates higher than divided government plans (because not all compromise plans under divided government will necessarily appear beneficial to one’s party). But as the results show, parties cannot always count on sympathetic same party judges to rule in their favor.</p>
<p>The results of the interaction term <italic>VRA</italic> × <italic>ideology</italic> indicate that ideology has a separate and distinct effect on judicial behavior. Ideology’s effect is greater on judicial decisions in VRA cases than in cases that do not involve the VRA, and this difference is statistically significant. In terms of legal influences, the <italic>no plan</italic> variable shows that states that fail to pass new plans after the decennial census are significantly more likely to have their old plans struck down, a result that is not surprising given longstanding precedent established in the 1960s. Challenges involving congressional plans are more likely to be struck down. The results also indicate that federal judges are upholding more state plans today than they were in the <italic>1990s</italic> or <italic>1980s</italic>. Perhaps states are getting better at compliance as jurisprudence has improved in racial gerrymandering cases and one person, one vote cases. However, <italic>commission</italic> plans in the overall model fare no better than plans drawn by a legislature. Moreover, being a former legislator has no effect on a judge’s behavior toward the state’s redistricting plan.</p>
<p>The story is quite different when looking at the results of the model containing only one person, one vote cases. For these cases, judges show no significant difference in how they treat <italic>same party</italic> and <italic>opposing party</italic> plans. However, they are highly influenced by excessive deviations in district populations. In other words, judges show <italic>no</italic> partisan favoritism in equal population cases. Instead, the law is a powerful predictor of judicial behavior. For example, in state legislative cases, the probability a judge votes for a plan decreases by 36 percent when the plan exceeds the 10 percent deviation rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1065912911421012">25</xref></sup> The substantive effect of this legal variable when litigation involves congressional cases under similar conditions (not reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421012">Table 3</xref>) decreases a judge’s probability in voting for the plan by over 75 percent. Another interesting finding from this model concerns the success of commission-drawn plans in court. In one person, one vote cases, commission plans are significantly more likely to survive judicial scrutiny when compared to legislative-drawn plans. Perhaps commissions are better at conforming to population requirements than their legislative counterparts, and when they do not, judges probably find commission explanations over deviations less sinister and less self-serving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1065912911421012">26</xref></sup> Finally, while partisan gerrymandering cases hardly ever win on their own merits, plaintiffs who bootstrap a partisan gerrymandering claim to a one person, one vote challenge increase their chances of getting a judge to invalidate the state plan by nearly 60 percent. A partisan gerrymandering claim that is added to a one person, one vote case probably makes any deviations from equal population appear more egregious to a judge. These findings are consistent with the notion of a constrained partisan judge.</p>
<p>In contrast to one person, one vote claims, VRA law is ambiguous. Consequently, the influence of partisanship on decision making should be more evident, and indeed the results of the VRA model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421012">Table 3</xref> show this is the case. Under similar circumstances used above (a 1980s state legislative case involving an opposing party judge), the probability that a judge will vote for the VRA plan decreases by 41 percent when that judge is an opposing party judge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1065912911421012">27</xref></sup> Ideological considerations also play a significant role in these cases, echoing the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421012">A. Cox and Miles (2008)</xref>, though the substantive effects of ideology are not necessarily larger than the partisan effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1065912911421012">28</xref></sup> The results confirm the hypothesis that conservative judges are less likely to find discrimination or VRA liability and thus are more likely to uphold plans under VRA attack.</p>
<p>For the racial gerrymandering model, the findings are more exploratory given that there are fewer cases. Nevertheless, the results fit the theme of judicial suspicion of opposing party plans when the law of racial gerrymandering is ambiguous. Partisan influences in judging dissipate after the law was clarified by <italic>Bush v. Vera</italic> and <italic>Shaw II</italic>. This is also a story of mostly conservative Republican-appointed judges striking down southern state plans drawn by Democratic legislatures while Democratic liberal-leaning judges vote to uphold these plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1065912911421012">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presents striking evidence of judges acting on partisan impulses in redistricting disputes over the past three decades, though this partisanship is at times constrained by the law. When redistricting law is vague or unclear, partisan influences become significant factors in judicial decision making, even after accounting for ideological influences. In these instances, federal judges have a greater tendency to strike down redistricting plans drawn up by the opposing party. At the same time, federal judges tend to treat their own party’s plans and divided government plans with much greater deference, as these types of plans are usually upheld.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study illustrates the circumstances under which partisanship and ideology can operate as independent forces in judicial decision making. Ideology has a strong influence on judicial behavior in redistricting, but partisan favoritism also operates as a significant and strong influence that could overshadow ideological impulses. For example, this study finds that more conservative judges (many of whom are Republicans) are less inclined to find discrimination in redistricting plans challenged in VRA litigation. Yet partisanship can also influence judges in VRA cases. Thus, in theory, a Republican judge, who tends to be more conservative and more skeptical of claims of discrimination, might nevertheless declare a plan discriminatory and invalid under the VRA in an effort to favor her or his own party’s interests if that plan had been constructed by a Democratic-controlled redistricting process. In other words, ideology and partisanship are both strong influences in judging in these cases, but they can sometimes operate as competing influences on a judge’s behavior.</p>
<p>Legal perspicuity dampens the effects of partisanship and ideology on judicial behavior. First, judges are heavily influenced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421012"><italic>Baker v. Carr</italic> (1962)</xref> case and its progeny. When a state fails to comply with <italic>Baker v. Carr</italic> by not creating a redistricting plan after a decennial census, federal judges routinely strike down the old plans as unconstitutional. Second, judges show no significant partisan favoritism or ideological divides in equal population cases. Instead, judges rely heavily on population deviation guidelines set by Supreme Court precedent. Judges also exhibit more favorability toward commission-drawn plans in equal population disputes. One possible explanation for this effect is that judges may find commission explanations for population deviations more credible than a legislature’s explanations. Finally, judicial partisanship evaporates in racial gerrymandering cases after the Supreme Court’s <italic>Bush v. Vera</italic> case reduced the ambiguity of how judges should be treating these claims.</p>
<p>The notion that judges in redistricting disputes are motivated to act as constrained partisans—constrained by the law, but influenced by partisanship when the law is ambiguous—is consistent with both strategic and psychological rationales on judging and raises important questions about the nature of judicial decision making. From a strategic perspective, a judge who fails to protect her or his party’s interests after the party recommended her or him to a federal appointment could result in that judge being overlooked by the president of her or his party the next time an appeals court or Supreme Court vacancy occurs. This explanation is weakened somewhat by the fact that twenty-eight self-identified independents in this study exhibit no partisan favoritism in their behavior toward the party that appointed them (see note 24). But such a small number of observations is not enough to reach any definitive conclusions, and thus the motivation of career advancement as a driver of behavior in these cases cannot be ruled out. In addition, there are other rational choice explanations that are consistent with a constrained partisan. As one Harvard Law scholar recently pointed out about judging, “[T]he costs of writing a legally persuasive opinion in favor of the most-preferred outcome are very high, perhaps requiring an extraordinary degree of legal creativity and complexity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912911421012">Stephenson 2009</xref>, 201). Under this explanation, in one person, one vote cases, the costs of writing a legally persuasive opinion against such clear precedent to favor one’s party are too great to attempt.</p>
<p>Alternatively, partisan judging is entirely consistent with more cognitive psychological explanations of judging. In more general studies of political behavior, political scientists have confirmed that partisanship can act as a perceptual screen in areas of political information processing, biasing the judgment of even the most informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911421012">Bartels 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421012">Lodge and Hamill 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912911421012">Lodge and Taber 2000</xref>; in psychology research, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421012">Chen and Chaiken 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912911421012">Lodge and Taber (2000</xref>, 187), “Citizens are always motivated, in some measure, to be accurate, but they are unable completely to ignore their preconceptions and prior affect. The constant tension between the drives for optimal accuracy and belief perseverance underlies all political reasoning.” It is not implausible to suggest that judges may be affected by this phenomenon. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421012">Baum (2006</xref>, 126) notes, in thinking about judicial partisanship, “[M]ost judges have the strong emotional attachments to a party that are abundant in the general population,” and thus political parties can “constitute important reference groups” for judges when making decisions.</p>
<p>Such strategic and psychological explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future research might examine other election-related cases that involve partisan outcomes as a way to shed further light on the psychological and strategic forces that make up the puzzle of judicial behavior.</p>
<p>The evidence of partisan favoritism among federal judges also has important implications for democracy and the redistricting process. While federal judges may not be as partisan as a state legislature in their approach to redistricting, neither are they dispassionate neutral referees who simply “call the fouls,” and this finding raises questions not only about the regulatory fairness of court oversight of redistricting but also about the due process rights of litigants in these cases. When judges make decisions based on what political party they favor, they are not living up to their responsibility to render an equal application of the law to all parties before their court, and thus they violate the due process rights of those who come before their court.</p>
<p>This study suggests that there are practical (if perhaps improbable) measures that the U.S. Supreme Court or the chief judges of the various circuit courts of appeal could take that might reduce the systematic influence of partisanship in these lower court cases. The Supreme Court could further clarify precedent, particularly in VRA cases. In addition, the chief judges in the circuit courts of appeal, who are responsible for forming the three-judge panels in redistricting, might diminish partisan influences by simply ensuring that all redistricting panels are balanced, containing one Republican, one Democrat, and one independent. As long as independents demonstrated no significant biases toward one party or another, the practice would weaken partisan favoritism. Unfortunately, this study cannot decisively answer the question of whether the practice of appointing balanced panels would neutralize partisanship since the study included only a few dozen independent judges. Reaching a more general assessment of whether and how partisanship influences independents’ decision processes must be left for future studies to investigate.</p>

<p>Typically, about 5 percent of a president’s nominees to the federal bench are of the opposite party (another 5 percent or thereabouts are independents). In studying the phenomenon of partisan favoritism in judging, using the party identification of the appointing president would not always be an accurate measure of a judge’s personal party identification. In this study, I employ the actual party identifications of federal judges, regardless of the president who appointed them.</p></fn>

<p>In describing these three types of plans, I employ similar terminology to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd’s (1995)</xref> work. Divided government plans are essentially redistricting plans created in states where no single party controlled the process. Divided government plans in this study include plans drawn by a state where one house of the legislature or the governorship is controlled by a different party (i.e., the traditional definition of divided government). Also grouped in this category are plans drawn by nonpartisan or bipartisan redistricting commissions. All of these plans are grouped in this category because they have one commonality in that neither party had complete control of the redistricting process. In states where partisan-controlled commissions drew lines (such as in Illinois), those plans were treated either as opposing party or same party plans, depending on the partisanship of the reviewing judge.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1065912911421012">
<label>5.</label>
<p>In constructing these judicial approaches to redistricting, I was informed in part by a series of twenty-two interviews of federal judges, conducted in person, across eight states in seven different circuits in 2006 and 2007. The twenty-two interviews are not a random set of judges. Budgetary constraints for the interview project limited the range of places that could be visited. Furthermore, most judges in the jurisdictions I traveled to refused interview requests. There is a heavy bias in the sample toward judges located in one particular circuit. Nevertheless, of those who did agree to an interview, more than half had prior experience with a redistricting case. Only three of the twenty-two judges directly stated their belief that partisanship affected decision making among their colleagues. An additional two hinted that such an influence might be a possibility. The other seventeen interviewees either outright rejected or side-stepped discussion of the notion that partisan favoritism could have any influence in their colleagues’ decisions. Even among these other seventeen, however, one could detect partisan bias in how some of these judges characterized their own party’s plans or the opposing party’s plans. For example, one federal judge who used to be a Democratic political operative rejected the notion that federal judges are influenced by partisanship in redistricting cases. Only a few moments later, she went on at length to complain bitterly about the 2003 Republican gerrymander in Texas, finally asking me in exasperation, “What did the children think?!”</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1065912911421012">

<p>Alternatively, judges may vote to uphold divided government plans (or bipartisan commission plans), in part, because the legal attacks on such plans are less likely to involve partisan-tinged evidence from the acts of the legislature (or commission), since both parties agreed to the plans. Under this perspective, judges are not necessarily indifferent to the partisan concerns of their party; rather, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421012">Lloyd (1995</xref>, 415) points out, such plans “would have presented no reference group identification for the judge.” The lack of a partisan imprint would present one less reason for a federal judge to strike down the plan, thus resulting in judges upholding divided government plans at higher rates.</p></fn>

<p>The legal claims do not add up to 100 percent because plaintiffs can assert multiple claims in a lawsuit. Excluded from the analysis are VRA claims before a single federal judge, which constitute only a handful of all cases (though keeping them in the statistical analysis does not change the results). Legal disputes over judicial districts and local electoral districts are also excluded from this analysis.</p></fn>

<p>Some lawsuits include both attacks on state legislative plans and attacks on congressional plans, and where the courts treated these claims all in one published opinion, they were considered only as three observations for the three-judge court for analytical purposes. In other words, if there were claims against multiple plans (state house, state senate, and congressional), and a judge struck down all three plans in the opinion, that was considered as only one vote against the state. To do otherwise only results in double counting, causing error in the analysis by overemphasizing certain judges’ displeasure or contentedness with the state’s actions in particular cases. The central act I want to measure is whether the judge votes against the state in an opinion. Because the courts often treat these claims in an omnibus fashion, it makes sense to model the analysis by each published decision.</p></fn>

<p>In some instances, decisions on the merits included grants of summary judgment. Cases that had previously been reversed and remanded by the Supreme Court were counted as a new case. Cases deemed “frivolous” by the court were included because one person’s frivolity may be another’s legitimate legal concern (only a few cases were actually deemed frivolous by a court). Preliminary orders were not included unless such orders were final dispositions in their practical effects. Cases on remand from state court, which were sent back to state court, were not counted unless such remand orders could clearly be interpreted as effectively dismissing the lawsuit (e.g., if the plaintiffs had no recourse in state court).</p></fn>

<p>For the vast majority of observations, the state plan is the plan adopted by the state legislature or state commission. In a few instances a state court drew the plan. If the court could be determined by partisanship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421012"><italic>Kelley v. Bennett</italic> 2000</xref>), then the partisanship of the plan could be identified. State court plans with no obvious partisan side (and a nonpartisan state judiciary) are coded the same as divided government plans. The results are the same if run without these state court drawn plans.</p></fn>

<p>The legal test in <italic>Gingles</italic> requires lower courts to conduct a threshold inquiry into three factors (but the various federal circuit courts of appeal are in disagreement on the interpretation in application of those factors, and, at any rate, since three-judge district courts are accountable only to the Supreme Court—appeals from these special courts go directly to the Supreme Court—these three-judge courts are not even necessarily beholden to their own circuit’s interpretation of <italic>Gingles</italic>). Even if the lower courts could agree on the interpretation of the threshold inquiry regarding the three factors, there is a second test that must be conducted called the “totality of the circumstances,” consisting of a myriad of “senate factors” (drawn from the Senate Judiciary Committee Report during the 1982 amendments to the act) that a judge can weigh as much or as little as she or he likes. University of Chicago law professors Adam Cox and Thomas Miles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421012">2008</xref>, 7-8) write that “there has been considerable disagreement about the precise meaning of [the totality of the circumstances] standard” as well as other aspects of section 2 VRA cases.</p></fn>

<p>Partisan gerrymandering jurisprudence is technically ambiguous when one considers the fact that the Supreme Court has failed to articulate a clear standard in two different cases (both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421012"><italic>Davis v. Bandemer</italic>’s 1986</xref> plurality opinion and the more recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1065912911421012"><italic>Vieth v. Jubelirer</italic> 2004</xref>). However, in practice most courts dismiss partisan gerrymandering claims. These claims are often asserted by litigants alongside other claims, but only rarely do litigants initiate a partisan gerrymandering action by itself.</p></fn>

<p>The probabilities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421012">Table 3</xref> for the “all cases” model were obtained by setting the scenario to a VRA complaint over state legislative districts with an opposing party judge in the 1980s (and with the interaction term <italic>VRA</italic> × <italic>Opposing Party</italic> set at 1), holding all other variables at their mode or mean.

<p>These conclusions hold if one runs the analyses excluding judges who identify as independents. In fact, the strength of partisanship is slightly more pronounced in this alternative model. There are twenty-eight federal judges in the data set who self-identify as independents. These independents appear to exhibit no partisan favoritism toward the party of the president who appointed them, as there is no statistical relationship between their votes on plans and partiality to the party of the president who appointed them. However, given the small amount of independents in the study, these findings are more suggestive than concrete.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912911421012">Winburn (2008)</xref> has argued that commissions cannot help states avoid the judicial axe in court.

<p>Changing the variable from its minimum to its maximum value (moving from the most liberal to the most conservative judge) increases the probability of a judicial vote in favor of the plan by 37 percent.

<p>Only four Democratic judges faced <italic>opposing party</italic> (Republican) plans in cases involving racial gerrymandering claims. Three of the four Democratic judges did behave in a manner consistent with the hypothesis by voting to strike down these Republican plans. But the paucity of Democratic judge observations facing opposing party plans presents some multicollinearity issues. <italic>Ideology</italic> correlated highly with the <italic>opposing party</italic> variable in these cases since most of the opposing party judges were also Republicans (and thus more conservative). This circumstance necessitated the dropping of ideology as an independent variable in this model.</p></fn>
