<abstract>
<p>Although there is now some recognition that sexual abuse, particularly that which occurs in religious settings, has spiritual implications for women who have been abused, the spiritual implications of sexual abuse which occurs beyond the confines of specific religious practices and beliefs tend not to be acknowledged. Taking a stance that all people, irrespective of their involvement in a formal religion, are inherently spiritual, this paper identifies the key concepts associated with spirituality as meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence. Examples as to how each of these may be issues following the experience of sexual abuse are provided. This approach challenges prevailing notions that sexual abuse only has spiritual implications for women who identify with a particular religious tradition. Instead it is argued that an experience of sexual abuse can be critical for the spiritual life of any woman who is subjected to abuse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years in many countries including Australia, Britain, Ireland and the USA, allegations about sexual abuse happening within religious contexts have appeared so often in the media that we are now rarely shocked at new reports. From the perspective of many media outlets, scandals make good copy, and particularly scandals involving the seemingly good, i.e. religious officials, engaging in the seemingly bad, i.e. illicit sexual activities, especially those involving minors. Typically, the focus will be on what happened, often long ago. If current consequences are even mentioned, these tend to be concerned with acute mental health or relationship problems, with religious or spiritual implications hardly, if at all, considered. Similar critiques can be applied to the reports of formal inquiries into allegations of abuse in religious institutions, such as that released by the Irish Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse [CICA] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0966735011425301">2009</xref>) about the abuse of children which had occurred over several decades in state institutions. Overwhelmingly the report, produced in five volumes and running to more than two and a half thousand pages, focused on abuse which happened in 216 residential schools run by several Catholic religious orders. Shocking accounts of physical and emotional abuse, as well as neglect and sexual abuse, being inflicted on girls and boys are provided. Although these institutions employed lay staff, many of the reported accounts involved perpetrators who were members of religious orders. In total there were just 133 words devoted to the topic ‘Religion now practiced’ and no discussion about spirituality more generally in this report:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Two hundred and ninety three (293) witnesses (37%), 156 male and 137 female, stated that they are practising Catholics and 11 others are practising members of different religious denominations.</p>
<p>Many witnesses described themselves as “lapsed Catholics” who had disengaged from the Church, but whose belief in God was unchanged. Witnesses described the continuing anxiety associated with encountering members of religious congregations. “<italic>I cannot serve a nun now where I work they…</italic>(colleagues)<italic>… call it ‘nun alert’</italic>.” Others reported they avoided entering buildings associated with religious congregations, such as churches and schools, for fear of reactivating memories of their abusive experiences.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty (120) witnesses (15%), 62 male and 58 female, described themselves as having completely rejected the idea of religion. Sixty three (63) witnesses did not comment on their religious practise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0966735011425301">CICA, 2009</xref>: 229).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>About the same time as the Irish report was made public, an Australian report concerning 191 reports of child sexual abuse made to the Anglican Church between 1990 and 2008 was released. While the majority of complainants were male, a quarter of the complaints were made by females. Similar to the Irish report, the majority of alleged offenders were clergy or candidates for the clergy, but a substantial minority held other paid or voluntary positions within church organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0966735011425301">Parkinson et al., 2009</xref>). There is no explicit mention of the religious or spiritual impacts of this abuse in this report.</p>
<p>If there is little community recognition of the impacts of sexual abuse on the spirituality of those who are abused within religious contexts, there is even less acknowledgement of there being spiritual consequences for those who are sexually abused in other settings. This paper emanates from a belief that all people, irrespective of their involvement in a formal religion, are inherently spiritual, and that significant and traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse have the potential to impact on one’s spirituality. To demonstrate this potential, I will use a framework which does not locate spirituality within particular religious settings or even require any association with any formal religion.</p>

<title>Is This an Issue?</title>
<p>Within my own religion of Christianity, a dominant assumption has long been that sexual abuse almost inevitably leads a person to leave the Church and abandon their beliefs in a loving or caring God. Indeed it is not surprising that many survivors come to believe that the church was allied with their abusers or that God neglected them when they were in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0966735011425301">Pritt, 1998</xref>). Such reasons are often cited for abandoning religious beliefs or severing connections with forms of organized religion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0966735011425301">Finkelhor et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0966735011425301">Kane et al., 1993</xref>). Survivors ‘often feel their feelings of anger, melancholy or anxiety are not welcome in the church’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0966735011425301">Carr, 1996</xref>: 23) and in some cases it has been suggested they who should leave their worshipping community and go elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0966735011425301">Last et al., 1994</xref>). For those who do leave, this can reflect a belief that an unreconstructed church has nothing to offer individuals who are desperate to reconstruct their lives following the experience of sexual abuse, rather than necessarily being an outright rejection of a desire for a relationship with God or other spiritual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2009</xref>). Having left, they are not considered to have any spiritual needs or spiritual needs which the church has any responsibility to assist them with, rendering further consideration of their spiritual needs unnecessary.</p>
<p>A dominant assumption that women who are sexually abused always leave their religious roots occludes the fact that there are some women whose attempts to make sense of the experience of abuse may also lead to greater religious involvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425301">2010a</xref>). Nevertheless, some of those who have stayed in the church have found their spiritual needs relegated to being of less importance than those of the alleged perpetrators of sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0966735011425301">Evinger and Yoder, 2002</xref>). Christianity does not have a monopoly on being problematic for survivors of sexual abuse, and the spiritual implications of sexual abuse for Jewish women are often not dissimilar from those of Christian women (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425301">Lev, 2003</xref>). Women of many religious persuasions have been subjected to forms of sexual abuse by men who claim that they are carrying out their religious duty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425301">Farrell and Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425301">King, 2009</xref>). Rape, sexual mutilation and inscription of the religious insignia of their attackers have all been used as methods of warfare during times of religious and political upheaval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425301">Menon, 2006</xref>). For example, in the process of becoming an independent nation it has been estimated that 200,000 women were raped in Bangladesh in 1971. As the Pakistani authorities considered the Bengali Muslims to be Muslim in name only, rape was legitimized as a means to populating Bangladesh with a new generation who would be ‘proper’ Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0966735011425301">Mookherjee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In such circumstances, some women make choices which to outsiders appear unfathomable. For example, after the partition of India some young Hindu women married their Muslim abductors, took on their religion and chose to stay with these husbands in Pakistan even when opportunities emerged for them to be repatriated back to their families in India. It is suggested that such women may have had legitimate fears both for their own safety and that of the safety of any child they had borne who was not of their family’s religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425301">Menon, 2006</xref>). For women in this situation it has been proposed that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Forcible conversion to another religion marks a violent appropriation through the rhetoric of her soul. The template of conversion, while staking a claim on the soul, does so through the conduit of the body. Therefore, conversion affords a spiritual dimension to the violation of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425301">Menon, 2006</xref>: 34-35).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are countless other examples which could be provided which consider the many spiritual implications of sexual abuse for women of various religions. However, as someone living in a country in which around only 10 percent of the population are actively involved in any form of organized religion, but most consider themselves to be ‘spiritual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0966735011425301">Tacey, 2003</xref>), I want to turn to the question of whether there might be spiritual implications for women who have been sexually abused, irrespective of whether they are connected with any religion. This will first require some consideration as to what might be meant by spirituality in such circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0966735011425301">
<title>What is Spirituality?</title>
<p>In my work as a social work academic, I have found myself having to explain what I mean by spirituality to audiences of whom the majority would not share my religious perspective, and many of whom have no more than a nominal association with any form of religion. As I work in a multi-faith context, the approach I have taken has been to forgo the ostensibly religious language and concepts which could be taken for granted in discussions with my co-religionists and consider neutral language which might recognize the experiences of persons of other religions and those of no religion. In my reading on spirituality from a broad range of perspectives, I found there were five concepts which recurred frequently, and it seemed as if one or more of these were present in every one of the very diverse definitions of spirituality which I had managed to locate. These categories were meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence. For the purposes of my work, the following is my current working definition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Spirituality involves an awareness of the other, which may be God or other human or divine beings or something else, which provides the basis for us to establish our needs and desires for, understand our experiences of, and ask questions about, meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence. While for some individuals these concerns will be integrally associated with their religious beliefs, and may only make sense within a specific religious framework, meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence are intrinsic to the human experience, whether or not individuals regard these to be in the realm of spirituality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2010b</xref>: 7).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the remainder of this paper, I will explore the impact of sexual abuse in terms of women’s experiences and issues in respect of meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0966735011425301">
<title>Meaning</title>
<p>Experiences of sexual abuse invariably involve a violation of trust and of the boundaries of intimacy. Consequently, people’s outlooks and perspectives on life may be so fundamentally challenged that some previously held assumptions are no longer tenable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425301">Herman, 2001</xref>). In particular, this can affect what is meaningful and the meanings people attach to words or actions. It has been suggested that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The systems of meaning that people build up are always fragile, for they are made up of the tiny fragments of their lived experience, the many loves, small and great, of their lives. Sexual abuse is a bulldozer gouging a road through this fragile ecosystem of love and meaning that a person has been painfully constructing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0966735011425301">Robinson, 2007</xref>: 217).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For example, the novelist Alice Sebold, has written that ‘When I was raped I lost my virginity and almost lost my life. I also discarded certain assumptions I held about how the world worked and about how safe I was’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0966735011425301">Sebold, 1990</xref>: 34). Women who have interpreted sexual abuse as a violation of the body may become wary of physical contact with others, particularly that which implies a degree of affection. Hence gestures of affection such as a kiss or hug from someone whom one has not yet grown to trust, can be misinterpreted leaving both parties feeling hurt and confused. As Jewish author Rachel Lev explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be hurtful or dangerous. I want to be a gentle creature, a kind soul, a gift. But his abuse left me believing I am evil and deeply flawed, empty and frightened. So I beseech you to be careful before you touch my jagged edges–before you reach out to hold me because if you take me on your lap I may cut you off at the knees before either one of us knows what has happened and then we will both be sorry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425301">Lev, 2003</xref>: 82).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such wariness often goes beyond touch, and some survivors will also find it difficult to know who they can talk with either about the abuse or other intimate or important aspects of their lives. Many survivors of sexual abuse experience symptoms which may be consistent with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whether or not there has been a formal diagnosis. Disordered thoughts are quite normal among sufferers of PTSD, and this may include a distrust of one’s own soul and emotions. Not only may this affect one’s ability to engage in relationships with persons such as friends, lovers, family members or even divine beings, but may be problematic in seeking counselling or guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425301">Ganje-Fling and McCarthy, 1996</xref>). When they do confide in others, they may need reassurance that what seem to them to be strange thoughts and reactions are actually very normal and not necessarily a sign of madness or mental instability.</p>
<p>A wariness of others – or a wariness of one’s ability to interpret and respond correctly to the cues of others – invariably leads to inhibitions in thoughts and/or actions. Conversely, for some women, a response to sexual abuse is to become disinhibited and sexually active with many partners. This includes women who had previously been in what they believed to be committed relationships with a single partner.</p>
<p>The internet has many accounts of women who attribute their sexual activity to their experiences of sexual abuse. For example, a 19 year-old female who had been abused from the ages of 13 to 16 by the older brother of a former boyfriend has written that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve never been without a male and I’ve slept with probably over 35 guys since being with him. Even if I didn’t want to. I never say no. And also I get emotionally attached very easily. But about 2 days after I stop seeing a guy I’ll be seeing a new one. The one I’m currently seeing told me girls who had been molested had a look in pain during intercourse, as though they have to put up with it and he can tell if a girls been raped. He told me i gave that look. I never told him I’d been raped and a guy once before that said i gave that look, and just tell him to stop if it hurts. As soon as my relationship gets serious, I feel smothered and trapped, like I can’t get out. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0966735011425301">Rape causing promiscuity, not dated</xref>, grammar and spelling reproduced as per original posting)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For others, high levels of sexual activity is just one of a number of what others might deem destructive behaviours which might be engaged in as part of a search for meaning. Another account found on the internet reads:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Ive been raped. and i was EXTREMELY promiscuous for years after. it took me getting knocked up and having an abortion to finally settle down. Its sad it took something of that extreme to get me to see what i was doing to myself and that i couldnt involve another being into the twisted hell my life had become i was drinking all the time doing all kinda of drugs. then i met the most wonderful person in my life now i finally have an understanding of a healthy relationship and lifestyle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0966735011425301">Victims of Rape, not dated</xref>, grammar and spelling reproduced as per original posting)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not everyone has the fairytale ending, in which they eventually live happily forever after. For some there can be no going back. Many religions place great importance on virginity and proscribe sexual relationships outside marriage. If sexual abuse has resulted in a religious woman no longer being a virgin, she may believe there is no longer any prohibition preventing her from engaging in sexual activity. For some this can become another justification for withdrawing from one’s religious beliefs and/or religious community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0966735011425301">
<title>Identity</title>
<p>Whether or not one’s systems of meaning have been affected, questions of identity or self perceptions must be addressed. For a start, revealing that one has been sexually abused can be risky in terms of one’s reputation. Perpetrators may engage a wide array of tactics to ensure allegations of abuse do not emerge, and, if they do so, that these will be perceived by others as of dubious credibility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. Secrecy and silence are the perpetrator’s first line of defense. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens. To this end, he marshals an impressive array of arguments, from the most blatant denial to the most sophisticated and elegant rationalization. After every atrocity one can expect to hear the same predictable apologies: it never happened; the victim lies; the victim exaggerates; the victim brought it upon herself; and in any case it is time to forget the past and move on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425301">Herman, 2001</xref>: 8).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to lacking credibility, she may be subjected to taunts that she is a ‘harlot’, ‘wanton woman’, ‘scarlet woman’, or ‘Jezebel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425301">Francis and Turner, 1995</xref>) who requires harsh punishment to reform them from being ‘wayward’ or ‘temptresses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0966735011425301">Leonard, 2006</xref>: 147). While some women can readily laugh and put aside such imputations on their character, others wonder whether they really have done something wrong. In other words, they confuse being a sinner with having been sinned against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are many religious people and religious organizations who provide exemplary support to women who have been sexually abused, religious zealotry underpins some of the most devastating attacks on the identity imaginable. For example, in the extremely fundamentalist religious group she was part of, one woman tells of the following teaching:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A soul tie is described as a spiritual connection between our soul and that of another person. These can be godly (as in marriage) or demonic. Although some teachings make reference to emotional soul ties and soul ties developed through “unhealthy” fantasy the emphasis is generally on those formed through sexual activity. The belief here is that any ungodly sex – that is any sexual activity that takes place outside marriage, results in the forming of a demonic soul tie between the two people. The presence of a soul tie then allows the demons from one person to pass to the person they are tied with … Therefore rape and sexual abuse counted. In fact I even heard it taught that because of the demon activity in an abused person they will attract abuse again and again as like (as in demons in an abused person) attracts like (as in the demons in an abuser). Believing that I had this spiritual tie to the man who raped me was for me absolutely terrifying. It added to the guilt, shame, fear and sense of being dirty that I already had and caused me a great deal of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0966735011425301">Spiritual Abuse, not dated</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If abuse has resulted in pregnancy, feelings of shame and guilt may compound the situation further. Proscription on abortion has been legitimated by many governments claiming strong religious influence or backing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0966735011425301">Moenne, 2005</xref>). In such circumstances, an abused woman may have to contemplate taking the physical and legal risks of having an illegal abortion. If she chooses to continue with the pregnancy, she may be revered for producing much-needed children for the future of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0966735011425301">Moenne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0966735011425301">Mookherjee, 2008</xref>), but may also nevertheless be told that she must endure the pains of childbirth because of her sins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0966735011425301">Moenne, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While difficult decisions about pregnancy and abortion need only be made by a few women who have been abused, much more common is the experience of low self esteem. While this can manifest itself in ‘the grip of a conviction that I am a terrible person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2006</xref>: 73), on an everyday basis it can make acts such as seeking assistance from others, even friends, a difficult experience lest the request be rejected. Receiving compliments or gifts, grasping that they are valued by others or that good things can happen to them, may be further struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Another way in which sexual abuse impacts on some women’s identities is that they find themselves not conforming to preferred images of themselves. For instance, some women have been socialized to believe that intense anger towards their abuser is in conflict with religious teachings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0966735011425301">Brewster, 1996</xref>) and/or beyond the bounds of feminine behaviour. Some even come to the point at which they have thought about killing their abuser or even wanted to do so. While such responses can evoke guilt, others come to the realization that expressing one’s anger is appropriate and even essential in order to realize change either for oneself or others. This in turn may evoke a recognition that their own lives are valuable and worth fighting for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0966735011425301">Brison, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0966735011425301">
<title>Connectedness</title>
<p>Perhaps one of the most common effects of sexual abuse is a sense of profound attack on one’s sense of connectedness. Given that discussion of even legitimate and non-abusive sexual expression between consenting persons is frequently a taboo subject, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to disclose that one has been sexually abused. Many women cannot talk about their abuse, and remain silent for years or even decades after it occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2010c</xref>). Terror can render individuals psychologically shattered and physically unable to speak of their experiences, as is often the case for those who have endured some form of torture:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A person’s self and a person’s world are constructed largely of interpersonal relationships–links to others, both significant and peripheral–which help define who one is. In torture’s shattering of self and world, those relationships are undone, and the victim is left isolated and alone, that is, without the resources to reconstitute a shared life, and therefore an integrated self. … The horror of torture is magnified by the realization that <italic>this is being done to me by another human being</italic>. It is a perversion and destruction of the very idea of human relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425301">Cavanaugh, 1998</xref>: 43).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Survivors are frequently terrified to speak of their experiences, especially if they have been threatened with death or violence should they ever reveal what has occurred. In such cases, it may only be years later, when the perpetrator has died or for some other reason is no longer in a position in which they have any possibility of carrying out their threats, that women feel able to disclose what has happened to them. There may also be some women for whom choosing not to speak about what has happened to them creates a sense of control over a situation in which any sense of control had previously been denied to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2010c</xref>). One arena in which many survivors are anxious as to the reaction of news that they have been sexually assaulted is in the workplace. A particular concern is that one’s professional credibility will be questioned, especially if in the course of one’s work there are opportunities to speak out about issues associated with sexual violence or abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425301">Brison, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only is sexual abuse a horrendous experience for the individual who has been abused, but friends and family members who are normally supportive may themselves be too horrified or scandalized by what has happened to be able to provide much needed support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425301">Brison, 1993</xref>). In some instances those who one might expect to be supportive prefer disclosures of abuse not to occur in order not to tarnish the reputations of particular individuals or organizations. In some cases, women have even been threatened with law suits by religious organizations if they decided to take legal action against officials of such organizations for sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425301">Dokecki, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Not being able to speak of the abuse one has endured often leaves women in the situation in which they are unaware of other women who have been abused with whom they might connect. Once such connections are made, many survivors report learning how others have negotiated the many impacts of sexual abuse, an experience which has brought much encouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0966735011425301">Clohessy, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Transformation</title>
<p>Immersed in bleakness and despair, it is not surprising that some women who have been sexually abused contemplate suicide, and some succeed in killing themselves. The desire for transformation is strong, and for some, the process of this starts with the process of telling their stories. As Rachel Lev has noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We bear witness in part by listening to survivor stories. Then we address the questions: How do we help people heal? What do we do to stop these abuses? Where do we start? Simple answers will not work. Blaming and shaming won’t work even though they’re tempting. Healing and prevention happen together when we listen to the stories that must be told, then share resources and a commitment to peaceful relationships. Healing comes when we “shine the light” on what is, what was, and what needs to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425301">Lev, 2003</xref>: xxvii).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than minimize feelings that may be intense and excruciating, the passionate outpourings of grief which characterize lament may be an essential element in the journey towards hope. Although sometimes wrongly depicted as weakness, great strength is required to lament that which should not have happened and which needs to be named. This is the first step to recognizing past injustices and taking action to ensure that they do not occur again. This in turn is necessary if hope is to overcome despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425301">Goulding, 2003</xref>). A further step may be to create narratives which can incorporate the new self which emerges after acknowledging the impact of sexual abuse. One of the turning points in moving from viewing oneself as a victim to a survivor may be coming to the realization that things don’t have to be done as they have been before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2009</xref>). Symbolically, this may involve changes to one’s outward appearance such as radical changes to one’s appearance. After surviving a violent rape and attempted murder, Susan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425301">Brison (1993)</xref> wrote that her experience led her to understand what had been described to her as a Jewish custom of changing one’s name after a brush with death.</p>
<p>Transformation is not easy. As one survivor of sexual abuse explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The effects of sexual exploitation are worse than a middle ear infection that takes a long time to heal and leaves scar tissue that never heals … Recovery from sexual exploitation is harder than recovery from 17 years of substance abuse. Sexual exploitation is more painful than being the last person your friend talks to before she jumps off the Windsor Bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0966735011425301">Lewis, 1995</xref>: 49).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Confronting the reality of sexual abuse may also require individuals to acknowledge their own powerlessness, and in some contexts, the economic poverty which has forced them into sexual relationships which in other circumstances they may not have chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0966735011425301">Althaus-Reid, 2000</xref>). In order to do so, individuals may need space to be able to express difficult feelings such as doubts and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2006</xref>) and be prepared to make mistakes along the way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2010a</xref>). Moreover, being open to the possibility of transformation is to accept that there will be times when one is beckoned to take a leap, not fully knowing what comes next, but with the hope for a vision of the divine or some other experience of transcendence.</p>

<sec id="section8-0966735011425301">
<title>Transcendence</title>
<p>Transcendence has been described as an ‘experience of the sacred which is accompanied by feelings of wonder, joy, love, trust and hope’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0966735011425301">Engebretson, 2006</xref>: 330). However, it might be more helpful to think of transcendence in terms of those moments of illumination which emerge from an encounter with the other as we seek to make sense of our experiences and establish our needs and desires for connectedness, identity, meaning and transformation. As such, transcendence refers to:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a capacity in human beings for wonderment, for experiencing or pondering what might lie beyond the visible, tangible aspects of reality; for interest in the nature and origin of things; and for considering how one is to relate to others, oneself, and to the world about us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0966735011425301">Trousdale, 2005</xref>: 63).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A capacity to experience transcendence is what nourishes the human soul and makes us feel fully alive. As Rachel Lev has noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The human soul hungers for sustenance, nurturance, inspiration, for connection to something greater than itself. It glorifies the divine, the holy, and finds rapture in its presence. For some, this hunger is fed by the glories of nature. The sight of the sun setting, the sound of roaring ocean waves, the sweet seduction of a gentle breeze connects us to something grand and glorious. For some this hunger is fed by the rituals and traditions of a religion or self-help network. For others it is fed by loving relationships. For some, it is not fed at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425301">Lev, 2003</xref>: 135).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many women who have been sexually abused are among those who, at least for a while following abuse, report a sense of having ‘died’ and find it difficult to imagine they will ever again experience a sense of wonderment or awe, let alone joy or ecstasy. Being able to imagine new possibilities may be crucial for moving on from a situation in which one feels trapped or a hostage to the terror of the memories of sexuaI abuse. However, an inability to engage the imagination may in part explain reports of self-harming behaviours among women who have been sexually abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>If there is little public recognition that sexual abuse within religious institutions has spiritual implications, it is not surprising that the spiritual implications of abuse for both religious women abused outside the confines of organized religion and women who don’t identify as being religious, is even less likely to be acknowledged. Nevertheless, as this paper has sought to demonstrate, there are potentially spiritual implications for all women who have experienced sexual abuse, irrespective of where the abuse occurred and their religious beliefs and practices or lack thereof.</p>
<p>The framework which I have used to explore the impacts of sexual abuse on a woman’s spirituality involves consideration of five key concepts which are integral to spirituality – meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence. Not only are these key elements of a healthy spirituality, but they also reflect many of the common responses or issues which women report difficulties with after sexual abuse. These may emerge in respect of specific religious beliefs and practices, but also in everyday life more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425301">Crisp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425301">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425301">Lev, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing this potential range of spiritual impacts facilitates a greater understanding of the complexity of the lived experience for many women more so than limiting understanding of spirituality to participation in formal religions. Furthermore, recognition of this complexity requires both religious organizations and others who seek to promote spiritual development, to be sensitive to, and, if need be, to respond to a wide range of issues which on the face of it might not seem to be spiritual matters, but in fact underpin the spiritual beliefs and practices of women who have been sexually abused. Being attentive to issues of meaning, identity, connectedness, transformation and transcendence, is arguably good practice in terms of promoting a healthy spirituality, irrespective of whether the target group have been sexually abused or not.Undoubtedly conceptualizing spirituality in this way is contentious, and brings criticisms from those who believe that spirituality cannot be divorced from religious beliefs and practices. However, I am not alone in my belief that everyone, not just the avowedly religious, are spiritual beings. A survey of religious leaders in Britain found that the majority of respondents who were Christian, Jewish or from no identified religious tradition considered spirituality to be something everyone experienced, as did some of the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0966735011425301">Rose, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While sexual abuse undoubtedly has profound impacts on the spirituality of many women, some of these may be life-long whereas others may be issues at particular points of time. Importantly, while there may be periods when one’s spirituality might be dominated by the effects of sexual abuse, it doesn’t necessarily remain that way, especially if other more positive life experiences become highly influential:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… she went on to talk about her life and work, and about her partner and the children they had together. She talked about the person she had become in that relationship. From a distance, if all I knew about her was the sickening details of what had been done to her, she would have appeared in every way to be a victim. But up close, in a personal meeting and the beginning of a friendship, she was recognizable as the interesting, accomplished, confident person that she is. The abuse, terrible as it was, was not the last word on her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425301">Dutney, 2005</xref>: 57).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is nevertheless striking that in this very brief glimpse into a woman’s life, we learn something about her sense of meaning (work, family), connectedness (relationships with partner and children, beginning friendship with the author), identity (‘the interesting, accomplished, confident person that she is’) and the sense of transformation (‘the abuse, terrible as it was, was not the last word on her’).</p>
<p>Although sexual abuse does not have to be the last word, it nevertheless needs to be acknowledged as a very real experience which has significant implications for many women’s spirituality, particularly in the face of attempts to diminish or ignore the devastating consequences of sexual abuse for many women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0966735011425301">Zeedyk, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, while I have indicated a number of areas in which these may occur, there may be many other ways in which sexual abuse has spiritual impacts for women. Suggestions that sexual abuse only has spiritual implications for religious women fails to take account of how detrimental an experience of sexual abuse can be for women as well as failing to engage with the broader understandings of spirituality which have been emerging in recent years. While this paper has begun to explore why sexual abuse has spiritual implications for all women who have been abused and not just those who are religious in a more traditional sense, clearly far more work is needed to explore this issue.</p>
