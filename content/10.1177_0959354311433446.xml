<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the tensions between narrative therapy’s self-identification as a Foucauldian poststructural practice, and its attachment to the notion of personal agency. Michael White—narrative therapy’s primary author—used Foucault’s work as a theoretical foundation, moving us to pose a question that White did not address: Can the narrative therapeutic commitment to an agentive subject be sustained alongside White’s loyalty to the Foucauldian notion of power/knowledge and its account of the constituted subject? I argue that while Foucault is often criticized for not making space for freedom or agency, something like an agentive subject is implicit in, even required for, his constitutionalist perspective to work. Working through this problem could be useful for the developing field of narrative therapy. Three proposals are offered as a way of imagining this agentive figure, and their relevance to narrative therapy practice is discussed.</p>

<p>Narrative therapy’s chief architect, Michael White (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354311433446">2000</xref>), consistently argued that this approach should be seen as a poststructural practice, with the work of Michel Foucault lying somewhere near its heart (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311433446">Besley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311433446">Epston, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311433446">Payne, 2006</xref>). White has sought to build a therapy that uses as theoretical platforms Foucault’s account of power/knowledge and his critique of the humanistic, sovereign subject in particular. Consequently, for some, narrative therapy “maps naturally onto Foucault’s ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354311433446">Madigan, 1992</xref>, p. 266). But a therapist and a social theorist will inevitably have different priorities, and indeed there are some discernible tensions involved in White’s fidelity to Foucault, which are seldom articulated in the narrative therapy literature (with some exceptions, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311433446">Luepnitz, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The tension that concerns us here revolves around the issue of personal agency, a notion which is considerably more problematized in Foucauldian scholarship than it is in White’s narrative therapy. This might account for the fact that while the figure of Foucault looms large in the narrative therapeutic literature, his name is barely mentioned in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White’s (2007)</xref> most recent writings on personal agency. In light of this tension, the question posed by this paper is: Can narrative therapy’s view of the agentive subject be sustained within the context of power/knowledge and its associated account of the constituted subject, and can it simultaneously be distinguished from the sovereign subject of which Foucault was so critical? I argue that it can.</p>
<p>I begin by examining how White uses Foucault, before exploring the issue of agency, which is problematic for both authors. Nevertheless, this paper suggests that something like an agentive subject is implicit in, and indeed required for, Foucault’s constitutionalist perspective to work. In light of this, three proposals are put forward (illustrated with a case study) to think through what it could mean to be an agentive subject in the context of a Foucauldian narrative therapy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354311433446">
<title>From Foucault’s social analysis to White’s narrative therapy</title>
<p>White uses Foucault in two broad, though systematic, ways. First, Foucault’s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311433446">1980</xref>) notion of “power/knowledge” is introduced as a way of understanding the social context within which persons’ lives are constituted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). And second, White embraces Foucault’s critiques of humanistic assumptions of the self, and associated normative discourses and practices, thereby distancing narrative therapy from humanistic therapeutic practices and promoting its identity as a form of poststructural inquiry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>). Let us discuss each of these in turn.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311433446">Besley (2002)</xref>, Foucault’s power/ knowledge formulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311433446">Foucault, 1980</xref>) was foundational for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White and Epston’s (1990)</xref> understanding both of the person’s contextual situation and of the narratives in which his or her life is constituted. White and Epston attempted to render salient the ways in which human beings are not merely caught up in but also shaped or constituted by the dynamics of power and discourse. As a theoretical pillar for the development of narrative therapy, this formulation of a dynamic and mutually productive relationship between power and knowledge lent White what might be described as a constitutionalist perspective on the subject. That is, the subject is constituted by discursive practices and the power relations within which they are embedded. Thinking of power as operating in and through knowledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354311433446">Foucault (1983)</xref> once stated that “the individual is the product of power” (p. xiv). While this is admittedly an extreme statement in the overall context of Foucault’s more nuanced work, it does point to the hard edge of the constitutionalist approach.</p>
<p>In his own writing, White simplified this point, claiming that the self is constituted in “stories.” He and Epston noted that “stories are constitutive—shaping lives and relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>, p. 12). This phrase quickly spread through the narrative literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311433446">Freedman &amp; Combs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311433446">Morgan, 2000</xref>). It is important to note, though, that the “stories” or “narratives” after which narrative therapy is named should be considered not merely as cognitive or constructivist phenomena, but as socially embedded, socially negotiated, and socially performed arrangements of meaning. These narratives entail meaning in, and meaning as, social practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">White, 1997</xref>). Thus, personal narratives—the stories with which narrative therapists are engaged—shape identity to the extent that they are <italic>practices</italic> taking place in the social, cultural, and historical realms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>), and which are thereby implicated in the broader power/knowledge dynamics articulated by Foucault. They are given meaning and social relevance—indeed they are themselves constituted—by the power/knowledge networks in which they are articulated and practised.</p>
<p>While the relationship between power and knowledge was key for White’s thinking about the person (and his or her difficulties as constituted in power/knowledge systems),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354311433446">1</xref></sup> he also discussed the models of self he was countering in the process. This is White’s second major use of Foucault. He (e.g., 1997) drew much inspiration from Foucault’s critiques of the humanistic subject, and the essential sovereign self. An example of this is his use of <italic>The History of Sexuality: Volume 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311433446">Foucault, 1990</xref>) to promote narrative therapy as a poststructural practice, and to articulate his opposition to the perception of this approach as a “recycled structuralist/humanist psychological practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">White, 1997</xref>, p. 217). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">White (1997)</xref> speaks of “the will to truth, the repressive hypothesis, and the emancipation narrative” (p. 221) as a “triumvirate” (p. 224) that produces modern subjects. It is a triumvirate, he insists, that narrative therapy should be oriented against. White goes on to argue that there is no essential, natural, internally coherent, sovereign self waiting to be released or emancipated when repression is lifted. Hence, for White, therapy cannot be oriented around the quest for such an essential figure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White (2004)</xref> argues that the essentialist position of a core self carries significant problems, including the consequent promotion of faithfulness to that hypothesized core (e.g., “be yourself”), deviations from which—by trauma, abuse, neglect, etc.—are often considered, within such a discourse, to be the origins of problems in living. Furthermore, the belief in an essence or personal core is seen to promote an impoverished “single-voiced” rather than multi-voiced view of the person, and to cultivate cultural norms, power dynamics, and practices of inclusion/exclusion, on the basis of what is considered the self’s “true nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>, p. 135). Thus, in defence of the Foucauldian vision of a constituted subject, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White (2004)</xref> argued against “naturalistic” or “universal” accounts of “human nature” (p. 176): there is no substantial self lurking beneath the narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311433446">Madigan, 2010</xref>). In this respect, narrative therapy traces quite closely Foucault’s position: “I do indeed believe,” he stated, “that there is no sovereign, founding subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311433446">Foucault, 1988</xref>, p. 50); and so our activities (therapeutic or otherwise) can “never bring us in the presence of something that would be ‘Man’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311433446">Foucault, 2000b</xref>, p. 276).</p>
<p>Instead of being built on the supposed bedrock of this final, essential “man” (<italic>sic</italic>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White (2004)</xref> understood identity to be already, and always, a product of—and the individual always a subject of and subject to—social discourses, practices, and power relations. Thus, instead of aiming to emancipate some true, core self from the forces of social or psychological repression, the narrative practitioner seeks to promote at a local level what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311433446">Foucault (1980)</xref> referred to as “the insurrection of subjugated knowledges” (p. 81); particularly those personal knowledges and experiences that have been silenced, marginalized, or disqualified by existing power/knowledge configurations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311433446">Monk &amp; Gehart, 2003</xref>). In narrative therapy, subjugated knowledges at the personal level were, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311433446">Goffman (1961)</xref>, renamed “unique outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>; a fact that risks rendering invisible the political aspects of such knowledges). This insurrection of subjugated knowledges—and their thickening in therapeutic dialogue—does not entail the possibility of people accessing some “knowledge of who they ‘really’ are” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>, pp. 212–213; as might be the case in a repression/emancipation or humanistic model). It can involve no more than the production of a different (though “preferred”) form of subject: the person becomes the subject of and subject to new narratives, which will in their turn implicate different power/knowledge practices. It is in this Foucauldian sense that we should understand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White and Epston’s (1990)</xref> intentions to generate “alternative stories that incorporate vital and previously neglected aspects of lived experience” (p. 31).</p>
<p>Within this general framework, what possibilities are afforded the narrative therapist for thinking about personal agency?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959354311433446">
<title>Personal agency in narrative therapy</title>
<p>In this section, following an outline of the importance of personal agency for narrative therapists, I discuss some of the theoretical difficulties with the concept in light of this approach’s theoretical acceptance of the constituted subject (as discussed above). I will discuss White’s variable references to agency, which culminate in an agentive subject constructed in the context of what I consider to be an unnecessary forgetting of Foucault.</p>
<p>But first, personal agency is a key aspect of narrative therapy. An assumption is made in this approach not only that there is always some means of escaping the positioning effects of discourse and power, but that the person him- or herself can intentionally effect or <italic>cause</italic> such an escape. The narrative therapist is committed to a particular <italic>location</italic> of agency: within the person (although obviously that need not be its only location). Interestingly, this is a commitment—to the personalization of agency—that Foucault did not have to make (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311433446">Hook, 2007</xref>), although I will argue below that he makes considerable room for such a location.</p>
<p>In narrative therapy, then, the person is sometimes described in terms of “an agentive self.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311433446">Freedman and Combs (1996)</xref>, for example, argue that one of the primary aims of this approach is “the construction of an ‘agentive self’” (p. 97). Developing this point, and moving away from his reading of Foucault, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White (2007)</xref> distinguishes between “internal state” and “intentional state understandings,” which represent contrasting ways of conceptualizing agency’s situation relative to the self (p. 100). Internal state understandings draw on such notions as the unconscious, dispositions, or personality traits, which allude, he says, to an idea of a centred or essential self that shapes the person’s conduct. White maintains that these understandings are of limited therapeutic utility. They emphasize how the person is influenced, but impede our vision (and that of the person him- or herself) of the person as a <italic>perpetrator</italic> of influence, which he considers a vital component of narrative practice. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White (2007)</xref> associates personal agency with “intentional state understandings of identity, whereby people are seen as living out their lives in line with their intentions and values” (p. 103). Therapy therefore orients around the promotion of intentional as opposed to internal state formulations of life experience, and promotes “a drift toward the generation of identity conclusions associated with intentional state understandings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White, 2007</xref>, p. 105); towards a view of the self as bearer of personal agency; as a constitutive rather than only a constituted subject. Intentions—personal, conscious, deliberate—are put forward as a cause of agency, and these intentions are mapped onto—and are seen as playing a constitutive role in—action in fundamental ways.</p>
<p>For various reasons, personal agency was arguably more important for White than it was for Foucault. Indeed, Foucault deliberately deferred any belief in such notions. As part of his social ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>), he took the methodological decision to set aside “anthropological universals,” including the humanistic assumption of a “constitutive subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311433446">Florence, 1994</xref>, p. 317); a given, a priori subject that produces or creates itself and its world. He did so in order to study thoroughly the social and historical forces that went into this being’s constitution. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311433446">Veyne (1997)</xref> noted, speaking of Foucault: “<italic>What is made</italic> [here, the subject] … is explained by what went into its <italic>making</italic> at each moment of history; we are wrong to imagine that the <italic>making</italic>, the practice, is explained on the basis of what is made” (pp. 160–161). As we shall see below, this does not mean that Foucault denied the possibility of personal agency. But it is notable that poststructural philosophers, including Foucault, have not satisfactorily resolved the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311433446">Gordon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>). Debates easily degenerate into a tension between the extremes of pure humanistic agency and self-determination, on the one hand, and discursive or social determinism, on the other. Neither position is adequate, and yet attempted compromises easily end up sliding over to one or other extreme. So how are these difficulties negotiated in narrative therapy? On what basis can we justify understanding the person as, simultaneously, a constituted and a constitutive, agentive subject?</p>
<p>White does not, in my view, reconcile the different positions he seems to take on the issue. On the one hand, as we have seen, he leaves Foucault aside as he writes about “intentional states”: agency caused by one’s self. Here, agency is a product of the ever-present human capacity to attribute action to personal intentions, choices, hopes, dreams, values, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White, 2007</xref>). But, on the other hand, when tracing Foucault’s ideas, White seems to imply that agency lies not in the person as such, but precisely in the dynamic operations of power and discourse in which the person is positioned. For example, in an essay on addressing personal failure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White (2004)</xref> speaks of experiencing “joy” in reading Foucault’s unsettling of the familiar and the taken-for-granted. It is in such a way, he says, that space is opened up for things to become other than what they are; for us to become other than who we are. He then states, drawing on Foucault’s idea that power is never fully successful:<disp-quote>
<p>If systems of power are very rarely ever total in their effects, and if the operations of this modern power are everywhere to be perceived, then examples of opposition to the relations of modern power … will be ever present. It is through the analysis of the operations of modern power that this opposition might be rendered more visible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>, p. 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is an interesting statement, which implies that resistance occurs because power fails. Note, White does not say: if there is opposition to power, it will not always work. Instead he says: if power does not always work, then we will see opposition to it. On this account, perhaps paradoxically, space is opened up for agency not by the person but by <italic>power</italic>. We discover resistance through an analysis of where power fails, because it is at this point that human beings become able to exercise agency.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in discussing how resistance is possible in the face of power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White (2004)</xref> argues that it cannot emerge from some pre-discursive self. Indeed, it is not “possible to sustain any account of identity, including of human nature, that would not be a social, cultural and historical product” (p. 176). White is careful to avoid arguing that the individual can propel himself or herself beyond the constraints of any power/knowledge network. This would seemingly constitute a reversion to the free-willed, humanistic subject that he and Foucault had already rejected (although I will argue below that, within a Foucauldian perspective, it need not amount to such a reversion). For White at this point, any such movement—resistance, protest, the production of new subject forms—is a product of the social domain. Such changes emerge not from the self, but from “multiple and competing systems of understanding of life and of the world” that are available in the social field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">White, 1997</xref>, p. 226).</p>
<p>This position is reminiscent of Foucault, who on several occasions sought to situate agency—or something like it—in the social rather than the individual domain. For example, he stated:<disp-quote>
<p>If I am now interested in how the subject constitutes itself in an active fashion through practices of the self, these practices are nevertheless not something invented by the individual himself. They are models that he finds in his culture and are proposed, suggested, imposed upon him by his culture, his society, and his social group. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311433446">Foucault, 1997c</xref>, p. 291)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I will argue below, however, that this is not the full story for Foucault: it is important to distinguish between the production of alternative practices (which, as Foucault and White indicate, rest on social models) and the person’s capacity to refuse them (which, Foucault implies, does not). This distinction, to be elaborated below, will have a crucial impact on what can be meant by an agentive subject. Nevertheless, in what I take to be his caution, White seems to trace Foucault’s commitment to a thoroughly social ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>)—where the individual cannot invent subject forms or models—and he engages in the discipline of not allowing the agentive individual to play too powerful an authorial role.</p>
<p>In sum, at times White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">2004</xref>) seems to follow Foucault as he suggests that we can resist what is, and find new meanings, not because we possess some intrinsic, inherent capacity for agency, but because (a) power often fails and (b) we exist in a social landscape in which alternatives are always available to us: we remain constituted subjects even in our agency and resistance. And yet clearly these arguments do not sit very easily with what White (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">2007</xref>) emphasized before his death: the agentive self acting in defiance of social prescriptions through personal, unique, self-generated “intentional” acts, beliefs, hopes, dreams, and so on. This last view seems to have taken root in the narrative therapy literature far more successfully than the former set of views. Indeed, narrative therapy texts are replete with accounts of the person as a unique, resourceful, wise, knowing, agentive, and decidedly individual figure; as a self that “continually creates itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311433446">Weingarten, 1991</xref>, p. 289).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354311433446">
<title>Agency and the constituted subject</title>
<p>And so there is a tension in narrative therapy, which has not gone unnoticed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311433446">Burnette, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311433446">Richert, 2002</xref>), between the idea of the constituted subject, on the one hand, and the agentive subject, on the other. In this section and the next, I will discuss some ways of thinking through the problem.</p>
<p>One solution, which I think is in some degree representative of narrative practice, is put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311433446">Zimmerman and Dickerson (1996)</xref>. For them, agency means “that each of us can play a part in choosing what to let guide us and in what contexts” (p. 93). That is, they combine the idea of agency with discursive understandings of the constituted subject by seeing the former as the person’s ability to choose “which discourse,” “which power dynamics,” “what kind of subject,” and “when,” all powered by his or her own volition, intentions, hopes, dreams, and personal choices. However, this does not quite solve the problem, and it requires a distortion of the power/knowledge formulation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White and Epston (1990)</xref> initially borrowed from Foucault. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311433446">Burnette (1995)</xref> states, if “power/knowledge discourses both oppress and form persons, and if those persons can somehow freely select and live out a story of their own making, then they must have an essential self” (p. 7). That is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311433446">Zimmerman and Dickerson (1996)</xref> seem to propose a wise, choosing self who precedes power and knowledge; one who is not constituted by these practices and is somehow capable of standing above them. This is precisely the kind of self that both White and Foucault have already gone to great lengths to counter; a sovereign self that has not already been constituted within power/knowledge dynamics. The risk is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311433446">Zimmerman and Dickerson’s (1996)</xref> solution ushers in precisely the humanistic subject that is anathema to narrative therapeutic formulations of the human being. From a poststructural perspective, this position-less, un-subjectified, self-centred figure, who adopts a God’s-eye-view over his or her experience, is illusory.</p>
<p>One might be tempted then to resolve the problem (of the constituted versus agentive subject) by invoking Foucault’s more recent works (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311433446">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311433446">1997b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311433446">2005</xref>), which emphasized freedom, creativity, and the omnipresent possibility of resistance against power, as opposed to the overwhelming focus on the constitutive effects of discourse and power in the earlier parts of his career (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311433446">1977</xref>). Certainly Foucault’s later work creates space for an agentive subject, who, for example, relates to himself or herself as an artist relates to his or her art; the self as an aesthetic project of self-constitution. But caution is needed, insofar as this was not an unproblematic development in the overall context of Foucault’s work. There are at least two issues here.</p>
<p>First, the agency aspect in the late Foucault was, for many, unconvincing and underdeveloped, compared to the theoretical density and comprehensiveness associated with his earlier emphasis on discursive practices and social power relations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311433446">Said (1986)</xref> saw Foucault’s view as “profoundly pessimistic,” and felt that he was really rather disinterested in effective resistances against power. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311433446">Fish (1999)</xref> has argued that in this last period of his work, Foucault was “vague and pessimistic about the possibility of individual agency and resistance” (p. 58). The position here is that while Foucault made room for some notion of agency in his overall oeuvre, it was not sufficiently developed to stand as a model or framework for thinking about struggles against power formations. Second, there is the often-raised issue of inconsistency over time in Foucault’s work. Among his various attempts to account for his changing focus, of interest here is his distinction between three axes that he claimed to have traced through his career, pertaining to the relationship between the subject and truth: he said that, first, he wrote about the individual as a subject of scientific knowledge; second, about the individual as subject to normative distributions and associated classificatory and dividing practices; and, third, about the individual as subject of and to itself (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311433446">Florence, 1994</xref>). But this breakdown does not solve the problem of inconsistency, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary (2002)</xref>. Some have suggested that Foucault’s final stage amounted to a tacit admission of humanism’s superiority (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354311433446">McCarthy, 1990</xref>), and others have argued that any integration of Foucault’s overall body of work (even by Foucault himself) is a mistake, which denies the specificity and distinctiveness of each of his studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311433446">Gutting, 1994</xref>). In any event, we can say that Foucault’s late thesis of an active self (in which the self constitutes itself as a subject) at the very least downplays the previous axes he referred to, which emphasized the constitutive force of power and discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary, 2002</xref>). Foucault did not leave us with an explicit, well-developed account of the active subject who (a) exists simultaneously within the context of power/knowledge dynamics and (b) is distinguishable from the sovereign subject he had already rejected.</p>
<p>The point here, for the narrative therapist, is that the attribution of an active, agentive subject to the work of Foucault is a complex (though, I shall argue, not impossible) road to take. It is one that still requires some work of us, and this paper is offered as a contribution in this direction. In doing so, we must deal with the charges that by following Foucault we might (a) not have sufficient theoretical grounds to hold onto a “thickened” notion of agency (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311433446">Fish, 1999</xref>) and/or (b) have a naïve view of agency that developed without due regard for the power/ knowledge formulation to which we have already committed ourselves (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps in recognition of these difficulties, in his last book (<italic>Maps of Narrative Practice</italic>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311433446">White (2007)</xref> seldom mentions Foucault, and indeed does not refer to him at all, or the power/knowledge dynamic, when discussing intentional agency. Foucault seems to recede as a focal point for White’s thinking at this stage. Whatever the reasons for this, I do not think there is necessarily a contradiction between the agentive figure required to make narrative therapy practicable, on the one hand, and the Foucauldian constituted subject, on the other. And this is my point: we do not need to dispense with the agentive figure in order to remain within the realms of a Foucauldian poststructuralism; and—despite Foucault’s objections to the view of the individual as inherently agentive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>)—we need not forget Foucault (as White seemed to do in his last work) when speaking about the agentive subject.</p>

<title>Three proposals for an agentive subject</title>
<p>I have tried thus far to show that narrative therapy carries with it an interesting theoretical problem: it has an attachment to personal agency which is unsettled by its allegiance to Foucauldian poststructuralism; and it has an attachment to poststructuralism which seems to be blurred or forgotten at times in order to permit an agentive view of the person. In this section I offer three proposals to think through this apparent dilemma, and to reflect on what it might mean to speak of an agentive subject in the context of narrative therapy. To be clear, the aim is to do so without proposing a structured, coherent, core self to the human being. To do so would be anathema to Foucauldian poststructuralism, because such a central structure would dictate therapeutic direction—which would be obliged to tie in with the “true self”—as well as social norms in its own terms. It might also prompt a distinction between narratives deemed “natural” (those that conform to the core) and “unnatural” (those that do not), and lead to the sedimentation of a particular set of power dynamics that are congruent with this supposed human essence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The first proposal, put forward by a number of Foucauldian scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354311433446">Falzon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311433446">Gordon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary, 2002</xref>), but not explicated by Foucault himself, is that humans have an inherent physical capacity to act and to transform their environments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354311433446">2</xref></sup> This immediately scuppers any suggestion of the Foucauldian subject as merely—<italic>as no more than</italic>—an effect or product of power and knowledge (despite some of Foucault’s strong, earlier, claims to the contrary). This capacity to act is extra-discursive, and is tied to the body. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354311433446">Hoy (1999)</xref>, Foucault sees “the body as the basis of our being” (p. 4), although he did not explicitly theorize it. Disciplinary power can only function to the extent that we have active bodies, to enact what power requires of us. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311433446">Patton (1989)</xref> eloquently put it, “power over” presupposes “power to” (p. 268). The individual’s “power to” derives from “the brute, disorganized and relatively chaotic set of capacities, powers and forces which a human animal possesses. This bare minimum of human being … is not the (or even ‘a’) subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary, 2002</xref>, p. 118). Thus, discourses may direct and organize our activities, relationships, identity formation, and so on, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">O’Leary (2002)</xref> indicates, they rely upon our brute, not-yet-subjectified capacity for embodied performance.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy (2004)</xref> suggests that Foucault did not emphasize this aspect of the body because such raw corporeal capacity was not considered crucial for the analysis of social—and therefore therapeutic—dynamics: it cannot determine discursive content or guide resistances against power. Our raw powers do not tell us which forms of subjection, which social constructions, or which discursive practices to accept and which to refuse. The body and its energies are, in themselves, without discursive content, and can always be interpreted, and hence socially deployed, in a plethora of ways. But let us not be dissuaded by Foucault’s attempts to downplay the relevance of the body’s corporeality by situating it fully in a social ontology. He may be right that our brute animal powers do not dictate acceptance or refusal of specific narrative contents—I suggest that it is upon this that his poststructuralism depends—but this does not mean that these powers cannot inform our understanding of the person and his or her agency in therapy. Indeed, despite Foucault’s apparent unwillingness to theorize this corporeality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy, 2004</xref>), it offers a first pillar of support for the therapeutic assumption of the person as an active being, as more than simply a constituted subject, a product of discourse. We can acknowledge the existence of the corporeal, dynamic, and energetic set of raw materials—O’Leary’s “human animal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311433446">2002</xref>, p. 118)—that narratives, as practices in the power/knowledge social field, work with, interpret, and put to use. These energies precede our positioning as discursive subjects, and without them subjection could not in any case function in the service of power.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the person is merely a work-horse; a set of energies waiting to be directed by external sources. In line with this corporeal basis of the human being, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311433446">Wade (1997)</xref> argues that narrative therapists assume the “pre-existing ability” of resistance (p. 24). Thus, the second proposal is that the human capacity for resistance precedes the person’s construction as a subject. To develop this point, it might be useful to distinguish between negative and positive forms of resistance (borrowing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311433446">Lee’s, 2004</xref>, p. 226, distinction between the “negative” and the “positive” contents of agency in his analysis of narrative therapy). For the purposes of this discussion, negative resistance can be seen as resistance that precedes discourse but lacks its own positive discursive contents, while positive resistance is the meaning-making activity that follows acts of negative resistance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311433446">Foucault’s (1997a)</xref> minimal form of resistance (a pure “No!”) involves a stepping outside of or a turning away from discourse. On this account, the initial face of resistance is not the affirmation of, or movement towards, an alternative discourse, but the refusal of an existing one. This refusal is not itself a product of discourse or power (although this is how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311433446">Žižek, 1999</xref>, interprets Foucault), but might be seen as one of the few ways in which a person can deliberately and wilfully slip outside of or beyond discourse itself, albeit temporarily and fleetingly. We can resist any power formation without justification, and without awareness of available alternatives. There is no requirement, indicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311433446">Foucault (2000a)</xref>, that we have a plan B in order to vehemently oppose plan A. Our ability to refuse <italic>precedes</italic> our exposure to narratives and social practices.</p>
<p>If resistance can involve even a momentary escape from discourse, then we have a second challenge to the view of the person as an entirely constituted subject. It would surely be expecting too much of discourse to ask that it account, in each and every instance, for resistance’s omnipresence in power dynamics; as if resistance were somehow pre-scripted as a set of behavioural options for all eventualities. This would be the implication if we were to insist that we are <italic>only and totally</italic> discursively produced subjects, and that acts of resistances are therefore always already discursive products. Rather, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354311433446">Živković and Hogan (2008)</xref> argue, “resistance is the ‘always already’ of power; … resistance precedes power” (p. 190). Clearly, resistance cannot precede power if it is a product of social or power processes. Rather, it should be seen in the first instance as a product of, and grounded, a priori, in our corporeality. The capacity to refuse is located not out there in the world of cultural models, discourses, and power dynamics, but in the embodied human being. We should not be led by the frequently cited statement “Where there is power, there is resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311433446">Foucault, 1990</xref>, p. 95), into thinking that power and resistance are two sides of the same coin. Rather, power in the Foucauldian world can be seen as a <italic>response</italic> to the corporeal capacity for resistance that it anticipates; that it knows is already there (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311433446">Prozorov, 2007</xref>). “The final word on power,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311433446">Deleuze (1988)</xref>, “is that resistance comes first” (p. 74).</p>
<p>But refusal without positive contents can create a phenomenological problem: if resistance entails escape from discursive constraints into some kind of extra-discursive space, would we not then succumb to nihilism, social disconnectedness, and meaninglessness? In the face of this concern, I suggest that the negative face of resistance can be accompanied by a more positive form of resistance, involving further discursive construction activity. This could involve a storying of the refusal itself, and/or a movement towards an alternative discourse. (It is also possible that negative resistance is followed not by positive resistance, but simply by recuperation by the original, opposed discourse and power formation, i.e., where resistance fails.)</p>
<p>Thus, the third proposal is that as the human animal resists and escapes discursive constraints, the social and meaning vacuum created produces a movement towards discourse once more. That is, in order to remain a participant in human social-communicative space, the person who successfully resists must be re-storied; become a subject once more. The “No” (e.g., “I am not this”; “I do not want this”) must become a version of “Yes” (e.g., “that is more like me”; “I want that”) in order to be socially and personally meaningful. Thus, I propose that when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311433446">Foucault (1997c)</xref>, as cited above, speaks of the social “models” on which the agentive subject must draw, and which cannot be invented by the individual, he is speaking of the “yes”—modelled on existing social forms—but which has as a precondition a “no” (which might be a refusal to “obey the Other,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311433446">Gros, 2005</xref>, p. 706; or a refusal, even, of who one is, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311433446">Rabinow, 1994</xref>, p. xix). In his discussions of the active, creative self (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311433446">Foucault, 2005</xref>, in his discussion of Greek and Roman civilizations and their relevance for our reflections on who we are today), Foucault was, I suggest, speaking beyond resistance itself (the “No!”)—beyond refusing “who we are” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311433446">Foucault, 2000c</xref>, p. 336)—to the issue of how one assumes a new form, or becomes a different kind of subject. Clearly, for Foucault we need something beyond the simple “no.”</p>
<p>In light of this, it is worthwhile wondering to what extent we <italic>need</italic> discourse, and to what extent Foucault implied this in his work. It seems that our attachment to discursive space, where we make sense of ourselves and our social positioning in the concrete world of social practices, matters a great deal to us; and this is implicit in Foucault’s insistence on our inescapable location in fields of power/knowledge. This space is the only one we have for constructing a position relative to ourselves and to others, and it thereby grants us “form” through which to access and participate in human sociality. Foucault did not say where this impetus for “form” comes from. But according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311433446">Bruner (2004)</xref>—whom White (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>) draws on—the impetus for self-storying, for locating ourselves in discourse, is “almost certainly innate and species-specific” (p. 4). Bruner here affirms the belief that we innately desire to be rendered subjects in, and subject to, stories or discourses, despite the constraints they inevitably impose upon us. It seems that in noting the benefits of subjection, Bruner emphasizes what might have been less visible—or perhaps simply less interesting—to Foucault, whose critical orientation led to a focus on problematic discourses and limiting forms of subjection. Subjection is, on this account, our way of meaningfully existing with each other.</p>
<p>Like the resistance to being storied in unwanted ways, I propose that the impetus to be storied is not conditional on narrative guidelines or stipulations. It is surely not a product of a particular type of subject-hood (e.g., prescribing that we locate ourselves as discursive subjects). Rather, our attachment to discursive situatedness is likely itself a symptom of our inherent attachment to sociality. Indeed, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311433446">Bruner (2004)</xref>, it is probably a product not of discourse but of our biological, evolutionary heritage. Our gravitation towards narrative situatedness surely comes from us, from “the inside,” despite the constraints and power dynamics that come with it. Perhaps, then, this pull functions as a kind of guarantee that negative resistances—with discourse escaping trajectories—will be accompanied by positive re-storying.</p>

<sec id="section5-0959354311433446">
<title>A case study</title>
<p>A brief case study illustrates these proposals. In this case, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311433446">Epston (2010)</xref>, one of the originators of narrative therapy, is working with Heather, a 22-year-old woman struggling against anorexia. It should be noted that in narrative therapy, anorexia is not seen in psychiatric or medical terms, but neither is it seen as merely a construction or story. Rather, it is typically formulated as a real and dangerous product of a variety of social power dynamics and gender prescriptions, the reproduction and extension of which are enabled through the recruitment of individuals who go on to develop difficulties with various eating and body-related practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311433446">Epston &amp; Maisel, 2009</xref>). The term “anorexia” will often be used in therapy to the extent that it has resonance for the client, and also as a way of naming and concretizing the experienced problem, which in turn allows it to be externalized and its effects to be interrogated.</p>
<p>In this case, the therapeutic dialogue between Epston and Heather has led to the creation of a distinction between, on the one hand, the named problem, anorexia, and, on the other hand, something that opposes the problem, which Epston calls “anti-anorexia.” Solidifying the externalization, Epston invokes the image of a river, with anorexia on one side and anti-anorexia on the other side. In the dialogue, Heather imagines herself on one side of the river, and says that she is “trying to cross it.” Epston enquires about her struggle to get to the anti-anorexia side. In response, Heather speaks of how anorexia calls out to her, pushing her to ignore those—including her therapist—who are calling her over to the anti-anorexic side.</p>
<p>I propose, in line with the three proposals offered above, that: (a) Heather has the intrinsic capacity to <italic>do something</italic> (e.g., move from one discursive side to another); (b) she is intrinsically capable of resisting anorexia (and the associated discursive practices and power relations to which she has become subject), even if only momentarily, and moving out of its discursive orbit (which does not mean she will succeed); but (c) once she has made this escape she will have to narrate her experience in one way or another, introducing either the risk of recapture (by anorexia), or the possibility of change (a new story). It seems also that all of this is to some extent implicit in the therapist’s talk.</p>
<p>First, Epston makes the assumption that Heather is able do <italic>something</italic> that could lead to a change in her circumstances. In order to reach the anti-anorexia “side” of the river, she will have to organize the multitude of her corporeal energies, capacities, forces, and impulses in the service of attaining that goal. Epston clearly knows—and his metaphors reveal this—that he cannot carry Heather, as a passive passenger, to the anti-anorexia side. He knows that she is able to move under her own power. But there is a problem. The fact that she is inherently capable of moving does not mean she can steer her own movements. It is in the nature of our situation within discourse and power that we do not have “free will.” The directions of Heather’s movements are influenced by powerful forces that emanate from outside of herself (e.g., gender and cultural prescriptions associated with anorexia). However, the power of these forces is suggestive rather than deterministic. In line with the arguments of both Foucault (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311433446">1997c</xref>) and White (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311433446">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">2004</xref>), as discussed above, it is true that anorexia is not always totally successful, and that Heather will always have access to other narratives and practice possibilities that are available in the social field. But these factors alone do not account fully for her protests. My argument is that Heather always retains an innate ability to resist. She can refuse aspects of anorexia discourse, regardless of whether anorexia “allows” her to do this, and regardless of her access to alternative cultural “models” for her resistance. Of course, these factors will likely impact on the success or failure of her resistance—on its ability to be socially supported or narratively thickened—but for now that is a separate matter. Because she is a human animal, and to paraphrase Deleuze, Heather’s resistance is there first; it precedes anorexia.</p>
<p>But the often momentary, fleeting nature of negative resistance (the “No”) means that if it is to be developed it must be supported with some kind of narration and social re-positioning. Negative resistance, I have proposed, will be accompanied by some kind of storying. But what kind? The power of anorexia is such that Heather’s internally generated negative resistance is vulnerable to reincorporation in the absence of scaffolded narration. If there is nowhere to go once she leaves anorexia—if there is no new meaning produced; no story to tell about where she is going or why she is “moving”—then it seems that the only viable story available to her is back within anorexia. This may have seemed to her to be the only place in which she could meaningfully story her experience and situate herself in the social world. Indeed, reflecting on Heather’s resistance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311433446">Epston (2010)</xref> asks: “Before [i.e., before therapy] you thought it was a choice between Anorexia and Nothingness, in a sense?” (Question 65). This is a choice between anorexia and the extra-discursive, meaningless space into which negative resistance could propel her. Heather agrees but also slightly refines the therapist’s understanding: “Yes… between Anorexia and Anorexia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311433446">2010</xref>). This response is interesting in that it suggests an experiential recognition on Heather’s part that the meaningless, extra-discursive space that Epston rightly recognizes is nevertheless not a viable option for human habitation. She therefore (at least, in the past) had to return to anorexia. Thus, while resistance remains an ever-present possibility, it is easily overcome, leading her back to the familiar subject position of Anorexic.</p>
<p>If Heather’s resistance is not to be swallowed up by the anorexia discourse, it needs to be accompanied by some kind of scaffolded re-storying. Through the concept of anti-anorexia, Epston offers Heather a place from which this re-storying can occur. His intervention is noteworthy in that anti-anorexia is not yet an alternative discourse. It is itself defined negatively: by what it opposes or challenges. It “is not fixed by adherence to any particular extant psychological or moral code” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311433446">Epston &amp; Maisel, 2009</xref>, p. 211). It does not ask Heather to be anything in particular, or to offer a forward-looking account (e.g., “What now?”). Rather it recognizes, and invites her to story her opposition to, her movement away from anorexia. In other words, by inviting her to move towards him (and others) on anti-anorexia, Epston helps her find space to story her negative resistance itself. Heather’s negative resistance is thus rendered positive via articulation. For example, from an anti-anorexic position, she is able to speak about how anorexia made her forget things, including how much her father loved her; she recalls how anorexia cut her off from other people; and she even speaks of how it tried to kill her. Such articulation further strengthens and “thickens” her resistance, through its reification of a new story-telling position, a narrative platform, distinct from that of anorexia.</p>
<p>Heather does not initially know where to take her anti-anorexic position (e.g., she says, after declaring herself Anti-Anorexic, “I don’t … know who I’m meant to become”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311433446">Epston, 2010</xref>, Answer 60). But then she says there is something “awesome” about simply “being Anti-Anorexic.” Here she has found a voice and a narrative of her resistance, with new subject positions that help stabilize—through storying activity—her turning away from anorexia. In the absence of such a narrative vantage point, Heather would likely be more vulnerable to reincorporation as an anorexic within anorexia.</p>
<p>Epston did not produce Heather’s corporeal energies, stimulate her initial refusals (i.e., negative resistances), or inform her of the need to story her experience. He had to assume that Heather already possessed these capacities, and that she was already able to upset or imbalance—albeit fleetingly—the power of the anorexia discourse and the practices it demanded of her. It is this imbalancing or disruption of anorexia, however, which needed narrative support. All Epston could do was to offer Heather a position from which she could articulate, story, and thus consolidate the resisting movement she was already struggling to make. In an important sense, Epston seemed to have relied upon and “tapped into” Heather’s own inherent capacity <italic>to do, to refuse, and to re-story</italic>. He relied on her capacity for agency.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The primary theoretical challenge for narrative therapy as a form of poststructural inquiry, in my view, is to create an understanding of the person that allows both for his or her contextualization in broader historical-cultural practices and power dynamics, and for some notion of freedom or personal agency. In the process, it is necessary to navigate carefully between the twin threats of social determinism, on the one side, and individual determinism, on the other. Furthermore, it is important that this personal agency not be seen as emanating from a sovereign or essential self.</p>
<p>The three proposals articulated here might offer a way of thinking through this theoretical conundrum. Influenced by Foucault, and the Nietzschean thinking that sometimes underpinned his work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354311433446">Hoy, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">2004</xref>), it is possible to think of the person as a dynamic entity who precedes discourse, whose agency is founded not upon some notion of pre-discursive personal choice or pre-existing wisdom—as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311433446">Zimmerman and Dickerson (1996)</xref> imply—but upon the individual’s raw, animal, corporeal capacity to refuse, to throw off the restraints discourse imposes on him or her. This stepping outside of subject positions—“de-subjectification”—may lead to the threat of nihilism, associated with the loss of one’s discursive situation and corresponding subject-hood. This point of potential meaninglessness requires one to re-situate oneself in discourse, and thus to belong in social space, and within the grip of its power relations, once more.</p>
<p>Given Foucauldian narrative therapists’ concerns about the essential, sovereign self (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311433446">White, 2004</xref>), it is important that any formulation of the pre-discursive subject or self should not prioritize or favour particular narrative <italic>types or contents</italic>, or specific subject positions, which means that it cannot prescribe therapeutic contents, social practices, or cultural norms in its own terms. In addition, this formulation paints a picture of the person as one who is primed to not stay in one narrative place for all time. As Foucault noted: “One’s way of no longer remaining the same is, by definition, the most singular part of who I am” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311433446">Rabinow, 1994</xref>, p. xix). Change is built into this figure, and is not left solely to the external movements or affordances of societal power dynamics. But power is also installed in this embodied person, who is capable of perpetually imbalancing the narratives that account for his or her life—of confounding the discursive requirements placed upon him or her—but who thereby in turn creates the need for new ones. Thus, I recommend for the narrative therapist what might be described as a “thin” notion of pre-subjected human being. This is the person who occasionally slips out from under the subject position in discourse, and upon whose powers and capacities for resisting and re-storying the therapist can rely.</p>
<p>These proposals are offered as part of the theoretical work that inevitably lies ahead for the promising field of narrative therapy. Much of the scholarship in this approach currently centres on pragmatics, on innovations in technique, and on practitioners’ and consumers’ experiences of clinical and community-oriented work. With the untimely death of Michael White, however, there is the risk that this practice focus will disrupt the emphasis on theoretical rigour that he and Epston (and few other scholars) endeavoured to bring to this work. In particular, it is apparent that narrative therapy’s claims to a specifically Foucauldian poststructuralism are more complex than we might have supposed. On this basis, its philosophical and theoretical foundations are vulnerable to challenge. This challenge, I suggest, is likely to centre on the notion of the subject as simultaneously constituted and agentive.</p>

<p>Foucault’s formulation also helped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311433446">White and Epston (1990)</xref> rethink the role of the therapist, as “always participating simultaneously in domains of power and knowledge” (p. 29).</p>

<p>Obviously Foucault’s work can be interpreted in multiple ways. My primary aim here is to forge a more or less coherent understanding of the pre-discursive human figure, rather than to argue that Foucault would have concurred with my formulation. Indeed, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311433446">Hoy (2004)</xref>, Foucault was reluctant to commit himself on such issues as the body and the ontological status of resistance, because such commitments might have led to an unravelling of so much of his work.</p>
