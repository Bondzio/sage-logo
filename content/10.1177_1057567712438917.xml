<abstract>
<p>Chinese informal fund transfer systems (IFTS), widely known as underground banks, are one of the two prototypes of unregulated practices of fund transfer which could either use or bypass conventional banking institutions. This article focuses on the type of underground banking systems which primarily deals with foreign exchange and remittance transfer. The article proposes that underground banks are treated as illegal enterprises instead of a component of organized crime. This first qualitative study draws firsthand evidence from interviews made both in mainland China and in the United States. By depicting and analyzing the links of Chinese IFTS to human smuggling and money laundering, this article examines the extent to which the systems are involved in crime.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chinese informal fund transfer systems (IFTS)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1057567712438917">1</xref>
</sup> are commonly referred to as “underground bank.” They originated from indigenous banks in China called Qianzhuang or Piaohao, which have been in existence for centuries and were used by businessmen for legitimate purposes since ancient times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712438917">Cheng, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1057567712438917">Yang, 1952</xref>). Before western banks came into operation, they were considered the oldest, most reliable money transfer option alongside Hawala in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057567712438917">Passas, 1999</xref>). IFTS are primarily employed to move money from place to place, most of the time cross borders in the contemporary context, to circumvent official supervision and controls. The process of fund transfer may or may not go through formal banking institutions, depending on the type and purpose of transactions. Expediency, efficiency, and convenience of IFTS make the service attractive for potential clientele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057567712438917">Passas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). However, the confidentiality and anonymity of IFTS also breed a high possibility for abuse. The authorities have expressed concerns that IFTS have become a vehicle for financing illicit enterprises. Along with other informal financial agencies, underground banks were outlawed as illegal financial institutions according to an ordinance (Regulations Concerning Outlawing Illegal Financial Institutions and Illegal Financial Services) issued by the State Council of the People’s Republic China on June 30, 1998. Chinese police crackdown operatives on underground banks are also heightened in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057567712438917">Fong, 2002</xref>; “Eleven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057567712438917">jailed,” 2004</xref>; “Sharp rise in number of illegal forex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057567712438917">deals,” 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057567712438917">“Large underground banking operation,” 2007</xref>). The growing evidence of transnational crime involving human and commodity trafficking, capital flight, and money laundering implicitly raises questions of whether the operation of underground banking systems finances illicit activities of great magnitude. To the extent that the illegal financing systems thrive in China, their presence also raises the concern whether the operation of underground banking channels imperils the nation’s financial stability.</p>
<p>In China, three types of underground banks are identified as active in different regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712438917">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Concentrated in booming eastern and southeastern coastal areas, such as Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, the first type of underground bank primarily provides foreign exchange and domestic and cross-border remittance services. The second type is involved in illegally accepting deposits and lending, particularly active in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, and other coastal provinces. The principal business for the third type focuses on illegal mortgages and usury, which are primarily present in some interior provinces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712438917">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Underground banking systems falling under the first category allegedly take the largest shares in illicit foreign exchange transactions in China and facilitate illicit money movement for transnational crime, such as money laundering, human and drug trafficking, and other illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057567712438917">“China busts,” 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1057567712438917">Zhu, 2001</xref>). Police in China, Japan, Australia, Great Britain, and the United States have discovered that Chinese-run underground banks located in these countries have routed huge sums back to China for illegal immigrants over the past years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057567712438917">Kakuchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057567712438917">Preston, 2006</xref>). This fact raises the question of whether Chinese underground banks pose a serious threat of supporting other illegal activities like their counterpart systems in the Middle East and India, which are accused of financing terrorism.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been plenty of reports on underground banking activities in China; however, no prior research has ever systematically examined these informal financial systems either in China or in overseas. For this reason, this study will focus on the first type of Chinese underground banks highly concentrated in coastal Provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, where police reports suggested a strong presence of active underground banks. Based on both firsthand and secondary data sources, and by exploring their connections with criminal activities, the present research represents the first step in addressing whether the IFTS are part and parcel of criminal enterprise.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, underground banks have gained public attention as a vice establishment largely on account of anecdotal evidence, police statements, and media accounts based on police reports. Their operation has become a serious concern in China because of the belief of the authorities that underground banks may be connected to a wide variety of criminal activities such as tax evasion, smuggling, capital flight, money laundering, and corruption. In the United States, knowledge of Chinese-controlled underground banks remained obscure until quite recently. In 2005, a Chinese underground bank proprietor was convicted and sentenced for her role in human smuggling. She was found to have financed human smuggling in cooperation with Chinese gangs in New York City (NYC), which included the “Golden Venture” incident in 1993.</p>
<p>The features of underground could immediately raise specter of “organized crime” in the eyes of scholars, governmental agencies, and the general public. However, this research argues that instead of integrated part of an organized crime, Chinese underground banks should be categorized as illegal enterprises which supply unique services to meet the illegitimate as well as legitimate market demands. Distinct from other profit-seeking criminality, illegal enterprises are involved in provision of illegal goods and services to customers who have knowledge of their illegality. In different periods of time in American history, the list of illegal goods involved has included liquor, pornography, and narcotics, while illegal services have ranged from bookmaking, gambling, and prostitution, to loan-sharking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057567712438917">Haller, 1990</xref>, p. 207). This study proposes to add underground banking as a major topic of criminological inquiry to the list of providers of illegal services, with its significance in need of greater conceptual development and more empirical studies. To help develop a useful analytic framework for an understanding of the structural properties and operational attributes of organized crime, this article begins with a review of organized crime theory and other relevant perspectives.</p>
<sec id="section3-1057567712438917">
<title>Theoretical Perspectives on Organized Crime</title>
<p>According to the 1967 U.S. Task Force on Organized Crime, organized crime differentiated from other crimes in that its main function was to supply illegal goods and services to legitimate consumers (1967 Task Force Report, p. 1). Apart from this core function, Schelling further pointed out that another crucial feature of organized crime is to exercise monopoly on and protect or extort illegal markets (1984, p. 181–182, 185). In examining the formation of Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta disagreed with Schelling by maintaining that Mafia fulfilled a (criminal) governmental role while primarily producing, promoting, and selling private protection by the use of violence (1993, p. 1). Thus, he concluded that Mafia and organized crime were not the same since the latter (which was essentially composed of independent business entrepreneurs active in either illegal or legal market) seeks the service of private protection that the Mafia provides. Varese endorsed this view by suggesting that the Mafia could be considered  a subset of the broader set of organized crime groups (2001, p. 4). The research findings on Chinese triad were consistent with these traditional perspectives on the Mafia as an organization characteristic of hierarchical structure, internal division of labor, and monopolized control over a certain sector of illegal market (as in functioning as protection firms and practicing extortion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057567712438917">Chung, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1057567712438917">
<title>Theoretical Perspectives on Illegal Enterprise</title>
<p>Another school of scholars challenges the traditional organized crime model with regard to their ability of monopolizing illegal market as nationwide crime syndicates. Instead, they argue that criminal organizations are primarily illegal enterprises that engage in the supply of illegal goods and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057567712438917">Haller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712438917">Smith, 1980</xref>; Reuter, 1983). In proposing a spectrum-based theory of enterprise, Smith posits that entrepreneurial activities take place along a continuum that includes both legal and illegal operations (1980, p. 379). Illicit entrepreneurs operate past the point of legitimacy as a result of a response to a dynamic “task environment” (p. 376) and the characteristics and needs of their customers. An illustration is that three establishments coexist on the market spectrum for the loan-making industry: the commercial banks, the pawnbrokers, and the loan sharks, serving the needs of varied types of customers and influenced by different rules or regulations. </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057567712438917">Reuter’s study (1986)</xref> on three illegal markets, the numbers industry, bookmaking, and loan-sharking and their relationship with Mafia provided empirical support for an illegal enterprise perspective. His research suggested that illegal markets consisted of “localized, fragmented, ephemeral, and undiversified enterprises” (1986, p. 131) due to constraints posed by small-scale operations, limited employment, and difficulty with obtaining external capital. His findings on the role of the Mafia basically echoed Gambetta’s assertion that there was no evidence indicating that the Mafia, despite its involvement in a certain level of extortion, possessed a monopoly on bookmaking through coercive power.</p>
<p>Haller’s historical analysis (1990) noted that any forms of coordination and partnership among the underworld suppliers were used to further their economic interests, rather than to establish centrally controlled, hierarchically structured criminal organizations. The involvement in partnerships among illegal enterprises was just an effective method for independent criminal entrepreneurs to pool their resources and to share risks. Thus, partnership arrangements helped structure the coordination of illegal activities among diverse enterprises in local, regional, and even international markets. The illegal activities, which were carried out by small independent criminal enterprises, were largely small-scale and short term, and violence was not frequently employed for business enforcement.</p>

<title>Influence of Market Force on Organized Crime</title>
<p>Of particular relevance to this current research, research on the Mafias and Chinese criminal groups suggests the importance of an understanding of the market dynamics in shaping the origin, structure, and operations of crime organizations. The Mafia in both Sicily (of early 1810s) and Russia (of late 1980s and early 1990s) emerged as a response to the state’s failure in protecting market transactions and enforcing property rights in a rapid transition into a market economy. The Mafia rose and took the government’s place by dealing in private protection to meet increased market demand for this valuable commodity in both sectors of underworld and overworld. The Mafias or triads were found not likely to dominate all sectors of illegal economy, either because of the fragmentation of the market or lack of required resources and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057567712438917">Chu, 2000</xref>). Coupled with operational requirements of criminal activities, the influence of market dynamic is even more distinctly strong over an illegal market full of hazard and uncertainty like human smuggling trade. Chinese human smuggling is found to be populated by loose networks of freelance entrepreneurs and operate in small group transactions independent of the control of organized crime groups like Chinese Triads. This is because the market conditions for human smuggling are utterly unfavorable for a crime organization established with rigid hierarchical structure, or a cartel found among Mafia families, and the continuity and stability of criminal alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1057567712438917">Zhang, 2008</xref>, p. 155–172).</p>
<p>By directing attention to an underground banking system widely used by an ethnic group both in the United States and in China, this current study offers an opportunity to explore the applicability of the prevailing perspectives and expand on theoretical elaboration on the nature of organized crime.</p>

<title>Research on Chinese Underground Banks</title>
<p>The Chinese underground banking system has been an elusive subject for academic scrutiny. Only three studies are identified: Two earlier reports were produced by law enforcement agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057567712438917">Cassidy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057567712438917">Lambert, 2000</xref>), while the most recent one was a preliminary study of underground banking system worldwide by a scholar in criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057567712438917">Passas, 2003</xref>). The first two studies were situated in the context of the American government’s concern about drug trade in the Southeastern Asia in the 1980s and attempted to examine the role of Chinese underground banks in narcotics money laundering. The first author, Cassidy, cautions against a premature conclusion that the mechanisms are knowingly employed for criminal purposes before any further investigation is made. Lambert’s study suggests that an active underground banking network controlled by an organized Chinese crime group financed heroin trafficking from the Golden Triangle to the U.S. market. However, Passas argues that Lambert’s article contains many factual errors deriving from his quotation of “facts by repetition.” Passas further points out that some statements made in Lambert’s study about the misuse of underground banks were “sheer speculation and based on no known cases…” (Passas, 2003, p. 26). Based on a limited database and interviews, Passas characterizes the Chinese system as primarily noncriminal in function because no solid evidence indicates that corporations and state agencies are involved in illegal money transfer through the Chinese IFTS. Despite disagreement on the extent of the growth of the Chinese underground banking system worldwide, two of these three studies have asserted that the unregulated use of the system may not be a grave concern, because it is believed that ethnic groups resort to the system either for legitimate purposes or for relatively minor offenses.</p>
<p>In short, the state of scholarship to date on Chinese underground banking is minimal. None of the previous studies has substantiated its findings by gathering firsthand information from Chinese clients or owners of underground banks. Scant attention has been paid to factors underlying the reemergence and growth of underground banks in a transitional China as it has moved from a centrally controlled to a free market economy. Furthermore, none of the previous research studies is able to distinguish different types of underground banks, thus fails to clearly delineate the disparate purposes of people using the system, whether they are criminals, criminal syndicates, companies, legal residents, or illegal immigrants in the context of China’s increased integration into a global economy. The result is that understanding of the dynamic process underlying the resurgence and growth of underground banks becomes problematic.</p>

<sec id="section7-1057567712438917">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>For the purposes of this present study, the firsthand data were collected both in mainland China and in the United States. With an aim at gaining an understanding of the underground banks operated in the United States, the 30 research subjects were selected from the Fujianese community in the United States who currently resided in NYC and Philadelphia through a snowballing technique. Potential respondents were restricted to adults who illegally entered the United States primarily through human smuggling since mid-1980s and used to be the clients of underground banks in Chinatown, NYC, since the preliminary research suggested that underground banks seemed to be primarily used among smuggled Fujianese immigrants for a certain time period. The researcher located six Fujianese dialect speakers to recruit potential research subjects. The majority of the participants were married, males, who left families behind at the time of arrival in the United States. They came from rural areas, with low-education levels and experience of working at low-skilled jobs. Their ages ranged from 24 to 52 at the time of the interview. Most of them were the first of their families to be smuggled into the United States and made their way into the country without being detected by the authorities. None of them had a criminal record either in China or in the United States.</p>
<p>The data collection strategy for this study relied on face-to-face surveys and interviews by the researcher, since participant–observation is practically impossible. The in-depth interviews of Fujianese illegal immigrants in NYC and Philadelphia were preceded by a structured survey consisting of around 40 closed-ended questions with categorical response items. The questions asked research subjects about general background information, sources of smuggling loans, location and method of smuggling fee payment, questions concerning their smuggling experiences, and their experiences with underground banks. It should be noted that the interview approach was open-ended to permit follow-up of important themes and emergent new themes during the interviews. However, the overall interview structure was guided by research questions outlined in the previous section. The firsthand data are used to answer the following questions: (1) Why do illegal immigrants turn to underground banks? (2) Who operates the underground banks in the United States? (3) What mechanism has sustained the operation of underground banks? (4) What purposes have underground banks served for illegal immigrants? (5) Have underground banks facilitated illegal migration through human smuggling? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1057567712438917">Table 1</xref> illustrates how the interview instrument is organized around the key questions addressed by the research.</p>

<p>The second part of firsthand data regarding underground banks operating in mainland China primarily was drawn from the face-to-face interviews of five underground bank users and five nonusers, who were scholars, lawyer, journalist, and law enforcement agents in China.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1057567712438917">2</xref>
</sup> Most of the interviewees were located through the researcher’s family and professional networks. While the interviews of other respondents took place in different cities of mainland China, all interviews of five clients were conducted at Shenzhen, a border city near Hong Kong, where underground banks reportedly has become a blooming industry. Since Shenzhen is known as a city of immigrants, the interviewees came from different regions with various background. They were middle-aged males, with four either owning a small business or being employees at private enterprises, and only one working for a state-owned enterprise. Aside from the primary data, a secondary source of data was derived from systematically reviewing news reports from mainstream press to complement primary information. To identify contemporary issues pertinent to the subject, the researcher searched major newspapers in English as well as the major media sources in Chinese.</p>
<p>In this research, qualitative analysis largely adopts an inductive approach to gain an understanding of why Chinese underground banks flourish as an illegal financial institution in specific social and cultural settings in the United States. The analytic process basically was broken down into three stages: data management, descriptive analysis, and explanatory analysis. The descriptive analysis involved finding the patterns of associations within the data. The explanatory analysis was to develop explanations as to what caused this pattern to occur.</p>

<title>The Early and Later Generations of Chinese Underground Banks</title>
<p>The origin of Chinese underground banks is traceable to indigenous financial institutions beginning in the early 18th and 19th centuries, Piaohao, literally “draft banks,” which were founded by merchants from Shanxi Province in North China, and Qianzhuang (pronounced as ch’ien-chuang, meaning “money shops”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1057567712438917">Yang, 1952</xref>). These institutions were operated with full recognition of the then Chinese governments, specifically the Ch’ing, the last imperial dynasty (1644–1911), and the first Republican Government of China (1911–1949; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712438917">Cheng, 2003</xref>). Throughout the turbulent history of China, these major native banks assumed different developmental trajectories and exerted significant influence in financial markets of China, but eventually both of them met their demise with the Communist control over China in 1949. The hope of further development of private banks was shattered in the nationalization movement. However, Qianzhuangs, that is, the later generation of underground banks, have come back to the stage and flourished in the Southern coastal regions like Guangdong and Fujian provinces since an “open-up,” market-oriented economic reform was initiated in China beginning in the early 1980s.</p>

<title>The Later Generation of Chinese IFTS in the Postreform Era</title>
<p>The later generation of Chinese underground banks bears a marked resemblance to the old institutions in terms of organizational structure and operational characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1057567712438917">Yan &amp; Gu, 2003</xref>). The current Chinese underground banks in the southern coastal area merge the services of piaohao and qiangzhuang: They handle interregional and cross-border remittances as well as deposits and loans, in addition to engaging in foreign exchange transactions (Xiao &amp; Yang, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712438917">Zou, 2004</xref>). They also retain the traditional organizational mode with the structure of a single partnership or family business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057567712438917">Jia, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As far as proprietors or operators of the new generation of Chinese underground banks are concerned, most of them do not seem to be sophisticated criminals. The profile reflected in police reports is quite consistent in that as a group of enterprising individuals with an acute sense of change in market demand, they are adept at working Chinese financial and legal loopholes to their own advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712438917">Chen, 2007</xref>; Zhao, personal interviews, August 10, 2005). Many of them have the experience of living abroad or have relatives who are residents of foreign countries. Others have well-established connections with foreign exchange outlets outside China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712438917">Zou, 2004</xref>). In general, current Chinese underground banks benefit from extensive, closely linked networks formed with their counterparts overseas and clients across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to taking cares of ordinary individuals and small businesses with the need to send money home from abroad or receive remittances, contemporary Chinese IFTS have reportedly expanded their reach into stock-listed corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712438917">Chen, 2007</xref>). So the client base for the later generation of underground banks is much broader. Official crackdown efforts in recent years disclose that the business turnover of underground banks reaches as much as billions of U.S. dollars, implicating many private enterprises, joint ventures, and even state-owned companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712438917">Chen, 2007</xref>; Zhao, personal interviews, August 13, 2005).</p>

<sec id="section10-1057567712438917">
<title>Operational Characteristics</title>
<p>The established networks of regulated banks are indispensable for operations of this type of underground banks. A salient feature of underground banks is trust-based cash transactions, absent the need for a contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1057567712438917">Zhu, 2001</xref>). The “bankers” normally serve repeat clients and rarely deal with strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057567712438917">“HIS plunges,” 2007</xref>; Zhao, personal interviews, August 8, 2005). Transactions are carried out through close collaboration between the underground banks located in China and their branches, partners or associates outside the territory of China, either in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712438917">Zou, 2004</xref>; Zhao, personal interviews, August 8, 2005). The two “banks” are separate, relatively independent systems in terms of settlement and financing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057567712438917">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). For example, domestic underground banks primarily handle transactions in Chinese yuan, while the payment in foreign currency is made mostly through their overseas partners. According to police investigations and informants, an underground bank would open many private accounts with more than one local bank and deposit the client’s cash under the bank accounts in Chinese currency, then give the client (the sender) a code, of which the recipient will be informed. The underground bank confirms with its overseas partner on the code, the account, and the remitted amount by telephone or fax. Finally, the overseas partner will deposit the equivalent amount in designated foreign currency and then make the payment to the recipient after verifying the code (Zhao, personal interviews, August 8, 2005; “The case on underground bank,” 2007).</p>
<p>For example, in a underground bank case, the operators of the underground bank based in Shanghai used as many as 68 personal saving accounts opened with 11 major Chinese banks to carry out 5.35 billion yuan (US$0.64 billion) worth cross-border transactions within 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057567712438917">Hon, 2007</xref>). The transactions can also be completed through online banking services if an underground bank attempts to avoid dealings in cash (“The case of on underground bank,” 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1057567712438917">“The expert from the Central Bank,” 2009</xref>). These two independent systems balance the books on a fixed schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1057567712438917">Yan &amp; Gu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712438917">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the informants, each “bank” constitutes a separate “settlement node” in an elaborate network based on its capital and business scale, among which a large-sum dealing can be completed through sharing capital and clients with one another. Additionally, lineage and family ties can be utilized to open up more business opportunities. This network attribute of underground banking systems can easily defeat the authorities’ crackdown strategies. Whenever one “settlement node” is smashed by the police, the “breach” will be quickly filled up by other underground banks. Underground banks can also shift the risk on their clients by raising the commission fee when the strike down hits them hard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057567712438917">Huang, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With simple transaction methods, low commission fees, more favorable exchange rates, faster capital turnover, and efficiency with to complete a transaction within a few minutes, underground banks become a preferred option for local businesses and individual clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712438917">Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057567712438917">Chiu, He, &amp; Yang, 2007</xref>; Zhao, personal interviews, August 22, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057567712438917">Qiu, 2007</xref>). Additional benefits are that the inflows and outflows of funds through underground banks circumvent the supervision from the authorities in tax, customs, and foreign exchange controls (Zhao, personal interviews, August 22, 2005). These “banks” earn profits from commission fees and differentials in exchange rates. The fee charged varies with the scale of underground banks. For example, an underground bank with the aggregate business turnover amounting to 1.78 billion yuan (US$0.21 billion) over a period of  ½ charged between 0.05% and 0.12% as compared to the normal charge of 0.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057567712438917">Dasgupta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1057567712438917">Wen, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Are Chinese IFTS Involved in Crime?</title>
<p>The authorities’ concerns with the involvement of Chinese IFTS in crime may not be unfounded. Chinese underground banks active throughout South China appear to have become an influential force in the underground economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712438917">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). They have been found to serve different purposes for a wide range of clientele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). They are not only involved in illegal foreign exchange transactions and cross-border remittance transfers, take deposits and offer loans, but also reportedly have great capacity to assist businesses and individuals in funneling abroad ill-gained proceeds generated from illegal activities and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1057567712438917">Zhu, 2001</xref>). Chinese law enforcement agencies contend that underground bank operations are inseparable from committing profit-generating crimes prevalent in the coastal regions, such as tax fraud and evasion, human smuggling, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The following analysis focuses primarily on human smuggling and money laundering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1057567712438917">
<title>Human Smuggling</title>
<p>Human smuggling has grown into a lucrative global industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057567712438917">Kyle &amp; Koslowski, 2001</xref>). Since the mid-1980s, Fujian Province has been the major region of smuggling Chinese illegal immigrant workers into the developed industrialized countries, with the United States as the most favored destination country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057567712438917">Smith, 1997</xref>). According to the estimates given by a census provided by Fuzhou municipal government and the experts in human smuggling, coupled with that of  the informants who work closely with Fujianese illegals, Fujian Province has exported roughly as much as 600,000 illegal immigrants into the United States over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). The largest group of illegal Fujianese, approximately 60,000 to 70,000, is concentrated in NYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057567712438917">Guest, 2003</xref>). The Chinese human trade yields an estimated annual profit of three billion dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the prior research focuses exclusively on the organizational structure of smuggling and delineates the proposed modus operandi of organized criminal groups. The literature on Chinese human smuggling has noted that the success of human smuggling operation hinges on the efficient operation of an elaborate and sophisticated international network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>). The research identifies the whole process of human smuggling, including recruiting immigrants, procuring documents (including both authentic and fraudulent), bribing law enforcement officials, transporting smuggled aliens from place to place, and collecting debts upon their arrival in the United States (Kwong, 1994). However, some of the important questions remain unanswered. For example, are there border-spanning financial systems involved in the operations of smuggling Chinese? Do these Chinese-controlled underground banks facilitate illegal migration and human smuggling? An illegal trip from China to the United States incurs enormous costs. Each individual is charged as high as $70,000 to be smuggled into the United States and Canada from Mainland China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). Chinese illegal immigrants typically are expected to make a down payment ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 before their departure, and the remainder is to be paid upon arrival in the United States by their relatives or friends in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). Smugglers would call their family back in China and demand full repayment by the time frame specified prior to the departure of the illegal immigrant. All dealings are reportedly carried out in cash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712438917">Zhao, 2009</xref>). For those Fujianese illegals whose friends or relatives in the United States are unable or refuse to repay smuggling fees upon their arrival, and for those without any social connections in the United States, it means that their guarantors or their family members would get themselves into serious trouble under these circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712438917">Chin, 1999</xref>; Kwong, 1994). As Fujian is also the major region hosting large numbers of underground banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1057567712438917">Tsai, 2002</xref>), it is important to investigate whether any link exists between operation of underground banks and human smuggling.</p>
<p>The current study on Chinese-run underground banks located in the United States investigates the role Chinese underground banks played in illegal migration and human smuggling from the perspective of the immigrants. Of particular interest is how their knowledge about underground banks as remitting agencies informed their decisions to come to the United States, and how the remittances transferred through underground banks have affected their lives in the United States and the lives of their families left behind in China. It also explores the role of these financial intermediaries in sustaining transnational illegal labor migration achieved through human smuggling. It represents a first attempt to illuminate the financial element of the migration and settlement process through the varied experiences of undocumented Chinese in the United States.</p>
<p>The findings show that during the period of the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, at the peak of the illegal immigration stream from the coastal areas of Fujian Province, a significant proportion of Fujianese illegal migrant workers gained access to underground banks operated by coethnics for transferring their earnings from illegal employment in the United States to home communities. Chinese underground banks in the United States were concentrated in the “Fuzhou Town,” that is, the area around East Broadway, Chinatown, NYC. The informants’ accounts suggest those Fujianese “establishments” either were confined to a counter in a street-front store selling clothing, cell phones or phone cards, and other consumer goods, or in a family-run hostel. These Fujianese-run underground banks collaborated with their counterparts in the sending communities of Fujian by arranging for safe delivery of overseas remittances to individual emigrant households without any additional charge. In other words, this type of underground banks used among illegal immigrants and their families are operative independent of domestic banks, a distinct feature contrasting the operation style of underground banks in Guangdong province.</p>
<p>According to the respondents’ accounts, the emergence of qianzhuangs in Chinatown, NYC, appears to be not necessarily tied to a lack of legal status or absence of legal avenues for fund transfer. Instead, it was a response used to cope with the impediments which they were confronted with: One is the fear of leaving any paper trail of transactions with formal banks and the dread of the cumbersome process of going through paperwork; second, they needed to clear smuggling debt within the shortest period possible. Fujianese-operated underground banks specialized in solving specific problems for illegal immigrants by offering a “unique” service which featured confidentiality, efficiency, service reliability, and cultural affinity. Those features render a competitive edge overregulated channels, enabling them to serve undocumented immigrant workers more effectively. Based on the respondents’ experience, though some underground banks reportedly retained the capacity to handle the transfer of large sums, most of the transactions involving illegal immigrant clients seemed to involve small sum transactions carried out by small-time operators who maintained their activities on small scale. The respondents’ narratives were also suggestive of another distinct feature of underground banks which is an extraordinarily high degree of reliability of their service. Complaints rarely turned up about the quality of qianzhuangs’ service from the respondents. None of the respondents reported that they had ever experienced or heard of a single case in which the families of an immigrant were shortchanged by a qianzhuang. On the whole, no disputes of any kind between qianzhuang operators and the clients, much less violent incidents, have been reported by the respondents.</p>
<p>Where criminal connections of Chinese underground banks are concerned, due to the limitations of this study, the findings are unable to speak to the issues regarding the direct role of underground banks in or sophisticated schemes behind the human smuggling trade. For example, only one underground bank proprietor based in the United States has been convicted for organizing a human smuggling racket leading to the Golden Venture Cargo disaster in 1993. She also owned underground banks in the sending communities in Fujian. Beyond that, no substantial evidence produced by this research is able to implicate other underground bank operators in the United States in engaging in human smuggling trade. According to the interviewees, the owners or operators of underground banks were considered by their illegal immigrants as decent entrepreneurs, who provided an indispensable service to individual illegal immigrants, making their own lives easier in the United States as well as improving the lives of their families staying behind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that Fujianese immigrants chose underground banks as a preferable mechanism to transfer earnings home for both illegitimate and legitimate purposes: The remittances were used for smuggling debts repayment and the improvement of their families’ economic well-being, including arranging for their family members to migrate to the United States legally or illegally. However, the interview data suggest that in recent years Fujianese illegal immigrants have begun the use of formal sector channels for repatriating their earnings, a result of government crackdown coupled with strong competition from formal remitting institutions, including Chinese-operated banks, Western Union, and MoneyGram. This shift in use toward legitimate institutions may have forced underground banks to a narrower use in which funds need to be transferred for illicit purposes. A reasonable deduction derived from the interviewees’ experienced difficulty locating underground banks is that their operation in Chinatown has significantly fallen, which is suspected of specializing in serving a much smaller group of clientele for the purposes of tax evasion or other unknown illicit purposes. The changing configuration of the remittance market may result in bifurcating their potential clients: One group can be termed as ordinary clients, whereas the other group classified as the prominent clients. Those who have been attracted to use the service provided by international money transfer agencies include lower income migrant workers, mostly the younger generation of more recently arrived illegal immigrants, and settled, legalized immigrants.</p>
<p>The implication is that the current main clientele of underground banks in the United States could be restricted to the “prominent” clients, a fortunate group who likely are established entrepreneurs with more incentive to use the service of underground banks. Some respondents’ statements hinted about the commonality of Fujianese business proprietors “cheating in tax payment,” or tax evasion, and the investment pattern of some affluent Fujianese immigrants, indicating the importance of the continued use of underground banks among this group of clientele. The interview data seem to be consistent with this implication. Since a trend has been noted of human smuggling expanding into other regions of China from Fujian province, the specialized use of underground banks will probably continue well into the 21st century to serve as a reliable conduit for concealing the source of illegitimate income and channeling capital back home for a varied array of purposes, including but not limited to financing smuggling passage, speculating in real estate, or much shadier dealings.</p>
<p>To sum up, the evolution of underground banks active in the United States suggests that they thrived on the massive inflow of smuggled Fujianese migrant workers in the United States and their decline came along with the waning migratory stream and aggressive marketing efforts of international money transfer agencies. Admittedly, human smuggling is a very complex process where a myriad of factors come into play. The evidence based on the experiences of the clients of underground banks suggests that the role of Chinese underground banks was more pronounced in a particular time period in the recent history of Chinese human smuggling starting from the late 1980s. By exclusively serving smuggled Fujianese immigrants as their main clientele, they certainly became a part of the human smuggling process, but they seemed to serve no more than a role of “facilitators” like human smugglers, who are viewed as “migration brokers” by some scholars (Pieke et al., 2004). Before the other side of story is made available from human smugglers and proprietors of underground banks, the link between these IFTS and the human smuggling trade is indirect at best.</p>

<title>Money Laundering</title>
<p>With a robust economy in the South China and increased border trade, profit-inducing crimes, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and financial frauds have exploded in the economically developed regions. In the coastal provinces like Guangdong and Fujian, their geographical proximity to Hong Kong and Taiwan make them prime locations for smuggling and illicit large-sum cash flow since the late 1980s that it has become the “integral” part of local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1057567712438917">Vogel, 1989</xref>). Though an exact estimate of laundered money is elusive, the International Monetary Fund recently estimates the total value of money laundering in China amounts as much as $24 billion annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057567712438917">“Money laundering and financial crime,” 2006</xref>). The economic boom in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong appears to turn these coastal regions into hotbed for money laundering, which together claimed 61.4% of the country’s suspicious currency transactions. Guangdong Province accounted for 40.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057567712438917">“Sharp rise in number of illegal forex deals,” 2006</xref>). As such, it hardly comes to a surprise that an existent sophisticated mechanism is suspected of facilitating the conversion of Chinese currency and fund transfer in meeting growing needs for money laundering.</p>
<p>During the same period of time, underground banking has also experienced rapid growth. According to the foreign exchange regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), underground banks were found to engage in illegal dealings worth US$1.5 billion in 2004, the figure surged to $3.03 billion in 2006 and $14.6 billion in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057567712438917">“China busts 40 illegal banks,” 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057567712438917">Chung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057567712438917">“Money laundering and financial crime,” 2006</xref>). The growing scale of the informal financial systems alarmed the authorities that underground banks may play a significant role as the provider of much-needed foreign currency used for purchasing smuggled goods and serves as the channels for laundering the illicit gains for criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057567712438917">Quek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057567712438917">“Money laundering rampant,” 2006</xref>). The local law enforcement agencies even suggested that underground banking operations are so closely tied to a wide array of illegal activities and that investigations of underground banks never failed to produce clues for tracking down smuggling and other crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712438917">Zou, 2004</xref>). According to official media and police reports, a significant proportion of smuggling cases under investigation involve underground banks. In 2008, a joint operation by police and the Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China cleared 89 money laundering cases totaling 28.2 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion), half of which involved underground banks; one third of them were detected in Guangdong Province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057567712438917">“China’s central bank helps,” 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The government’s concerns heighten when underground banks are believed to commit money laundering by siphoning off public funds as a result of official corruption and bribery. The most publicized case is that of Fairwell smuggling racket (Yuanhua Group in China) uncovered in a southern coastal city Xiamen, Fujian in the later 1990s. Lai Changxing, the founder of the company, who has already extradited from Canada back to China in 2011, was charged with orchestrating the smuggling of US$6 billion worth of goods. His company smuggled luxury goods, cigarettes, cars, oil, and electronics into China in the mid-1990s, resulting in the loss of government revenue in unpaid customs duties totaling US$3.6 billion. More than 300 public officials were involved in a vast network of corruption, including provincial officials and a former vice minister of public security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057567712438917">Brown, 2003</xref>). From 1996 to 1998, approximately 12 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) generated from smuggling was laundered by an underground bank in Jinjiang, Fujian Province. The money was deposited in foreign accounts by overseas Yuanhua affiliates through a Hong Kong partner of this underground bank (Zhao, personal interviews, August 13, 2005).</p>
<p>Although there are a number of alternative avenues available to corrupt officials for money transfer, the interview data suggest that underground banks are widely recognized as a safe channel to transfer ill-gotten money abroad, as illustrated by some official corruption cases. In one case, Mr. Kong-xing Lin, the former top-rank executive of the Central China Power Group who was put on trial in October 2004, had 80 million yuan (US$9.6 million) of embezzled public funds laundered and deposited into his overseas account through underground banks. In another case, Mr. Shuo-biao Li, the director in charge of managing public housing funds for state sector employees, misappropriated public funds totaling 73 million yuan ($8.8 million) for gambling debt repayment in 1999. An underground bank based in Zhuhai, Guangdong, helped convert the embezzled money into Hong Kong dollars, which wound up on the tables of casinos in Macao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712438917">Zou, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>On account of these and many other underground bank–related cases, Chinese authorities and the government-controlled media often claim that underground banks facilitate drug trafficking, smuggling, and other serious criminal activities through their illicit financial operations (Zhao, personal interviews, August 10, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1057567712438917">Wang &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>). Underground banks are also accused of seriously disrupting the nation’s financial stability by serving as the conduit for speculative inflows of “hot” money (i.e., short-term speculative capital) and outflows of “black” money (i.e., criminal proceeds). Thus, their existence has greatly impacted China’s capital flight, money laundering, and speculative activities involving international hot money on stock and real estate markets (“The expert from the Central Bank,” 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1057567712438917">Wen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there lacks solid evidence indicating that underground banks are established to specialize in laundering ill-gotten money, or criminal groups are operating underground banks for unlawful purposes. More evidence points to the fact that underground banks revived to meet the mixed market demands with both legitimate and illegitimate elements (Zhao, personal interviews, August 22, 2005). The demands arose because of stringent foreign exchange controls and state banks’ discriminative financing practices against private enterprises. The state’s foreign controls pose unreasonable restraints on the demand for foreign exchange particularly among medium- and small-size enterprises, and the ineffectual service of state-owned banks would subject these enterprises to the higher risk of foreign exchange market and greater cost incurred by the differential between selling and buying rates of foreign exchange set by state banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057567712438917">Qiu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1057567712438917">Wolf, Yeh, Zycher, Eberstadt, &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>). As such, expedient service and fast capital turnover of underground banks are considered no less than a boon among their enterprise clients.</p>
<p>A notable case concerning a so-called the largest underground bank in the South China by media, which was owned by a woman named Ling To, and was shut down in 2007, illustrates the point. Police investigation shows that the Shenzhen branch of To’s money exchange shop had been in operation at least for 7 years and had capacity to handle more than 4.3 billion yuan (US$578 million) in illicit money transfers between Shenzhen and Hong Kong on behalf of 55 clients over a period between 2006 and May 2007 (“China cracking down,” 2007). To’s “bank” won wide recognition from clients scattering across the 21 provinces, which included investors in retail business and other small companies. More important, for the first time, the large state-owned corporations were implicated in doing transactions with the underground bank, including the subsidiaries of National Petroleum Corp (PetroChina), China’s largest oil producer, and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp (Sinopec), the nation’s largest fuel distributor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057567712438917">Hu &amp; Ng, 2007</xref>). Contrary to the negative reputation depicted by media and police report, an expert on Chinese underground economy pointed out that To’s underground bank appeared to have “properly” conducted cross-border foreign exchange transactions for trading and investment purposes, including overseas payment for project services, collection of export payment, payment for fuels, securities for land transfer, mortgage lending, securities investment, advance payment for goods purchased overseas (Zhao, personal interviews, August 19, 2005). The SAFE’s investigation indicated that the largest sum of the combined transactions under three corporate accounts handled by this underground bank, 453 million yuan ($60 million) went to trade and domestic sales, while a total of 130 million yuan ($17 million) was invested in real estate and 105 million ($14 million) in the capital market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712438917">Chen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, lack of investment options on China’s inadequately developed financial market, combined with low interest rates and price gaps in stocks listed in mainland and overseas (e.g., mainland’s B-share market and the H-share market in Hong Kong), could create incentive for increased use of underground banks (Zhao, personal interviews, August 24, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1057567712438917">“Underground currency dealings examined,” 2005</xref>). In August 2007, the central government initiated the stocks “through-train” scheme, allowing direct investment by mainlanders in the Hong Kong stock market. This directly fueled huge foreign exchange trade though underground banks, and their clients, which included corporations as well as individual investors, triggering tens of billions of fund flow from the mainland into Hong Kong stocks within a few months. Because of nonconvertibility of Chinese currency under the capital account, underground banking channels were the only option for the transactions between Chinese currency and Hong Kong dollars (Zhao, personal interviews, August 24, 2005). After Chinese investors withdrew cash from their banks accounts with regulated banks, what those underground banking networks needed to do was to collaborate with their Hong Kong partners by instructing them to deposit the equivalent amount in Hong Kong dollars at local bank branches on behalf of the investors. So literally there was no physical movement of funds cross the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057567712438917">Chiu &amp; Chan, 2007</xref>). Evidently, the respondents, including the law enforcement agents and scholars, acknowledged that there could be a certain proportion of funds of illicit sources mingling with the capital outflows. However, some of the scholar respondents opined that the core issue is that it is largely a strong, pent-up demand for foreign exchange for the purposes of investment and trade that runs on the collision course with the government’s long-standing stringent policy of exchange rate controls and restricted convertibility of the yuan (Zhao, personal interviews, August 22, 2005). The preference of Chinese investors demonstrates that underground banks function as intermediaries to render more reliable and efficient services than state-owned banks and other conventional financial institutions. A researcher at the Shenzhen branch of the government-backed China Development Institute estimated that as much as 90% of mainland capital invested in Hong Kong stock market was transferred through underground banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057567712438917">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>). As such, it might be argued that underground banks primarily exist to meet strong, legitimate market demand, instead of specializing in transferring criminal proceeds (Zhao, personal interviews, August 22, 2005).</p>

<title>Implications and Discussion</title>
<p>The study’s descriptive and exploratory findings seem to provide more support for illegal enterprise perspectives than traditional organized crime model. At the core of the perspectives is the emphasis on the task environment of illegal enterprise or internal economics of market and the resultant influence over the structure and operation of underground banks, and their relationships with their clients. By looking at Chinese underground banks as illegal enterprises, instead of a component of organized crime, this research sheds light on the demand side of the market, which was shaped by special needs and focal concerns of their clientele. The demands of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States and booming private businesses in Southern coastal regions in China created different market niches. These demands provide ample potential for profits to illegal service providers like underground banks, whose unique service provides a competitive edge over formal banks. Undocumented individual immigrants and private enterprises turn to underground banking outlets for the purposes of circumventing government controls and taking advantage of the convenience and quality service they offered. Furthermore, the market demands for the illegal service waxed and waned over years with different groups of clientele. Contracting underground banking system operation in the United States seems a response to dwindling stream of illegal labor migration, whereas their counterparts in China continually expand as a result of soaring demands of flourishing private enterprises there.<sup>

</p>
<p>The discovery has important policy implications. Treating underground banks as crime organizations justifies the policy of criminalization of the systems and strike-hard strategy at expense of the neglect of profound structural issues such as those relating to China’s state banking systems. The laws against underground banks are relatively recent in China. The Chinese government has taken aggressive actions in response to the rapid proliferation of underground banks since the 1990s. Recent years have seen more underground banks shut down, and the proposition for harsher punishments has been included in a draft amendment to the Penal Code in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057567712438917">“China busts 40 illegal banks,” 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, little evidence suggests that the get-tough approach has achieved desired results. Contrary to the authorities’ claim that underground banking activities has been successfully contained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057567712438917">“Sharp rise in number of illegal forex deals,” 2006</xref>), Chinese underground banks reportedly continue to flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1057567712438917">“Worried about illicit lending,” 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1057567712438917">Zhou, 2008</xref>), expanding from South China into the hinterlands in the west and the coastal regions in the north (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1057567712438917">Tschang, 2005</xref>). There are good reasons to expect that crackdown strategies in China probably may bring about unintended adverse consequences, such as driving these informal financial institutions further underground to facilitate a wide variety of illegal activities.</p>
<p>The article does not imply that underground banks do not pose a serious problem simply because available evidence in this current research suggests that all business transactions going through underground banks do not necessarily deal with criminal proceeds. This article presents a preliminary overview of two types of criminal offenses implicating underground banks. The research comes with important limitations due to the sampling problem and inaccessible governmental archive. The data generated from the study do not deal with sources of funding, or personnel management and monitoring in the operation of underground banks. The nonprobability sampling used in this study may be characterized by selection bias due to the highly sensitive subject matter and the general difficulty involved in identifying clients willing to discuss the criminal use of underground banks. Another issue concerns the composition of the research sample. Over 80% of the research subjects were of the early generation of illegal immigrants who came to the United States prior to 1995. Given the small number of more recent illegal immigrants interviewed for this study, it could affect the description of the changes in the use of underground banks with confidence. Such preliminary observations definitely warrant further research with more representative research samples.</p>
<p>All evidence available suggest that what surfaces in the crackdown on underground banks might be the tip of the iceberg; it is likely that much is hidden beyond what has been exposed under police investigation. Future research with better designs and improved data collection strategy should delve into the nature of underground banking systems in their connections to a wide variety of criminal activities.</p>

<p>There is a lack of consensus on terminology relating to informal financial systems. The often used terms include IFTS, “alternative remittance systems,” “underground banking,” “ethnic banking,” and “informal value system.” A more detailed description of these systems can be found in El Qorchi et al. (2003). Some scholars argue that a distinction should be made between IFTS and informal value transfer mechanisms” (IFTSM), two different types of informal remittance system. See El Qorchi et al. (2003), Maimbo (2003), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057567712438917">Passas (2003</xref>). Both refer to “mechanism or networks of people facilitating the transfer of funds or value without leaving a trail of entire transactions or taking place outside the traditionally regulated financial channels” (El Qorchi et al., 2003). However, IFTS is mainly used for pure monetary value transfer carried out by ethnic businesses. The practice was widespread in subcontinental India and China and now their services are available across the globe. They are subject to financial regulations applicable to money services businesses. Examples of IFTS include the hawala system (prevalent in India and the Middle East) and Chinese underground banking systems (Qianzhuang in Chinese). IFTSM refers to the transfer of value in the form of goods, or a combination of goods and money, for their monetary value. Examples of IFTSM include in-kind transfers/payments, invoice manipulation, trade diversion, and so on. They usually have interface with the formal banking institutions but leave no money trail. See Maimbo and Passas (2004). The IFTS is used in this article to stand for Chinese-operated informal remittance transfer systems.</p>

<p>The author encountered greater difficulty recruiting and locating cooperative research subjects in mainland China than in the U.S. Some potential respondents, particularly those who were legal scholars or worked in the judicial systems, declined to issue personal comments on the subject topic by referring to its political sensitivity. As for other reluctant respondents, the author's impression was that it could be either because they felt threatened by heightened police crackdown, or were personally involved in illicit activities.</p>

<p>The private sector accounted for total industrial output worth $1,200 billion in 1999, while the state sector produced around $400 billion. Over the period between 1996 and 2002, the private sector’s growth rate reached 14.3% annually as compared to a 5.4% for the state sector. The private sector has created more jobs for the nonagricultural population than the state sector. During the period from 1995 to 2002, over 70% of nonagricultural employees worked in the private sector. By 2005, a total of 29.3 million private sectors contributed to 49.7% of the gross domestic product. See Allen, Qian, and Qian (2005) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report (2005).</p>
