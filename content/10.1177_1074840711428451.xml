<abstract>
<p>Although more is known about how individuals within families make decisions and manage more discrete issues when a family member is dying, less is known about how families as a unit manage after the sudden death of a family member. The article discusses an investigation that was conducted to better understand how families respond to the life-threatening illness or injury and eventual death of a family member. The purpose of the study was to define Family Management Styles (FMSs) and determine distinctive characteristics of each FMS used by families after the death of a family member who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn as a result of an unexpected, life-threatening illness or injury. Interviews are conducted with 8 families (22 family members) 1 to 2 years after the death of their family members. A modified typology of FMSs based on a directed analysis that was then inductively modified includes: progressing, accommodating, maintaining, struggling, and floundering. Understanding FMSs and how FMSs may change over time, reflecting the changing focus of family work, will further aid in the development of family-focused interventions as well as develop FMSs within the context of end of life.</p>

<p>Patients enter the critical care setting in acute physiological crisis. Treatment is aggressive in an effort to be life-saving. Thirteen percent of all patients hospitalized in ICUs, however, eventually die before being discharged from the hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840711428451">Iwashyna, Kramer, &amp; Kahn, 2009</xref>). The majority of critical care deaths are preceded by decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840711428451">Azoulay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840711428451">Cook et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840711428451">Heyland, Rocker, O’Callaghan, Dodek, &amp; Cook, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Families of the dying who participate in these decisions are at higher risk for psychosocial and physical sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711428451">Azoulay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840711428451">Pochard et al., 2001</xref>), with little specifically known about their health or social outcomes. A key aspect of this situation is the unexpected nature of the sudden acute illness or injury and the need to grapple with unanticipated and often premature death. Much of what is known about families and end-of-life care is about the treatment decisions they make with and for family members. Families not only make these end-of-life decisions but also live with the consequence of participating in the decision-making process and the dying process that occurs after the decision is made. Family members have reported extremely high levels of stress that approach those found in natural disasters. Stress can reportedly continue for 3 months or more after the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840711428451">Azoulay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840711428451">Tilden, Tolle, Nelson, &amp; Fields, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Little research has been done to examine how families manage after they participate in decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapy (LST) and in the dying process. Most existing research has focused on the process of deciding to withhold and withdraw LST. This research has revealed significant burden for families and profound emotional and ethical anguish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840711428451">Wiegand, 2008</xref>). Hansen and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711428451">Hansen, Archbold, &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>) reported that family members experienced role strain before, during, and after the decision-making process related to LST. Family members have described participation in the process as difficult, intense, painful, overwhelming, devastating, and traumatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840711428451">Tilden, Tolle, Nelson, Thompson, &amp; Eggman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711428451">Wiegand, 2006</xref>). They have described the decision to withdraw LST as the hardest thing they had ever had to do, and many felt guilty about participating in decisions to either withhold or withdraw therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840711428451">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840711428451">Tilden et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840711428451">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711428451">Wiegand, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1074840711428451">
<title>Original Study</title>
<p>A hermeneutic phenomenological study was conducted to describe families’ experiences during the process of withdrawal of LST from a family member with an unexpected, life-threatening illness or injury. This study occurred during the acute phase of illness or injury and throughout the process of withdrawal of LST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840711428451">Wiegand, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840711428451">2008</xref>). As data collection and data analysis proceeded in the original investigation, patterns or a typology of FMSs emerged including progressing, accommodating, maintaining, struggling, and floundering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand, Deatrick, &amp; Knafl, 2008</xref>). Major components and dimensions that served as a matrix for these styles described the work of the family during withdrawal of treatment: Definition of the Situation (view of the person, illness/injury view, management mindset/family readiness, family mutuality), Management Behaviors (family philosophy, family interaction, family presence, preparing for death), and Consequences (physiological effects, emotive responses, LST withheld, LST withdrawn). Questions remained about the major components, dimensions, and FMSs of families after the experience of withdrawal of treatment.</p>
<p>To fill this gap in understanding, an investigation was conducted to better understand family response after withdrawal of treatment and the eventual death of the family member. The purpose of the study was to define FMSs and determine distinctive characteristics of each FMS used by families after the death of a family member who had LST withdrawn as a result of an unexpected, life-threatening illness or injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1074840711428451">
<title>Family Management Style Framework</title>
<p>The Family Management Style Framework (FMSF) was used to guide the investigation. Family management is the family’s role in actively responding to illness and health care situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840711428451">Deatrick &amp; Knafl, 1990</xref>). Identifying typologies or patterns of family response to illnesses can help to understand family processes and strategies that families use to manage illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711428451">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). The FMSF is a model that can be used to understand family-shared perceptions and meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840711428451">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 1990</xref>). The FMSF is composed of three major components: Definition of the Situation, Management Behaviors, and Perceived Consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711428451">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). Definition of the Situation is how the family views the family member and the illness or injury. Management Behaviors describe the family’s ability to develop a routine for responding or managing to the family member’s illness and/or injury and death. Perceived Consequences are actual or expected outcomes that shape Management Behaviors and affect the subsequent Definition of the Situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711428451">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>). Each of these three components is further developed with dimensions (a total of eight) that describe key issues of family management for children’s chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840711428451">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Each family member from the original investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>) was contacted for a follow-up interview to explore his or her perceptions of the withdrawal of LST process. During this interview, patterns of family responses were described by the family members and observed by the researcher. Data analysis and interpretation were directed by the components and dimensions of family management identified in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>) and were modified based on data from this study.</p>
<sec id="section4-1074840711428451">
<title>Family Sample</title>
<p>Of the 19 families who participated in the original study, 8 agreed to the follow-up interview. From the 8 families, 22 family members out of the original 30 family members agreed to participate in the follow-up interview. Thus, all families who participated in the follow-up study participated in the original study.</p>
<p>Patients in the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand and colleagues (2008)</xref> study ranged in age from 20 to 82 years old (mean = 63, median = 68). The majority of the patients in the original study were female (79%) and 16 (84%) of the patients were white, non-Hispanic in origin. Patients were diagnosed with new cancer diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 6), neurological event (<italic>n</italic> = 4), trauma (<italic>n</italic> = 3), surgical complication (<italic>n</italic> = 3), pancreatitis (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and gastrointestinal bleeding (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>
<p>The 8 patients whose families participated in this follow-up study ranged in age from 45 to 82 (mean = 69, median = 70). The majority of the patients were female (75%), and all of the patients in the follow-up study were white, non-Hispanic in origin. Patients had serious life-threatening illnesses and injuries, including neurological events (<italic>n</italic> = 4), new cancer diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and trauma (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
<p>The age range of family members who participated in the original study was 17 to 77 (mean = 49, median = 47). The majority (66%) of the family members were female and white, non-Hispanic (89%) in origin. Most of the family members were adult children 57% (<italic>n</italic> = 32) of the patient, followed by spouse 14% (<italic>n</italic> = 8), sibling 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 5), parent 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and in-law 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
<p>The 22 family members who participated in this study ranged in age from 27 to 75 (mean = 50, median = 48). The majority (68%) of the family members were female (<italic>n</italic> = 15), and all of the family members were white, non-Hispanic in origin. Most (77%) of the family members were adult children (<italic>n</italic> = 17) of the patient, followed by spouse, 18% (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and parent, 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Thus, patients in this follow-up study were slightly older than patients in the original study and were all white, non-Hispanic in origin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1074840711428451">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All families who participated in the original investigation were contacted and asked whether they would participate in a follow-up interview. The interviews were conducted 1 to 2 years (mean = 18 months) after the death of each family member. Thirteen individual family member interviews (59%) were conducted over the telephone. Two interviews were conducted with multiple family members in their homes, and one individual interview was conducted with a family member in an office. Informed consent was obtained from each family member prior to each interview. Permission was obtained to audiotape each interview. Additional study procedures regarding the conduct of interviews have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840711428451">Wiegand &amp; Petri, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1074840711428451">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A directed analysis was conducted using the FMS typology that was inductively derived in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>). The analysis in this follow-up study focused on identifying patterns of family responses after the death of the family member (the patient).</p>
<p>Matrices were developed that organized data into grids according to each major FMSF component identified in the original study. The <italic>Definition of the Situation</italic> grid included information about how families viewed their deceased family members and his or her illness or injury, the <italic>Management Behavior</italic> grid included principles on which Management Behaviors were based and how each family managed after the death of their family members, and the <italic>Consequences</italic> grid included actual consequences that occurred after the death of each families’ family member.</p>
<p>Data were managed and analyzed maintaining a family focus, and each family was first examined for within-family patterns of management. In order to do so, data were carefully reviewed from each of the families and added those to the grids. As the data were added, some of the dimensions remained the same as in the original study and some of the dimensions needed to be changed. New dimensions emerged that helped to further explain each of the major components (D<italic>efinition of the Situation, Management Behaviors, and Consequences</italic>) of the FMSF. An independent reviewer (another qualitative researcher) reviewed the audit trail (data, the grids, and decision points) to confirm the findings.</p>
<p>Data from each family were then compared to that of other families. The across-family analyses of the data helped to identify aspects of the experience that were shared by all of the families and helped to determine how families defined and managed differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>). A FMS was determined for each of the families in the follow-up study.</p>
<p>A matrix was then created containing each family participating in both the original and the follow-up investigations. This provided a visual comparison of the FMS identified in this study and in the original investigation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1074840711428451" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis contributed to better understanding family response after the death of a family member in terms of FMSs and their major components and dimensions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840711428451">Figure 1</xref>). The five FMSs and their major components remained the same; however, their descriptions were refined and modified. Five dimensions identified in the original study no longer applied after the death of the family member: regarding the families’ Definition of the Situation, management mindset/family readiness; regarding the families’ Management Behaviors, family presence, and preparing for death; and regarding the Perceived Consequences for the families, LST withheld and LST withdrawn.</p>

</fig>
<p>Each major component identified for families in this study will be described along with its dimensions as well as the FMSs that were constructed. In order to illustrate the interplay across dimensions, two case studies will be presented as exemplars of the progressing and floundering family management styles.</p>
<sec id="section8-1074840711428451">
<title>Dimensions</title>
<sec id="section9-1074840711428451">
<title>Definition of the Situation</title>
<p>Family members defined their situation in terms of how they viewed the deceased member and his or her illness or injury. Dimensions of this FMS component included view of the person, view of the illness or injury, view of the decision to withdraw LST, and family mutuality. Management mindset/family readiness, which was important in the original study during the process of the family member’s death, was no longer relevant to these families, following the death of their family members.</p>
<p>The family members’ view of the person incorporated varying perspectives about the deceased family member. Family members described their family member and what type of a person he or she was. Family members also spoke of their family member’s life and what he or she had done, which was often described within the context of the family. Another dimension discussed by family members was their views or perceptions of their family member’s illness or injury. Whereas some family members thoroughly understood the nature of the illness, others had varying levels of understanding related to the nature of their family member’s illness or injury.</p>
<p>Following the death of each family member, view of the decision to withdraw LST became a new dimension of the Definition of the Situation component. Family members varied to the extent they justified the decision to withdraw LST as the right decision given the circumstances of the patient’s illness or injury and/or questioned the decision or the timing of the decision.</p>
<p>The final theme related to Definition of the Situation was family mutuality. Family mutuality referred to whether family members had similar individual views. Family members described varying levels of similar or disparate views related to the deceased member, the illness or injury, and the decision to withdraw LST.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1074840711428451">
<title>Management Behaviors</title>
<p>Families varied in how they managed as a family after the death of their ill or injured family member. Dimensions used to understand family Management Behaviors included family philosophy, family interaction, and family support. Family presence and preparing for death, which were important in the original study, were no longer relevant to these families after the death.</p>
<p>Family philosophy referred to the views and values that guided the overall approach of the family as it managed after the death of one of its members. Family members varied in terms of their ability to view the end-of-life experience within a larger context of the family goals, priorities, and values. Family interaction referred to the ability of the family members to communicate and interact with each other. Following each family member’s death, surviving family members varied in their ability and willingness to interact and communicate with each other. The last dimension related to Management Behaviors was family support. This was identified as a new dimension that encompassed surviving family members’ efforts to attend to each others’ needs following the death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074840711428451">
<title>Perceived Consequences</title>
<p>Family members identified various consequences following the death one of the family members, including physiological effects, emotive responses, moving on, and family relationships. LST withheld and LST withdrawn, which were important in the original study before each family member’s death, were no longer relevant to these families after the death.</p>
<p>Physiological effects referred to changes in family members’ health after the death of their family member. Although some family members’ health remained unchanged, some family members linked new, serious health concerns to the death. Emotive responses included a range of affective responses to the death, some of which were expected (e.g., sadness and loneliness) and some of which were not expected (e.g., relief and anger). Moving on, a new dimension, referred to the ability of the family to resume usual roles and activities following the death. Some families were gradually able to move on after the death of a family member, whereas other families remained focused on circumstances surrounding the death. A second new dimension referred to changed family relationships after the death of the family member. Whereas some family members noted few changes, others noted weakened or strengthened family ties.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1074840711428451">
<title>Family Management Styles (FMSs)</title>
<p>Families in this study were characterized by one of five FMSs: progressing, accommodating, maintaining, struggling, and floundering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840711428451">Figure 1</xref>). An overview of distinguishing characteristics of each FMS will be provided followed by a description of two case examples of progressing and floundering FMS to demonstrate the interplay among their major components and dimensions.</p>
<sec id="section13-1074840711428451">
<title>FMS: Progressing (Two Families)</title>
<p>Families categorized in the progressing FMS were able to move forward as a family. They were not only able to function as individuals but were also able to continue functioning as a family despite the tremendous loss that they had experienced.</p>
<sec id="section14-1074840711428451">
<title>Definition of the Situation</title>
<p>Family members viewed the deceased member from a very positive perspective. They described positive qualities of the deceased member and described how important he or she was to the family. Family members had similar reviews regarding the serious nature of their family member’s illness or injury and knew that withdrawal of LST was the right decision to make.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1074840711428451">
<title>Management Behaviors</title>
<p>Family members of progressing families were able to put the entire experience in a larger context. Family members were able to communicate and interact as a family. Family members genuinely cared for and supported each other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1074840711428451">
<title>Perceived Consequences</title>
<p>Family members in progressing families maintained good health after the death of their family member. They experienced grief and were gradually, over time, able to work through the grief. The family was able to move on as a family by continuing family traditions and starting new traditions. Family relationships were strengthened because of the experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1074840711428451">
<title>The progressing FMS exemplar</title>
<p>The Rich family (all names are pseudonyms) will be discussed as an example of a family that was identified as the progressing FMS. Mr. Rich (Fred) had his annual physical and endoscopy. A “cancer spot” was detected during his endoscopy. As his wife, Ann, stated, “He had no signs, he didn’t feel bad, he never had indigestion, he never had heartburn and he had cancer.” Two weeks after his endoscopy, Fred had gastric surgery. He progressed well in the first few days after his surgery and then he developed several complications, including renal failure and sepsis. Fred’s family, including his wife and adult children, spent long hours and many days at his bedside. Unfortunately, the aggressive interventions did not improve Fred’s condition and his prognosis was determined to be very grim. After several weeks of aggressive treatments a shared decision was made between the health care team and Fred’s family that LST would be withdrawn and Fred died.</p>
<p>Fred’s wife and adult children participated in the follow-up interview that was conducted a little over a year after Fred’s death. The Rich family was categorized as the progressing FMS. Families categorized as <italic>progressing</italic> moved forward as a family in their general functioning. In terms of the dimension, <italic>Definition of the Situation</italic>, the family members were very positive about the deceased family member. Mrs. Rich spoke very positively about her husband, and Mr. Rich’s adult children spoke very highly of their father. The family members understood the severity of Mr. Rich’s illness. Although it was not the decision that they ever thought they would have to make, the Rich family members felt that the decision to stop treatment was the right decision to make. Very important, all of the family members within the family had the same view.</p>
<p>The Rich family members were able to come together and manage well despite their loss. The members of the Rich family interacted well and frequently. They communicated openly with each other and were able to provide support for each other. The family members functioned well as a family.</p>
<p>Family members in the category of progressing FMS were able to maintain their health as a family. The Rich family experienced the emotional aspects of loss and grief as did the other families, but the intensity of the grief lessened gradually over time. Relationships between family members were strengthened and the family members adjusted well to new roles. The Rich family was able to move on as a family to life without Fred. Fred’s wife, Ann, started several new activities. She started a part-time job and began spending more time with her friends. She and her adult children started a new tradition at the Christmas holiday after Fred’s death.</p>

<title>The floundering FMS exemplar</title>
<p>The Cotton family will be discussed as an example of a family that was identified as the floundering FMS. Abby was found unconscious and was transported by ambulance to the hospital. She had an intracerebral hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Abby had surgery to repair the ruptured aneurysm. She never regained consciousness. After a week of aggressive interventions a decision was made between the Cotton family and Abby’s health care team to stop treatment. LST was stopped and Abby died.</p>
<p>Abby’s mother and one of her daughters participated in the follow-up interview 1 year after Abby’s death. The Cotton family was categorized as the floundering FMS. The family was in turmoil and functioned very poorly as a family. In terms of the dimension, Definition of the Situation, Abby’s mother and daughter spoke more negatively than positively about Abby. The family members had varied views related to understanding Abby’s illness and its severity. The family had varied views regarding the decision to stop treatment, and concerns were verbalized that some members of the family thought the decision was made too soon.</p>
<p>The Cotton family did not manage well after Abby’s death. There was little to no support exchanged between family members. If family members interacted, the interactions were very tumultuous. There was little communication between family members, and if communication occurred, it often involved harsh words and raised voices.</p>
<p>After the death of Abby the family was literally in chaos. The Cotton family experienced the emotional aspects of loss and grief as did the other families but also experienced intense feelings of anger and distrust toward other family members. The Cotton family found that changes in family member roles were often overwhelming. There was a complete breakdown of the family, with many family members no longer speaking to each other. Family traditions ceased, and individual family members experienced serious health issues. For example, Abby’s mother developed a new diagnosis of hypertension just after her daughter’s death and one of Abby’s daughters was hospitalized 1 month after her death for a “nervous breakdown.”</p>

<title>Comparison of FMSs to the Original Study</title>
<p>Although the intent of this study was to describe the characteristics of the FMSs and their major components and dimensions, a preliminary exploration was completed regarding how FMSs compared for each family in the original study and the present study. Five of the families’ FMSs remained the same throughout both studies: progressing FMS (<italic>n</italic> = 2), accommodating FMS (<italic>n</italic> = 1), maintaining FMS (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and struggling FMS (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Three of the families modified their FMS. One of these families was “maintaining” in the original study connoting that it was somewhat reactive and selective in its response to the situation and had difficulty determining what should guide decision making. In this study, this family was “accommodating” connoting that its members were adjusting to the loss of one of the members and adapting the best that they could. The second family was also “maintaining” in the original study but was “struggling” in this study meaning that it went from being a family that was variable in its response to being a family that was characterized by conflict. The third family was “struggling” to interact and make decisions as a family in the original study and was “floundering” in this study, meaning that it had even more difficulty managing after the death of one of its members, which affected not only individuals within the family but also the ability of the family to function as one unit.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Typologies of FMSs have been used to describe family response to a variety of health care challenges. FMSs have been identified for families managing the chronic illness of a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711428451">Kendall &amp; Shelton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840711428451">Knafl, Breitmayer, Gallo, &amp; Zoeller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840711428451">Kodadek &amp; Haylor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840711428451">Misko &amp; Bousso, 2007</xref>). FMSs have also been identified for families responding to the acute illness of a neonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840711428451">Murphy, 1990</xref>), to the process of breastfeeding a low-birth-weight neonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840711428451">Krouse, 2002</xref>), to breastfeeding a premature neonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840711428451">Bernaix, Schmidt, Jamerson, Seiter, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>) and to how families respond to genetic testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840711428451">Van Riper, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This investigation extends the use of the FMSF and contributes to understanding FMSs in the context of end of life. The FMSF can be used to understand FMSs used by families in response to the sudden, life-threatening illness or injury of an adult family member for whom LST was withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840711428451">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>) and to understand FMSs used by families in response to the death of one of their members.</p>
<p>An acute, unexpected illness or injury resulting in the death of a family member alters the structure of the family and potentially threatens the integrity of the family. Whereas family response varies, family management has not been studied and little research has been done to investigate whether FMSs remain consistent or change over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840711428451">Knafl and colleagues (1996)</xref> described potential changes in family management over time concerning school-aged children with chronic conditions. They found no relationship between length of time since diagnosis and change or stability of FMS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840711428451">Kendall and Shelton (2003)</xref> studied family responses to having a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They found that over time most families progressed on a continuum to improving their ability to manage. The exception was chaotic families who remained chaotic with no change over time. The current investigation offers preliminary descriptive evidence suggesting how the dimensions of FMS can evolve within the context of an acute life-threatening illness or injury followed by the death of a family member. The results describe how the work of the family can shift, illustrating the importance of a longitudinal perspective.</p>
<sec id="section37-1074840711428451">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This investigation has several limitations. One limitation is the low response rate to those who had agreed to be contacted for follow-up. Less than half (8) of the 19 families asked to participate in this follow-up investigation agreed to participate. It was anticipated that more families would participate in this follow-up study since the researcher collected data at both time points and had an established relationship with the families. It is unclear why the follow-up participation was low because those who did not participate did not answer telephone calls and did not respond to written correspondence.</p>
<p>Little longitudinal research has been conducted with families of the dying in the acute care setting; thus, it is not known whether this response rate was to be expected or not. When asked to participate in research related to withholding and withdrawing LST for patients with acute illnesses, up to 40% of family members refused to participate at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840711428451">Tilden et al., 1999</xref>). Another limitation was that there was very little diversity in the follow-up sample and no data could be gathered regarding why more diverse families did not respond after agreeing to be recontacted just prior to each family member’s death. All of the family members in the follow-up investigation were white, non-Hispanic in origin, and the majority of family members were female, adult children of the deceased.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Helping families transition from life to death facilitates the beginning of the grief process for families. Understanding the FMS may be helpful to nurses and other health care providers as they assess and intervene to help families with this transition. Mularski and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840711428451">Mularski, Heine, Osborne, Ganzini, &amp; Curtis, 2005</xref>) reported that family members of patients dying in a critical care unit wanted to be prepared for the dying process. Universal interventions can be offered to all families. The most current guidelines recommend educating and communicating with families of the critically ill about the signs and symptoms during the dying process. That is, all family members should be prepared for the withdrawal of LST process and should be guided and supported during their family member’s active phase of dying. In addition, family members may need support so that they can remain at the patient’s bedside together during the active phase of dying or they may need support to be at the bedside during different blocks of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711428451">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840711428451">Truog et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Current clinical care guidelines could be logically extended to care of the family unit after death but lack a strong empirical basis. After the death of the patient each family should be given general information to take home. This may include general information on the expected course of grief, the effect of grief on the family, and contact information for grief support services. Immediate support may be needed in the hospital by a grief counselor and other palliative care and supportive services. In addition, appointments may need to be set up for individual and/or family counseling or group support (spiritual, grief, psychological, etc.) after the patient has died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840711428451">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840711428451">Truog et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Individualized interventions can be focused on dimensions of the FMS that are most important for the family (what it sees as its biggest strength or possible areas of greatest vulnerability), for example, issues related to each component/dimension of family management. Family members who are progressing, their management needs to be reinforced and problem solving can be used to enable them to keep “moving on.” For family members who are struggling or floundering, more immediate and long-term individual and family services may be needed. Immediate interventions in a family meeting may focus on what the family may have in common (e.g., their view of the person and their intent to ease the person’s suffering) through enabling family interaction and accurate information about the illness, injury, and treatment.</p>
<p>This study has important research implications. Additional research is needed to determine whether the FMSs identified in this study remain consistent for a larger number of families going through similar experiences. The dimensions identified in this study need to be tested and refined further. Additional investigations need to be conducted to determine whether FMSs tend to remain consistent or change with time and how families can be best helped through the end-of-life process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that a family typology of family management exists for families experiencing the death of a family member who had LST withdrawn as a result of an unexpected life-threatening illness or injury. Understanding FMSs and how FMSs may change over time, reflecting the changing focus of family work, will further aid in the development of family-focused interventions for this population of families as well as develop FMSs within the context of end of life.</p>
