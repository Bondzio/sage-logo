<abstract>
<p>This article considers the argument that immigration controls can be protective of migrants/victims of trafficking. It examines how the avoidance of “harm” has become central to immigration enforcement and considers the implications of this with particular reference to children. It argues that the language of protection and harm risks inscribing the state as an appropriate protector, not just for children, but for at-risk migrants more generally. This is deeply problematic when, through immigration controls and practices, the state is implicated in constructing this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Managed migration seems to offer the possibility of economic migration as a triple win for sending and receiving states and migrants themselves: International migrants from poorer states are guided into employment where their skills and labor are used for the good of receiving states’ economies; they remit money to productive purpose in their country of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212443814">Goldin, 2011</xref>, p. 415). When times are good, migrants are seen as means of bringing in skills and labor; at a time of recession, controls are tightened to protect the local labor force. When no longer needed, or their stay expires, they return with improved skills and experience to the benefit of all. Migration facilitates development in countries of origin, as it contributes to the economies of receiving countries. Thus, it is both economically sensible and ethical. This is the logic of “managed migration” and, with the exception of issues raised by their consequences for asylum routes, there is little public debate about the desirability and reasonableness of this kind of approach. However, the flip side to managed migration is enforcement, detention, and deportation. This flip side risks undermining win-win-win approaches. Moreover, it is one thing to refuse entry at the borders of a state, but when enacted within state territory enforcement (and the powers that go with it: the surveillance, the knock on the door, the guards, the physical restraint, the fear, and the power of state officials), it can be troubling to a political culture that values physical integrity and individual rights. Although citizens may be broadly in agreement with government immigration policy limiting numbers and acknowledge the consequent logic of detention and deportation, its actual practice can be deeply unsettling.</p>
<p>The liberal dilemma of promotion of basic human rights on one hand and the rights of citizens on the other has been the subject of considerable and important theoretical debate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212443814">Benhabib, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212443814">Bosniak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212443814">Carens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212443814">Zapata-Barrero &amp; de Witte, 2007</xref>). In this article I consider how policy has responded to this dilemma by examining attempts to recast enforcement as <italic>protective</italic> of rights, and in particular protective of the human rights of migrants, through a focus on “harm.” Taking the United Kingdom as a case study, I want to examine how the framing of public debates and policy around “trafficking” have attempted to introduce human rights concerns into immigration policy. This is not the only such attempt; most obviously the policies and debates around migration and development have similarly worked to bring in ethical concerns into immigration practices. However, trafficking is particularly focused on the difficult issues raised by immigration enforcement. Anti-trafficking measures have received a striking degree of public and media support, in stark contrast to calls to stop deportations or protect the rights of “illegal immigrants.” I begin by outlining the UK political and policy context, focusing on the deportation turn and increasing public knowledge of and engagement with deportation. I then examine how the British government attempts to justify this within a liberal framework and consider how concerns with trafficking have facilitated the enshrinement of the prevention of harm at the heart of the immigration enforcement regime. Children are likely to be the least controversial subjects of a policy guided by harm protection, and for this reason I then focus on the case of non-citizen children and immigration enforcement as protection. Taking children as my case study, I argue that a focus on harm and trafficking misses the crucial point that immigration controls produce relations of domination and subordination, thereby leaving state responsibility out of the picture.</p>

<title>The United Kingdom, Managed Migration, Deportation, and Citizenship</title>
<p>The Labour administration of 1998–2010 saw the introduction of “managed migration”, the promulgation of the importance of the relation between migration and economic costs and benefits and a significant shift in the relation between immigration and asylum policy. The first immigration and asylum policy document of their administration, <italic>Fairer, Faster, Firmer—A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum</italic>, published in July 1998, introduced the figure of the “bogus asylum seeker,” and the position of asylum seekers was significantly undermined. At the same time, it became easier to enter the United Kingdom as an economic migrant, and possibilities for working in many sectors of the labor market, including the so-called “low skilled,” increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212443814">Flynn, 2003</xref>). It was the era of “managed migration” and of a “firm but fair” asylum policy. From end of World War II until the early 1990s, the treatment of the “refugee” was a benchmark of how rights of non-citizens are respected within the United Kingdom as a liberal democratic state. From the early 2000s onward the circumscription of the rights of asylum seeker (the ill-fated voucher scheme where asylum seekers were given supermarket vouchers instead of cash, dispersal, the expansion of detention) meant that hospitality to those seeking asylum could no longer function as an example of how rights of migrants are respected. <italic>Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain</italic>, a white paper published in February 2002, made the case for “managed migration” at the same time as requiring the electronic tagging of asylum seekers and setting the penalty for any infraction of asylum conditions as detention.</p>
<p>The relatively positive approach of the British government to labor migration began to shift in May 2004, when 10 new member states joined the European Union, and the United Kingdom, unlike most other EU states, did not set any transitional measures to prevent the new EU citizens from accessing the labor market. Initial projections of 13,000 new migrants proved to be a vast underestimate, and concerns about the impact of new arrivals, not just on jobs, but on local services, housing, education, and health, began to be voiced in the media. Three years later the “Points Based System” was introduced, with a view to “restoring public trust in the immigration system.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212443814">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the beginning of the clampdown on asylum, enforcement and deportation have moved into the limelight. No longer are they a dirty little secret of immigration practice. In 2003, Blair announced that he would be taking personal control of asylum policy and one of his main priorities would be swifter and more efficient removals of failed asylum seekers. Indeed, as the government’s policies began to bear fruit and the overall rate of expulsion increased, a huge political crisis emerged over the failure of the Home Office officials to consider many non-citizens convicted of serious crimes for deportation, leading to the resignation of the Home Secretary Charles Clarke in 2006. The more deportations, it seemed, the better. The government’s enthusiasm for deportation was reflected in how it publicized its record in the area of deportation. The then–UK Immigration Minister Liam Byrne boasted in 2008, “We are now removing an immigration offender every eight minutes” (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, May 19, 2008). The 2009 UK Border Agency Christmas card comprised a series of celebratory statements in the shape of a Christmas tree including: “We have a tougher enforcement regime within the UK deporting a record number of foreign national prisoners,” and “we are getting stricter on those who don’t play by the rules.” Numbers of people deported or removed from the United Kingdom have increased from around 30,000 annually in 1997 to 68,000 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443814">Anderson, Gibney, &amp; Paoletti, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s deportation turn has been accompanied by an increased visibility of enforcement. When the UK Border Agency (UKBA) was re-formed in 2008, much was made of its new uniform “to increase the visibility of immigration staff.” Moreover, the Home Office signed an “advertiser funded” deal with Sky TV enabling it to contribute to the costs of developing and making a fly-on-the-wall documentary series called <italic>Border Force</italic>, promoting the work of immigration enforcement officers, following them on workplace raids, interrogating suspects, stopping people on entry, and deporting people from removal centers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212443814">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The everyday awareness of immigration enforcement is not restricted to its entertainment value. Ordinary citizens are increasingly involved in the policing and monitoring of borders. On June 18, 2008, the UK Home Office issued a press release announcing its plans to “transform our enforcement capacity.” Key to this transformation (read “increase”) in capacity are the decentralization and localization of enforcement. Government is increasingly reliant on “ordinary people” to police immigration. Public sector workers including health workers, GPs, teachers, university lecturers, social workers, youth workers, and employees of carriers (airline officials, lorry drivers, etc.) have obligations to report any evidence of infractions of control. In a new bid to bring immigration staff and officers “closer to the communities they serve” local immigration teams (LITs) are being established to liaise with “local communities” and immigration crime partnerships. The plan is that a total of 70 to 80 teams will be in place by December 2011, staffed by some 7,500 UKBA officers and staff. But perhaps the most obvious impact of enforcement on citizens has been employer sanctions. Employer sanctions were toughened in 2004, and, in 2006, new legislation was brought in which made it a criminal offence to knowingly employ someone who does not have the correct immigration status, and this is punishable with a maximum two year sentence. The same legislation also made it a civil offence to employ someone in this situation, and requiring employers to conduct repeat document checks at least every 12 months. Moreover, the UKBA reserves the right to publicize information about employers who fail to check the status of their workers and are found to be employing workers illegally. These employers are served with fines and “civil penalty” notices, and their details are recorded on a publically accessible UKBA website.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764212443814">3</xref></sup> Information about them is also often released to local media. Enforcement is not an optional extra for citizens but is increasingly the duty of the good citizen.</p>
<p>This latter point is important because the increased public responsibility for border policing has occurred during a period of intense public debate around Britishness, national identity, and British values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212443814">Anderson, 2011</xref>, for an overview). The promotion of “a meaningful concept of citizenship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212443814">Home Office Community Cohesion Review Team, 2001</xref>) has its roots in a broader civic republic agenda introduced in the early years of the New Labour government. Naturalization is a key site for the construction of citizenship, so this agenda was reflected in the requirements for the acquisition of British nationality: English language, passing a citizenship test, attending a citizenship ceremony, commitment to “British values” (whatever they are). As Bonnie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212443814">Honig (2003)</xref> has shown, these rituals may be a way of symbolically enacting the moment of consent that is supposed to underpin liberal citizenship. Rather than primarily being about the induction of particular strangers into membership, they really serve to affirm the principles that are supposed to bind existing members together. This is supported by the broader policy agenda that went way beyond migrants and naturalization, including the introduction of compulsory citizenship lessons in schools, the 2004 Active Learning for Active Citizenship program, and citizenship reviews by Bernard Crick and Lord Goldsmith. The 2011 census also introduced a new question on national identity. The new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has continued in the same vein, emphasizing the responsibility of individuals and communities to build the “Big Society” and piloting projects to enable young people to develop the skills to be “active and responsible citizens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212443814">Cabinet Office, 2010</xref>, p. 411). In short, the rise in deportation and increase in its visibility has gone alongside a more general debate around citizenship, identity, and British values. Nationalistic feeling in itself is not a problem for immigration enforcement; indeed, it rather facilitates a positive view of deportation, but Britishness is also associated with certain liberal values, and herein lies the challenge.</p>
<p>Increasing enforcement and political concern with “public trust” in immigration systems should not lead to the conclusion that the public in liberal states is unambiguously behind the recent deportation turn or in favor of harsh measures to deal with asylum seekers or illegal migrants. It is true that in the UK public opinion polls have consistently demonstrated in recent years, a preference for tougher restrictions on entry and a belief that there are too many immigrants in the country. However, remarkably few claim that their own neighbourhood has problems attributable to migrants. The Citizenship Survey (2008–2009) found that approximately 85% of respondents report that in their local area, people get along well. Apparently, much of the opposition to migration comes from general concerns about Britain as a nation rather than from direct, negative experiences in one’s own community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212443814">Blinder, 2011</xref>). Such a tension has been examined by Antje <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212443814">Ellermann (2006)</xref>, who has noted that public attitudes to deportation vary greatly across the public policy cycle. Although “at the stage of agenda-setting and policy formulation, the benefits of regulation—restoring the integrity of the immigration system, public safety, fiscal savings—dominate. . . . Once implementation gets under way the public comes face to face with the costs of deportation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212443814">Ellermann, 2006</xref>, p. 296). Confronted with the human face of deportation, public attitudes toward removal are less affected by attempts to “demonize” and scapegoat migrants and often become far more sensitive to the claims of those the state is attempting to expel. Although citizens may be broadly in agreement with government immigration policy and acknowledge the consequent logic of deportation, its actual practice can be deeply unsettling to a political culture that values physical integrity and individual rights. Anti-deportation campaigns in support of particular individuals and families are a ubiquitous feature in many liberal democracies. These campaigns are often mobilized around neighborhoods, schools, and churches and typically use the media and local politicians to try to prevent deportations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212443814">Freedman, 2011</xref>). They often draw on ideas of “good citizenship” by stressing an individual or family’s tangible contribution to the community. Those in danger of deportation are presented as hardworking students, devoted church congregants, conscientious colleagues, and/or valuable local volunteers. This points to some of the contradictions behind government promotion of active citizenship and liberal values on one hand, and deportation policy on the other. It is the managing of these contradictions that I want to move on to discuss, and more particularly the British state’s attempts to justify enforcement policies within a liberal framework.</p>

<title>Harm and Immigration Controls</title>
<p>Britain’s enforcement policy and practice is always contextualized within commitment to broader liberal values. Take the Home Secretary’s foreword to Enforcing the Rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2007</xref>), an outline of the 5-year enforcement strategy:
<disp-quote>
<p>Britain is a country where people work hard, play by the rules, speak English, and get on through merit. It has a proud, centuries-old record of integrating immigrants from around the world and, many times down the years, it has become home to communities fleeing persecution.</p>
<p>That is why I am keen now to press on and sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Failure to take on the people traffickers, who are behind three-quarters of illegal immigration to this country, leaves vulnerable and often desperate people at the mercy of organised criminals. (p. 2)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764212443814">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we have immigration enforcement set within the context of the United Kingdom as a place of liberal freedoms and “fairness,” ruled by the social contract, concerned to foster tolerance and stamp out racism and exploitation. As the foreword suggests and in public discourse at least, an “ethical approach” has tended to be associated with asylum and those “fleeing persecution.” However, as we have seen, after the end of the cold war, the political refugee (bespectacled, older man who enshrined the doing of democratic politics) morphed into the bogus asylum seeker whose rights claims were far more contested. The extension of protection to refugees was no longer straightforwardly the hallmark of liberal democracies’ freedom and respect for rights for non-citizens. It is precisely at this moment that the victim of trafficking materializes.</p>
<p>But who is the “victim of trafficking” (VoT)? Although concern with VoTs (the “White slave trade”) has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212443814">Doezma, 2010</xref>, p. 412) it received renewed international attention with the adoption in November 2000 of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime. This was supplemented by additional protocols, including one on the smuggling of migrants, and another with trafficking in persons, particularly women and children. The definition of trafficking, unlike the definition of smuggling, did not require movement across an international border, still less illegality. However, the central concern of the trafficking protocol, which is the facilitation of cooperation between states to combat organized crime (not human rights, nor the protection of victims), has meant a particular focus on illegal immigration. Moreover, again although the international definition of trafficking as set out in the UN protocol is not restricted to women and girls forced into prostitution, its drafting reflected a particular concern with prostitution, and this has continued to be a focus of policy and press interest, though trafficking for domestic servitude has received increasing attention. Like the “genuine refugee,” the VoT usually requires protection from nonliberal forces. However, unlike the refugee the VoT is primarily depicted as a woman or (girl) child, needing protection from a barbaric foreign national who has associations with organized crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212443814">O’Connell Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 420). Again, unlike the refugee the VoT is not a political actor, and it is important that although the refugee is granted protection through entry to the United Kingdom, the VoT may be protected by NOT being permitted to enter.</p>
<p>It was the arrival on the scene of the VoT that marked the emergence of the prevention of “harm” as a concern of immigration policy. Harm is associated with the body, with shared human physical (and related mental) fragility, with suffering bodies, and in policy terms, with public health, drugs, commercial sex, and other activities that are deemed risky. The VoT is particularly associated with prostitution, that is, with a “harmful” activity, and there is a long history of using the language of “harm” to describe the range of physical and mental consequences of prostitution for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212443814">Weitzer, 2010</xref>). Radical feminists such as Janice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212443814">Raymond (1999</xref>, <italic>Making the Harm Visible</italic>), Melissa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212443814">Farley (2004</xref>, “Prostitution and the Invisibility of Harm”), and Patricia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212443814">Hynes (2002</xref>, “Put in Harm’s Way”) have developed concerns that originate in Victorian responses to the Contagious Diseases Act to apply to so-called “prostituted women” today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443814">Agustin, 2007</xref>, p. 407; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212443814">Doezma, 2010</xref>, p. 412). There has been a particular and growing concern with migrant women whose involvement in the sex industry as VoTs has made them vulnerable to “trafficking harms.” In <italic>Secure Borders, Safe Haven</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2002</xref>) “harm” is mentioned only twice, but both times it is with reference to trafficking. Notably, in that document trafficking was felt to be an issue for “particularly those working as prostitutes” (p. 85, para. 5.31). Moreover, “available evidence points to the majority of illegal immigrants to the UK being here by their consent and that the number of trafficked people is small by comparison” (p. 75, para. 5.2). By 2007, however, organized crime seems to have overrun international borders, and trafficking is used to refer, not only to those migrants in the sex sector but also, more generally, as in the Home Secretary’s foreword, to so-called “illegal migrants.” This elision between trafficking and illegality is what, in 2007, enabled the movement of the language of “harm” into the mainstream of immigration management and enforcement. <italic>Enforcing the Rules</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2007</xref>) comprises some 36 pages, and the words <italic>harm</italic> and <italic>harmful</italic> occur no fewer than 62 times. The prevention of harm is now a central plank of enforcement policy not just anti-trafficking policy, and in February 2010 the UKBA published <italic>Protecting Our Border, Protecting the Public</italic>, a document setting out how the UKBA will protect the public from the “untold harm” that derives from crime, terrorism, and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The language of harm that has slipped into immigration enforcement is extremely powerful. Although the scope of positive duties may be controversial, the prevention of harm is something that can be easily agreed on by people with a wide diversity of overall conceptions of the good. Moreover, in a liberal society it is harm that justifies compulsion, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443814">Mill (1948)</xref> puts it in his famous “Harm Principle,” “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443814">Mill, 1948</xref>, p. 73). It is difficult for a liberal to argue that harm should not be prevented, even if it requires force. But there are problems in practice with this argument when it comes to enforcement. There are three obfuscations that using the terminology of “harm” brings about.</p>
<p>First is the question of what, in the case of immigration enforcement, is meant by “harm.” In <italic>Enforcing the Rules</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2007</xref>) “harm” is defined as “all the potential negative consequences of illegal migration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2007</xref>, p. 10, para. 12). This is clearly tautological and, moreover, assumes that the “potential negative consequences of illegal migration” are not deeply contested. There is also a lack of clarity about the relation between “harm” and migration: How is the harmful outcome related to the migratory process? Are migrants more vulnerable to harm because they don’t speak the language, don’t know their rights, don’t have contacts in receiving states, for example (the argument of many NGOs)? Or is it because organized crime is involved in facilitating their movement and employment (the argument often put forward by state agencies)? With regard to immigration and enforcement, “harms” are presented as varying in seriousness from undermining public confidence in the immigration system to terrorism and security threats. This illegal immigration, it seems, harms a wide variety of types of actors: It causes harm to businesses, citizens, and the community. It also causes harm to the state by “undermining confidence in the system.” There are a wide variety of potential victims, each with different interests and agendas: the unemployed citizen struggling to get a job, the hard-pressed business playing by the rules, and migrants themselves. These latter are particularly vulnerable to harm, as victims of exploitative employers, as victims of traffickers, and (when legally resident and working) victims of other migrants who take opportunities that are rightfully theirs. Everyone, it seems is harmed somehow by illegal immigration, and it is in everyone’s interests to stop it.</p>
<p>But this then raises a second question. Compulsion may be used to “prevent harm to others,” but justifying compulsion on the grounds that it prevents harm to self is quite different:
<disp-quote>
<p>His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. . . . Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443814">Mill, 1948</xref>, p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mill’s distinction between compulsion to prevent harm to others and compulsion to prevent harm to the individuals themselves is pertinent here. There is a difference between the “harm” that is visited on migrants as victims of immigration opportunists and the harm that is visited on communities. Although one might want to argue that enforcement is necessary for the good of the community, the argument that it is necessary for the good of migrants themselves is much more difficult. Yet in the flattening of interests that the language of harm facilitates, the compulsion of particular migrants to protect the interests of those migrants is equated with compulsion of migrants to protect the interests of citizens. They are not being treated as liberal sovereign selves, with whom one should remonstrate or reason. Perhaps Mill again can give us some clues as to why this might be, as it is, of course, only members of “a civilised community” who can be so regarded: “[W]e may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443814">Mill, 1948</xref>, p. 73).</p>

<title>Disruptive Children and Migration Management</title>
<p>Although the idea of “races in their nonage” may be offensive, one group however for whom there is some consensus over the requirement to compel for their own good is children: “Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212443814">Mill, 1948</xref>, p. 73). It is reasonable to expect that immigration enforcement as harm prevention will be least controversial therefore when applied to children. Children are the subject of particular ethical concern, and this concern has been extensively promoted by liberal democratic states since the 1990s through the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). This instrument gave children specific and special rights, concretizing the notion of “global citizenship” for young people. It raised children’s rights on the political and social agendas, and the treatment of children has become a means of assessing the political and social condition of different societies and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212443814">Hart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212443814">Pupavac, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212443814">Sigona &amp; Hughes, 2010</xref>). Does this raise any contradictions for the British state, and how has harm prevention shaped the immigration agenda as applied to children?</p>
<p>It is important that the children’s rights model is based on children being nested within family members/carers, and then within “their” state, and the movement of children across international borders clearly disrupts this model. For example, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) highlights the importance of its contribution to the Fourth Millennium Goals to reduce child mortality, through its support of global vaccination and immunization programs including prophylaxis for malaria. Insecticide-treated nets are recognized by DFID as reducing mortality rates for children younger than 5 by 20%, but despite a recommendation from the children’s commissioner that these be provided for children returning to malaria-infested areas, this has not been followed up, even for those younger than 5. Although the rights of the child can be recognized internationally, when the children are non-citizens situated on state territory, this clearly becomes more problematic, even (or particularly?) it seems, when they are about to be removed.</p>
<p>Moreover, children are not the property-owning, rational, sovereign selves of liberal citizenship. As Julia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212443814">O’Connell Davidson (2005)</xref> has argued, children help fix social connections and social linkages, they are a sign of our interrelatedness rather than our self-sovereignty, and in this way they show a common unifying humanity and the limits of the market. The equal moral worth of children underscores the universal moral worth of all humans—to this extent they signal an importance beyond individuals, and we must sacrifice for our children, understood as humanity’s children, not just those related to us as individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212443814">O’Connell Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 420). Yet this means that children are difficult to incorporate into the politics and practices of citizenship even when they are not migrants, at least during the early years of childhood. Thus, while holding rights, children are not imagined as moral agents. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212443814">Pupavac (2001)</xref> puts it in her discussion of the CRC, it is the best interests of the children that are protected, not what the children say that they want.</p>
<p>At the national level the UK Government’s Every Child Matters Green Paper and the subsequent Children’s Act (2004) have transformed child welfare policies and introduced a “duty of regard for the welfare of children” to almost all state agencies. Ambiguity about the rights of migrant children was explicit in the UK government’s 1991 reservation from the CRC on the grounds of immigration and nationality. It did not agree to Articles 9 and 22 of the convention. Article 9 prevented states from separating children from their parents against their will, whereas Article 22 specifically protected asylum-seeking children, requiring that they receive “appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance.” In practice this meant that asylum-seeking children did not have the same access to support or accommodation or child welfare benefits that was granted citizen children. This was lifted after a long campaign only in 2008. As part of this process, the UKBA held a consultation process to develop a code of practice for keeping children “safe from harm,” in this case defined as meaning “ill treatment or impairment of health or development.” The UKBA does now have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under the 2009 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act. Although there continue to be important matters of policy and practice, where the UKBA is being challenged regarding children’s rights, there is at least now some framework in which children’s rights can be seen to apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212443814">Sigona &amp; Hughes, 2010</xref>). From the UKBA itself there is a recognition that
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he UK Border Agency has an important role in identifying children suffering or likely to suffer significant harm. By tackling the criminality behind child cruelty, such as human trafficking, we can help prevent abuse and neglect. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2010</xref>, p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the harm prevention agenda, three groups of children have received particular attention: “trafficked” children, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), and children in detention. Notably, the first two of these groups are alone: VoTs have usually been rescued or escaped from adults (“traffickers”) who are patently not operating in their best interests, whereas in the case of UASC there is no need to consider their relation to a “bogus asylum seeker” parent. Because these groups of children are alone this gives the state a clear role to intervene as protector. There is no conflict between the state and the parents or carers, or others acting in the child’s interests, because the latter are not present on the territory. Thus, in practice most UASC are given some kind of leave to remain. Notably, this is usually “discretionary leave to remain,” which expires when the child reaches the age of 18. The difficulty of separation of child from adult, that this is not a binary that maps on to real life, results in young people living with the knowledge of their impending removal on reaching 18, the fact that they will become an adult no longer subject to the protection of children’s rights blighting their late years of childhood and early years of youth. Children who are alone are not detained (other than in age dispute cases).</p>
<p>Child detainees reveal the difficulty, in practice of separating neatly the rights of children from those of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212443814">O’Connell Davidson, 2005</xref>, p. 420), in particular the difficulty of separating the rights of children from those of the adults that they live with. This matter has received a great deal of publicity in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and been the subject of considerable public outrage on the basis of two types of arguments: first, that whatever the parents have done, the children should not be punished; and second, that detention has long-lasting and damaging effects on children. The new government has announced that it is committed to ending the detention of children, but it is important that it has not ruled out the detention of the parents and carers of young children, only that their children will not be detained with them. Moreover, it seems that alternatives to child detention are already being piloted. The 2010 document <italic>Protecting Our Border</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2010</xref>) cites as an example of joint enforcement operations the initiation of projects that work with schools and truancy watch teams to share intelligence and data to “aid consistent support to migrant children whose families abscond or avoid immigration compliance controls” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2010</xref>, p. 18). This initiative falls under the heading of “Child Protection.”</p>

<title>Invisible Children</title>
<p>The harm agenda has had an impact then on child detention, but also on the granting of leave and protections to UASC. However, the numbers of those so identified are relatively small when compared to the numbers of those younger than 18 who actually move across borders. Indeed, more generally children are remarkable for their absence in the rhetoric around immigration control and policy. In 2007 there were an estimated 155,000 undocumented migrant children in the United Kingdom, of whom 85,000 are estimated to be UK born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212443814">Sigona &amp; Hughes, 2010</xref>). The invisibility of this group of children from the rhetoric around harm prevention points to the difficulty of its accommodating interdependence. Rather, as women were imagined as subsumed into families or trailing spouses in the academic and policy literature until the 1990s, so children are subsumed into dependents. When they have legal status, children are imagined as a subset of asylum and “family reunion” (this latter has also received surprisingly little policy or academic interest), and the particular challenges and opportunities they experience are not of much interest. Living in a household of insecure status where parents are stressed about their immigration status and the possibility of being deported is likely to have long-term impacts for family relationships and children’s development, for instance, yet this is not a subject of concern. These sorts of issues are by no means restricted to those who are illegally resident. The practice of the law has done little to challenge the dependency of children on adults for their rights to stay, and accompanied children are almost never given separate legal representation in immigration appeals. Changes in 2007 to visas for senior care workers, for example, meant that some 2,000 migrants and their dependents who had been legally resident for 4 years and were anticipating settling found that their visas were not renewed as a result of changing definitions of “skill” and associated minimum wage rates. Children who had been resident and in schooling for several years found themselves returned to their countries of birth with no right of appeal.</p>
<p>Immigration controls are not neutral, separating legal from illegal, refugees from bogus asylum seekers, and so on. Immigration controls are productive: They produce and reinforce relations of dependency and power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443814">Miles (1987)</xref> famously argued that the limitations on migrants’ entitlement to commodify their labor power that result from state-imposed restrictions (as in work permit systems) generate a form of unfree labor. Yet this crucial insight has been overlooked in the plethora of studies on migrant labor and “trafficking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212443814">O’Connell Davidson, 2010</xref>), which have focused on evil employers and traffickers. The personalized dependencies generated under such circumstances are typically imagined as a result of “illegality,” which is regarded as a key explanatory variable for understanding migrants’ vulnerability to abusive practices both in the workplace and in their daily lives. This approach means the root of the difficulties faced by undocumented migrants becomes morally reprehensible individuals who take advantage of migrants’ illegal status to exploit them in the workplace, extract extortionate rents for poor properties, demand sexual services, and so on. The role of the state in illegalizing workers is passed over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212443814">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212443814">Sciortino, 2004</xref>), giving rise to contradictions such as allowing that an employer’s threat of denunciation to the authorities may constitute evidence of “trafficking” on one hand, and immigration authorities’ preparedness to act on such denunciations for the purposes of enforcement on the other. Concern with trafficking focuses on borders and immigration controls while missing the crucial point that immigration controls produce relations of domination and subordination, thereby leaving state responsibility for the consequences of this completely out of the picture.</p>
<p>It is of course not that, were it not for immigration controls, migrant children would be independent of adults. Indeed, as has been seen, children, whatever their formal citizenship status, challenge the liberal sovereign subject precisely because of its assumptions of “independence.” However, what is indicated is that immigration controls enhance dependence and create new forms of dependencies for migrant children. The dependence of children on adults is reinforced and promulgated at a range of levels. It is apparent for example in the generalized shift within the EU citizenship from jus soli to jus sanguinis. That is, although formerly in the United Kingdom or Ireland, for example, any child born in the territory of the nation-state was automatically a citizen of that state, now citizenship is determined by the citizenship of one’s parents, usually one’s mother. Dependence on a foreign national parent can be an immigration problem even for UK national children who can be and are removed from the United Kingdom with a migrant parent. They cannot independently exercise a right to family life, and if their UK national parent does not exercise his or her parental right to be with them, they will be deported. In the case of a UK national husband and a third country national wife, the right to family life means that the spousal relationship can enable the wife to remain in the United Kingdom, but having a parental relationship to a UK national child would not be sufficient to enable her to remain. It is not possible to obtain figures on citizens younger than 18 subject to enforcement actions since this is not accommodated within the law, and for the same reason there is no mechanism for them to appeal against such actions. Even when they are legal citizens it seems that the citizenship of children is circumscribed because of their dependence on adults. In this way, when children are accompanied by carers and parents, immigration controls imagine and reinforce a hyperdependency on these adults. These adults may be abusive: Migrant children, as long as they are accompanied, may cross borders invisibly, suffer invisibly, and find themselves with no protection from abusive and violent adults. But, perhaps more commonly these adults are often themselves extremely vulnerable as a result of their immigration status. For example, what are the consequences of leaving children in the care of adults who are highly traumatized and stressed by immigration processes often for a period of several years?</p>

<sec id="section5-0002764212443814">
<title>Honest Broker?</title>
<p>Thus, as well as the question of what is harm, and the use of harm prevention to justify compulsion “for their own good,” attention to the case of children indicates a third obfuscation arising from using the justification of harm prevention that is the positioning of the state as “honest broker.” The focus on UASC and VoT not only leaves the situation of the majority of children who are affected by immigration controls out of the picture but unproblematically installs the state as the legitimate protector of children. This is of course precisely as set out under the CRC: Governments bear primary responsibility for fulfilling children’s rights. The problem for migrant children is that the immigration/citizenship status of themselves and/or their parents is often precisely what makes them vulnerable. The determining of status and its policing and enforcement, key components of their vulnerability, are the responsibilities of the state. Thus, the same body that is charged with protecting them from harm because they are children is also charged with creating and policing the boundaries between citizens and non-citizens, and with deporting them if they are found to be in breach of the law.</p>
<p>The issues this raises can be seen from this practical example from my local newspaper report headline on November 22, 2010. It purports to be about 23 “missing persons,” 18 of them asylum seekers. A police spokesperson explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>What happens with some people is they come into the country illegally and then they can be taken into criminal gangs and kept against their will and used in unlawful businesses. Whether they’re victims of crime or simply illegal immigrants, we want to trace them. Primarily it’s to make sure they’re okay and not being abused in any way. Secondly if they are here illegally they need to be dealt with by immigration services. . . . There’s no specific suggestion of trafficking, but we investigate every possibility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212443814">Allen, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So readers were urged to use the photographs to identify the people concerned because they might be at risk of harm. All of the missing asylum seekers were children approaching 18 or just older than 18, many of them had been in local authority care. Given the policy of removing UASC when they reach the age of majority, it is not unrealistic to expect that they might have a reason for disappearing from the authorities at this particular stage in their lives. This is not to deny that they might be vulnerable to being exploited by unlawful businesses; indeed, they might join that group of “vulnerable and often desperate people” whose plight was highlighted by John Reid in the ministerial foreword quoted above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443814">Home Office, 2007</xref>), migrants who are working illegally and who are grossly exploited. But their “deportability” is the key factor in making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. At the same time as allowing that “threats of deportation through reporting status to the authorities” may constitute evidence of trafficking, the state will also enforce these deportations to not attract abusive claims. Presumably they are worried about “bogus slaves.” In the language of “harm prevention,” the role of the state in producing vulnerability is invisibilized in favor of its role as a protector.</p>
<p>This is the case not just for these 18-year-olds. There are a number of information and publicity campaigns that are concerned to sensitize the public to signs of trafficking. The “Blue Blindfold Campaign,” for example, urges people to “open your eyes and know the signs.” Clues to modern-day slavery include “foreign nationals doing farm or factory work” and “minibuses pick up non-UK nationals at unusual hours of the day and night.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764212443814">5</xref></sup> If people see signs like this, they should report it, and they can do so anonymously to a police help line. The police “need the eyes and ears of the public.” Notably, this is not depicted as reporting concerns about illegal working and immigration, and people are encouraged to report even the slightest suspicion on the grounds that, when it comes to slavery, it is better to be safe than sorry. Thus, concerns for the rights of migrants are mobilized for the purposes of immigration enforcement in a kind of home-orientated “humanitarian intervention.” It is important that they are not mobilized for the purposes of the enforcement of employment protections, which would be to the benefit of both migrants and citizens. The enforcement of employment protections, for all the calls for British jobs for British workers, is significantly less funded than immigration enforcement. Compare the 2009–2010 projected costs for the enforcement of the national minimum wage—£8.8 million, with the budget for in-country immigration control (work permits, points-based system, removals, asylum procedures) of £884.3 million. The national minimum wage had 93 compliance officers in 2009. Compare this to the proposed number of UKBA staff for LITs at 7,500.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The argument that immigration enforcement can be a means of harm prevention and protection for migrants as well as citizens was promoted by the previous Labour government in the United Kingdom, and it seems set to continue. Although the ethics of migration management, who is allowed entry and who is not, may seem important, but perhaps rather removed from the daily lives of citizens, the ethical questions raised by enforcement are both different and more clearly related to their relationships and concerns. Relations of dependency and power are infiltrating everyday practice as the UK government seeks to decentralize and localize enforcement. The prevention of harm to migrants is a poor basis on which to try to develop “ethically comfortable” enforcement mechanisms: it relies on an idea of harm that is so vague as to be platitudinous, it equates compulsion for the good of others with compulsion for your own good, and it invisibilizes the role of the state and immigration and citizenship legislation and practice in reinforcing dependencies and vulnerabilities. The reinscription of the state as the legitimate protector of migrants’ rights that is facilitated through anti-trafficking concerns is deeply problematic. The language of harm and of trafficking suggests that migrants are a special case whose vulnerabilities are different from those of citizens. But one of the key sources of increased vulnerability for migrants lies in their subjection to immigration controls. To suggest that further immigration controls and policing is the solution is missing the point. There is ample empirical evidence that, in the United Kingdom at least, certain groups of migrants fear state intrusion and offers of protection because of their immigration status—even when they are not resident illegally. Rather than rescuing people because we know best, it might be better to regard migrants as sovereign selves who are driven, by state laws and practices, into excessive dependencies, on individuals who can thereby do them harm. The state has, at the very least, a responsibility to recognize the role of immigration and citizenship in creating imbalances of power.</p>

<p>The foreword goes on, But, equally importantly, the fact that many immigrants, at the end of their journey, end up in shadowy jobs in the grey economy undermines the terms and working conditions of British workers. That’s not fair. It chips away at the social contract and fabric of our country. Resentment of it breeds discontent and racism. This is especially keenly felt among those who believe they are not getting the economic or social opportunities they should because others, who have flouted the rules and often the law, seem to be getting on ahead of them. That’s not fair either. (p. 2)</p></fn>
