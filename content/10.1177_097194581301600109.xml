<p>The history of the English parliament has usually been dated back to the thirteenth century—the time, when the word ‘parliament’ (= p.) came into use for certain councils convened by the king. When in 1236 the counsel of Henry III was enlarged by summoning the archbishops of Canterbury and York, other bishops, abbots, earls and barons, modern historians assumed the birth of p. to have taken place (cf. R.L. Storey, ‘Parlament, Parliament, II. England’, <italic>Lexikon des Mittelalters</italic>, vol. 6, 2000: 1723–1725, here 1723). Were they wrong? John Robert Maddicott (= M.) goes much further back in the English history stating the origins of p. to lie already in the tenth century. The accession of King Æthelstan in 924, and the deposition of King Edward II in 1327 mark the bounds of his subject. M. argues that on the one hand national assemblies took place under the reign of Æthelstan for the first time, and on the other hand great councils evolved into the ‘fully formed medieval parliament’ (p. vii) under Edward’s rule.</p>
<p>The book’s first chapter, ‘Genesis’ (pp. 1–56), deals with the organisational matters and functions of the early assemblies until the eve of Norman Conquest. Given the leader’s/king’s ‘counsel with his great men’ (p. 1) as the literal origins of the English (and every other) p., the author analyses the early English assemblies’ size, composition, times, proceedings and places. Following M., ‘from Æthelstan’s accession […] to Edward the Confessor’s death […] central assemblies summoned by the king played a crucial part in the management of the English polity’, and can be seen as an adoption and preservation of the early Germanic tradition of incorporating besides the great men ‘others less great […] into the government of the realm’ (p. 49). And although central assemblies in the pre-Conquest period did not always include the less great men, those assembled, called the ‘witan’, were seen to stand for a whole people, the English, and were ‘regarded as representing the nation and its consent as binding on all men’ (pp. 52, 54). M. convincingly describes Æthelstan as the initiator of frequent, regular, large and socially diverse composed assemblies (pp. 4–18), and points out two main classifications of their functions: charisma and consensus. Concerning the first one, impressively shown through festal crown wearing, again Æthelstan seems to have been the inventor. At least for the English kingdom for he had very close connections to what M. calls ‘Germany’ (which is up to the late eleventh century a very problematic term for that part of the Roman Empire ruled by the eastern successors of Charlemagne) he was most probably influenced by the Carolingian-Ottonian practice of crown wearing (pp. 20–21). ‘The promotion of consensus between the king and his great men’ is what M. calls the even ‘more latent purpose of assemblies’ (p. 23). At such occasions not only social tensions were solved within a framework of feasting, conversation, gift-giving and patronage, but also justice, legislation and other political decisions were made—indeed consensually by the king and those assembled (pp. 27–31).</p>
<p>Although not all successors of Æthelstan continued with the consensual business of law-making at assemblies, William I, the first protagonist of the second chapter (pp. 57–105), appropriated the conciliar tradition ‘in the interests both of efficient government and of his own legitimate standing as Edward’s rightful heir’ (p. 57). He helped crown-wearing at festal assemblies to new prominence, and rebuilt legislation, policy-making and justice on consensus (p. 61). Interrupted by the reign of Stephen of Blois (1135–54) conciliar legislation, discussion and jurisdiction at assemblies continued in the period from 1066 to 1189 (p. 68). Dealing not just with changing times and places of royal assemblies, the author analyses the terms used to describe these gatherings. While the name ‘concilium’ was central by Henry II’s day, under his rule the French vocable ‘parlement’ occurs for the first time ‘to denote a council of king and magnates’ (p. 75). But M. states that the most significant change in the period was the emphasis of a feudal vassal’s duty to render his lord consilium et auxilium, when continental feudal concepts were transferred to England with the Conquest (pp. 76–77). Appearance at royal councils was, therefore, not just the privilege of being summoned, but became also (if they were summoned) the obliged way for the king’s tenants-in-chief to fulfil their duty to give counsel—initially a vassal’s duty, later his right. So the occasional participation of small landholders in central assemblies, what M. calls a ‘distinguishing feature of the later English parliament’, had already emerged in the twelfth century (pp. 77, 86). He shows that to give counsel to the king could be in the interest of both, kings and tenants; last but not least for the creation of ‘social harmony and political consensus’ (p. 96). At the end of the chapter’s period (1188) an enhancement of conciliar business is remarkable that finally led to the council’s transformation into parliaments, as M. put it—consent to taxation (p. 102).</p>
<p>After the first authorisation of a direct tax ‘by common counsel’ (p.102), the Saladin Tithe of 1188 for the support of Henry II’s scheduled crusade, direct taxation became ‘irrevocably [dependent] on conciliar consent’ in 1225 (p. 119), which is described by M. at the beginning of his third chapter (pp. 106–56). From the third to the sixth chapter the author analyses the development of conciliar business until the deposition of King Edward II in 1327, by examining the evolution of p. out of itself (e.g., in the time of magnate assemblies during Henry III’s minority), every king’s or ruler’s (i.e., Simon de Montfort’s) attitude towards councils and his tenants in general, the composition of the known councils and the history of social groups which would later form the two Houses of Parliament—the Commons and the Lords. So M.’s research reveals the establishment of the word ‘parliament’ in the mid 1230s, the rise of the elected knights of the shire as representatives of their constituents, the successive incorporation of the burgesses’ representatives into p., frequent demands on taxes attended by conflicts between king and p., the practice of royal concessions in order to obtain consent for taxation, growing publicity of the p. in the provinces and the emergence of the petitioning system in the late twelfth century. In 1327 p. ‘provided both the setting and the mechanism for the transfer of power from the old to the new king’, when Edward II was deposed and his son crowned (p. 359). Although these actions were initiated by a group of magnates, ‘the authority conferred by their [i.e., the commons’] presence and assent was seen as essential to the act’s validation’ (p. 363).</p>
<p>The seventh chapter is dedicated to the peculiarities of the English p. Especially in comparison with that of France, but also with other European realms. M. points out that (<italic>i</italic>) England was the exception while in other western European kingdoms a decline of assemblies after the Carolingians demise had been observed (p. 381) and therefore already over a century before the Norman Conquest councils were ‘essential to the workings of the English state [and] established as law-making assemblies’, which because of the ‘general weakness of regional sentiments and affiliations […] in their social, judicial, and political roles, faced no provincial or private rivals’ (p. 393); (<italic>ii</italic>) no other European realm possessed the equivalent of Magna Carta ‘to serve as a permanent pole of attraction for all the ruler’s subjects […] who came to see themselves as constituting a communitas unknown elsewhere’ (p. 439); (<italic>iii</italic>) the English nobility was in contrast to the often exempt continental nobilities under taxation (pp. 417–31); (<italic>iv</italic>) because of the financial instability of the crown, English assemblies won a ‘novel authority in bargaining with the crown, expressing popular grievances, and, on occasion, putting the weight of the king’s subjects’ money behind the king’s politics’ in their ‘new responsibilities in the granting or denial of taxation’ (p. 394) far earlier than in France. One must agree with M. when he states that a privilege of exemption from taxes was of less value than the right to consent to direct taxation. It was taxation what M. regards to be the reason for the transformation of a council with mainly advisory functions into a powerful p., whose consent was essential for grants and whose members—by 1327 magnates, knights and burgesses—were representatives of the English people (pp. 407–17).</p>
<p>After a conclusion of the final chapter and also of the study itself (pp. 440–53), not just the obligatory bibliography but also a list of great councils and parliaments, 1235–57, and a comprehensive index completes the book. The reader could be disappointed that the history of knights, magnates or burgesses in relation with the p. in a cohesive chapter are not easily grasped or he might miss a compact chapter concerning Magna Carta, but although important, these particular topics were not the actual subject of M.’s study. Attempting to prove continuities in a conciliar tradition from 924 to 1327 he had to examine his subject chronologically.</p>
<p>John Robert Maddicott’s book is a valuable, persuasive and magisterial study that clarifies the early origins of the English p. and proves them to date back actually to the tenth century. Although the term ‘parliament’ emerges quite late and although the composition and the functions of assemblies had to evolve into what the late medieval p. represented, there have been significant continuities from the witan of the Anglo-Saxon period via the great councils of post-Conquest England to the p. of the thirteenth century and beyond. The reviewed volume is highly recommendable for both scholars and students of medieval history, who are at least familiar with the basics of English history between the twelfth and the fourteenth century.</p>
