<p>In his undisputed New Testament letter to the Galatians, Paul states: “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male or female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus” (3:28, New Revised Standard Version‗. This verse has become a cornerstone for some feminist interpretations of Christian origins. For example, Elizabeth Schüssler Fiorenza is convinced that this verse reflects the earliest attitudes about women in nascent Christianity, namely an “egalitarian Christian self-understanding” that “did away with all male privileges of religion, class and caste” (<italic>In Memory of Her</italic> [New York: Crossroad, 1983], 218‗. Hogan’s study of Galatians 3:28 in the early Christian textual tradition reveals that it was not used in this way in earliest Christianity. In this refreshing historical investigation, Hogan pursues two avenues of inquiry. First, she traces the phrase “no longer male or female” from Paul’s inclusion in the baptismal formula in Galatians 3:28 through to the Christian writers of the fourth century (before Augustine‗. Second, since these writers rarely cite this verse when discussing the social and communal roles of women, she also examines their attitudes about women’s roles and how these particular authors perceived women’s social and spiritual identity in the Christian community.</p>
<p>One of Hogan’s driving questions is, how did writers deal with the cognitive dissonance created by the notion of “no longer male or female” in Christ alongside the common Aristotelian notion that women were innately inferior to men? In general, early Christian writers related the idea of “no longer male or female” to an understanding of Christian unity and/or to a transformation toward Christian perfection, in this life or the next. Other than a fourth-century reference which condemns the use of this verse to justify female leadership in the heterodox New Prophecy (Montanist‗ movement, there is little evidence that Galatians 3:28 influenced male and female social relationships or women’s public leadership positions. Thus, Hogan suggests that a modern interpretation like that of Fiorenza says more about our own assumptions than it does about those of the early Christians.</p>
<p>As Hogan details the development of perceptions of women’s roles and spiritual capacity, she is careful to note the particular setting of the text and/or personal experiences of each writer, as far as it is possible. In this way, she observes recurrent themes (e.g., the inferiority of the female gender, gender and spirituality, and celibacy‗ within the social and theological context of each writer.</p>
<p>In the second century, female martyrs like Perpetua and Thecla were sometimes depicted as men or as exhibiting male traits when they became “like Christ.” In this way, they were thought to have overcome their inferior femaleness. Second-century Gnostic texts emphasized primal androgyny, the notion that humans began and will return to a genderless state. They promoted celibacy as a means of reaching spiritual perfection. Some later orthodox writers, like third-century Origen, thought celibacy was the best path to spiritual maturity. For Ambrose, writing in the fourth century, women could overcome their bodily imperfection as women through celibacy.</p>
<p>Other writers were more positive about women’s spiritual potential, but such ideas did not translate into social equality. For Clement of Alexandria in the third century, men and women had the same capacity for moral courage and equal access to God because they had the same human nature. For Tertullian, although men and women would be equal in the resurrection, social hierarchy in this life was to remain intact. In the fourth century, Basil of Caesarea, his friend Gregory of Nazianzus and his brother Gregory of Nyssa, expressed positive sentiments about strong, spiritual women in their own families, and did not consider marriage a hindrance to female spirituality. Gregory of Nyssa held that God was not gendered, and Christians would be restored to a non-gendered state in the afterlife. Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus thought that women were spiritually and intellectually equal to men, and had the same capacity for virtue as men. These sentiments related to the spiritual rather than the social sphere.</p>
<p>Hogan convincingly points out how social distinctions between men and women were part of the ancient mindset; however, more attention to ancient Mediterranean cultural ideas of honor, modesty and public reputation as they appear in these texts would have been fruitful, especially since they were texts meant for public hearing. Nevertheless, Hogan is successful in describing how different early Christian writers’ ideas about Galatians 3:28 and women’s roles are from our own.</p>
<p>This book will be of interest to students and researchers of religion interested in the study of women, social constructions of gender, and celibacy in Christian origins and in Patristics, as well as those interested in feminist theology. It is wonderfully accessible to non-specialists of the patristic era.</p>
