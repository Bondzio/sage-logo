<p>Three media studies scholars who are very well known for their works on television history, Michele Hilmes, Horace Newcomb, and Eileen Meehan, were invited to speak on a plenary panel that discusses what television was and what we can learn from its past. Michele Hilmes talks about how television is “radio with pictures,” Horace Newcomb talks about early television studies and the Peabody Awards, and Eileen Meehan talks about the “known unknowns” regarding television’s past. This is the transcript of the panel discussion.</p>

<title>The Future of Television Is Radio’s Past: Let’s Go Back to the Future</title>
<p>It is interesting to be at a “What is Television” conference, cast as <italic>the past</italic>—are we radio scholars the ghosts of television’s past, come back to haunt you, rattling our chains? More hopefully, what we radio scholars might provide is a glimpse at television’s past that illuminates the present, to expose new aspects of what we’re talking about here more generally, which is the future.</p>
<p>So I’m going to make an initial statement that may make some people roll their eyes—both because a number of you will expect me to say exactly this sort of thing and also because it might seem rather dusty or trite, a vision rejected long ago: What is TV? TV is radio with pictures.</p>
<p>Let me explain. So far, in our discussions of the future of television, we’ve spent a lot of time on digital media, print media has come up quite a bit, and we’ve discussed film. I think I heard radio mentioned twice, and only in passing, throughout all these discussions. And of course, most published histories of television begin with that technology’s introduction in the late 1940s. That’s a good textbook example of technological determinism since it has been well established that most of the basic decisions that set up the structures of what we call television—the commercial model, the program forms, the practices, the audience habits—happened not in the 1940s or 1950s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, with radio. So, to understand how television will evolve in the future, perhaps we should first try to acknowledge its formal and institutional past and not be blinded by technology.</p>
<p>Because the early period of television’s history—that is, the radio era—evokes the current period of television’s transformation much more closely than the intervening decades of television’s predominance. I’m going to focus on three aspects of radio, established early on, that mark, I argue, where television is heading today. They are (a) dispersed distribution, (b) seriality, and (c) the centrality of sound. All were characteristics of the earlier period, all were rejected or dismissed during the period of network television, and all have returned to significance today. A better understanding of these three basic tendencies of electronic media, ignored for so long, might help us chart our way into the digital future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0196859912459749">
<title>Dispersed Distribution</title>
<p>The first two decades of radio, in particular, were quite unlike the centralized national medium that TV became in the 1960s. Early broadcasting was much more diverse, dispersed, and differentiated that many histories give it credit for. Hundreds, then thousands of stations went on the air, network affiliations were loose and easily altered, many alternative live and syndicated networks existed, like Mutual, but there were also many regional and ad hoc networks supplying all kinds of programs, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859912459749">Alex Russo (2010)</xref> argues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912459749">Elena Razlogova (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859912459749">David Goodman (2012)</xref> show us that a far greater variety of listening practices were available than usually acknowledged, practices that had more interactive relationships with communities and audiences. Even network program schedules were less homogenized and tightly controlled than they later became. Plus, the sites of radio’s production were diffuse and scattered. Radio programs were created by ad agencies, by independent production companies, by existing theatrical, arts and information groups. And there was far more sustaining programming on both networks and local stations than there would be later: often, shows produced by educational and cultural organizations (local and national) and aired without commercials.</p>
<p>Additionally, localism thrived on radio to a degree never approximated by television. While nationalizing forces, like networks, wielded considerable power, alternatives to them flourished among the continually expanding number and types of stations scattered across the country. By 1940, 765 AM stations were on the air; only 194 were NBC and CBS affiliates. Accounts like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859912459749">Robert McChesney’s (1995)</xref> emphasize the growing power of networks, and that is true enough, but they seriously misrepresent the continuing growth of the educational and independent sector, especially after FM set asides in 1945—the number of stations on the air had exploded to more than 2,500 by 1949, more than 700 of them on the FM band. My recent research on the U.S./BBC relationship in broadcasting had the unexpected effect of opening up this public sector to me—due to the close relationship U.S. educational broadcasters had with BBC—and conversely revealing the commercial side of British public service broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912459749">Hilmes, 2011</xref>). This is a counterhistory well worth knowing.</p>
<p>In short, early radio was diverse, dispersed, and interactive—far more similar to the dispersed digital platforms today than the centralized television network system of 1960s through 1990s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0196859912459749">
<title>Seriality</title>
<p>The second element linking radio’s past to television’s future is seriality. I’m lucky here because a lot of my points were made this morning very eloquently by Bryce Zabel, who was talking about what he called “binge TV”—the kind of long-form dramatic television program that holds viewers across weeks and months and seasons, and takes them to online sites and DVDs. As he pointed out, binge TV is serial TV. Seriality has been part of mediated communication forever—newspapers, magazines, serial novels. Up until the 20th century, authors made far more money publishing their novels in magazines and in other kinds of serial distribution than they did through book sales; serial distribution was the tail that wagged the dog. Not until the early 20th century did single novel publishing became the dominant standard.</p>
<p>But what an amazing thing radio did in the 1920s and 1930s for seriality. Radio became the biggest booster of serial structures of expression since the advent of the penny press. Radio took the serial form and raised it to an art form in its own right. As publishers in their dispersed environment well knew, seriality possesses powers to pull together an audience over time and attach it to a property or authorial source. There was nothing inherent in radio that mandated that serial presentation would become its backbone. Not at all: if you study the history of the BBC you will find that seriality was adamantly resisted there until the late 1930s. Val Gielgud, the BBC’s head of drama for 30 years, viewed serial drama as an inherently lowbrow cultural form, good only for entrancing the lower classes and women, and detrimental to any serious art. U.S. television in its earliest years echoed this vision with its insistence on live anthology forms, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912459749">William Boddy (1990)</xref> has described; radio’s seriality was rejected in favor of more respectable stand-alone, short form programs. (That only lasted until the networks had securely captured the TV business in the 1960s; then, it became seriality as usual, though usually of the episodic type.)</p>
<p>Today, one key difference between television and other media, as several speakers here have pointed out, is long form versus short form media. Long form means seriality, and not episodic seriality as practiced during television’s classic network period, but continuous, drawn-out narratives, like the radio soaps. Television serial drama today can expand over weeks and months and seasons better than any other medium, with deeper character development, more complex plots, more time to tell a complicated and evolving story. We are now in the era of long-form media. Not that short-form media like films and stand-alone programs no longer exist, but media producers have realized that in this dispersed digital age, long-form narratives are the best bet for constituting a regular and consistent audience and holding them together over time, for creating brand identity and for organizing expectations.</p>
<p>Long-form seriality is the glue that has replaced the centralized institutions of network television’s heyday, just like it did when radio set the terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0196859912459749">
<title>Sound—On Screens</title>
<p>It should not be surprising, finally, that another aspect of this moment of transformation should be the return to prominence of sound—this time, as a screen-based medium. As we all began accessing most of our media experiences through various screens—iPods, iPads, computers—and as sound media cross platforms to become visualized via these devices too, it is no coincidence that sound has taken on a newly central role in media consumption and production. Programs today centrally feature music, using the soundtrack to attract viewers, promote new artists, create a brand identity around a series. Music supervisors have become the new powers-that-be behind television production (as well as film). Music and visuals have become more closely related than ever before, not least, I argue, because we now access our music, our TV, our movies, our radio through the same devices, on the same screens. The rise of mobile media means that both pictures and sound come through on our smartphone screens, our MP3 players, our tablets, as well as our computer screens. It used to be said that television would integrate computer capacities into its universe (remember Web TV?), but much more likely now is that computer technology will subsume television while it’s busy fretting about free downloads—Apple TV is in the wings, and will soon be in the house.</p>
<p>The central place of sound in the digital universe is further demonstrated by the fact that public radio is one of the few traditional media sectors experiencing significant growth, thanks to the creative lead that it took integrating sound and graphic/visual media on its digital platforms. And a tremendously vital independent sound production sector has arisen via online access, including podcasts. This digital revolution has produced some of the first nationally—even globally—recognized long-form sound programs heard on U.S. radio in 50 years, like <italic>This American Life, Radiolab</italic>, and <italic>Studio 360</italic>. But don’t just listen, go to their web sites—these screens are integral, dynamic, a part of the total experience, completely integrated with the sound.</p>
<p>So, sound is a now screen medium, on a par via digital access with visual and textual information. Television has not yet been able to match this convergence. The television industry has been one of the slowest to move fully onto digital platforms, while everywhere other media sectors are taking full advantage of the current integration of sound and screen. Television needs to take a page out of radio’s book, so to speak. Integrated with text, graphics, and music in a dispersed digital landscape, the future of television looks a lot more like early radio than it does the glory days of either the studio system or the national networks. Radio’s seriality became the backbone of television, and we access our long-form narratives now on dispersed and mobile screens, using graphic and sonic interfaces, headphones on ears, from a wide variety of producers and across different platforms.</p>
<p>What is television today, as we look toward the future? It is dispersed serial narratives, combining sound, pictures, and text, on screen interfaces.</p>
<p>It is radio with pictures.</p>

<title>Horace Newcomb</title>
<p>Let me begin by saying I have never considered myself a historian. In part this is because I am sometimes puzzled about the usefulness of the enterprise. Of course we all remember George Santayana’s famous comment, often paraphrased differently: “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” This is usually offered as a reason for studying history, and frequently, by authors, for writing it. My response, however, is that those who <italic>do</italic> remember the past are also condemned to repeat it. As the book of Ecclesiastes (1:9) says, “there’s nothing new under the sun.” While we’re comfortable with the familiar “nothing new” line, it’s more difficult to read the earlier part of that sentence. “What has been done is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done.” Or, in another verse, “That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been” (Ecc 3:15).</p>
<p>So far I have not attempted to write anything substantial that I would call “history” because I fear the process could become endless and endlessly frustrating, arranging and rearranging material one knows to be incomplete and always skewed in some fashion.</p>
<p>With all these qualifications and reservations in mind, I can assume three possible reasons for being a designated historian for our purposes here. The first is probably the most obvious. I’m old enough to remember the early days of television, especially the transition from radio to television. Related to this is that I have been writing about television since the late 1960s, which makes things I wrote then look like history now. Indeed, I have heard that <italic>TV: The Most Popular Art</italic> (<italic>TVMPA</italic>) can be used as a description (remember, partial, flawed, and skewed), of television in the 1950s and 1960s. Written between 1971 and 1974 and published in late 1974, the book does contain a good many descriptions and plot summaries that could be useful to others—assuming they recognize that without the service of VHS or DVR or DVD these summaries and descriptions were all written from my memory of those shows. Seven editions of <italic>Television: The Critical View</italic>, from 1976 through 2007, also contain many descriptions and as with <italic>The Most Popular Art</italic>, contain many strong arguments about the programs described there.</p>
<p>A second reason for my placement on this panel is likely the work done in editing the <italic>Museum of Broadcast Communications Encyclopedia of Television</italic>. With that effort I learned, from more than 300 authors, a great deal more history of the medium than I possessed. The third reason is perhaps my present position with the Peabody Awards. In that capacity I work very closely with the archivists in the Walter J. Brown Media Archive and Peabody Awards Collection in the University of Georgia Library. This archive recently moved into a new state of the art building. There, our fragile collection of film and video and audiotape, CDs, DVDs, Pods and hard drives receive the utmost care. This is important because the Peabody television collection alone holds more than 50,000 titles, with “title” often referring to complete annual series of television entertainment. This is the third largest television archive in the United States, following only the Library of Congress and UCLA’s Film and Television Archive, and I will refer only to the television materials today despite the presence of a massive radio collection.</p>
<p>This is a truly unique collection. It comprises works selected by producers, stations, networks, and individuals as their most outstanding work from the previous calendar year. We are currently in the midst of evaluating more than 1,000 entries for the year 2011. The entries cross all forms, from entertainment to public service, documentary to children’s programming, news and information, and so on. The archive undoubtedly holds the most extensive collection of local U.S. television programming in the country. Though the bulk of these local works are from news organizations, we also hold early local children’s and educational programs, teen dance programs, and local documentaries. The Peabody Archive is a treasure for social and cultural historians seeking mediated materials to complement other sources. But in many ways, it is also a history, from 1940 to the present, of broadcasting, cable distribution and, lately, webcasting. Though the great majority of holdings are United States in origin, it is also international in scope, with more and more international entries each year. Drawing on some aspects of this great collection I know, finally, you may be saying, address our topic directly: “What Is Television?”</p>
<p>I have puzzled over this question for many years, since the seams of the three (four if you count public television), began to stretch and unravel. The coming of the FOX network and the first slow, then explosive, expansion of cable offerings shattered my notion of a coherent definition of television. When Paul Hirsch and I published “Television as a Cultural Forum: Implications for Research,” in 1983, we assumed we had adequately, though certainly not sufficiently, described and defined “television.” The article was meant as a response, a challenge, to what we considered narrow and incomplete explanations. The premise was very simple. Television programming and content are more complicated, more complex than political economy, effects research, the Frankfort School and American culture critics like Dwight McDonald believed or demonstrated. And though I flee from audience research even more swiftly than from history, we asserted that audiences make many meanings from the meanings offered in television content. None of this should be taken as abandoning the contributions of political economy, or the Frankfort School—though it may be more of a challenge to effects research. We tried hard to make it clear that all this complexity and freedom operated within political and economic constraints. We referred to television as a central storytelling medium for the culture and society, what David Thorburn refers to as “consensus narrative.” But consensus does not mean uncritical, without ambiguity, without means of questioning conventions and practices. Rather, it suggests the presence of multiple perspectives bound together yet simultaneously challenged. In our view at that time it was precisely this commonly available, commonly known set of arrangements—economic, social, and cultural—that defined “television.” The “what is” question had not come to the fore.</p>
<p>What happens, then, when the “forum” is shattered, when there are multiple fora, each addressing more specifically defined viewers, when there are more and more distribution channels, some defined more and appealing more to viewers by ideology than by anything commonly shared. To some degree these developments drive the question before us.</p>
<p>Yet this new, fragmented, and segmented version of “television” is developing in tandem with other features. Somewhat paradoxically, it is now easier than ever to consider the history of television. Much of that history is now no longer exclusively in the past. Much of what we so easily referred to as ephemeral is with us, at hand, easily accessed. We have Hulu. We have nostalgia sets of DVDs. We have many forms of illegal downloads. I appreciate all of these. I can now check, in some cases, to see if the memories I used in <italic>TVMPA</italic> were relatively accurate.</p>
<p>Among the most important of these resources for me are services used by local television station digital ancillary channels. Various groups have realized that there is money to be made with history. Enlarging, and in some ways reinventing the syndication model, Retro TV, Me-TV, and other services make available a substantial range of earlier programming.</p>
<p>WSB in Atlanta, for example, offers me much of what I still consider “my” television. This is the programming that started my fascination and scholarly concerns with prime time entertainment TV, which led to arguments that this is the most significant storytelling invention ever conceived, a means of storytelling that shatters the Aristotelian dictum that all good stories have beginnings, middles, and ends. In his seminal 1976 essay, “Television Melodrama,” David Thorburn told us that the system of reruns constitutes a museum of sorts. That museum, that archive, is now exponentially expanded. But how do we understand this “history?” How do we use it as history? What does it suggest as an answer to What is Television?</p>
<p>One of my all-time personal favorite television programs, one I have written about, one that exemplifies some features that suggested the forum model is <italic>Route 66</italic>. The series ran from 1960 to 1963, presenting 116 episodes, almost all written by cocreator Sterling Silliphant, almost all shot on locations in 25 different states. Silliphant described his creation as “a show about a statement of existence, closer to Sartre or Kafka than to anything else” (quoted in Alvey, <italic>Route 66</italic>, 2004, p. 1966). With considerably less self-congratulation but equal enthusiasm, Mark Alvey suggests “The unrest at the core of the series echoed that of the Beats—especially Jack Kerouac’s <italic>On the Road</italic>, of course—and anticipated the even more disaffected searchers of <italic>Easy Rider</italic>” (Alvey, 2004, p. 1966).</p>
<p>If we study this single program as part of a “history project,” what strategies might be in order? Certainly, we can examine episodes of <italic>Route 66</italic> to study issues and treatments of issues, television aesthetics of a particular sort, and so on. But we can also examine the show in the context of other television programming of its time, the schedule. The series ranked number 30 in its first year, 1960—with a 21.7 rating. <italic>Gunsmoke</italic> was number 1, at 37.3. Between the two were many Westerns. Another of my favorites, <italic>Have Gun, Will Travel</italic> was number 3; the <italic>Andy Griffith Show</italic> was number 4. <italic>The Ed Sullivan Show, The Flintstones, What’s My Line</italic>, were scattered in the top thirty that year. <italic>Route 66</italic> didn’t show up in 1961-1962, but <italic>The Defenders</italic>, a major legal series that covered every aspect of social justice issues was at number 26 with a 22.4 rating. <italic>Sing Along with Mitch</italic> was at number 15, tied with <italic>Lassie. Route 66</italic> showed again at number 27 in the 1962-1963 season. We can now examine many of these programs in a manner that would allow for far greater richness, complexity, and subtlety than the textual analyses of an earlier period allowed. We have more details. We have machines that allow us to “read” closely, moving forward and backward. What does <italic>Route 66</italic> “mean” and tell us about what “television” meant in the context of the schedule, examined as history? But consider now another mode of historical comparison.</p>
<p>If I turn to the online catalogue of the Peabody Awards Archive, I can search by year and retrieve 198 titles broadcast in 1960, each program described with at least some minimal information and some with a great deal. There I find documentaries, news programs, specials, entertainment work, children’s programming, the bulk of it from local stations. <italic>It’s Academic</italic>, from WRC-TV in Washington. <italic>Communist Expose</italic>, from WCKT, Miami. <italic>Focus Berlin</italic>, from the U.S. Information Agency. <italic>Baseball’s Greatest Dynasty</italic>, KPIX, San Francisco. <italic>Ben Casey: A Certain Time of Darkness</italic>, ABC. <italic>The Bullwinkle Show</italic>, NBC. <italic>Bell and Howell Closeup: Walk in My Shoes</italic>, ABC. <italic>The Eichmann Trial</italic>, WABC, New York. <italic>General Electric Theatre: The Dropout</italic>, CBS.</p>
<p>We could examine <italic>Route 66</italic> and perhaps the entire prime time schedule in light of such programming. And even then we would be touching only a small slice of what was available to some viewers nationally and what addressed viewers in specific communities directly. These comparisons capture certain elements, offer material for comparative analysis, provide insight into industry structures and strategies, even into notions and definitions of quality. But is that all there is to history? Is that all there is to context? Does that tell us what television was, or what it has become?</p>
<p>I will conclude with another form of the past. As I did when first writing about the medium, I continue to rely on memory. I consider history to be memory tutored, educated, analyzed, polished, smoothed over. Therein lies the great value of history. It enables us to see more clearly. But I continue to appreciate the other personal, angular, flawed, blurred, myopic features of memory.</p>
<p>So it may be difficult to describe for you, for you to understand what a television program like <italic>Route 66</italic> might have meant to a group of high school seniors in a small high school in Mississippi in 1960. It was a group reading Kerouac, listening to Dylan and Stravinsky and the Dave Brubeck Quartet’s “Take Five,” or more often arguing the relative merits of “Blue Rondo a la Turk” when compared with “Take Five.” Watching <italic>Peter Gunn</italic> and <italic>La Dolce Vita</italic> as well as <italic>Route 66</italic>. And all of this caught up in the swirl of the Civil Rights Movement taking place outside our doors and the emergence of the other great historical event that marked our lives from that time forward. In the Peabody Archive I find 52 items dealing with Vietnam submitted for review between 1962 and 1969, including one already entitled, <italic>The 20-Year War</italic>.</p>
<p>In 1963 one of the original stars of <italic>Route 66</italic> left the show following a dispute with the network. A character who portrayed a Vietnam veteran replaced him. Remember, 1963. In his introductory episode he experienced, in a very violent manner, a manner we would now recognize as “realistic,” what we today refer to as Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome. Vietnam, 1963. PTSD. So far as I can determine this is the earliest commentary on the war in an entertainment series.</p>
<p>In his essay on the series in the <italic>Encyclopedia of Television</italic>, Mark Alvey goes on to capture more of the sense of this great series:<disp-quote>
<p>The show’s rejection of domesticity in favor of rootlessness formed a rather startling counterpoint to the dominant prime-time landscape of home and family in the 1960s, as did the majority of the characters encountered on the road. The more hopeful dimension of <italic>Route 66</italic> coincided with the optimism of the New Frontier circa 1960, with these wandering Samaritans symbolic of the era’s new spirit of activism. Premiering at the dawn of a new decade, <italic>Route 66</italic> captured in a singular way the nation’s passage from the disquiet of the 1950s to the turbulence of the 1960s, expressing a simultaneously troubled and hopeful vision of the United States. (p. 1966)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is an adequate, though partial description of the worlds in which those high school seniors viewed <italic>Route 66</italic>, then talked about it along with those other cultural artifacts in their “home room” hours. Activism, turbulence, disquiet, hope, trouble. For some, though not all of us, the shattering of domesticity, the need to wander would become a defining characteristic with lifelong consequences.</p>
<p>What I want to suggest with all these various points of entry into a single television program, or for that matter, into a schedule or a network or a cable system or the corporations that monitor and seek, unsuccessfully in my view, to control them is that to answer the question that brings us here we must examine very closely the personal, social, and cultural arrangements made possible by whatever we call television. Those conditions vary historically to some degree. They vary among individuals. They even vary within individuals, for we may always have had multiple ways of living with television. Today, those ways may be multiplied yet more fiercely, varying from screen to screen, connection to connection. Mark Alvey’s comments above are a substantive, though partial account of what memory can bring to the surface. But it is what remains below the surface that might best define television, certainly from the perspectives of history. I have tried to suggest that I once thought I knew what television was because I have at times been able to articulate some of those sedimented features. What has been, what is, and what will be is the set of deep connections forged with the medium in all its forms. Only when we understand those relationships at every stage and every level, from individual to system to social and cultural formation, will we be able to say what television is. And our answer will very likely only last for a short time.</p>

<p>I am especially pleased to address television’s history today, because history in general is making a major comeback in public discourse because of the Republican primaries. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have been the most active invokers of our history, which they characterize as being comprised of a limited number of immutable facts that can be interpreted in only one way. Those interpretations cohere into a few specific lessons, like don’t tax billionaires. And these lessons can be easily taught at schools if only teachers weren’t unionized and college professors were cloned from Newt Gingrich. I bring up this vision of television as known, immutable, easily translated into simple lessons because it is so alien to anyone who has done historical research. I am going to briefly discuss this vision in terms of television’s history, addressing in turn the notion that television history is comprised of a limited number of immutable facts, that these facts can be interpreted in a single way. And finally that we can articulate simple lessons that have universal and eternal validity.</p>
<p>So let’s start with immutable facts and making the distinction between what happened in the past and what we know about what happened in the past. Today, no one seems have invented a time machine. So I am willing to concede that the past might actually be fully past and immutable. However, what we know about the past is different from the past itself. And that is one of the things that makes television’s past so interesting. We are constantly discovering more facts. These new facts must be put in relationship with the old facts. Can we integrate the new and the old? If so, why and how? If not, why not? How not? As we reexamine what we know about some aspects of television’s past, in light of new facts, we look for nuances, connections, disconnections, implications. In this sense, the history of television is constantly being discovered. It is important to note here that historical research on television takes different approaches. Among them, social history, cultural history, political economic history. This means that the constant discovery of fact occurs in terms of different emphases, different foci, which means that the constant discovery of television’s past is more accurately as a constant discovery of multiple aspects of television’s pasts. This is far from the notion of a limited number of immutable facts that constitute the stuff of television history. From my points about discovery and research focus, it logically follows that no single interpretation will cover all of the facts. A political economic analysis of the history of the national ratings industry tells us nothing about how people lived with television at different points of times. Nor should it. The questions that drive social history are not the same as the questions that drive political economy. Nor should they be. And ditto for cultural studies.</p>
<p>Without a single limited body of facts and without a single unifying interpretation, the chances for one or two pity lessons from television’s past are just about nil. But I think that at least three lessons can be drawn from my comments.</p>
<p>First, as a phenomenon, television operates as social, cultural, and political economic institutions. Hence when we take a singular approach, we may illuminate one aspect of the phenomena of television. But we do not capture its complexity.</p>
<p>Second, if we have an interest in understanding a phenomenon in its complexity, then more interdisciplinary work is needed.</p>
<p>Third, given what I’ve heard at the conference, it would be behoove us to pursue such interdisciplinary research because television—defined as a transmission of images across distances—is going to have a very long past, indeed, starting as of … this past second.</p>
<p>I began my remarks by noting the idea of history that has been championed by Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. I think it’s only fair to end with a quotation from another member of the Republican Party. This is a quotation which I have taken out of context but which I believe to be apropos because it reminds us of things we have, things we need to do, and things we are still seeking, unknowingly. And I quote:<disp-quote>
<p>There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know that there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don’t know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I thank former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for his contribution to our study of the history of television’s past. Let us go forward. Let us know what we know. Let us find out what we know that we don’t know. And let us find out the unknown unknowns that we don’t know yet.</p>
