<abstract>
<p>Exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS can cause an immune refractory state in mammals known as endotoxin tolerance (ET), resulting in a decreased inflammatory response after pathogen contact. This ET concept was used to reduce the severity of an experimentally-induced clinical mastitis. Cows were pretreated with 1 µg LPS per udder quarter and challenged 72 h (group L72EC) or 240 h (group L240EC) later with 500 CFU <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Pretreated animals showed no leukopenia after challenge, no (L72EC), or only slightly (L240EC), elevated body temperature and significantly reduced systemic and local clinical scores compared with cows that were not pretreated. Whereas an increase of milk somatic cell count after the <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge was abrogated in L72EC animals, it was significantly delayed in the L240EC group. In both pretreated groups the bacterial load in milk was markedly reduced. Based on the expression of inflammation-related genes in lobulo-alveolar mammary tissue, the tolerizing effect of LPS pretreatment is based on the inhibited up-regulation of inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL20) and anti-inflammatory genes (IL-10, IRAK-M). These findings indicate that the concept of ET may be usefully applied as mastitis prophylaxis facilitating a rapid response to microbial infection and avoiding dysregulated inflammation.</p>

<p>Mastitis is one of the most significant diseases among dairy cattle worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911422407">1</xref></sup> Intramammary infections (IMI) with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> frequently cause acute clinical mastitis and may result in severe disease with permanent tissue damage of the udder or even lethal outcome. Dysregulation of initial immune mechanisms is regarded as the main underlying reason for fatal cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911422407">2</xref></sup> Up to now existing concepts for prophylaxis and therapy of acute clinical mastitis have been unsatisfactory therefore novel approaches are required.</p>
<p>During intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> infection, LPS is recognized in an orchestrated interaction of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), CD14, TLR4 and MD2, inducing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory genes via a tightly regulated signaling cascade. Dysregulation of these balanced molecular mechanisms may lead to hyperactivation of host cells by microbial products and septic shock. Repeated exposure to microbial pathogens or their constituents [pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)] can cause a subsequent immune refractory state in mammals resulting in a decreased inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911422407">3</xref></sup> This phenomenon is known as ‘endotoxin tolerance’ (ET) and has been widely investigated in the human and murine system in connection with septic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911422407">4</xref></sup> This refractory state of the host is not solely induced by LPS (endotoxin) but also by various other PAMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911422407">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911422407">6</xref></sup> Although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911422407">4</xref></sup> PAMP-mediated tolerance is characterized by a transient inactivation of TLR-mediated induction of distinct inflammatory genes (e.g. TNF-α). In contrast, other TLR-driven genes encoding for antimicrobial effector molecules remain inducible in the state of ET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911422407">7</xref></sup> Thus, PAMP-mediated tolerance is considered to be a potentially protective mechanism against septic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911422407">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a bovine mastitis model, it was shown that experimental <italic>E. coli</italic> IMI, introduced twice with an interval of 14 d, was accompanied by a reduction of the acute phase response and severity of clinical signs during the second infection phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911422407">8</xref></sup> Induction of acute clinical mastitis by infusing 100 µg LPS into udder quarters prevented the establishment of <italic>E. coli</italic> IMI when the latter was applied 19 h after LPS infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911422407">9</xref></sup> Recently, we reported that experimental <italic>E. coli</italic> mastitis in one udder quarter influenced the reactivity in a neighbouring udder quarter to a subsequent <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911422407">10</xref></sup> Altogether these observations proved that cattle can be hyporesponsive when repeatedly exposed to PAMPs or Gram-negative infection. As there are no studies aiming at protection against IMI by targeting PAMP-mediated tolerance in cattle we decided to use the concept of ET to reduce the severity of an experimentally-induced clinical mastitis. The potential of a low dose intramammary LPS application to induce non- or hyporesponsiveness of the tissue to a subsequent controlled intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge was evaluated by recording clinical signs of mastitis. We tested how long the refractory state lasted in the udder. Protection against <italic>E. coli</italic> IMI and enhanced bacterial clearance by host mechanisms was evaluated by recovering <italic>E. coli</italic> from mammary secretions. Based on the expression of selected inflammation-related genes in lobulo-alveolar mammary tissue, we analyzed whether the tolerizing effect of LPS pretreatment was based on an inhibited up-regulation of inflammatory or an increased induction of anti-inflammatory and regulatory genes.</p>

<p>This study included 26 healthy Holstein cows 3–6 months into their first lactation. The trials were conducted at the Clinic for Ruminants, LMU Munich (Oberschleißheim, Germany) with the approval of the ethics committee of the regional government of Upper Bavaria, Germany (No. 55.2-1-54-2531-108-05). Only animals without previous diagnosis of clinical or subclinical mastitis and a reported somatic cell count (SCC) &lt;50,000/ml were included in the study. Before the trial, weekly cytobacteriologic testing of quarter milk samples ensured that milk contained &lt;50,000 somatic cells/ml and was free of mastitis pathogens. Cows were milked twice daily at 12 h intervals and were fed a total mixed ration based on production level. To achieve comparable hormonal conditions, all animals were synchronized by insertion of CIDR® devices according to the manufacturer's specifications (Pfizer Animal Health, Berlin, Germany) so that at time point of tissue sample collection all animals were at the stage of estrus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1753425911422407"><title>LPS and E. coli inoculum dose</title>
<p>Bovine mastitis isolate <italic>E. coli</italic> 1303 belongs to the major <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogenetic group A and has been used in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911422407">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911422407">11</xref></sup> According to a multiplex PCR-based screening for virulence-associated genes of pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, this strain does not represent an extra-intestinal or intestinal pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate. Only the genes coding for type 1 fimbriae, F17 fimbriae, antigen 43, the ferric citrate siderophore system and the EAST1 toxin could be detected. Bacteria were kept cryo-conserved (Mikrobank-System Cryobank™, Mast Diagnostika, Reinfeld, Germany) for subsequent infections. Bacteria were plated on Columbia sheep blood agar (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) and incubated (37°C) for 24 h. A few colonies were transferred to a tube of brain-heart infusion broth (Oxoid) and incubated for 6 h (37°C); then, a 100 µl sample was transferred to a tube containing 9.9 ml trypticase soy broth (Oxoid). Serial dilutions were made after 18 h to prepare the desired inoculum dose of 500 CFU/2 ml 0.9% sterile, pyrogen-free saline. The LPS of <italic>E. coli</italic> 1303 was prepared from the bacteria using the butanol extraction procedure and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911422407">12</xref></sup> This was followed by a purification step with triethylamine and deoxycholate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911422407">13</xref></sup> Finally the LPS was diluted in 0.9% sterile, pyrogen-free saline to a concentration of 0.2 µg/ml and kept stored in 5 ml aliquots at −80°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1753425911422407"><title>Milk samples, bacterial recovery and SCC</title>
<p>Throughout the trial, the milk secretion was macroscopically checked for alterations (clots, colour, consistency) every 12 h before regular milking. Simultaneously, quarter milk samples were aseptically collected in sterile vials for bacteriologic examination. Fifteen µl of quarter milk samples were plated on Columbia sheep blood agar, on Violet red bile agar and on Edwards agar (Oxoid). Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C and were examined daily for bacterial growth. The animals were milked with a quarter milker (WestfaliaSurge, Bönen, Germany) so that milk from individual udder quarters was collected in separate containers. This enabled determining the SCC with a Fossomatic 5000® (FOSS Electric, Hillerod, Denmark) in 20 ml of the main milk fraction of every individual quarter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1753425911422407"><title>Clinical score for local and systemic signs</title>
<p>A complete clinical examination of the animals was carried out throughout the trial in 12 h intervals, as well as 3, 6 and 9 h after LPS infusion or <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge respectively. Rectal temperature, heart rate, rumen contraction rate, appetite and general attitude, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425911422407">Table 1</xref>, were integrated into a modified score for systemic signs based on the severity scoring system published by Wenz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911422407">14</xref></sup> Based on the total score, animals were classified as showing a mild, moderate or severe systemic response. For estimating the degree of local inflammatory signs, the udder was examined every 12 h for swelling of the parenchyma, subcutaneous edema, rise in temperature on the udder surface compared with neighbouring quarters, signs of quarter pain and alterations of milk secretion, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753425911422407">Table 2</xref>. The total score of local clinical signs classified the udder quarter as being mildly, moderately or severely affected by mastitis.

<p>Before LPS infusion or <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, all animals were entirely milked out after 20 IU Oxytocin (Veyx-Pharma, Schwarzenborn, Germany) were applied intravenously. Before intracisternal application of LPS or <italic>E. coli</italic> by inserting a teat cannula through the streak canal, the teats were cleaned and disinfected with 70% ethanol. <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge (500 CFU/2 ml sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% saline) was carried out during estrus in one udder quarter per animal. The quarter with the lowest SCC was selected for challenge. The set-up of the animal groups is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911422407">Figure 1</xref>. In total, 15 animals received intramammary LPS pretreatment in all quarters 72 h (group L72EC, <italic>n</italic> = 5) or 240 h (group L240EC, <italic>n</italic> = 10) before <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. After completing the first five animals of the L240EC group, the group size was expanded to ten animals because of large interindividual differences in the clinical response to intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. However, only samples from five animals of this group were analyzed by qRT-PCR for technical reasons. In the EC group (<italic>n</italic> = 5), animals received no LPS infusion before <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge in one udder quarter. An additional six animals received neither LPS infusion nor <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge and served as control animals in the qRT-PCR analysis to define baseline gene expression values.

Leukocyte counts in blood samples were carried out with a Sysmex pocH100i (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany). At trial end (24 h after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge), the cows were killed with a penetrating captive bolt gun followed by exsanguination. Tissue samples were aseptically collected from the slaughtered cows within 10 min after killing. A piece of tissue (5 × 5 × 5 cm) was removed from a deeper location of the udder quarter, 7 cm dorsal of the milk cistern, of which a smaller tissue piece (1 × 1 × 1 cm) was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and served as original material for all further analyses.</p>

<p>All animals without LPS pretreatment (EC) responded with acute clinical mastitis 12 h after intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. Fever peaked with 41.1 ± 0.2°C after a period of 15–18 h following pathogen inoculation. This was accompanied by a significant leukopenia 12 h and 24 h after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2</xref>). Animals that had received LPS pretreatment 72 h prior to <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge (L72EC) developed no fever and no alterations in circulating blood leukocyte numbers. In the group receiving LPS pretreatment 240 h prior to <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, animals responded more heterogeneously: 5 out of 10 animals showed an increased body temperature (&gt;39.2°C) but mean temperature did not exceed a maximum of 39.4 ± 0.3°C. There was a significant difference between pretreated groups compared with animals that had received no pretreatment for rectal body temperature and circulating blood leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the classification of the systemic clinical score, all cows of the EC group showed a moderate clinical response towards intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. Both pretreated groups showed only a mild systemic clinical score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3</xref>). Although a tendency could be seen that L240EC was more strongly affected, there was no significant difference to L72EC because of interindividual differences in L240EC. As early as 12 h after intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, the three groups differed significantly in the characteristics of the local inflammation of the udder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3</xref>). These differences also lasted during the following 12 h. There were no signs of mastitis detectable in the L72EC group 12 and 24 h after intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. In the L240EC group, local symptoms were mostly restricted to 5 out of 10 animals but still these 5 animals showed a significantly milder local clinical score than all animals of the EC group, but stronger symptoms than the L72EC group. Animals without LPS pretreatment invariantly showed udder swelling, subcutaneous edema and strongly altered milk secretion 24 h after intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge.

<sec id="sec15-1753425911422407" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute clinical mastitis in cows is a complex pathophysiologic reaction that has to be tightly regulated, keeping in mind both resolving the infection and limiting damage to the host. In cows developing acute clinical mastitis, the desired cascades begin with pathogen recognition, induction of an initial inflammatory reaction and subsequently anti-inflammatory regulatory pathways. To avoid over-exuberant inflammation the hypo-responsiveness towards repeated confrontation with microbial products seems to be an effective mechanism that markedly decreases the apparent immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911422407">3</xref></sup> The aim of the current study was to evaluate this principle by reducing the severity of, or preventing an acute clinical, mastitis in cows. For the desensitization, we chose to infuse LPS into the udder as most of the studies about endotoxin tolerance in mice and humans were performed with this well-characterized PAMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911422407">4</xref></sup> Moreover LPS has been frequently applied intramammarily to study the pathogenesis of <italic>E. coli</italic> mastitis in cows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911422407">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911422407">16</xref></sup> Our intention was that the immuno-modulatory pretreatment should not lead to signs of clinical mastitis. As toxicity of LPS can vary between different bacterial strains and LPS preparations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911422407">17</xref></sup> the dosage for pretreatment was evaluated in pilot trials to guarantee that LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> strain 1303 induced a mild host response (data not shown). When 1 µg LPS were infused in all four udder quarters, a slight, short-lived rise in body temperature and a moderate rise in SCC was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753425911422407">Table 4</xref>). In most published studies, 100 µg LPS were infused into udder quarters and induced an acute inflammatory systemic and local response in dairy cows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911422407">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911422407">18</xref></sup> The clinical findings of our study showed that the LPS-induced response took place, but to a very limited extent. The general attitude of the animals, as well as milk yields and blood leukocyte counts stayed unaffected over the whole period of 240 h (data not shown). About 50% of infused udder quarters showed minimally-altered milk secretion (a few clots) in foremilk 12 h after LPS infusion, but were back to normal 72 h after LPS infusion. This moment was chosen for intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge in one group (L72EC). The SCC values at 72 h post-LPS pretreatment were significantly higher compared with baseline values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753425911422407">Table 4</xref>). To evaluate potential antimicrobial effects of an initially increased SCC on the applied <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculum dose in the L72EC group, the second group received an <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge 10 d after LPS pretreatment. At this time point, the SCC was back to baseline values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753425911422407">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The inoculated strain, <italic>E. coli</italic> 1303, causes intramammary infection and acute clinical mastitis in cows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911422407">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911422407">11</xref></sup> As it belongs to the phylogeny group A, this strain represents the majority of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains isolated from cases of bovine mastitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911422407">19</xref></sup> The five animals who received only an <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge (EC) showed almost a uniform acute inflammatory response, which is in line with previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911422407">10</xref></sup> This response included fever paired with blood leukopenia and a fast and high increase of milk somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2</xref>). The clinical symptoms indicating a systemic response peaked 12 h after challenge, while local symptoms were most apparent 24 h after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3</xref>). The clinical scores were characteristic for cows responding moderately after intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911422407">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, animals that had received LPS pretreatment 72 h prior to <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge showed no systemic signs of clinical mastitis after inoculation of 500 CFU <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This was also true for local signs except for one animal who showed two small flakes in milk and a second animal who showed an increased firmness of the udder parenchyma, both occurring 12 h after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. The absence of apparent inflammation was underpinned by lack of fever, leukopenia and SCC increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>This clearly showed that the LPS pretreatment abrogated the clinical response towards an <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. Whether this was caused by enhanced clearance of the inoculated bacteria by present milk cells or to a diminished inflammatory response of tissue cells is discussed below.</p>
<p>At the least, this effect was seen 72 h after LPS infusion. To test for how long the LPS effects lasted, group L240EC received an intramammary <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge 240 h after LPS pretreatment. In summary, this group displayed a higher degree of variability. Therefore we tested 10 animals for the clinical course of infection. The infection was able to establish itself, but the animals showed a clearly reduced disease severity in comparison to group EC. Other than a significantly reduced clinical score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3A</xref>), animals of L240EC showed no alterations in circulating blood leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the systemic response was limited. Major differences from L72EC were shown when the SCC was compared. In contrast to the L72EC group, it had increased significantly in L240EC, but the SCC increase in the L240EC group was delayed in comparison with the EC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been established that a delayed PMN influx into the udder can cause higher quantities of <italic>E. coli</italic> in milk and consequently increase the severity of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911422407">20</xref></sup> However, although the SCC increase was delayed in L240EC, only in 50% of challenged udder quarters was <italic>E. coli</italic> recovered 12 h after challenge. Conversely, a fast SCC increase could not prevent <italic>E. coli</italic> multiplication in the EC group, where all udder quarters were positively tested for <italic>E. coli</italic> at every time point after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911422407">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the number of immigrated milk phagocytes is not the sole reason for an inhibited growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria could not be re-isolated from quarter samples of L72EC animals (except one quarter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911422407">Figure 4</xref>) although at 12 h after <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation L72EC animals did not differ in SCC values from L240EC animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of the LPS pretreatment the SCC was still elevated (661,000 ± 229,000 cells per ml) in the milk of the L72EC animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2C</xref>). This may have influenced bacterial growth by an increased initial presence of PMN. In other experimental mastitis models, however, cows with fairly high SCC values (up to 500,000/cells per ml) showed fast <italic>E. coli</italic> growth and developed clinical mastitis within 12 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911422407">21</xref></sup> In one L72EC animal <italic>E. coli</italic> was re-isolated 24 h after challenge, although it had been found negative 12 h before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911422407">Figure 4</xref>). This finding suggests that the initial inoculum dose had not been completely eliminated but that <italic>E. coli</italic> was able to multiply in this particular quarter.</p>
<p>As the number of somatic cells per ml of milk seemed not to be decisive for the observed LPS pretreatment effects on the clinical outcome of an <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, it seems more likely that LPS pretreatment altered the response of the udder tissue towards <italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
<p>To address this point we analyzed the expression of selected genes in tissue samples taken 24 h after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. In line with others’ findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911422407">7</xref></sup> animals pretreated with LPS and then challenged with <italic>E. coli</italic> displayed a significantly reduced expression of several genes related to the inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425911422407">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425911422407">6</xref>). Interestingly, the reduced expression or the reduced up-regulation of genes not only affected the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 or the chemokine genes CXCL8 and CCL20, but also the anti-inflammatory gene, IL-10. Thus, the clinical tolerization to LPS not only inhibited the up-regulation of pro-, but also of anti-inflammatory genes. Interleukin-10 is only produced by specific cells, such as dendritic cells, monocytes and, notably, macrophages. The LPS pretreatment may have caused a distortion of the cell composition inside the udder possibly leading to a reduced number of IL-10 producing cells at the time of the <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. This may be one reason for the observed absence of up-regulation of the IL-10 mRNA abundance in those udder samples. The type of broad-spectrum inhibitory effect became obvious when the expression of IRAK-M was analyzed, which has been described as a negative regulator of TLR signaling in murine macrophages. Also, IRAK-M knock-out mice proved to be less efficiently LPS tolerizable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911422407">22</xref></sup> The LPS pretreatment of cows, however, did not result in enhanced expression of bovine IRAK-M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425911422407">Figure 6</xref>), although it was induced in the EC group.</p>
<p>Altogether, the data obtained do not point to a selective inhibition of a set of genes, as was observed in studies with LPS-tolerized macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911422407">7</xref></sup> Whether there are still other genes or gene sets that are more highly expressed after LPS pretreatment and <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge was not further analyzed. Future transcriptome analyses studies could clarify the existence of inducible and non-inducible genes in LPS-tolerant cows and mammary cells.</p>
<p>After LPS pretreatment, we chose two different time points for subsequent <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge to see whether the protective effects in the udder are progressively reduced. The time-dependent decline of reduced protection was best seen in the local clinical score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911422407">Figure 3B</xref>) and in the bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911422407">Figure 4</xref>). Regarding these parameters, the L240EC group ranged between groups EC and L72EC. Systemically, the LPS pretreatment proved to be long lasting, with systemic clinical scores and the blood leukocyte counts being statistically identical between L72EC and L240EC animals. Surprisingly, this was not true for SCC values in milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422407">Figure 2C</xref>), where L240EC animals showed a delayed, but similar, increase after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge compared with group EC, while this increase was totally absent in group L72EC. These differences between 72 h and 240 h post-LPS pretreatment may rely on the differential gene regulation. For instance, in udder tissue we observed a profoundly inhibited expression of IL-6 after <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge in group L72EC and a reduction in L240EC which was near significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.016) after Bonferroni correction. This could explain why systemic effects were less apparent in these animals. In contrast, genes like CXCL8 coding for IL-8 which selectively attracts PMN appeared to be less inhibited in group L240EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425911422407">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>In conflict with our findings, Rainard and Paape reported that repeated LPS stimulation sensitizes the bovine mammary gland, resulting in a boosted reaction to a following stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425911422407">23</xref></sup> However, they infused LPS twice with an interval of 24 h. This interval may be too short to desensitize the udder tissue to a successive stimulus although Lohuis et al., who challenged cows with <italic>E. coli</italic> 19 h after a previous intramammary LPS infusion, found no inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911422407">9</xref></sup> These differences may be a result of the dose and type of the inoculated LPS. In summary, our findings are in line with those of Suojala et al. who showed that a consecutive <italic>E. coli</italic> mastitis with an interval of 2 wk was accompanied by a reduced acute phase response, although all animals developed acute clinical mastitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911422407">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intramammary LPS pretreatment of cows has been revealed to be effective in preventing and reducing the severity of clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> mastitis. Future studies should focus on minimizing the side effects of pretreatment on milk quality and extending the period of protection; thus, the concept of PAMP-mediated tolerance induction can be successfully applied to mastitis prevention in cattle.</p>
