<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Relatives asked for more information and individual rehabilitation plans. Booklets describing CA, the ICU stay and continuing care and rehabilitation directed at both the patients and their relatives are needed. Follow-up visits to the ICU staff, for both patients and relatives, need to be arranged.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Survivors of a cardiac arrest (CA) are treated in an intensive care unit (ICU), an unfamiliar environment for most people. The prognosis is uncertain not only due to the CA and the heart disease, but also with regard to neurological symptoms and sequelae. This situation influences the relatives, as the event is unexpected. For persons suffering a CA the outcome is relatively poor. Survival rates are low, and the ischaemia reperfusion injury related to the CA may cause brain damage with neurological symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112459618">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112459618"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112459618">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after CA is thought to protect the brain by reducing oxygen consumption, metabolism and damaging biochemical reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112459618">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112459618">7</xref></sup> TH has been used during operations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery since the 1950s and for patients with neurological injury some years later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112459618">8</xref></sup> The favourable effect of TH after CA to improving neurological outcome was first demonstrated in animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112459618">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112459618">9</xref></sup> In 2002, two randomized and controlled studies presented improved neurological outcome and survival after CA in patients treated with TH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112459618">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112459618">2</xref></sup> TH to 32–34°C and maintained for 12–24 hours is today recommended in unconcious patients after successful resuscitation from CA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112459618">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112459618">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112459618">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The experience of being a relative to a person who has suffered an acute critical illness and been hospitalized in an ICU has been described as one of shock, stress and of feeling that time has stood still.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112459618">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref></sup> The critical situation creates anxiety, uncertainty and a feeling of oscillating between hope and despair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref></sup> Relatives’ experiences of their next of kin’s CA are described as strong, unexpected and chaotic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112459618">17</xref></sup> and the event influences their life situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112459618">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112459618">19</xref></sup> They have a high risk of stress, anxiety and depression during the first days after a next of kin has been admitted to the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112459618">20</xref></sup> Research indicates that relatives need to feel hope, receive adequate and honest information and be assured that their next of kin is getting the best possible care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112459618">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459618"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459618">24</xref></sup>They also need support, and the most important support comes from other family members, with whom they are able to discuss their experiences, feelings and how to deal with practical matters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459618">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>After suffering a CA, the prognostication of neurological outcomes after TH is not available until at least 3 days later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112459618">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112459618">11</xref></sup> This increases the anxiety and uncertainty for relatives during the next of kin’s hospital stay and has previously been poorly described. The aim of this study was to describe relatives’ experiences during a next of kin’s hospital stay after surviving a CA treated with hypothermia at an ICU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1474515112459618" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The methodological approach was qualitative description and was informed by Sandelowski’s work. Qualitative description is a method used for classification of experiences and to answer questions such as “who, what and where”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112459618">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112459618">26</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-1474515112459618">
<title>Settings and participants</title>
<p>The study was performed at one university hospital and two general county hospitals in Sweden. Twenty relatives of patients who had survived a CA and been treated with TH were included in the study during the period May 2008 to June 2010. All respondents asked participated in the study.</p>
<p>When the patient’s health permitted, they were asked whether they would allow a close relative to be interviewed about how the relative experienced their CA. If the patient consented, they were asked to give the name of the relative that could be contacted. A relative was defined as someone close, who cared about the patient and whom the patient trusted. The relatives were purposely selected according to age, sex and relationship to the patient to achieve as wide a variety of experiences as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112459618">27</xref></sup> The participants are henceforth described as relatives and the persons who had suffered the CA as next of kin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1474515112459618">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide covering how the relatives experienced their next of kin’s CA and TH, support and information during the stay in hospital, how everyday life had changed during the next of kin’s stay in hospital and how they viewed the future. The interview guide was developed in agreement within the research team. In a pilot interview, the interview guide was tested and found to be feasible because it elicited in-depth answers. Clarifying questions were used such as: “What do you mean?”, “How did you feel then?” and “What did you think then?” The interview was conducted at the time the patient was discharged from hospital, 1.5 to 6 weeks post-CA, recorded and lasted from 30 to 60 minutes. The interview was performed in a separate room at the hospital or in the relative’s home, at the discretion of the participant. Four of the interviews were conducted over the telephone because of the distances involved.</p>
<p>Three ICU nurses – the first author, the last author and one collaborating nurse, one from each hospital, performed the interviews. The last author is experienced in the method used in the present study and supervised the others involved in data collection and analysis. The other two nurseshave studied interview technique and were supported by the last author.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112459618">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The interview text was systematically analysed using qualitative content analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112459618">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112459618"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112459618">30</xref></sup> The interviews were first transcribed verbatim, thereafter each interview text was read several times to gain an overall impression. The text was divided into meaning units in line with the study aim. A meaning unit could consist of anything from a few words to several sentences. These units were condensed and given a code. Codes that expressed related meanings were grouped into categories. Categories with similar content and underlying meaning were sorted into the same theme. Throughout the entire process, the authors went back and forth between the interviews, codes, categories and themes to validate the findings. The first author conducted the analysis and the emerging of categories and themes were continuously discussed with the other authors during the analysis process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112459618">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The Regional Ethical Committee in Uppsala approved the study (Dnr 2007/307). The participants received written and oral information about the purpose of the study. They were told that participation was voluntary, they were free to withdraw at any time and that full confidentiality was guaranteed. The participants signed an informedconsent document.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112459618" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The participants, 13 women and 7 men, were aged between 20 and 70 years (mean 52), and 10 out of 20 participants were the husband or wife of the patient, three were partners, six were children and one was a parent. Eleven of the participants were present during the CA and nine were informed afterwards about the CA. At the time of the patient’s CA, 13 participants worked full time, four worked part-time and three were retired or on sick leave.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed 10 categories and three themes. The findings will be presented by each theme: The first period of chaos, Feeling secure in a difficult situation, and Living in a changed existence, and its underlying categories. Each category is illustrated with interview excerpts.</p>
<sec id="section12-1474515112459618">
<title>The first period of chaos</title>
<p>This theme describes how relatives experienced the acute phase after their next of kin had suffered the CA and contains four categories including: Difficulties taking in what had happened, Feeling fear, Waiting in uncertainty, and Painful to see a relative seriously ill.</p>
<sec id="section13-1474515112459618">
<title>Difficulties taking in what had happened</title>
<p>The relatives who were present when their next of kin suffered the CA described having a sense of unreality in relation to what had happened, and it was an unexpected and dramatic incident. They felt like time had stood still, involving a loss of time perception; it was difficult to understand what had happened and they defended themselves from unpleasant memories. Nevertheless they acted rationally when the next of kin suffered the CA. Both the relatives who had received a telephone call regarding their next of kin’s CA and those who had been present during the CA described a chaotic and shattering experience, but with maintained rational thought.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…it was a real disturbance, I think, when xxx reached me on Saturday my thoughts just stopped…, totally stopped, everything just disappeared, like I was somewhere else… after that there was like a chaos and what should I do and there were thousands of thoughts…” (Participant 5)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1474515112459618">
<title>Feeling fear</title>
<p>The CA gave rise to feelings of fear in the relatives. They experienced a state of panic and desperation, and even a strong feeling of anxiety and dark thoughts. These feelings were related to uncertainty as to whether the next of kin would survive or be changed and what the future would look like.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…my mother called me and told me my father was really ill, come to me, don’t tell your sister. I just ran away. I was really scared…” (Participant 1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1474515112459618">
<title>Waiting in uncertainty</title>
<p>Relatives described having to wait after arrival at the hospital before being allowed to see their next of kin. This waiting was associated with great uncertainty and disappointment because they had receivedno information.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…than it was the waiting… and this waiting was definitely the worst thing I’ve ever been through…” (Participant 9)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1474515112459618">
<title>Painful to see a relative seriously ill</title>
<p>Relatives found it difficult to see their next of kin seriously ill. They described the TH as unpleasant; the next of kin felt cold and almost dead. Relatives with younger children reported how painful it was for children to see one of their parents seriously ill. The time before the next of kin woke up was stressful because of the uncertainty as to what kind of injuries, if any, the next of kin had suffered. Thoughts of the risk that their next of kin could die emerged. During this difficult time, relatives often related to earlier experiences when other family members have been seriously ill.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“… she was cold too, I don’t know what temperature her body was then and deathly pale, she looked dead, that was the association I got. And then I said, oh my God, she’s dead! That was the way I saw it. I knew that all these machines were working and so, ECG and everything but to me she was dead at that moment…” (Participant 5)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1474515112459618">
<title>Feeling secure in a difficult situation</title>
<p>This theme illuminates relatives’ need for support and information as well as variations in the care their next of kin received. It contains the following three categories: Receiving support, Receiving information, and Feeling variations in the quality of care.</p>
<sec id="section18-1474515112459618">
<title>Receiving support</title>
<p>Relatives experienced support from their family as the most important; all received support from family members and close friends. Even colleagues and employers were described as supportive; religious beliefs were also a source of support. The experience of support from the ICU staff varied among the relatives. However, they felt the support fromstaff decreased when their next of kin was moved to a general ward.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…it decreased when one got to the next place (general ward). They kind of answered when spoken to, they were not rude. This was kind of more positive… some of the spirit that was here (ICU) would be appreciated at the next unit…” (Participant 4)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeing a hospital social worker was not routine, but some relatives were offered contact; some of them agreed and others felt they had no need for such contact. Relatives who wrote a diary felt this helped them sort out whathad happened.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…They asked if we wanted to get help from a counsellor and such but I didn’t feel a need for that because it is more like that they gave the support when we were there and after that there are things you have to process by yourself, I felt then…” (Participant 2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1474515112459618">
<title>Receiving information</title>
<p>All of the relatives reported receiving information about their next of kin’s condition. They felt the information was good, correct and factual and given continuously during the ICU stay.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…everything was straight and they just said it like it was that xxx was in a very bad state, and that was what they said, so it was good information. I was sitting there and they came and told me how it was…” (Participant 16)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Relatives experienced difficulties in assimilating the information because of their diminished concentration abilities. Language barriers were apparent and affected the interpretation of the information. These barriers could be due to different native languages or the way the medical staff expressed themselves. There were occasions when the relatives felt the answers to their questions were not available, because there were questions no one could give a clear answer to, for example “Will he wake up?” or “How will he be?” Certain relatives experienced a lack of information from the physician. They wanted more written information about what had caused the CA, the prognosis and information about prevention.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…a bit short of information, like speaking to the doctors and such, actually… I feel like I’m …we were sitting there, is there anyone who has talked to me like, it’s not and…I know there were people coming in and that sort of thing, but I can’t say when they were there and who was there and so on, it’s all a bit too blurry….” (Participant 6)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112459618">
<title>Feeling variations in the quality of care</title>
<p>Relatives experienced the ICU care as good and safe. The personnel behaved professionally and competently, and were nice and engaged, treating all family members with consideration.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…maybe it’s mostly a question of how they care for the ill patient but it’s so closely tied to how one is treated as a relative. I felt from the first moment that I was very secure in a way here because right from the start I got to be involved, I wasn’t shut out…” (Participant 11)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ICU environment was experienced as frightening to some extent. Relatives were able to visit their next of kin and be close, but they could also feel they were in the way when the staff were providing care. Having a routine for how to take care of relatives was emphasized. Relatives felt the staff on the general ward were less supportive and engaged than those in the ICU. They had difficulty getting answers to their questions and felt they were disturbingthe staff.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>(Experiences from the general ward) ”…At the beginning, negative. - The lid was on, there were no information. It was a pure coincidence that I asked a nurse…then I found out they had sent a fax to xx that she would turn up there…” (Move to another hospital) (Participant 17)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Opportunities for rehabilitation and care after hospital discharge were insufficient. They wanted a rehabilitation plan for their next of kin including mental training, especially memory training.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1474515112459618">
<title>Living in a changed existence</title>
<p>The impact on everyday life after their next of kin’s CA is illustrated in this theme. Three categories were found: Feeling increased demands and responsibility, Concerns for the future, and The next of kin has changed.</p>
<sec id="section22-1474515112459618">
<title>Feeling increased demands and responsibility</title>
<p>Relatives experienced an increased workload and a responsibility to support other family members. They had difficulties dealing with other people’s worries. Relatives with younger children felt a great responsibility for them and found their sadness and anxiety very challenging. Relatives described a demand to maintain continuous contact with other family members and friends by phoning, but felt they were spending too much time by the phone. These feelings gave them a guilty conscience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“…by the time I reached home everybody expected me to call them and tell them what had happened during the day. So the first hour at home was spent by the phone. Sometimes I felt I would rather not make those calls…” (Participant 4)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Relatives described feeling under pressure and how normal life duties were set aside. Many of them were tired. The incident brought with it many practical issues to deal with. Contacts with the social security system and the insurance company were demanding. Relatives found it difficult to work full-time, which had a negative impact on their personal economy. They felt responsible for their next of kin and wanted to support them to the utmost. At the time of the interview, some relatives had not discussed the incident with their next of kin. They wished to protect their next of kin by withholding information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1474515112459618">
<title>Concerns for the future</title>
<p>The relatives felt great uncertainty and anxiety about the future, but were hopeful. They were worried about possible physical and mental changes in their next of kin: a new CA, personality changes and impaired memory. They felt anxiety about the situation when their next of kin returned home from hospital.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<title>The next of kin has changed</title>
<p>The next of kin was still affected by the CA. Relatives described how their next of kin’s short-term memory was affected, including no memory of the CA and the time in ICU. Furthermore some of them had no disease awareness. Some next of kin displayed speech, balance and walking difficulties, while others had suffered physical complications such as renal dysfunction, infections, further myocardial infarctions and heart failure.</p>

<p>The present study reveals relatives’ experiences during the next of kin’s stay in hospital after surviving CA and being treated with TH in an ICU. The relatives wanted morewritten information and found it difficult to assimilate the information provided. This has been confirmed in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112459618">31</xref></sup> To feel as secure as possible in this difficult situation, relatives wanted honest and clear information about their next of kin’s condition and prognosis.

<p>In the present study, relatives described difficulties in understanding and absorbing what had happened, and the situation felt unreal. They protected themselves from unpleasant memories, which is in line with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112459618">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112459618">35</xref></sup> Uncertainty was prevalent among relatives during the acute phase, and waiting in uncertainty was described as a time filled with anxiety and fear, which is consistent with previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112459618">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459618">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112459618">36</xref></sup> In the present study, relatives described how painful it was to see their next of kin seriously ill in the ICU, and TH made their next of kin cold and seem almost dead. Touching the cold person is described as unreal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref></sup> and it was difficult to see a close next of kin seriously ill in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1474515112459618">37</xref></sup> High levels of traumatic stress, anxiety and depression are described in relatives during the first days after a next of kin’s admission to an ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112459618">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1474515112459618">38</xref></sup> In the present study, the illness itself and thoughts about what kind of injuries the next of kin had suffered were powerful causes of stress, more than the environment in the ICU, and this is in line with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112459618">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474515112459618">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>One surprising result was the demand placed on relatives to maintain telephone contact with other family members and friends. This was time-consuming and instead they would prefer time to relax and think. These feelings resulted in a guilty conscience. Reflected in other research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112459618">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459618">22</xref></sup> relatives experienced increased responsibility, demands, obligations and guilt when a next of kin became seriously ill. Increased responsibility became apparent in the form of supporting other family members and dealing with the worries of others, while being concerned about their next of kin. Concern for other family members has been described as a double worry about how they will handle the situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref></sup> Eriksson et al. discussed the feelings of obligation that everyday life must go on even at these difficult times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474515112459618">39</xref></sup> According to Engström and Söderberg, there needs to be recognition of the importance of moments of solitude and having a private space where relatives can deal with their feelings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref></sup> Relatives reported having feelings of guilt when they left their next of kin in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1474515112459618">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relatives felt uncertain about the future, but hopeful. It was important for them to feel hope even when the situation was critical and the prognosis uncertain. Studies have revealed the importance of hope when a next of kin is critically ill and shown that hope is of greater importance in cases of unexpected incidences than in chronically evolving illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459618">24</xref></sup> The feelings of hope are complex and hope has an internal being dimension that things will go well. Even in moments of hopelessness, hope might suddenly appear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1474515112459618">40</xref></sup> Relatives’ need for hope must be taken into account when staff meet with them. Because relatives desire honest and realistic information, it is important that staff encourage hopefulness without promoting unrealistic hope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1474515112459618">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1474515112459618">42</xref></sup> Hope was also a way to cope with the situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1474515112459618">41</xref></sup> Relatives who already have a social network use social support as a coping strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1474515112459618">43</xref></sup> In the present study, all relatives experienced support and the most important support came from other family members. Another study found that relatives prefer to talk to someone they know rather than to a hospital social worker or a priest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459618">13</xref></sup> The present study illustrates that relatives experienced support from ICU staff to varying degrees, and receiving support from a hospital social worker was not routine. Receiving support from ICU staff has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459618">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618">23</xref></sup> but also that professional support is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459618">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, relatives described a difference between the ICU and the general ward in terms of effective interpersonal relations, attitudes, and knowledge on the part of staff as well as lack of contact with staff. Transfer from the ICU to a general ward has been described in other studies as a change in level of care and environment, and ward staff may not be able to meet informational needs due to lack of time, experience and knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1474515112459618">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1474515112459618"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1474515112459618">46</xref></sup> Care of relatives is an important issue, as is how staff treat both relatives’ next of kin and the relatives themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459618">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459618">24</xref></sup> The absence of rehabilitation plans after discharge from the medical ward was also a major issue.</p>

<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Trustworthiness is important in qualitative studiesand according to Graneheim and Lundman it comprisescredibility, transferability and dependability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112459618">28</xref></sup> To achieve credibility, participant selection aimed at variation in demographic characteristics, and a pilot interview was performed to test the interview guide and examine whether the three researchers were focusing on the same topics. The interviews took place at about the same time after the next of kin’s CA, which made the experiences of the participating relatives comparable. Three interviewers performed the interviews. This can be a weakness, as different topics and follow-up questions can be emphasized. However, it can also be a strength, if it contributes to development of a greater variety of experiences. The first author and the collaborating nurse work in two of the ICUs involved in the study and might have been involved in the care of few of the patients and relatives. The interviewers and the authors were familiar with the research field. This pre-understanding of the context can be useful during the interviews and data analysis but it can also be a weakness if the interviewers take the participant’s statements for granted. To enhance credibility during the analysis the authors continuously discussed the steps in the process. One limitation of this study is that only those who could understand and speak Swedish were included as participants. Because of the distances involved, four of the interviews were conducted over the telephone. According to Novick, face-to-face interviews are preferable, because lack of visual cues can lead to data loss or distortion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1474515112459618">47</xref></sup> In the present study, the content of the telephone interviews was more shallow and narrow. However, this was compensated for by the face-to-face interviews, which were complex and exhaustive. Giventhe method used, the present results cannot be generalized,but they can be transferred to relatives in a similar situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112459618">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112459618">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions and clinical implications</title>
<p>The present findings show that relatives of a person who has suffered a CA described the absence of a rehabilitation plan for their next of kin. Keeping contact with other family members and friends was described as demanding. This group of relatives desired more information, especially written, on the cause of the CA, treatment, prognosis and prevention.</p>
<p>Booklets describing CA, the ICU stay and continuing care and rehabilitation directed at both the patients and their relatives are needed. Current booklets used in ICU need to be more developed and detailed. ICU staff must support relatives and encourage them to designate a contact person who can forward information to other family members and friends. Furthermore relatives and patients need to be prepared about the change in level of care and environment in the general ward before moving from ICU. Follow-up visits for both patients and relatives need to be considered. Hospitals should consider establishing a rehabilitation plan for this group of patients, presented by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals and that focuses on the individual’s situation, including the consequences of their heart disease and brain damage. A follow-up study is recommended to further investigate relatives’ quality of life and post-traumatic stress.</p>
