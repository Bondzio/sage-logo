<p>The article tells the story of the development of a Sentencing Information System for the High Court in Scotland from its genesis as an exploratory research project to its final implementation in the court. The article uses Actor Network Theory to understand how the database was assembled through the social practices of academic researchers, government officials, judges and court officers. It offers a corrective to theories which exaggerate the de-humanizing effect of information technology and argues that an Actor Network Theory approach is not incompatible with an understanding of how institutionally located power operates through social practices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article presents a case study of a process of sentencing reform which took place between 1993 and 2002 in a small jurisdiction (Scotland). The case study tells two stories. One story is about how information technology was used to develop a Sentencing Information System (SIS) to support the exercise of judicial discretion. The article focuses on the practices through which the SIS was first proposed, then imagined, given shape and form and finally implemented.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612465767">Aas (2005)</xref> has written a persuasive account of the de-humanizing influence of technology on sentencing. Although she is careful to avoid technological determinism, her analysis suggests that the use of technology has a number of effects on sentencing. Sentencing decisions increasingly become based on abstract de-contextualized information as opposed to subtle human assessments of individual subjects. Formal process-based transparency is substituted for trust in professional judgements. Judicial discretion is replaced or at least significantly constrained by machine-like rules.</p>
<p>This article presents an alternative account of the effect of technology on sentencing based on a case study. A case study can neither prove nor disprove broad accounts of social change based on reviews of legislation, policy and/or political rhetoric. However, a case study can remind us that social changes have to be accomplished through social practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612465767">Aas (2005</xref>: 86) argues that: ‘SISs to a large extent circumvent the figure of the judge who navigates between the particular circumstances of the case and the universal legal rules, and who in order to act, needs to understand and construct narratives.’ This case study shows that the High Court SIS places no additional constraints on judicial construction of narratives. It also shows how judges actively participated in the construction of new ways of representing seriousness which were precisely based on a process of moving backwards and forwards between the individual case and different ways of representing similarity thus enabling the court to pursue greater consistency. The SIS did not create rules which defined consistency, it permitted, indeed required, judicial negotiation with the database.</p>
<p>A second story narrated here presents an account of how the form and content of the SIS was generated through the practices of academic researchers, judges, government officials and court staff. The focus on practice is derived from the theory/methodology developed by Bruno Latour and others and the case study is also a critical contribution to this body that has become known as Actor Network Theory (ANT). ANT focuses analytic attention on the processes through which actors engage with each other to ‘assemble’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612465767">Latour, 2005</xref>) the social world. It acts as a corrective to accounts which exaggerate the causal efficacy of social structures and polarize human actors and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612465767">Aas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>If one of the strengths of ANT is its focus on process, one of its major weaknesses is a lack of attention to power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612465767">Elder-Vass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612465767">Levi and Valverde, 2008</xref>). This article shows how it is possible to combine a focus on the processes of social assembly with attention to the political and institutional context to provide a richer understanding of how power operates through social practices. In this case study, the Sentencing Information System took on a particular shape through the translations from ideas and texts to a digital database. The content and form were not determined by judges, researchers, politicians, government officials nor by some inherent characteristic of information technology, but through the interactions of all of these actors and the contingent outcomes of these interactions. There were a number of occasions during the 10 years of the project when things could have turned out differently. The analysis highlights both the fragility and contingency of social life and at the same time its stability and persistence.</p>

<title>A Sentencing Information System for the High Court of judiciary</title>
<p>Between 1993 and 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362480612465767">1</xref></sup> a multi-disciplinary research team<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362480612465767">2</xref></sup> based at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow worked with senior judges in Scotland to design, build and eventually implement a Sentencing Information System (SIS). A SIS is a decision support tool which judges can use at the point of sentence. The aim of this system was to enable judges, when deciding sentence in a particular case, to search the database for similar cases and thereby pursue the goal of greater consistency in sentencing while retaining their discretion. Although the idea of such a tool was far from new (Morris, 1953: 200 quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362480612465767">Frase, 1997</xref>: 366), information technology had only made these tools possible relatively recently. In Canada systems had been developed, then discarded, in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612465767">Doob, 1990</xref>). At the time this project began, there was one other system operational in New South Wales (NSW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480612465767">Potas, 1991</xref>). The Scottish system was inspired by the NSW system but ultimately adopted a different approach.</p>
<p>The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in sentencing was a relatively unexplored area. Scotland is predominantly a common law jurisdiction, and the ways in which sentencing information is stored makes it almost impossible for judges, using the existing legal resources, to consult reliable data about the sentences passed by the courts for cases similar to one they have at hand. Technology offers the capacity to retrieve information quickly and flexibly. A database allows judges to pursue consistency and, perhaps more significantly, to demonstrate this publicly. However the content and form of the SIS was not determined by technology, it was assembled through the practices of judges, researchers, court clerks, court managers, government research funders.</p>
<p>The article shows how the translation from individualized sentencing to a database representing patterns of similar cases was accomplished and how the SIS came to take on the shape that it did. The SIS case study demonstrates that the use of information technology to assist the pursuit of consistency in sentencing can work alongside the exercise of judicial discretion.</p>

<sec id="section3-1362480612465767">
<title>Actor Network Theory</title>
<p>Actor Network Theory is as much a method of enquiry as it is a theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612465767">Levi and Valverde, 2008</xref>). ANT directs analytic attention to the actions and processes of human and non-human actors through which the social world is assembled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1362480612465767">3</xref></sup> The method is sensitive to the dynamism and contingency of these processes. It offers tantalizing glimpses of how the social world might have been otherwise, but ultimately describes how the world came to be the way it is (though of course the choice of a finishing point is a pragmatic decision for the analyst as the process of assembling continues).</p>
<p>ANT was not used as a ‘method’ for the project, but as a means of understanding the social process of constructing the SIS. ANT is particularly helpful for examining change because it directs attention to the assembling of something new and different, in this case, a change in the way judges approach sentencing. ANT has produced a body of work which examines the interaction between technologies and humans in the generation of different ways of classifying knowledge and information, which is at the heart of the SIS project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362480612465767">Bijker and Law, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480612465767">Latour, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362480612465767">Latour and Woolgar, 1979/1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362480612465767">Mol, 2003</xref>), and more recently, ANT scholars have turned their attention to law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612465767">Cowan and Carr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362480612465767">Latour, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362480612465767">Levi and Valverde, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362480612465767">Silbey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362480612465767">Valverde, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1362480612465767">
<title>Translation</title>
<p>ANT uses the term ‘translation’ to describe the processes through which actions/texts from one source are mediated by other actors and in turn become a new source for further mediation by other actors: a process of movement and associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612465767">Freeman, 2009</xref>). So for example, the SIS was assembled through translation of different materials. These included texts, such as research data interpreted and presented by the research team, draft papers produced by the research team and amended in the light of judicial comments and data collected from the court records, and later digital products created from these texts. This article uses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612465767">Callon’s (1986)</xref> ‘four moments of translation’: problematization, interessement, enrolment and mobilization as a framework to describe how the SIS was translated from its beginnings in a proposal from a senior judge into a database which, for a brief moment at least, became a practical judicial support tool.</p>
<p>Problematization refers to the identification and definition of the problem which will be addressed by the alliance that is constructed by the assembled entities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1362480612465767">4</xref></sup> Interessement refers to the processes through which entities are attached to the problematization and at the same time possibly detached from other associations or entities which do not share the problematization. Enrolment is a device by which a set of roles is defined and attributed to actors who accept them. Interessement achieves enrolment if it is successful. Mobilization refers to the process through which the assembled entities generate change.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612465767">Callon’s (1986)</xref> framework helps to capture the uncertainties and contingencies of the processes through which the SIS was designed, revised and developed. How was the initial problem defined and by whom? How were the interests of the various entities aroused? How were the entities enrolled and committed to the project? How were the entities mobilized? The project began its physical existence as ideas and conversations, became a multiplicity of texts and finally digital information on disks and laptop computers. From one perspective the project was a highly unlikely, and rather marvellous, application of relatively untested innovative ideas and technology to an ancient, closely guarded practice belonging to a small elite professional group. From another perspective the SIS was assembled through the day to day actions of a relatively small number of academic researchers, government officials, court administrators and judges, fitting the project around their many other obligations and commitments as just another part of their day job. The ANT method is particularly sensitive to understanding this paradoxical juxtaposition of the strange and the familiar in social life. A ‘good’ ANT account, can and arguably should, read like a gripping story. There should be an element of drama which comes from uncertainty: How will the SIS define similarity? Who will make these decisions? How will these decisions be put into practice? Ideally the theoretical framework of ANT should be almost invisible. The point of making explicit use of Callon’s framework in this article is to draw attention to the method used to produce this story, a method which pays close attention to what the actors do.</p>
<p>The project was in fact three separate projects over a period of almost 10 years. In the limited space available here, this article concentrates predominantly on the first phase of the project, the feasibility study, where most of the work of defining the problem took place and which therefore produced the basic architecture of the SIS. The full story of the implementation and eventual neglect of the SIS will have to be told elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1362480612465767">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Institutions, structure and power</title>
<p>This is also a story of the subtle and not so subtle ways in which power was exercised (and not exercised) in a process which was, and continues to be, contested. Latour has been criticized for neglecting the causal effect of structure in his detailed ethnographic accounts of how the social is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612465767">Elder-Vass, 2008</xref>: 464–468). At times his deliberate refusal to admit the possibility that structure exists independently from actors’ actions seems almost playful and there are passages where ‘Latour talks as if he were just deferring the moment at which structure is recognised, yet he never seems to arrive at this moment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362480612465767">Elder-Vass, 2008</xref>: 464).</p>
<p>This article shares Elder-Vass’s view that it is not possible to understand how the social is assembled without an understanding of how institutionally situated power is exercised. Judges have power by virtue of their institutional position and the political independence invested in this position. Researchers are able to exercise power based on their institutional credentials and claims to have professional knowledge of the relevant scientific research, bureaucrats exercise power through their role as financial gatekeepers and their relationship with government. The SIS prototype exercises power by virtue of the possibilities and limitations offered by the technology in the classification, storage and retrieval of data. Law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1362480612465767">6</xref></sup> Science, Government and Technology are all institutions which have an existence which is to an extent independent of the individuals working in these institutions. However, the great strength of an ANT approach is that it insists that the social world is assembled by action. Actors negotiate, persuade, advise, inform, compromise, issue invitations, make requests and so on, and through these actions the project is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362480612465767">Latour, 2005</xref>: 72). Actors are not mere intermediaries, passing on some structurally located text, actors are mediators whose actions effect translations from one state of affairs to another. Power only operates through these translations.</p>

<sec id="section6-1362480612465767">
<title>Individualized sentencing</title>
<p>The following section provides a brief account of what is meant by ‘individualized sentencing’ as an approach to accounting for the delivery of justice. The design of the SIS required a shift away from this traditional approach to sentencing which is widely used across western jurisdictions. Although one of the main attractions for judges of an Information System approach to sentencing reform is that it allows them to retain their discretion, nevertheless, the construction of the database requires judges not only to think about sentencing in a different way but to design tools to represent sentencing in a different way.</p>
<p>‘Individualized sentencing’ is sometimes used to mean the process of crafting a sentence to achieve particular correctional aims for an individual offender. I am using the term differently here, as a justification for a particular approach to sentencing. Under this approach, the court produces a just sanction by taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances of each unique individual case. There are potentially hundreds if not thousands of ‘relevant’ factors which can be taken into account and while in Scotland there are sentencing encyclopaedias and volumes of Law Reports, there is no developed jurisprudence of sentencing which provides a set of ‘rules’ for determining the seriousness of any case. An account of a decision provided in a written judgment will typically narrate the facts and circumstances of the case and end by saying that in the light of these the sentence of the court is X.</p>
<p>An Australian court has famously described the process as ‘instinctive synthesis’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1362480612465767">7</xref></sup> As Judge McHugh puts it in his judgment in the <italic>Markarian</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1362480612465767">8</xref></sup> case,
<disp-quote><p>There is no objectively correct sentence, only a range of sentences that the majority of experienced judges would agree applied to the case. … There is no Aladdin’s cave of accurate sentencing methodology … There is only human judgement based on all of the facts of the case, the judge’s experience, the data derived from comparable sentences, and the guidelines and principles authoritatively laid down in statutes and authoritative judgements.</p>
<attrib>(<italic>Markarian</italic>, 2005: 71)</attrib></disp-quote></p>
<p>Note that the judge refers to ‘the data derived from comparable sentences’. This is an unusual admission in a sentencing judgment but it recognizes the desirability of ensuring that similar cases receive similar sanctions and therefore the importance of consistency as an important principle of sentencing. The SIS was designed to improve consistency (or at least to enable an account of the pursuit of consistency to be articulated)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1362480612465767">9</xref></sup> and to provide reliable access to these data. Judges in Scotland, and in most other jurisdictions, do not have access to comprehensive data about sentencing for past cases. They can consult their memories and can refer to published court reports and may be able to locate cases which share some characteristics, almost certainly based only on offence characteristics, with the case they have at hand to sentence, but they will not be able to search a database to retrieve all such cases in a comprehensive and systematic manner.</p>
<p>Individualized sentencing delivers one key component of a liberal theory of just sentencing, that is, that the punishment should fit the crime (and the criminal) but it does not deliver another key element of the same theory, namely that sentencing should demonstrate fairness and equal treatment of similarly situated offenders who should receive similar sanctions, that is, consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362480612465767">Hutton, 1995</xref>). The design of a Sentencing Information System requires the development of categories or classifications which allow cases to be defined as similar or different. This is at odds with the individualized sentencing approach which eschews any attempts to establish categories of similar cases and insists on dealing with cases on their individual merits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1362480612465767">10</xref></sup> The design of a SIS therefore involves a translation from one approach to enacting justice to a different approach. However, it is important to repeat that the SIS does not interfere with judicial discretion in sentencing. It provides information which can be used by judges to improve consistency in sentencing, it does not provide the ‘correct’ sentence. So although the task of constructing the database requires judges to think differently about sentencing and to generate classifications which have no legal authority, using a method which is unfamiliar to them, and, in effect, generate a different decision-making frame of reference for sentencing, at the same time, the construction of the system has no immediate impact on their familiar individualized sentencing approach.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612465767">Aas (2005)</xref> tends to idealize individualized sentencing as a human approach to sentencing which she contrasts with what she takes to be the de-humanized approach deployed by guidelines and Information Systems. However, one problem with individualized sentencing is that it leaves open the possibility of the all too human characteristics of bias, prejudice and unequal treatment, all of which are damaging to a liberal definition of justice. The SIS offered a way of retaining judicial discretion but at the same time enabling judges to demonstrate their concern to pursue consistency.</p>

<title>The SIS project: stage one: feasibility study</title>
<p>It is helpful to begin with a brief description of the entities involved in the project.</p>
<sec id="section8-1362480612465767">
<title>The research team</title>
<p>Three members of staff from the University of Strathclyde Law School: a professor with strong connections to the judiciary and interests in IT applications to law, a sociologist of law and a politics and law graduate who together had recently completed a study of sentencing disparity and a computer scientist, previously unknown to any of the law school colleagues, who was recruited through internal contacts within the university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1362480612465767">
<title>The judiciary</title>
<p>There were 27 High Court judges at the time of the project. The project was instigated by the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Ross, who was the second most senior judge and who has responsibility for criminal matters. The High Court deals with the most serious 5 per cent of crimes and most of those sentenced receive custodial sentences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1362480612465767">
<title>The funders</title>
<p>The first project was funded by the Central Research Unit of the Scottish Office, at that time, an in-house unit of government officials which commissioned research and conducted its own internal research projects. The second two stages of the project were funded by the Scottish Courts Administration, the government department responsible for the operation the courts, latterly this became an agency known as the Scottish Courts Service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1362480612465767">
<title>The technology</title>
<p>Sentencing Information Systems had been previously built in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362480612465767">Doob, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362480612465767">Hogarth, 1988</xref>) and New South Wales in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362480612465767">Chan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362480612465767">Potas, 1991</xref>). By 1993, when the feasibility project began, there had been significant advances in ICT which offered opportunities to enhance such systems, including data compression which allowed greater flexibility and speed in accessing data, the development of networks and remote access (although these were not ultimately used in this project) and the availability of smaller, cheaper laptop computers. Many of the technologies considered innovative in 1993 have since been overtaken by more recent innovations, notably the internet and portable devices.</p>

<title>Articulating the problem and engaging the interests of the entities</title>
<p>How did the prototype SIS come to look the way it did? How was its form and content designed and developed? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612465767">Callon (1986)</xref> argues that a research project begins with a problem to be solved. What was the problem in the SIS project? How was it defined and by whom?</p>
<p>The ‘problem’ in the feasibility project was first articulated by the Lord Justice Clerk. He had seen a demonstration of the New South Wales Sentencing Information System at an overseas conference. At that time, some of the Scottish judges shared a concern that the then Secretary of State for Scotland intended to introduce some form of sentencing guidelines, probably in the form of mandatory minimum sentences, to Scotland. Scottish judges were (and still are) fiercely protective of what they see as their independence from the executive. There has never been an executive driven sentencing policy in Scotland. While Parliament has legislated to regulate aspects of sentencing procedure and has set maximum penalties for some statutory offences, judges have very wide discretion over sentencing decisions for individual cases. The Lord Justice Clerk took the view that if the judges took the initiative in developing a database of past practice to help them to pursue greater consistency in sentencing, this might make it politically more difficult for the Secretary of State to introduce mandatory sentences which would damage what the judges perceived as their independence. His question to the university team can be paraphrased as follows: can a prototype SIS be designed and built for the High Court which would provide judges with access to the sentencing decisions of previous cases but which would leave their discretion and independence intact?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1362480612465767">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Lord Justice Clerk was aware of relevant research interests and experience in the Law School at the University of Strathclyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612465767">Hutton and Tata, 1998</xref>). It is unusual in Scotland for judges to invite academics to conduct research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1362480612465767">12</xref></sup> The fact that the initial approach came from the judiciary was important both in building an alliance between the judiciary and the research team and also in securing funding from the Government. The three academics recruited a colleague, previously unknown to them, from the department of Computer Science who had a track record of publications in computer science related to the technical skills necessary to build a database and user interface, although none of this work had anything to do with judicial sentencing.</p>
<p>The research team made informal enquiries about funding a potential research project to the Scottish Office Central Research Unit (CRU) which had funded the previous sentencing research project and later submitted a research proposal, drawn up in collaboration with the Lord Justice Clerk, which received approval in 1993. The aim of the project was ‘to assess the feasibility of designing a Sentencing Information System, along the lines of the NSW model, for the High Court’. The meaning of ‘feasibility’ later turned out to be a key issue, although the research team were not aware of the funders’ interpretation until after the first phase of the project had been completed.</p>
<p>The research team’s ‘translation’ of feasibility was that the best way to test feasibility was to work with judges to design and build a prototype which judges would be able to use in a practical, hands-on way. This is how the proposal was framed and indeed how all three projects were conducted. However when the draft report of the project was submitted to the CRU in 1995, concern was expressed that the research team had not provided a range of options from which the Scottish Office could choose, but instead had presented the Scottish Office with a fait accompli: take it or leave it. This decision by the research team drove the project in a particular direction which was approved and supported by the judiciary and was what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362480612465767">Callon (1986)</xref> has called an ‘obligatory passage point’, that is, once this stage had been reached and progress beyond it agreed, the stage would become unquestioned and serve as the basis for the future stages of the project.</p>
<p>The research proposal was based on the research team’s translation of the existing scientific knowledge, that is, the research literature on sentencing and on Sentencing Information Systems. On the basis of this evidence, the research team took the methodological decision to build a working prototype in collaboration with the judiciary. This satisfied the academic desire to build on previous research and further expand knowledge and at the same time was perceived by the research team to meet the needs of the judiciary.</p>

<title>The deployment of scientific knowledge</title>
<p>The university team were entrusted by both the judiciary and the CRU with writing the research proposal based on existing knowledge of Sentencing Information Systems and ICT. The proposal was built on two bodies of ‘scientific research’: sentencing research and database research. The sentencing research was based on a literature review which had informed the methodology for the recently completed project by two members of the research team, a report of which was at that time still being prepared for submission to the Scottish Office Central Research Unit which funded the project. This project had developed an original methodology for representing and comparing seriousness, which, at this stage, had neither been subject to peer review nor even been published. A project report was submitted in 1994, some time after the SIS project had been approved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1362480612465767">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The research team had drawn two central conclusions from their review of the research literature.</p>
<list id="list1-1362480612465767" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The data used for the system had to be in a form which would be useful to judges for sentencing. The NSW system used existing data which was neither designed for, nor in the view of the research team, helpful for sentencing purposes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Judges had to be closely involved in the design and construction of the system. The reports from the Canadian systems suggested three main reasons for their failure: the lack of an institutional home for the systems; the clumsiness of the technology; and the failure to engage judges sufficiently in the design of the systems. The SIS research team were determined to learn from this. The team could do little about providing an institutional home for the system beyond lobbying the judges and the officials. However the team were confident that technological advances could cure the clumsiness issue and were determined to ensure that consultation and engagement with the judiciary became a central focus of the project to address the third issue which emerged from the Canadian experience.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both of these conclusions were central to the team’s approach to writing the research proposal.</p>
<p>An Information System could have been constructed using existing data collected to serve the needs of the prosecution authority and court administration. Such a system would have been cheaper and easier to build and would have provided some measure of support to enable judges to pursue greater consistency in sentencing. The NSW database used these sorts of data. The research team, however, believed that the equivalent Scottish data would not be helpful to judges because the data would be too broad to provide any useful guidance. For example, retrieving all cases of assault would generate a very large sample of cases with sentencing varying from non-custodial sentences to sentences of 12 years and more. The research team argued that it was necessary to develop new classifications which would, in a case of assault for example, allow judges to retrieve ‘bundles’ of assault cases which they perceived to be of broadly similar seriousness. The researchers felt that this form of data would meet the sentencing needs of judges and that therefore it was necessary to work with judges to design the classifications. Judges would decide what factors should be collected from the case papers and also how information should be retrieved from the database.</p>
<p>The available ICT made it possible, both technically and financially, to collect ‘new’ data retrospectively from court records and design an interface which would allow users to retrieve the data in a very flexible manner. The information recorded in the court records set an absolute limit on the information that judges could request. Once the judges had agreed a classification system, this was used to re-classify information from the court records which was then transferred into digital form. The software allowed users to access this information in a very flexible way. For example, a judge dealing with a case which involved the robbery of a shop of less than £500 where a weapon was used but no injury sustained, could retrieve data for all robberies, all robberies of shops, all robberies of shops where a weapon was used and so on, thereby building up pictures of sentencing levels for broadly similar cases which would help to situate the case at hand. The research team, in consultation with the judges, took the view that this approach avoided the problem of developing an objective definition of similarity, but rather allowed judges to use different definitions to develop a picture of sentencing patterns against which they could assess the relative seriousness of the individual case before them.</p>
<p>Although the judiciary ‘signed up’ to the research proposal, it was never clear that they had any particular enthusiasm for the proposed methodology, nor that they shared the research team’s definition of usefulness. It could be argued that the judiciary were well aware that the only threat to their discretion came from sentencing legislation. As long as the SIS remained purely advisory, there was no threat to their traditional sentencing practice.</p>
<p>This approach satisfied the desire of the researchers to produce something which was original and which would advance knowledge of how to use information to support an individualized approach to sentencing. The research team successfully persuaded the judiciary and the CRU that this was the appropriate way forward. Thus although the Lord Justice Clerk was a vital catalyst in the initial stages of problematization, interessement and enrolment, the research team performed this role in the next stage. The research team devised the detailed methodology, which was novel, and had been scientifically tested only in a very recently completed project. It was this methodology which defined the basic structural architecture of the SIS which was to remain fundamentally unchanged, although enhanced and augmented, throughout the rest of the project. After this stage, there was little likelihood of reverting to a system based on existing sentencing data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1362480612465767">
<title>Engaging interests and securing enrolment</title>
<p>In order for the SIS to become a reality, alliances needed to be forged. Sacrifices had to be made and risks accepted in order to allow these alliances to proceed. The alliances were contingent and temporary. The SIS was not yet an object, it was only an emergent possibility. Yet its emergent potential was an actor/entity in the problematization stage. It acted, though it existed only in the emergent form of plans, ideas, proposals, some publicly embodied in documents produced by the research team and others expressed in collective discussions and conversations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1362480612465767">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The research team sought a number of outcomes from the project. The IT researcher was interested in further developing techniques of data compression and retrieval. The Law School researchers had an interest in enhancing the reputation of the school with the judiciary, reinforcing the academic reputation of the Law School for research in IT and Law, and developing opportunities for access to a normally inaccessible research site and intellectually challenging research developing existing work in an under-researched area. On the negative side, researchers would have to work across disciplines, would have to deal with the tension between judicial independence and bureaucratic demands from government funders, were aware that there would be potential difficulty in publishing results and might have to cede an element of control over the research method to judges or government officials and thereby lose academic credibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1362480612465767">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Judges might avoid legislative interference with their discretion but would have to work in a way which was professionally uncomfortable for them, work with non-judges and learn to use computers. Perhaps most importantly, they would put at risk what they perceived to be their historically established ‘ownership’ of sentencing. However, the risk was very low. It was unlikely that the prototype would progress from a research project to become a working tool of the court. If this did happen, it would only be advisory unless legislation was introduced which in some way placed a statutory obligation on judges to make use of the system.</p>
<p>The potential funders would be under pressure to fund research requested by the judiciary, but would have to demonstrate value for money to their political masters and would be wary of the pressures that judicial independence may place on their bureaucratic goals and wary of their lack of control over the methods of the project and lack of control over lifetime costs, should the project move from the feasibility stage. With most research projects this would not be an issue but as this project was initiated and supported by the judiciary, from an official’s point of view, there was an outside chance that the feasibility study might grow into something permanent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1362480612465767">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Is technology an actor?</title>
<p>In what sense did the technology ‘act’ as opposed to being an object which was used by human actors? ANT has been criticized for understanding things as social actors. To a sociologist, attributing the properties normally associated with human actors to inert things seems artificial. It may be that this stance taken by Latour is intended to provoke sociologists to pay greater attention to the power of technologies to shape social life, without succumbing to technological determinism. For the purposes of this case study, it is helpful to understand ICT as ‘acting’ though not to suggest that this action is the same as human action. Human actors are normally held to exercise choice, the possibility of behaving otherwise, at least in principle, and ICT clearly does not have this capacity. In this case study, the ICT certainly did not negotiate, but it did set limits and offer possibilities and, as described below, when a prototype was built, its physical presence was more persuasive than its previous existence as mere text.</p>
<p>However it is equally important to insist that ICT did not determine the shape and content of the SIS. This was formed by the assembling actions of all of the actors. It is also true to say that the non-technical actors, were heavily reliant on the expertise of the computer scientist to understand both what the technology made possible and what it could not deliver. However, it is helpful to conceive of the ICT as offering potential and setting limits independently of any mediating work performed by the research team or the judiciary in their interpretations of the technology. The technology allowed large volumes of data to be stored and retrieved both quickly and flexibly. Flexibility of data retrieval allowed both researchers and judges to avoid the problem of creating fixed categories of cases held to be of similar seriousness. For the researchers this offered a novel way of thinking about the provision of support for individualized sentencing. For judges, this avoided the undesirable task of creating what might be seen as an ‘unofficial’ codification of Scots’ criminal law, a task which was not part of their job description. However technology also placed limitations on what might be achieved. At that time it was not possible to produce a web-based database with remote access through portable devices which could be continuously updated. The SIS relied on data being stored on floppy disks. These were used to provide updates to be installed on users’ laptop machines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1362480612465767">
<title>Hands-on experience</title>
<p>In the early stages of the project the ICT was represented in documents, texts, flow charts and computer code written by the research team. There was an air of unreality about these words, numbers and diagrams for at least the non-technical actors involved in the project. Later, the papers were translated into digital material and presented in an electronic form which allowed users to manipulate the data practically. In the first series of seminars with the judiciary, the research team were able to demonstrate the NSW database and also a mock preliminary version of what the Scottish SIS might look like on a computer. In a series of seminars later in 1994, judges had an opportunity to use the prototype model which the research team had produced. This model used real data collected from the court records. In the next stage of the project, four judges, two from the sub-group and two other experienced judges, were provided with laptop computers and asked to test the prototype system for one month. This was intended to inform the study of feasibility and the period of systematic testing which the SIS would have to undergo before any future implementation of the system.</p>
<p>The research team wanted to demonstrate to the judges that the SIS was a practical possibility and thus wanted to allow judges to have a hands-on experience which would convince them that the SIS would be easy to use and remove any doubts about their capacity to operate the computer technology. This was a key decision. Arguably, the existence of a working prototype made the further development of the project more likely. Had the research project produced a text outlining a number of options and recording judicial reactions to these, it would have been easier for both judges and funders to withdraw support from the project. The construction of a prototype with ‘real’ data transformed the SIS from text into digital material on floppy disks and laptop computers (at that time still relatively uncommon machines). To non-ICT specialists, the ICT generated a capacity to engage with the data which was both somewhat magical and also intensely practical. In this sense, it is helpful to think of the ICT as an actor contributing to the process of assembly. The physical presence of the SIS was difficult to resist</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1362480612465767">
<title>Assembling the prototype SIS: the translation from individualized sentencing to representing similarity of seriousness</title>
<p>The Lord Justice Clerk recruited two colleagues (out of 25 judges) to join him in the judicial sub-group which worked with the university research team to produce an initial set of classifications. The group met regularly with the university team and exchanged documentation and comments as the classifications were developed. These three judges thus ‘represented’ their judicial colleagues. The decisions which they made on the architecture and design of the system were made on behalf of the other judges, and not just the remainder of the existing High Court judges but, potentially at least, their successors.</p>
<p>The research team and the judicial sub-group deployed a particular translation of the research literature to produce a prototype system. The detailed classifications were produced by the judicial sub-group and the research team. The research team finalized this and presented it to all the judges and latterly the funders and the scientific community of sentencing researchers and computer scientists. There were expressions of scepticism and dissent to some of the proposed classifications in the judicial seminars, but these did not translate into a coherent opposition to the plans. Thus the crucial choice of the fundamental architecture of the SIS was effectively designed by a small number of judges.</p>
<p>The SIS ‘works’ by allowing judges to search the database for cases which are ‘similar’ to a case at hand. The SIS does not provide an objective definition of ‘similarity’ but a flexible approach to representing similarity. Thus for example, a judge faced with a burglary case, can first look at all burglaries and then further refine the search by adding factors such as the use of a weapon, the extent of injury, the value of property stolen and so on. As there are very many factors involved, searching for an exactly ‘similar’ case may produce a very small number of results when in fact there are many more cases which are broadly similar but which differ on matters of detail, for example the use of a sharp weapon rather than a blunt instrument. In consultation with the judicial sub-group, the research team developed a classification system designed to represent the nature and ‘seriousness’ of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612465767">Tata et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Translation from an intuitive, individualized sentencing approach to the design of a database which gathers cases into groups of similar seriousness raises many challenges. In order to design the database, judges have to learn to think about sentencing in a new and unfamiliar way. They need to think not about an individual case, but about how to define a ‘bundle’ of cases which can be treated as broadly similar for sentencing purposes. The task of defining these classes is not governed by legal rules. There is no correct answer. There are no objectively accurate classifications. Judges are being asked to perform a task for which they have not been trained, which is therefore outside their professional expertise and about which they may feel uncomfortable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1362480612465767">17</xref></sup> The classifications need to include the most important determinants of seriousness, but cannot include all of the factors which might impact on seriousness. One practical reason for this is that information about factors such as the demeanour of the offender in court, and other biographical information are either never available from the court papers or only sometimes available. More importantly, the more factors included in the system and used in searches, the smaller the number of cases which will be retrieved. Many ‘similar’ cases will be ‘missed’.</p>
<p>The classifications which were used to collect and retrieve the data were developed by the research team in collaboration with the judicial sub-group. The research team would ask the judges to list the factors which were important in the assessment of seriousness of a particular type of case. Typically, judges attempted to provide an exhaustive account of all of the factors which might potentially impinge on the assessment of seriousness. The research team saw their role as pressing judges to limit themselves to the most important factors. To take another example, when four judges tested the prototype for a month, one of their main suggestions for improvement was the addition of more textual information at the level of the individual case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1362480612465767">18</xref></sup> Again, the judges’ idea of a useful SIS is one which supported their familiar individualized approach to sentencing by providing as much information as possible about each individual case. The research team’s definition of usefulness was the provision of more intuitively useful categories of broadly similar cases. The prototype was able to accommodate both of these translations of ‘usefulness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1362480612465767">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Judgements about the classifications are judgements about their utility, not about whether they are right or wrong. Judges are used to making decisions which are correct. The performance of the decision confers legal authority (subject of course to appeal to a higher court). Decisions about guideline classifications are policy decisions and are evaluated on their utility. Will they enable judges to locate cases of similar seriousness? Will they help to achieve greater consistency in sentencing? It is not that judges are either incapable or unwilling to take on these tasks, but that the tasks require a different way of thinking about sentencing from the traditional intuitive synthesis approach and some judges may find this difficult and uncomfortable. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612465767">Freeman (2009</xref>: 440) says, translation is ‘a science of adequacy: it works according to equivalence not deduction; it entails writing and thinking in terms of function not cause. Its epistemology is rooted in pragmatics not logic.’</p>
<p>The SIS offered a means of operationalizing seriousness which enabled judges to retrieve cases ‘similar’ to the case they had before them by looking both at patterns of sentencing for broadly similar cases and by locating individual cases which shared as many factors as possible with the case at hand. There was no objective definition of ‘similar seriousness’, nor was the definition left to the subjective intuition of each individual judge. The SIS provided a flexible means of examining similarity, which allowed individual judges to engage in dialogue with past practice and thereby shift sentencing towards greater consistency without ever settling on an objective definition. Consistency is thus an ideal goal but one which can never be achieved in practice. To non-lawyers this might look like the antithesis of law, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362480612465767">Robertson (1998)</xref> has shown, uncertainty is at the heart of legal decision making and ‘hard cases’ are often value choices rather than logically produced solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1362480612465767">20</xref></sup> Be this as it may, while judges are accustomed to work with such uncertainties on a daily basis in criminal sentencing, they are not accustomed to either articulating these issues or to seeking solutions.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about this is to consider sentencing as a professional practice with its own cultural logic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612465767">Abbot (1988)</xref> argues that medical practitioners use a probabilistic approach when making a diagnosis. They begin with the most likely diagnosis based on initial review of symptoms and if this does not work, take account of additional symptoms which lead to a more unusual diagnosis, that is, a less common ailment. Criminal cases are also mostly routine, so judges can make an initial assessment of the broad type of case and then look more closely at the detail to ascertain whether the case is significantly different from the routine sort of case to justify a different sentence. Professional logic thus uses a probabilistic hierarchy from common to esoteric and not a logical hierarchy from general to specific. Medical practitioners can articulate this probabilistic hierarchy, but judges cannot because they have no language for characterizing ‘typical’ cases. One way of thinking about the SIS is as an attempt to provide judges with a means of articulating a set of classifications which would define criminal cases in a way which was helpful for the purposes of sentencing (rather than for the purposes of arrest and prosecution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612465767">Abbot, 1988</xref>: 41; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362480612465767">Tata et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The mass of information in the court records which had been gathered and presented to meet the legal and professional demands of prosecutors and court administrators was thus translated into a structured body of information which could be manipulated to represent ‘similarity of seriousness’ for the purposes of pursuing more consistent sentencing decision making. This translation required displacing the court data, displacing the way judges conventionally approach sentencing and displacing academic researchers into toolmakers. The SIS classification system produced by a handful of researchers and a small group of judges, mobilized the whole population of High Court judges. Scientific colleagues were presented with the classification system as a product of judicial and academic collaboration.</p>

<sec id="section18-1362480612465767" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion: assembling the SIS</title>
<p>There are two main conclusions to be drawn from this case study. The first is that the SIS harnesses human and non-human actors to generate an account of justice in sentencing, which is different to that produced by the individualized sentencing approach. The SIS does not interfere with judicial discretion but provides a structure to which judges can refer to generate accounts which emphasize the value of consistency in sentencing, a value which remains silent in the individualized sentencing approach.</p>
<p>A problem was defined and shared: ‘Can an Information System be designed and built to support judicial sentencing practice?’ Researchers from a range of disciplines, judges and government authorities generated associations which produced a prototype, developed and revised the prototype into a working database and implemented this as a sentencing support tool in the High Court. The content and form of the database were generated through the collaborative activities of an interdisciplinary team of academic researchers, judges, government officials and the technology itself. Judicial discretion remained unaffected, and the database offered a different approach to harnessing human judgement and technological capacity to serve the delivery of justice.</p>
<p>The SIS harnessed the information processing power of ICT to support the traditional individualized approach to sentencing and at the same time provide the court with the ability to pursue greater consistency with past practice. The classificatory system and the underpinning architecture of the SIS was designed and developed by human actors, not dictated by technological imperatives. While ICT offered opportunities to use information in innovative ways to support sentencing, and played a part in the shaping of the SIS, it did not determine the shape of the SIS, far less transform judicial discretion into ‘sentencing by computer’. The SIS supports a ‘human’ approach to sentencing rather than stripping out the human element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612465767">Aas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The second conclusion is that this case study demonstrates the value of a close examination of the processes through which the social world is assembled which cautions against the danger of exaggerating the causal impact of any particular social structures. This case study shows how change can occur when interests are mobilized. The lens provided by an ANT approach makes visible the translations which moved the project along and through which the SIS took on a specific shape and form until it became a real-life judicial support tool, albeit for a brief moment. The analysis provides fleeting glimpses of how the world might have been otherwise but at the same time shows how the world came to be as it was: a different research team might have used existing sentencing data for the SIS, as had been done in New South Wales; had the retirement of the first Lord Justice Clerk been delayed for a couple of years, the management and sustainability of the system might have been given a higher priority; the decision to proceed with the second phase of implementation took two years and could have gone the other way. But of course none of these things happened.</p>
<p>The value of an ANT approach is that it shows how the social world is assembled. However, Latour’s reluctance to recognize that individual actors act as members of institutions and not as isolated individuals, limits the utility of the method for understanding how power operates through mundane social practices in assembling the social world. The recognition of structure does not mean that structures are fixed and unchanging, nor that they are determinate, nor that they can be used uncritically to explain social stability or social change. The social world is constantly being assembled. It is both stable and changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362480612465767">Cowan and Carr, 2008</xref>: 152). An ANT method is particularly helpful to focus analytic attention on change and the potential for change but also shows how stability endures.</p>

The important difference is that constructionism is often associated with a critical or debunking approach. For Latour, the assembling of the social (whether it be scientific research, law or whatever), is an achievement to be admired and celebrated, rather than debunked.

<p>The first stage of implementation of the SIS began in 1995 and the second in 2000 after a three year delay due mainly to a change of personnel within the judiciary. It was implemented in the High Court in 2002 under the authority of the judiciary but without any additional administrative or managerial support. Since then it has been difficult to find out what has happened to the SIS. Enquiries by the Sentencing Commission for Scotland, which operated between 2003 and 2006, suggested that data entry to the Information System which was to be taken over by senior court clerks had not, as the research team had warned, been entirely reliable and that judges were therefore not making regular use of the system. The Commission recommended that the Scottish government, in consultation with the Lord Justice General, should determine the future for the system. There has been no further action on this determination.

<p>Although human and non-human actors are treated symmetrically in ANT, that does not mean that they are the same. Latour elides distinctions between non-human and human actors to insist on the capacity for action of non-human entities, usually ignored in sociology. It may be that this rhetorical intention is a bit lost when translated into English. I am not suggesting that floppy disks or software code enter into negotiation, but I do suggest that they ‘act’ in the sense of offering possibilities and placing limitations on how data can be recorded, stored and retrieved. Like other actors their effects are mediated through the actions of other actors.</p>

<p>In my view, ‘instinctive synthesis’ should not be understood as an accurate empirical description of how judges go about making sentencing decisions. Sentencing is a social practice as well as an individual practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362480612465767">Hutton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362480612465767">Tata, 2007</xref>). Judges understand cases as more or less typical versions of familiar situations and are aware of ‘going rates’ for these cases. Individualized sentencing is understood here as a means of justifying an approach to sentencing. This says that just sentencing decisions can only be produced on a case by case basis because each case is unique.</p>

<p>So the ‘problem’ for the judges was motivated by a desire for a reform option which was softer, that is, less intrusive on their discretion, than mandatory minimum sentences. The research team shared the aim of leaving discretion unconstrained, but the team’s notion of the ‘problem’ involved the added component of the desire to develop a novel approach to the design of an SIS which would learn from the research evidence about the limitations of earlier systems.</p>

<p>It is more common for researchers to experience difficulties in securing access for research with the judiciary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612465767">Ashworth et al., 1984</xref>).</p>

<p>The final report of the project was not published by the Scottish Office until 1996 and an academic article followed in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362480612465767">Hutton and Tata, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>‘By definition, a technological project is a work of fiction, since at the outset, it does not exist, and there is no way that it can exist yet because it is in the project phase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362480612465767">Latour, 1996</xref>: 21). It is helpful to think of the SIS as emergent, but it is not a fiction. At this stage it has an existence as a plan, albeit a plan which is contentious and is perceived differently by different actors.</p>

<p>These might be described as the opportunities and challenges which faced the academic participants as they engaged in ‘public criminology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362480612465767">Loader and Sparks, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>In a White Paper ‘Firm and fair; Improving the delivery of justice in Scotland’, published in June 1994, the Government welcomed the High Court initiative to look at the feasibility of a Sentencing Information System and indicated that if it was deemed successful the Government would ‘keep in view’ the case for similar developments in other courts.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1362480612465767">

<p>Discomfort arises because individualized sentencing, insisting as it does that each case is unique, has no language to talk about consistency, no benchmarks against which to assess similarity in any general way. This does not mean that in their everyday sentencing decision-making judges necessarily feel any discomfort.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1362480612465767">

<p>At a later stage of the project judges were invited to produce brief explanations for their sentencing decisions which were added to the database. These were known as ‘purple passages’.</p>

<p>In ANT terminology the SIS can be seen as a ‘boundary object’, objects which cross boundaries and connect different worlds. Defined by Star and Griesemer (1989: 393 quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362480612465767">Freeman, 2009</xref>: 436) as follows, ‘objects which both inhabit several intersecting social worlds and satisfy the informational requirements of each’.</p>
