<p>Jenny Rinehart and Elizabeth Yeater’s article on factors affecting young women’s perceptions of sexual assault risk opens this issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic>. Rinehart and Yeater asked a sample of college women to rate vignettes in terms of the risk to women that each portrayed. They examined several factors that may affect the women’s perceptions of risk, including the physical attractiveness of the man as described in the vignette and whether or not the study participants had themselves been previously victimized. Interestingly, they found that the attractiveness of the man did not affect risk perception in vignettes that described high-risk scenarios, and in vignettes with low-risk scenarios the women were less likely to rate the vignette as risky if the man was attractive, although the difference was not statistically significant. The participants’ personal experiences of victimization also did not affect their risk perception, but Rinehart and Yeater found that women with more liberal sexual attitudes rated the vignettes as less risky compared with women with more conservative sexual attitudes. As they point out, since risk perception often corresponds to risk-taking behavior, this finding raises concerns and should be incorporated into prevention programming.</p>
<p>Lindsay Orchowski and Christine Gidycz examine factors that influence sexual assault survivors’ likelihood of disclosing victimization as well as in whom they are most likely to confide. Orchowski and Gidycz’s study is important in that the researchers use both retrospective and prospective analyses. Among a sample of college women, they explore the effects of adolescent sexual victimization and sexual victimization experiences over a 7-month interim to follow-up data collection. They report that a sizeable percentage of the women told no one about their victimization, even victimization that had occurred when they were as young as 14. Very few told their parents or any formal help provider; none of the women had reported the victimization to the police. If they did disclose, most disclosed to a female peer, and they did so immediately after or in the first few weeks following the assault. Orchowski and Gidycz also identify several factors that influence willingness to disclose, including coping with stressful situations by seeking emotional support, attachment, tendency to disclose stressful information, level of acquaintance with the perpetrator, and victim’s and perpetrator’s alcohol use at the time of the assault.</p>
<p>Alcohol consumption among female victims of interpersonal violence also figures prominently in Lauren Kaplan, Terrence Hill, and Gini Mann-Deibert’s article in this issue. Kaplan et al.’s sample differs, though, from Orchowski and Gidycz’s sample. Kaplan and her colleagues use data from a longitudinal study of low-income women with children in three major U.S. cities. As they point out, research consistently shows that interpersonal violence victimization is associated with poorer subsequent mental health, but their analysis examines the mediating effects of alcohol consumption. Their findings show that heavy drinking can exacerbate the mental health consequences of interpersonal violence, with women who report greater frequency of intoxication along with sexual coercion before age 18 as well as past year experiences of psychological aggression and minor physical assault also reporting greater psychological distress. They urge practitioners to screen for and treat both interpersonal violence and heavy alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Nareadi Phasha and Doris Nyokangi discuss the results of their study of school-based sexual violence among female learners with mild intellectual disabilities in South Africa. Their small sample of 16 women, aged 16 to 24, reported a high incidence of sexual abuse perpetrated by male peers. And contrary to popular belief, these young women were quite aware of the abusiveness of the various behaviors, although many felt powerless to do anything to stop it. Contributing to this sense of powerlessness are school policies that reinforce the problem rather than remedy it. Phasha and Nuokangi, for instance, discuss school administrators’ concerns with keeping such incidents quiet so as not to damage the reputation of the schools, along with “partnering” programs that match young female and male learners in social and romantic relationships that the young men at least perceive as giving them license to abuse young women. One wonders, too, how much abuse these young women may experience at the hands of school staff, although Phasha and Nyokangi do not address this issue.</p>
<p>Duncan McDuie-Ra examines violence against ethnic minority women in Northeast India, an area that has become increasingly militarized. McDuie-Ra emphasizes how many who study violence against women in India argue that a general patriarchal culture and social structure are to blame for high rates of victimization. As well, militarization is frequently blamed for violence against women. But the author argues that neither of these factors alone is sufficient to explain the violent victimization of ethnic minority women in Northeast India. Instead, McDuie-Ra presents a convincing analysis, highlighting in particular a “frontier culture of violence” that dominates the region and how violence against women is both experienced and contested there.</p>
<p>Suneeta Krishnan, Kalyani Subbiah, Sajida Khanum, Prabha Chandra, and Nancy Padian, in the last article in this issue, also report on research from India, but from a different region—Bengaluru in Southern India. Krishnan and her colleagues present their study of the development and assessment of an intergenerational women’s empowerment intervention to reduce domestic violence and its negative health consequences for victims. As the researchers emphasize, prevention and intervention efforts, particularly in societies such as India with extended family households, will not be effective if they only target victims and abusers; they must also include other family members and be cognizant of community contexts. The program they discuss recognizes the importance of a woman’s mother-in-law—her status in the family and her power to intervene in violent or potentially violent situations—for addressing and preventing domestic violence. Krishnan et al.’s research offers optimism that intergenerational programming that includes both mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law are feasible, safe, and can effectively mitigate domestic violence and its adverse health consequences at least in Southern Indian communities.</p>
