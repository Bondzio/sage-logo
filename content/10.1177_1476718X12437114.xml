<abstract>
<p>Training of quality early childhood development (ECD) teachers is paramount in ensuring quality ECD service provision. This exploratory study focuses on the gains and challenges met in the implementation of the Uganda ECD teacher training framework. Data were obtained using questionnaires and interviews from principals and tutors of ECD teacher training institutions (<italic>n</italic> = 106) who participated in a framework familiarization workshop. Results indicated some gains in use of the framework, while other areas still need more support for it to be effectively implemented. Major challenges were found in institutional management and administrative set ups, tutor competencies, and trainee assessment. The article concludes with specific recommendations for technical assistance to promote effective implementation of framework so as to produce better ECD teachers in Uganda.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The aim of early childhood development (ECD) (also known as pre-primary education) in Uganda is to develop children’s capabilities, healthy physical growth and good social habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>). Although ECD covers children in the age range of 0–8 years, ECD centres (schools for young children) take up children from 0 to 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12437114">Ministry of Education &amp; Sports (MoES), 2008</xref>). Emphasis in ECD centres is on moral development, imagination, self-reliance, thinking power, appreciation of cultural backgrounds, customs, language and communication skills in the mother tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), 2005</xref>). Although most parents wish their children to be first taught reading, writing and arithmetic, these skills are not emphasized at this level of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2005</xref>). This is because the thematic curriculum used in lower primary schools for children of 6–8 years has taken care of literacy and numeracy as its main focus using local language as the medium of instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12437114">Smart, 2006</xref>). The personnel who take care of children in ECD centres are therefore supposed to take cognizance of the level scope to avoid exposing children to content of a level they are not at (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In Uganda, ECD centres are either home based, in centres or institutionalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X12437114">2007b</xref>). All personnel who work in ECD centres are referred to as caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>). However, caregivers who work in institutions like children’s homes or orphanages are also sometimes called child care workers while those who work in schools or centres are called teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>). The major role of all caregivers is to provide a stimulating environment to enhance children’s holistic growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2005</xref>). ECD teachers also have the additional responsibility of helping children develop good morals, love for the country, appropriate language and mathematics concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2005</xref>). For all the categories of caregivers working with children, the basic qualification is a one-year certificate in child care for one to work in a home or a two-year ECD teacher certificate for one to work in a centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>ECD teachers are trained in ECD teacher training colleges. As most of these trainees are school drop-outs, the training here is like a catch up programme to help trainees get certificates that will enable them to join a diploma teacher training programme for those interested in further education. It should be noted that most ECD teacher training colleges in Uganda are privately owned with the exception of Kyambogo University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X12437114">Uganda Child Rights NGO Network, 2007</xref>). These training colleges have been operating with little government control and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X12437114">Obua-Otoa, 1996</xref>). Different private colleges developed their own curriculum for training and assessing trainees in the way they see fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12437114">Muheirwe, 2003</xref>). Entry requirement into different ECD teacher training programmes varied from one institution to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007b</xref>). These differences, therefore, led to variation in both quality and standards of teachers produced from different ECD training institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The passing of the Uganda ECD policy in 2007 and the Education Act 2008 put the responsibility of ensuring the quality and standard of ECD teachers to the Ministry of Education and Sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12437114">2008</xref>). Section 10 (2) (b) of the Education Act 2008 and the ECD policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>) mandates Teacher Instructor and Education Training (TIET) Department of MoES to streamline, license, classify and register ECD training centres and teachers and to ensure that the programmes offered in them are certified and accredited. The instruments also mandate MoES to ensure that teachers who teach in pre-primary institutions are properly trained and have the necessary qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12437114">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In an attempt to streamline the training of ECD teachers in Uganda, Kyambogo University in conjunction with MoES and other ECD teacher training stakeholders developed a comprehensive ECD teacher training framework and disseminated to ECD teacher training colleges in 2008. The purpose of the framework is streamline content, entry requirements for entry into different programmes and assessment of trainees so as to enhance their quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>). All ECD teachers trained following the framework will be registered by MoES and will be considered for upgrading by universities to other levels of education which was not possible before introduction of the training framework.</p>
<p>The new ECD teacher training framework proposes that there should be a management body for each ECD teacher training college separate from its administration. The framework also suggests that training colleges should make an effort to affiliate to recognized universities to ensure standards. It should be noted however, that in Uganda, affiliation is not a must, but is considered necessary for professional growth of young colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The framework suggests different ECD training programmes and critical content areas for training different categories of ECD personnel. In addition, the framework dictates the entry requirements for different ECD training programmes, qualification of the tutors to teach those programmes, nature of assessment to be used for assessing the trainees, and duration of the programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>). The framework also allows different colleges that are located in districts or regions with unique cultures and diversities to incorporate those diversities but without removing the benchmarks suggested in the framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The first programme in the framework is the community child care programme which is to be offered to interested persons to gain more knowledge about child care. It does not lead to any academic award. This is a three-month programme, offered at a time that is convenient for parents (trainees). The five course units to be covered in this programme include: benefits of ECD to child family and nation, uses of different ECD centres, children’s rights and role of stakeholders in promoting children’s rights. Child growth and development including characteristics of young children, needs and development stages of young children, child stimulation, setting up and equipping children’s play areas; child growth promotion and monitoring; child health, nutrition, safety and security; early identification of special needs in children and how to support them.</p>
<p>The second programme is a one-year course in child care. Graduates from the programme work in child care institutions, home centres, day care centres, orphanages, or as matrons in boarding primary schools. The programme targets those who have reached standard seven, drop-outs or persons with interests in working with children. The course has 11 units that include all the five units for the first programme and an addition of six others that include: assessment of children’s learning; pre-school curriculum for children of 0–3 years and 3–6 years; child rearing and care practices; child stimulation; language skills to be developed in children (listening, speaking, non-verbal communication); functional literacy; home management and family life education; child abuse and neglect in homes; and practicum in communities.</p>
<p>The third programme is a two-year programme leading to award of a teachers’ certificate. It targets those who have reached form 4 (Ordinary level) and have at least six passes including English language. The graduates from this programme work in nursery schools, kindergartens, Montessori or child focused institutions as teachers. The programme has all the 11 units in the second programme and an addition of eight units that include: children’s learning styles, motivation, child guidance and counselling, teacher’s ethics and code of conduct; methods and approaches of teaching; ways of developing mathematics concepts in children; administration and management of ECD centres; foundations of education; comparative education in pre-school education; application of ICT in learning; cultural education including music and songs for children, creative work, art and crafts for children, religious education values to be inculcated in children; conflict resolution and management in pre-primary institutions; gender issues in pre-schools; influence of environment on children’s development and learning.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth programmes are the diploma and then the degree programme which take on students from certificate and diploma levels in ECD respectively. Continuous assessment is to be carried out for all the certificate programmes with a bias towards hands on practices in the communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Survey carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12437114">MoES (2009)</xref> to validate ECD teacher training colleges in Uganda for the purpose of their licensing and registration found that most colleges had not fully implemented the ECD teacher training framework. The survey found that most colleges were still using their old curriculum, although they have the training framework. The assessment guidelines were also not being followed as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2009</xref>). This lack of adherence to the framework raises concerns about what gains and challenges the colleges could be facing that hinders their smooth use of the framework.</p>
<p>Whereas there are many studies that record benefits that accrue if different colleges use the same framework to train a given category of personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12437114">Hyson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12437114">NCDC, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12437114">Sue, 2007</xref>), those that focus on the challenges of implementing the training framework in Uganda are not in abundance. Studies from other countries such as England show that use of one training framework can be very challenging due to the inadequate level of support that trainees receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12437114">Sue, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge of these challenges have helped departments that oversee implementation of frameworks to provide constant support in challenging areas and ensure all benefit from fruits of using the same framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12437114">Hyson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2010</xref>). This study offers the opportunity for all stakeholders in Uganda where this lack of knowledge exists to be informed of the gains and challenges of implementing the training framework for action.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to establish the gains and challenges faced by different ECD teacher training colleges in the implementation of the ECD teacher training framework in Uganda. The information may perhaps be used to design appropriate and focused support strategies to improve training of ECD teachers in Uganda.</p>

<sec id="section2-1476718X12437114" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The research design included a survey to collect statistical information from two categories of respondents. The study was conducted among principals and tutors from ECD teacher training institutions distributed in four regions of Uganda. These included northern, eastern, western and central regions. This was done in order to represent ECD teacher training colleges in Uganda. MoES had invited all principals and a tutor from each ECD teacher training college in Uganda to participate in a five-day ECD teacher training framework materials dissemination workshop at Kabulasoke primary teachers’ college from 10 to 15 October 2010. All colleges that participated in that workshop formed the core for this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1476718X12437114">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participant for this study consisted of 106 persons. These included 53 principals and 53 tutors from each college that participated in the workshop. The principals, most of whom are the proprietors of the colleges were targeted because they hold powers of both management and administration. The tutor on the other hand is the ECD specialist who is relied on for curriculum interpretation since most principals are business persons with no ECD related qualifications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476718X12437114">
<title>Tools for data collection</title>
<p>A questionnaire for principals was used to establish the status of framework implementation in the institutions. The questionnaire was structured following the sections in the training framework that colleges have to implement. It included management and administration, affiliation and registration process, programmes offered, assessment framework and staffing requirements. An oral interview was also used for the tutors from the colleges. The interview was designed along curriculum themes in the training framework to collect information on training needs in a class situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476718X12437114">
<title>Procedure for data collection</title>
<p>Data collection was done in two phases.</p>
<list id="list1-1476718X12437114" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Preliminary investigation</italic>: preliminary investigation was done in four institutions to see how easy it was for the respondents to work with the questionnaire. After pre-testing, the tool was analysed and necessary modifications made to make it user friendly for data collection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Data collection</italic>: in the last three days of the workshop, participants were purposively selected from the registration sheet while considering the status of the participant. Since the workshop was partly a capacity building session, the principals were asked to complete the questionnaire in order to help identify challenging areas in the framework for intervention. Tutors who had come with the principals were also purposively selected and interviewed to get their views on the implementation of the curriculum areas in the training framework.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For data analysis, a master sheet was prepared for summarizing individual responses. Descriptive data were then presented in tabular form thematically with their percentage of occurrence. From the tables, content analysis was done.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476718X12437114" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section7-1476718X12437114">
<title>The respondents</title>
<p>Most of the respondents (78%) were female, while the other 22 percent were male. There were more males in diploma and degree programme colleges, while females were largely in certificate programmes. This implied that many lower level ECD teacher training colleges were being managed by female staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1476718X12437114">
<title>Management and administration of ECD teacher training colleges</title>
<p>The status of management and administrative structures in Ugandan ECD teacher training colleges is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X12437114">Table 1</xref>. Most institutions (71.7%) did not have in place students’ administrative structures. Also, most of the institutions (60.4%) did not have both management and management sub-committees. However, most colleges (94.3%) had functional administrative committees. Some (28.3%) had non-functional management committees, while a few (1.9%) had no functional administrative committees. Only 18.9 percent of the colleges had been affiliated to recognized universities. All these indicate that most institutions were not being managed as expected in the training framework.</p>

<p>The ECD teacher training programmes offered in different teacher training colleges is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X12437114">Table 2</xref>. Most colleges (94.3%) were offering the ECD teachers’ certificate programme. Some (28.3%) were offering child care and diploma programmes. Only 5.7 percent offered the community child care programme. All colleges had adopted the entry requirements into different training programmes and their duration as suggested in the training framework. The programme most offered was the ECD teachers’ certificate programme. The mode of delivery of the programme however, still varied with some colleges offering it on a full-time basis, while others offered it as weekend or evening programme. Some of the tutors interviewed revealed that some institutions offered the teacher certificate programme as a distance programme yet they had no modules to run it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-1476718X12437114">
<title>General challenges</title>
<p>ECD teacher training is still one of the areas that attract inadequate funding from government. The lack of funds makes it challenging to facilitate staff supervising teacher training institutions or to attract consultants and experts needed to raise the profile of ECD teacher training. Within the Ministry of Education, staff are very thin on the ground. There is fewer than five staff in charge of ECD teacher training. This makes the monitoring, evaluation and support supervision a challenge. Most times the Ministry relies on ECD lecturers from Kyambogo University to help them develop programmes, monitor and evaluate training. These lecturers, however, also have their prescribed roles to perform and may not be available all the time to help the Ministry.</p>
<p>At the institutional level, most colleges were started by individuals and therefore run as a family business. Most of these entrepreneurs have no management qualifications and therefore manage the colleges by crisis, or as each day event arises. Changing this set up to encourage them open up to other parties as demanded by the framework is still challenging. Also, many of these colleges operate in personal homes, others operate within other institutional premises, while the rest operate in a different premise every semester. If we are to strictly enforce standards as specified in the framework, some of these colleges may face closure. Some of colleges, however, have close ties to politicians who shield them, thus making it challenging to have speedy regulatory enforcement.</p>

<sec id="section14-1476718X12437114">
<title>Specific components of the training framework that are challenging to implement</title>
<p>Whereas the framework has specified the qualification of staff who are supposed to train ECD teachers at different levels, most of the staff are not available in the training colleges. Tutors available in many colleges have qualifications in other related fields like secondary, primary or primary teacher education and social works other than ECD teacher education. This mix of staff being made to train ECD teachers poses a challenge for quality and the nature of standard being followed by trainers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12437114">Hyson et al., 2009</xref>). This is because each category of tutors has a different area of focus that may not be related to the best principals of ECD teacher training. For example, primary school teachers emphasize discipline through corporal punishment as is still done in primary schools, while secondary teachers prefer lecture and plenty of dictated notes. All these if transferred to ECD will not help bring out children’s potentials appropriately.</p>
<p>A greater percentage of ECD specialists preferred being part-time tutors. These specialists who are aware that they are scarce prefer teaching in more than one college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X12437114">Early and Winton, 2001</xref>). Most institutions have advertised posts for ECD specialists but have failed to get enough staff with the specified qualifications. Kyambogo University, the only government university that trains ECD tutors recruits only up to 20 trainees in a year. By the time these trainees qualify, they will all have been taken up by richer colleges. This scarcity of staff therefore makes it difficult for a college to get enough staff for a given programme as specified in the framework. This lack of staff also compromises the level of trainee support while using the framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12437114">Sue, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Adequate reference books especially those that deal with local ECD issues are not easily available. This is because ECD is still a new area in Uganda with most structures just being put in place. Most relevant literature is still in draft form where most colleges cannot access. The other general academic literature is either too expensive for colleges or they are unaware of their existence.</p>
<p>There are compulsory units in the framework like computers and education technology among others. Trainees have to be prepared in using computers, projectors, video and other media. Provision of this equipment and other teaching or learning aids is a big challenge for colleges. First, the colleges cannot afford computers for training purposes. Second, even if they can afford them, over 70 percent of rural Uganda, where most of colleges are located, has no electricity to run the equipment. Third, there are very few tutors who are computer literate to a level of training others. This is therefore an area that calls for immediate intervention by MoES.</p>
<p>Most training institutions have not yet got a registration certificate or licence to operate from the Ministry. By the time of the workshop, out of the 53 institutions that were present, only 12 had been registered by another arm of the Ministry (Business, Technical, Vocational Education and Training [BTVET] that is not responsible for ECD teacher education). The principals complained that the conditions for registration specified by the Ministry teacher education department was too stringent and also had many steps that made it very expensive for them. Some of the conditions include having a college land title, separate management from administration, adequate qualified staff for all programmes offered, an independent source of revenue to finance the college besides fees levied on trainees, permanent structures and a computer lab or resource centre.</p>
<p>Many colleges represented in the workshop did not have separate management from the administration. This is because most colleges were run by one individual, who is the proprietor. The proprietor was also the principal and bursar. Many colleges did not even have a students’ administrative or prefects’ body. Everybody reported to one person, the proprietor, for everything from student admission, tutor hiring or firing, management matters, financial matters, students’ discipline, food menu, or timetabling. In the absence of this person, all activities in the college came to a standstill due to lack of a delegation mechanism.</p>
<p>While the framework has apportioned content for the programmes to be run in semester system, colleges prefer term system. If a college used a term system, it would not be able to complete the content to be covered for a given programme as scheduled. The framework also prefers a semester system to allow trainees to be recruited after the release of entry examinations which is always in the middle of the first term. The semester system also allows trainees to pay fees twice in a year instead of the three times in a term system. Colleges are not happy with this arrangement because it reduces their income. Many however argue that collecting fees is easier in a term system than a semester system.</p>
<p>Some colleges were facing a challenge of scarcity of ECD centres from which practicum can be done in some communities. For example, in a college locality, there could be one or two ECD centres with each being able to accept only between three to four trainees from a college with 200 trainees. As a result, trainees from some colleges carry out practicum for two weeks instead of the recommended six weeks so as to give chance to other trainees to practise in the same centres. Others are forced to take students for practicum very far away from their colleges making it difficult for trainees to be adequately supervised.</p>
<p>Assessment in different institutions also varied. Tutors interviewed revealed that each tutor assessed trainees in a way he/she felt comfortable with. For example, most colleges assessed students through summative examinations as opposed to a combination of coursework, projects and examinations suggested in the framework. Others simply passed students basing on how one has been ‘good’ or ‘well behaved’. These differences indicate variations from national standards and focus, variation in understanding and use of theory and research, and priorities for enhancing student competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12437114">Sue, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas most colleges had adopted content suggested in the training framework, most of the tutors interviewed revealed that they found it a challenge to determine the scope, depth and breadth of course content. Some tutors taught diploma content in the certificate programme because they could not determine where certificate content stopped. Others taught very few course units. For example, trainees from one college would in their two years of training be prepared in 18 course units, while another college prepared the same category of trainees in four course units with two of them not being related to ECD. Such unrelated units may include book keeping, tailoring or commercial studies leaving out important teaching components like practicum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12437114">MoES, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X12437114">2007b</xref>). This variation in content quality and quantity provided to students raise questions about institutional capacity and therefore concerns about quality of teachers trained from some institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12437114">Hyson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1476718X12437114">
<title>Gains</title>
<p>Although many colleges are not yet affiliated to recognized universities due to stringent affiliation conditions, some institutions have shown interest in meeting the conditions so as to regularize their status of affiliation. Universities are also becoming flexible especially in making affiliation affordable.</p>
<p>Training duration for ECD teachers’ certificate of two years on a full-time basis was being uniformly followed by all colleges offering it. Before the introduction of the training framework, some institutions were offering this programme for three years, others two years, while some one year for the same programme.</p>
<p>A few colleges have started offering the diploma and degree programme in ECD. These colleges have either got accreditation by the National Council of Higher Education or are in the process of accrediting the programme. Most colleges however complain of the long process of accreditation and the stringent requirements for it. The Ministry is insisting on accreditation of programmes before it is offered to trainees. This is because programmes which usually do not pass the accreditation criteria have substantive weaknesses that do not align with and support key teacher competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X12437114">Hyson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>All colleges that were represented in this workshop reported that they had adopted the new trainee entry requirements guidelines for different programmes. Those trainees who had been recruited to certain programmes where they did not have appropriate entry requirements were advised to change to a programme that matched their qualifications.</p>
<p>Although there are many colleges that still have management and administrative structures as one unit, there are also some institutions that have made progress in putting in place separate efficient administrative and management structures. Some have even incorporated other stakeholders they trust into the management of their institutions for accountability.</p>
<p>Another important gain is the better communication that is emerging between different ECD teacher training colleges, district leaders, other universities and Ministry of Education. It is now much easier to collect statistical information on ECD teacher training from different colleges because of the trust that has been built.</p>
<p>All ECD training colleges have adopted the new programme duration, programme entry requirements and assessment guidelines for all the categories of programmes bringing uniformity in their delivery. Also, most tutors in the colleges, especially those who do not have the required qualifications to handle particular programmes as suggested by the training framework, are taking a keen interest in upgrading. Most of them have embarked on the postgraduate programmes in ECD teacher education to improve their competences. This reform will hugely benefit students and teachers alike and, most importantly, improve the training status of ECD teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12437114">Sue, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of the ECD tutors who have a master’s degree in ECD are working in the government university. These tutors (lecturers) form the core team of specialists whom the Ministry is currently working with to develop the training programmes, syllabuses for use in ECD centres, monitoring and evaluation of ECD programmes, external assessment of ECD trainees, research into ECD areas and policy positions to be proposed to other government agencies and departments.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The ECD working group in the Ministry of Education and Sports is the channel used to advance ECD related issues for action by the Ministry. Upon completion of this study, the findings and recommendations will be presented to it for appropriate action. The following are some of the institutional based recommendations coming from this study.</p>
<sec id="section17-1476718X12437114">
<title>Ministry of Education and Sports</title>
<p>More staff need to be recruited into the ECD teacher education desk to increase the current number from one to at least five. This will go a long way in consolidating the gains achieved after introduction of the ECD teacher training framework. We should note that whenever there are inadequate staff, efficiency is compromised.</p>
<p>Spot inspection of different ECD teacher training institutions needs to be stepped up in order to increase compliance to the framework and improve the quality of training. Also, the Ministry needs to speed up the process of registration and licensing of ECD teacher training institutions so as to curb briefcase or mobile institutions that have been fleecing trainees and failing to give them any certification after training.</p>
<p>Work with other universities to put in place one recognized assessment body that will ensure uniform ECD trainee assessment and certification. This will make ECD training colleges adhere faster to the training framework guidelines.</p>
<p>This study was an initial exploratory study. Another more comprehensive follow up study needs to be conducted probably after one or two years depending on the availability of funds for comparison. This will provide better insight into new challenges identified so as to decide the best intervention strategies for them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1476718X12437114">
<title>Universities</title>
<p>Public and private universities should focus more on research into ECD issues in Uganda. This will not only help generate literature for use by the colleges but also get solutions to local challenges that ECD faces in the country. Universities should also urgently develop more postgraduate ECD programmes that are tailored to uplift the competences of ECD teacher tutors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1476718X12437114">
<title>Directorate of Education Standards (DES)</title>
<p>This is the education standards body that was created to spearhead, maintain and control education standards in Uganda. DES should integrate ECD teacher training colleges in their national monitoring and supervision schedule in the way it is done with primary and secondary schools. This will help ECD teacher training colleges improve their adherence to the training framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1476718X12437114">
<title>Institutional principals</title>
<p>The principals should regularly lobby for continuous professional development programmes for their staff from MoES and other universities to keep their staff up to date and get solutions to challenges that arise from implementing the framework. They also need to clearly separate their management from administration. This will help to make them stronger because of the checks and balances that will have been created.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1476718X12437114">
<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>This study was conducted in only 53 ECD teacher training institutions, particularly those that are in the teacher training association umbrella. There are other training institutions that are not part of this umbrella and yet they train ECD teachers based on their own standards. As many of those institutions that are not part of the teacher training umbrella have not been fully involved in the development of the training framework, the gains and challenges identified in this study may not completely represent their concerns.</p>
<p>Information in this report was gathered from principals and tutors from different ECD teacher training colleges attended a MoES ECD teacher training framework familiarization and materials dissemination workshop. Perhaps if the researcher had visited colleges specifically including those that were reluctant to participate in the workshop, different results would have been obtained.</p>
<p>Experience of working with some of the training colleges has shown that those institutions who are doing the right things are ones that are keen to come forward or even accept the invitation of the Ministry to participate in their workshops. The others who have more challenges are less enthusiastic to approach any authority for help. It is therefore possible that some of the major challenges have not been identified to be addressed yet.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section22-1476718X12437114" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, it can be concluded that there is some progress in the implementation of the training framework. One can note that colleges are more enthusiastic to do the right thing in training. The major challenges still lie in staffing and assessment which will lead to uniform awards and quality ECD personnel. More effort therefore needs to be placed in such areas that will lift up the capacity of individual colleges to use the framework through collaborative and networking effort with all concerned stakeholders.</p>
