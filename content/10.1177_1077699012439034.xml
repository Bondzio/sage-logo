<abstract>
<p>This study uses an experiment to examine the effects of valenced news frames, in terms of risks and benefits, on participants perceptions’ of and attitudes toward the product-country image (PCI) of “Made in China.” Findings suggest that the risks frame elicits negative perception and attitude concerning “Made in China,” whereas the benefits frame induces positive evaluations. Participants perceive the product aspect of “Made in China” more positively than the country aspect. Personal relevance, shopping experience, and shopping habit jointly affect participants’ perceptions and attitudes as covariates.</p>

<p>The concept of framing has been applied to a variety of communication disciplines to investigate the nature of news content or non-news messages,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012439034">1</xref></sup> as well as their effects on audience responses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012439034">2</xref></sup> By highlighting a particular aspect of the societal reality in a communicating text,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012439034">3</xref></sup> and then in the mind of the audience, the framing process can affect people’s issue perception and judgment,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012439034">4</xref></sup> to a certain extent. Scholars argue in particular that <italic>valence</italic> framing, emphasizing either negative or positive attributes of the same object, can drive people’s thoughts in opposite directions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012439034">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have also suggested that people rely on media to know about foreign countries,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012439034">6</xref></sup> and their evaluations of issues concerning remote areas are significantly affected by news framing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012439034">7</xref></sup> In this respect, valence framing can provide a theoretical perspective for understanding the influence of media coverage on perceptions of and attitudes toward a product-country image (PCI),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012439034">8</xref></sup> a particular aspect regarding a given foreign nation.</p>
<p>The dispute over “Made in China” offers an appropriate case to assess the connection between valenced media frames and PCI concerning a specific nation, which has not received much scholarly attention. As the world’s most rapidly changing economy, China is taking major shares of global markets once dominated by the United States and other industrialized countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012439034">9</xref></sup> The “Made in China” label once signified average quality and very low manufacturing cost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012439034">10</xref></sup> However, after the extensive pet food<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012439034">11</xref></sup> and toys recalls<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012439034">12</xref></sup> in the United States as well as a series of food safety crises occurring inside China,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012439034">13</xref></sup> American consumers have become more and more skeptical about the quality of China-made products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012439034">14</xref></sup> The “Made in China” label has thus gradually become synonymous with both low cost and low quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012439034">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>While acknowledging the relevance of PCI to strategic communication, a domain emphasizing the purposeful or planned use of communications to achieve organizational goals in areas such as public relations, advertising, and marketing communication,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012439034">16</xref></sup> the current endeavor aims to shed light on the intersection of journalism and strategic communication, especially public relations, from a news framing perspective. Specifically, this study employs valence framing analysis in an experimental setting to test how two opposite news frames—<italic>risks</italic> and <italic>benefits</italic>—divide US audiences’ perceptions of and attitudes toward “Made in China.” The implications of the findings for mass-mediated strategic communication are also discussed.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>

<title>Valence framing</title>
<p>A key concept in communication research,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012439034">17</xref></sup> <italic>framing</italic> has been well employed in content analyses to examine how issues are depicted in news<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012439034">18</xref></sup> or non-news communication texts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012439034">19</xref></sup> (e.g., organization’s press releases, health care messages, public service announcements, etc.) and in experimental studies to elaborate how news or message frames alter people’s cognitive responses,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012439034">20</xref></sup> attitudes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012439034">21</xref></sup> and behavioral intention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012439034">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Highlighting particular aspects of factually identical situations or objects, news or message frames are not necessarily neutral. Rather, frames may inherently hold opposite attributes. According to the prospect theory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012439034">23</xref></sup> (often associated with the metaphor of a half-empty glass), valenced frames “are indicative of ‘good and bad’ and (implicitly) carry positive and/or negative elements.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012439034">24</xref></sup> Frames with positive valence emphasize beneficial or advantageous aspects, solutions, or treatments, while frames with a negative valence emphasize the opposite.</p>
<p>Studies on the effects of valenced frames have been well documented in various disciplines,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012439034">25</xref></sup> where identical information was either positively or negatively presented, in terms of potential gain or loss,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012439034">26</xref></sup> opportunity or risk,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012439034">27</xref></sup> advantage or disadvantage,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012439034">28</xref></sup> benefit or cost,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012439034">29</xref></sup> to name a few. Comparing the persuasive power of valenced messages based on different types of frame manipulations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012439034">30</xref></sup> has featured in studies with various communication contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012439034">31</xref></sup> A number of studies have suggested that valenced frames can exert sizable influence on individuals’ cognitive response<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012439034">32</xref></sup> and decision making<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012439034">33</xref></sup> regarding the issue discussed.</p>
<p>Valence framing is an important concept in experimental research on brand or product information for strategic communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012439034">34</xref></sup> Scholars maintain, for example, that valenced frames “bias how the ads and the advertised brands are evaluated,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012439034">35</xref></sup> and subsequently affect people’s judgment making. In other words, an advertisement framed either positively<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012439034">36</xref></sup> or negatively<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012439034">37</xref></sup> has correspondingly favorable or unfavorable associations with the advertised product,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012439034">38</xref></sup> and can affect people’s cognitive response,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012439034">39</xref></sup> attitude,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012439034">40</xref></sup> and purchasing behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012439034">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Valence framing effects are also significant in studies regarding persuasive messages other than product information. Scholars argue, for instance, different valence frames lead to different degrees of effectiveness of charity advertising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012439034">42</xref></sup> Valence framing and other message characteristics can work together in affecting perceived value of a charity goal delivered in fundraising messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012439034">43</xref></sup> Likewise, negative news that frame a corporation as practicing unethical advertising tend to elicit negative judgments on its corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and less favorable attitudes toward the target corporation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012439034">44</xref></sup> While previous studies have compared persuasive effectiveness between positive and negative frames, no studies have yet connected valenced media frames with product-country image.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077699012439034">
<title>Product-country image</title>
<p>Derived from the discipline of international marketing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012439034">45</xref></sup> the construct of product-country image has been used to address the “country-of-origin (COO)” effect or “Made-in” phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012439034">46</xref></sup> Conceptually, PCI can be regarded as a “midpoint” between the perception of a “pure” product or brand image (e.g., “Toyota cars may not be safe to drive”) and the perception of a “pure” overall national image (e.g., “Japan is a friendly country”).</p>
<p>Without a uniform definition of PCI readily available in communication, this study suggests that perception of a PCI may combine two aspects—a product-related aspect (because it was “made in” a particular country) and a country-related aspect (a particular, not an overall, country image that is associated with the products)—as two sides of the same coin. In today’s globalization context, research on PCI has shown its potential to become a subject worthy of exploration in strategic communication. It can help explain the complexity of image perceptions entwined with foreign products and news coverage in domestic media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077699012439034">
<title>Media coverage and image</title>
<p>Previous studies find that people without direct experience with foreign countries rely more on mass media to know about those countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012439034">47</xref></sup> Scholars<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012439034">48</xref></sup> suggest that mass media play an irreplaceable role in cultivating people’s perceived image of foreign countries and that people’s evaluations of other countries are largely based on media coverage.</p>
<p>As for the nature of media coverage on foreign nations, Manheim and Albritton<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012439034">49</xref></sup> believe that the <italic>valence</italic> of the content is influential in altering people’s perception of foreign countries. In the long run, a country’s image created by the media can be improved or impaired depending on whether positive outweighs negative media coverage, or vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012439034">50</xref></sup> This notion regarding the nature as well as the influence of media coverage on the formation of an overall national image is pertinent to the question of how media shape a product-country image. Media coverage on foreign products may likewise influence people’s perceptions of and attitudes toward a given product-country image.</p>

<sec id="section5-1077699012439034">
<title>“Made in China.”</title> <p>“Made in China” literally refers to the label affixed to products manufactured in Mainland China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012439034">51</xref></sup> Today, with China being the largest manufacturer and exporter of consumer goods in the world, “Made in China” has become one of the most recognizable labels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012439034">52</xref></sup> For companies outsourcing manufacturing to China, “Made in China” stands for low cost of labor and resources and also competitive advantages; for consumers, before the series of product safety scandals, “Made in China” represented value for money,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012439034">53</xref></sup> or at least average quality at low cost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012439034">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the safety of China-made goods at concern, consumers are becoming apprehensive about buying “Made in China,” and many companies are considering outsourcing manufacturing to countries other than China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012439034">55</xref></sup> In addition, China’s regulations of product quality, intellectual property rights issues, human rights record, and trade disputes with the United States have all contributed to the recent “Made in China” crisis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012439034">56</xref></sup> and drawn attention to this particular product-country image.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077699012439034">
<title>Valence framing and PCI</title>
<p>It is noteworthy that literature about “Made in China” is scanty in the communication discipline. Only a few studies analyze strategic communication about products made in China. For example, Cai, Lee, and Pang<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012439034">57</xref></sup> discuss the image-repairing strategies adopted by the Chinese government following product recalls in 2007. Li and Tang<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012439034">58</xref></sup> examine how national and local newspapers in the United States framed Chinese product recalls in 2007. They argue that Chinese sources are less likely to be cited by American media for their non-US perspectives. No research has assessed framing effects of media coverage on audiences’ perceptions and attitudes in terms of product-country image.</p>
<p>Although the aforementioned <italic>valence</italic> of “image” coverage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012439034">59</xref></sup> refers to the “extrinsic” feature of news stories, not the <italic>valence</italic> of news frames imbedded in the coverage, this study argues that a product-country image should be the outcome of a summarized perception cultivated and influenced by the framed messages underlying media coverage. In other words, it is the <italic>valence</italic> of relevant news frames that determines the valence or tone of the coverage on the products <italic>made in</italic> a given country, from which a <italic>biased</italic> perception may result. As a corollary, valenced frames are likely to affect people’s perceived PCI, then lead to frame-consistent evaluations. Analyzing frame attributes thus provides a better understanding of the PCI woven by mass media and perceived by the public.</p>
<p>Applying the notion of valence framing, the present study aims to compare the effect of <italic>risks</italic> frame and <italic>benefits</italic> frame on people’s perceptions of and attitudes toward “Made in China.” The <italic>risks</italic> frame focuses on the negative aspects concerning products made in China, such as product safety, US trade deficit and unemployment in the manufacturing sector, and human rights concerns. The <italic>benefits</italic> frame highlights the positive aspects of using and marketing China-made products, such as affordability, improved quality, rising of Chinese brands, and US economic gains from trading with China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012439034">
<title>Hypotheses and Research Questions</title>
<p>Based on the literature review, this study proposes the first two sets of hypotheses to test the valence framing effect on perceptions.</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012439034" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1a</bold>: Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>risks</italic> will lead to negative perception of the product aspect of this PCI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H1b:</bold> Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>risks</italic> will lead to negative perception of the country aspect of this PCI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2a</bold>: Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>benefits</italic> will lead to positive perception of the product aspect of this PCI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2b</bold>: Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>benefits</italic> will lead to positive perception of the country aspect of this PCI.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Meanwhile, drawing upon evidence regarding the effects of valence framing on attitudes from previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012439034">60</xref></sup> we assume that valence frames not only influence people’s perceptions, but also affect their attitudes toward “Made in China.” This argument is addressed in the third set of hypotheses.</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012439034" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H3a:</bold> Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>risks</italic> will draw negative attitudes toward this PCI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H3b:</bold> Framing “Made in China” in terms of <italic>benefits</italic> will draw positive attitudes toward this PCI.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012439034">61</xref></sup> suggest personal experience plays a weighty role in the formation of certain national images. Product involvement and personal relevance<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012439034">62</xref></sup> also affect message processing in brand evaluation. The present study argues that personal experience embraces psychological and behavioral aspects. The former refers to personal relevance (e.g., curiosity, interest) due to personal involvement in the subject concerned; the latter is related to particular activities, including shopping experience and habit. We incorporate personal relevance and prior shopping behavior into the analysis as covariates. The following two research questions are then raised:</p>

<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> To what extent will personal relevance, in terms of the level of personal involvement in China-related matters, affect perceptions of and attitudes toward the product-country image of “Made in China”?</p></list-item>

<title>Design</title>
<p>This study adopted a single-factor, posttest only, between-subjects experimental design. Following previous experimental research with a similar focus on comparing two competing stimuli,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012439034">63</xref></sup> this study did not use a pretest in order to avoid possible subject sensitization to the posttest. Three conditions were included in the design. One represented <italic>risks</italic> frame, another <italic>benefits</italic> frame, and the third the control condition. The inclusion of a control condition both in design and analysis allowed the current study to compare the possible difference not only between opposite frame valences, but also between news facts with and without valenced frames. This marked one of the differences between the current project and relevant previous experimental research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077699012439034">64</xref></sup></p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and eighty American undergraduate students taking mass communication courses at a large Midwest university volunteered to participate in this study. Among the participants, 27% were male and 73% female. No Chinese students were included. Upon completion of the test, participants received extra credit and were entered for a prize draw.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077699012439034">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was conducted in February 2010. Participants were randomly assigned to each of the three conditions. They first answered questions related to demographics and consumer behavior. Next, they read an experimentally prepared news story before completing the remaining part of the questionnaire measuring their perceptions of and attitudes toward “Made in China,” and their personal relevance with China-related matters. After completing the questionnaire, the participants were debriefed. The entire procedure lasted about forty minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077699012439034">
<title>Stimulus materials</title>
<p>Three news stories were prepared for the experimental and control conditions. The original news article, taken from <italic>the New York Times</italic>, was about US public concerns over the safety and quality of products made in China. It was rewritten in three versions to correspond to three conditions. Each included the same core information describing the basic facts relevant to an opinion poll. The font, layout, and general appearance of these versions were identical. They all gave the impression of being from <italic>the New York Times</italic>.</p>
<p>For each of the two framing conditions, the title, introductory and concluding paragraphs, and supporting messages were rewritten in similar length and style, but emphasized different aspects of the basic facts to establish opposite frames. The <italic>benefits</italic>-framed article was titled “While China Steps up Safety Efforts, Americans Benefit, Poll Finds,” and the <italic>risks</italic>-framed article was titled “China’s Safety Efforts in Doubt and Americans at Risk, Poll Finds.” For the control condition, the article had the title “Americans Have Mixed Feelings about Chinese Goods, Poll Finds” and mainly presented the core factual information.</p>
<p>All three articles were carefully reviewed and revised by a native English speaker, who is a former journalist and currently a faculty member in mass communication at an East Coast university. To ensure successful message manipulations, all stimuli were pilot-tested with thirty randomly assigned participants who would not be included in the test. Three groups of ten participants each were asked to read one story corresponding to one of the three conditions and then answer two questions about whether the news covered China-made products as well as China in a positive versus negative light on a 5-point Likert scale. The result confirmed successful manipulation: the two experimental conditions were sufficiently strong to allow difference in dependent measures between the framed conditions as well as between framed conditions and the control condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Furthering the conversations of previous research about valence framing effects in various communication disciplines,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1077699012439034">71</xref></sup> this study pays particular attention to the relationship between valenced media frames and the product-country image of “Made in China.” Although the notion of PCI and the specific case discussed readily aligns this study with public relations, our test on the effects of media frames connects journalism and strategic communication as well. Resonating prior experimental studies, the current project supports the notion that valenced frames have the capacity to alter people’s perceptions of and attitudes toward a certain subject matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1077699012439034">72</xref></sup> It may contribute to the literature on the role of media in forming and fashioning image perceptions and attitudes as well as on the application of quantitative framing analysis in strategic communication scholarship.</p>
<p>Showcasing the valence framing effect on people’s perceptions of a particular PCI, this study first confirms that the news framed with <italic>risks</italic> elicits negative perceptions concerning both the product aspect and the country aspect of “Made in China,” while the news framed with <italic>benefits</italic> induces positive perceptions. Findings then indicate that participants perceive the product aspect of “Made in China” more positively than the country aspect. While the latter is mainly associated with negative elements such as trade deficit and unemployment in the United States, and human rights concerns in China, the former is mixed with both negative (e.g., safety concern, poor quality) and positive messages (e.g., affordability, availability). As Americans in general use China-made products almost every day, when a negatively framed message about those products is at work, participants are likely to take personal experience<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1077699012439034">73</xref></sup> and product attributes into account as well, which may offset the framing effect to some extent. As a result, participants do not rate very negatively the products they use often. On the contrary, when positive evaluation is induced by positively framed news, participants intend to make cue-based judgments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1077699012439034">74</xref></sup> In this sense, the framed message can direct, but not control, the ideas and feelings activated when people process news stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1077699012439034">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>This argument is further verified when covariates figure in the process. A higher level of personal involvement dilutes the influence of a negative frame and switches people’s thoughts toward a more positive perception. At the same time, those who have already consumed China-made goods are also inclined to process “Made in China” along a positive line. Further, shopping experience is stronger than personal relevance in activating immediate cognitive response or impression concerning the product aspect, whereas the latter was more powerful regarding the country aspect.</p>
<p>As for the contrast between the experiment conditions and the control condition, it is no surprise that framed messages show stronger influence than unframed messages in forming image perception. This result suggests, however, that messages without a valenced frame tend to have a “neutralizing” effect that directed participants’ perceptions to the “middle point” along the negative-positive spectrum.</p>
<p>Regarding the attitudes toward “Made in China,” this study partially confirms that valenced media frames can also draw frame-consistent attitudes toward PCI. Post hoc tests suggest that the two experimental conditions are significantly different one from the other, although no significant mean differences are found between the control condition and the two experimental conditions. This result defends the expectation that news frames can play an important role in forming people’s short-term attitudes. Meanwhile, in the complicated cognitive process, participants in the control condition may rely on their prior existing schema to automatically activate associated evaluations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1077699012439034">76</xref></sup> which may naturally lead to an inclination for either more positive or more negative attitudes in this case.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the influence of covariates, attitudes are positively correlated with prior shopping behavior but not with personal relevance. Those who pay no heed to the brand or country origin of products, along with those who have used Chinese goods, show more positive attitudes toward “Made in China.” A possible reason is that shopping experience and habits can develop over time, and may have already been incorporated into participants’ existing schema, which is readily available to become more decisive when later attitudinal judgment on a related issue must be made.</p>
<p>Although this study does not address the valence framing effect directly on product promotion or international marketing communication, the findings about media framing of PCI have practical implications for strategic communicators. On one hand, as previous research suggests, strategic preparation of public relations message is crucial to obtaining effective outcome favoring an organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1077699012439034">77</xref></sup> Communicators may structure the message by properly and purposely incorporating a certain angle of an issue to facilitate positive perceptions or attitudes. On the other hand, communications do not always occur between an organization and key publics directly; rather, today’s media still play a big role in between. An image can be improved in media and consequently better received by the target public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1077699012439034">78</xref></sup> As the first step to achieve this objective, communicators should position themselves as frame strategists and consider how valenced media frames can determine the nature of a certain issue, and why the framed news information can be accepted or rejected by the public who “have different positions”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1077699012439034">79</xref></sup> on the issue. With a better understanding of media frames, strategic communicators may help alter negative perception or cultivate favorable opinion toward the products made in a certain country through mass communication.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although elaborating the linkage between PCI and the overall national image goes beyond the scope of this article, it is noteworthy that PCI can serve as “the building blocks of the general image” of a country,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1077699012439034">80</xref></sup> which in return affect people’s evaluation of the products made in that country. In this regard, investigating valenced media frames of PCI is helpful to countries that intend to expand their overseas markets. Consider again the “Made in China” case. Although Chinese government and manufacturers have made great efforts to deal with the product recall crises, their communication with the public in international markets by targeting an instant turnaround has yet to be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1077699012439034">81</xref></sup> Rather negative frames have for a while drawn considerable concern among the public not only about specific Chinese products, but also about other issues regarding that country. If there is any lesson to learn, strategic communicators in a country of origin should pay serious attention to the PCI depicted in international media<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1077699012439034">82</xref></sup> and consider how to get positive messages across to target consumers there through media to build up a healthy overall national image that is related, but not restricted, to particular products.</p>
<p>Framing “Made in China” in <italic>risks</italic> and <italic>benefits</italic> may have “ignored” other “aspects and particularities” of this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1077699012439034">83</xref></sup> However, based on the theoretical grounds established by previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-1077699012439034">84</xref></sup> we argue that negative (risks) versus positive (benefits) frames are intrinsic to the topic regarding “Made in China,” considering the difficult balance stakeholders always try to strike between product quality and cost, and, broadly, imports and exports in international trade, along with people’s mixed feelings about buying Chinese products. As an initial effort toward connecting news framing effects with PCI literature, this study may also facilitate an appreciation of the pertinence of information processing approach to the scholarship on image or reputation in strategic communication.</p>
<sec id="section21-1077699012439034">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>While offering intriguing findings, the limitations of this study should be noted for further discussion. First, the current experiment prepared one example of risks or benefits frame, which restrains the generalizability of the findings. Future studies can test multiple scenarios of risks or benefits to compare the results drawn from different manipulations. Second, due to the nature of experimental study, participants are often recruited from a group of students enrolled in a certain study program in college, with possible gender imbalance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-1077699012439034">85</xref></sup> The participants’ profile of this study reflects this feature, which may affect the external validity of the findings. Recognizing this weakness, we should regard the findings as tentative and be cautious to generalize to all American consumers or the general population. Third, the items used to measure the variables were developed particularly for the current study based on our content analysis of US media coverage on China-made goods, with inspirations from several previous studies reviewed in the aforementined on image<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1077699012439034">86</xref></sup> and “Made in China.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-1077699012439034">87</xref></sup> Although the measuring instruments yielded reliable Cronbach’s alpha values and satisfying content validity, they can be further refined in future research to ensure construct validity. Fourth, future research is needed to investigate the valence framing effect on perceived place-of-origin image or overall national image that may emerge from the valence-framed news coverage of PCI in order to draw a clearer picture of the formation and hierarchy of image perception in mass-mediated strategic communication process.</p>

<p>China has burst onto the US trading scene in recent years. As of 2005, US-China trade was valued at $211.6 billion. China’s largest export market is the United States and is the second largest source of US imports of merchandise ($243 billion in 2005) after Canada ($287 billion). It accounted for over 14% of US imports in 2005, up from 12% in 2003, 8% in 1999, and 3% in 1990, although this share still falls short of Japan’s 18% in the early 1990s. Thomas Lum and Dick K. Nanto, “CRS Report for Congress: China’s Trade with United States and the World,” updated January 4, 2007; accessed January 30, 2009, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL31403.pdf">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL31403.pdf</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The US-China trading data also show that the US trade deficit with China is rising with the overall US trade deficit or growing at a slightly faster rate. Between 1996 and 1998, China’s share of the overall US merchandise trade deficit averaged 24%; between 1999 and 2001, China’s share was 18%, and between 2002 and 2004, 22%. As of 2005, the US trade deficit with China was 26% of its global trade deficit (Lum and Nanto, “CRS Report,” 11).</p>

<p>It is not unusual for communication-related projects to include more female than male participants. For example, Shen and Dillard, “The Influence of Behavioral Inhibition/Approach Systems and Message Framing on the Processing of Persuasive Health Messages,” <italic>Communication Research</italic> 34 (August 2007): 433-67; Schuck and de Vreese, “Between Risk and Opportunity.” In addition, featuring more women than men in the study may even help align the participants to general American consumers, because surveys indicate that women have taken charge of major household purchases in the United States. See: Rich Morin and D’Vera Cohn, “Women Call the Shots at Home; Public Mixed on Gender Roles in Jobs,” September 25, 2008, accessed June 1, 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/967/gender-power">http://pewresearch.org/pubs/967/gender-power</ext-link>. This evidence may provide a justification for the external validity, although not the generalizability, of the current study.</p>
