<abstract>
<p>An ultraviolet cured glass fiber-reinforced acylate polymer composite can be cured in several 10 sec, which is potentially used for quick repair of concrete structures. In the present paper, combined effects of water or alkaline solution immersion and sustained bending on its water absorption and thermomechanical properties were investigated. With increasing the sustained bending levels, water uptake and diffusion rate monotonically increased in ultraviolet cured glass fiber-reinforced acylate polymer. The combined effects lead to remarkable decreases in the tensile properties. More serious degradation of the tensile strength was found in the cases of higher sustained bending levels and/or alkaline solution immersion. After removal of sustained bending, residual deformation of samples was observed and depended on the bending levels and immersion medium, attributed to the orientation of the resin molecules. In all, 1% of water uptake led to about 8–9℃ reduction in the glass transition temperatures, regardless of sustained bending or immersion medium. The height of tan delta decrease with sustained bending levels indicates the occurrence of fiber debonding or delamination.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312457099" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Compared to traditional civil engineering materials (i.e., steel and concrete), fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites possess many irreplaceable advantages in terms of light weight, high strength, excellent corrosive resistance, ease of installation, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312457099">1</xref></sup> In recent years, FRP composites have been found to have fast increasing application in civil engineering, especially in the field of infrastructure rehabilitation, repair and upgrading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312457099">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312457099"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312457099">4</xref></sup> The long-term durability of FRPs in harsh civil engineering environments, however, has not been well understood, which adversely affects their safe, economic and wide application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312457099">5</xref></sup> Up to date, a number of researching works have been conducted on the durability of various FRPs in a range of environments, such as humidity, immersion in various solutions, temperatures and static or dynamic stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312457099">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312457099">7</xref></sup> Most of the durability of FRPs were focused on a single environment, which is obviously apart from the real situations of FRPs in practice. FRPs applied in strengthening civil engineering structures, in many cases (such as concrete beam strengthening), have to face combined effects of sustained stress and various environments of immersion, temperatures etc. The combined effects on the long-term performance of FRPs as well as FRP-strengthened structures have already been considered as a critical topic for the application FRPs in civil engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312457099"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312457099"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312457099">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>By now, a few researchers have already conducted durability work of FRPs under combined stress/strain together with various environments. Helbling and Karbhari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312457099">9</xref></sup> studied water sorption and tensile performance of a unidirectional pultruded E-glass/vinylester composite subjected to synergistic hygrothermal exposure and sustained bending. The sustained strain shows an accelerative effect on both water uptake and the degradation of tensile performance. The matrix cracking and fiber-matrix debonding are attributed to the more water uptake as well as the degradation in tensile strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref></sup> The sustained strain around 35.9% showed a transition in degradative response of a GFRP composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref></sup> The effect of tap water and sea water immersion on the long-term behavior of GFRP bars in concrete beams subjected to sustained loads were investigated, and a significant loss in strength was found. Laoubi et al. studied the effect of freeze-thaw cycling and sustained bending on GFRP strengthened concrete beams and found that no obvious degradation occurred for the beams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312457099">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current paper, a UV curable GFRP composite (UV-GFRP) were developed for fast repair of concrete structures, which can be cured in several 10 sec and possesses a comparable mechanical properties with conventional ambient cured epoxy based GFRPs. UV-GFRP system used to strengthen existing structures have also been explored by some researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312457099">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312457099">13</xref></sup> However, to author’s best knowledge, no work has been conducted on the durability of such novel systems yet.</p>
<p>In this paper, water uptake, long-term tensile properties as well as viscoelastic performance of the GFRP under combined water/alkaline solution immersion and sustained bending were investigated. The work aims to reveal the degradation mechanisms of the system, which will be meaningful for application of UV-GFRP in civil engineering and modification of current UV-GFRP systems.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998312457099"><title>Experiment</title>
<sec id="sec3-0021998312457099"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>A UV-curable resin system, developed in the Lab for FRP Composite and Structure (Harbin Institute of Technology, China), is a mixture of Bisphenol A epoxy acrylate, polyester acrylate and diluent of TPGDA (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHO(OC<sub>3</sub>H6)<sub>3</sub>OCOCH=CH<sub>2</sub>) monomer. Photoinitiator is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone, bought from CAC Group Co., Ltd of China. The viscosity of the resin with 2 wt.% initiatior at 25℃ is about 4000 mPa.S. Unidirectional glass fabric was kindly offered by Fyfe Co., ltd (San Diego, USA,) with the brand name of SEH 51A.</p>
<p>A UV lamp was bought from Xinlan Electric Light Source Co, Ltd (Henan, China) to cure the UV systems. The UV lamp gives the UV light with the wavelength of 365 nm, 1000 W and the UV intensity is 80 W/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312457099">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>UV curable resins with 2 wt.% of photo-initiator were mixed with hands for at least 5 min. The mixture was then used to saturate a layer of glass fabric with a hand layup process, and then cured with the UV lamp. With the UV lamp, the saturated one layer of glass fabric can be fully cured in 25 s, and the resulted glass transition temperature is 58℃, and the tensile strength, modulus and strain at break are 484 MPa, 27.1 GPa and 1.94%, respectively.</p>
<p>The nominal thickness of the fabricated GFRP plate is set as 1.3 mm, and the fiber content is 47.9 wt.% measured with the burn off testing method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998312457099"><title>Durability testing</title>
<p>The cured GFRP sample coupons were cut into strips in fiber direction with the dimensions of 250 mm × 10 mm × 1.3 mm. Metal fixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312457099">Figure 1</xref>) were set up to impose the strip of bending deformation, according to the three-point bending testing fixture. The imposed strain was adjusted with the position of the middle rod, made of stainless steel. In the present work, two strain levels were adopted. One is 25% of its ultimate strain (0.485%) and the other is 40% of its ultimate strain (0.776%).

<p>One set of samples were exposed to ambient air in laboratory for control samples (∼50% in humidity). The other two were immersed in distilled water or in alkaline solution (simulated concrete pore water with pH value of 12.5) at 25℃. The alkaline solution was made according to ACI 3 R-04 (Guide test methods for fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) for reinforcing or strengthening concrete structures). The alkaline solution consists of 118.5 g of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 g of NaOH and 4.2 g of KOH per 1 liter of distilled water.</p>
<p>The water uptake, residual deformation, tensile properties and glass transition temperatures of the samples were tracked in 6 months.</p>
<p>For water uptake, samples taken out of the baths were swiped off the surface water using tissue paper and weighted using an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg. The presented data are an average for five coupons.</p>
<p>Tensile properties of the unidirectional UV-GFRPs were tested according to ASTM D 3039 with a tensile speed of 5 mm/min. For each condition, five samples were repeated and the average results were reported.</p>
<p>Aged UV<bold>-</bold>GFRP samples (50 × 10 × 1.3 mm<sup>3</sup>) cut from the middle part of the aged sample in fiber direction were used for Dynamic mechanical themal analysis (DMTA) test at a frequency of 1 Hz, a strain of 0.025% and a heating rate of 5℃ from 25 to 160℃ in three-point bending mode using an EXSTAR DMS6100 dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (produced by SII NanoTechnology Inc, Japan).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312457099">Table 1</xref>, the imposed bending strain brings in much more water uptake, the higher the sustained bending, the higher the absorbed water content. For the rate of diffusion, the same trend is found. Similar results were reported on a pultruded vinyl ester-based GFRP composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312457099">9</xref></sup> For the apparent coefficient of diffusion (<italic>D</italic><sub>a</sub>) in both cases of immersion, however, there is no such monotonic trend (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312457099">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312457099">2</xref>). A very slight change in <italic>D</italic><sub>a</sub> occurred when the sustained bending increased from 0 to 25%, while a dramatic increase in <italic>D</italic><sub>a</sub> was realized as the sustained bending continuously increased by 40%. The variation of water uptake parameters (see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312457099">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312457099">2</xref>) was attributed to the change of water absorption mechanisms under different sustained bending levels.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms of water uptake in a fiber-reinforced composite were expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312457099">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312457099">16</xref></sup> One is related to free volume of the polymer matrix, and the other is related to the defects in the composites, e.g., voids and debonding of fibers from the polymer resin (leading to the wicking effect).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312457099">17</xref></sup> For the mechanisms with the free volume, the external tension stress will lead the free volume to increase, and thus the enhanced water diffusion coefficient and water uptake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312457099">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312457099">16</xref></sup> On the contrary, the compression decreases the volume content of the system, bringing in reduced water diffusion coefficient and water uptake. For the mechanisms with defeats inside of the system, the water flow and storage in the microcraks as well as the interfaces between debonded fiber and matrix can bring in much remarkable water uptake, diffusion rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312457099">17</xref></sup> For the present UV-GFRP system, the ultimate strain is around 1.94%, and the imposed tensile strain on the tension side only about 0.485% to 0.776%. Therefore, the macro-cracks of the UV-GFRP will not occur for both strain levels. As observed with light microscopy, even after 4 months of immersion, no cracks were found on the tension side of the UV-GFRP samples. Accordingly, under lower bending strain level (less than 25%), the free volume change due to the bending strain is dominant on the water absorption. However, under high bending strain (i.e., 40%), fiber debonding and the central delamination of the sample may occur, and a new path of water diffusion and new place for water uptake were realized. The wicking effect is dominant, leading to much higher water uptake and diffusion. The similar mechanisms of water absorption due to sustained bending were proposed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312457099">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is noted as a point of interest that the UV-GFRPs immersed in water possess higher <italic>E</italic><italic><sub>∞</sub></italic>, <italic>D</italic><sub>a</sub> and <italic>k</italic> values than those immersed in alkaline solution under the same strain levels. This can be attributed to hydrolysis of UV-cured acrylate resin catalyzed by alkaline solution, which leads to continuous mass loss and offset the water uptake and diffusion. In one our previous study, the hydrolysis of the UV cured acrylate resin was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312457099">18</xref></sup> It is worth noting that the conventionally cured GFRP composites used for rehabilitation, upgrading of civil structures are based on epoxy resin system. The molecular structures of the cured epoxy resin system are mainly ether bonds, which is much stable than acrylate bonds of UV curing system during immersion. In view of this, it is not surprising that the UV-GFRP system exhibits less durable than conventional cured GFRP composites, especially during immersion.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figure 3</xref> shows the variation of tensile properties of UV-GFRP strips as a function of ageing time under combined effects of sustained bending and distilled water immersion. For comparison, samples under sustained bending in ambient were also tested and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figure 3</xref>. In ambient conditions, the tensile strength gradually reduced by 7.9% and 16.9% with sustained bending strain of 25% and 40% in 6 months. While in distilled water, more degradation in the tensile strength is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figure 3</xref>). The reduction is about 9.6% for the sustained bending strain of 25%, and 26.2% for the sustained bending strain of 40%. Clearly, combined with water immersion, the sustained strain exhibits a more detrimental effect on the degradation of the tensile strength. Compared to the water immersion, the alkaline solution immersion accelerates degradation in the strength of the UV-GFRP samples under sustained bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312457099">Figure 4(a)</xref>), significantly. In 6 months, the tensile strength readily decreased by 41% under 25% of bending strain, and by 48.7% under 40% of bending strain when UV-GFRPs were immersed in alkaline solution. It is worth noting that the reduction in the tensile strength of a glass fiber reinforced vinyl ester pultruded strips is around 20–26% under the similar bending conditions for a similar water immersion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312457099">8</xref></sup>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figure 3(c)</xref> shows the variation of the ultimate tensile strain as a function of ageing time. As shown, the ultimate strain gradually decreases with the ageing time by 13–17%, and immersion in water does not bring more degradation. The higher the sustained bending strain leads to the higher reduction in the ultimate strain. More severe degradations of the ultimate strain were found for the combined effect of sustained bending and alkaline solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312457099">Figure 4(c)</xref>). This trend is consistent with the change of the tensile strength.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the section of water absorption, the combined effects of sustained bending and immersion may bring in fiber debonding, cracks in resin as well as delamination, which undoubtedly can cause the premature breaks of UV-GFRPs during tension, resulting in decreased tensile strength and ultimate strain. Since alkaline immersion additionally leads to hydrolysis of the resin, more severe degradations in the strength and ultimate strain were realized.</p>
<p>As opposed to the tensile strength and the ultimate elongation, the tensile modulus was increased by 12% for the samples under sustained bending in ambient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figure 3(b)</xref>) regardless of the level of the sustained strain. Combined with the water immersion, the tensile modulus is enhanced to a similar extent for the lower sustained bending. However, under the higher sustained bending combined with distilled water, the tensile modulus exhibits much less affected. Similarly, UV-GFRPs subjected to combined sustained bending and alkaline solution exhibit clearly increases in the tensile modulus, even under high sustained bending level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312457099">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Orientation of the resins due to the sustained tension strain on the tension side of the UV-GFRP samples, as expected, can contribute to the enhanced modulus. In addition, due to the extraction of un-cured small molecules during immersion, the resin system will be hardening. This will also lead to the increase of the modulus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998312457099"><title>Residual strain</title>
<p>As assumed above, the orientation of resin molecules due to extended bending strain occurred and was responsible for the increased tensile modulus. On the other side, when the imposed bending strain was removed, the oriented resin molecules will cause residual flexural deformation. In this section, the residual flexural deformation is discussed.</p>
<p>The residual strain of UV-GFRPs is calculated by the flexural deformation (s), which was directly measured on the specimens immediately after they were taken off from the fixture. The residual strain is expressed as:

where, <italic>h</italic> is the thickness of the sample, and <italic>l</italic> is the span length of the specimen.</p>
<p>Variation of the residual strain as a function of ageing time under various sustained bending strains and immersion conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312457099">Figure 5</xref>. As found, for both ambient and immersion cases, the sustained bending levels exhibit a significant effect on the residual strains. Even only after 1 week under sustained bending, the residual strain in immersion or ambient environments, the residual strain is in the range of 0.04–0.05% for 25% ultimate strain and ∼0.13% for 40% ultimate strain. With the ageing time extending, the residual strain gradually increase with different rates, dependent on the exposure conditions. The specimens immersed in alkaline solution possess the highest residual strain, while the specimens in water and ambient conditions have the middle or lowest residual strain, respectively. After 6 months, the maximum residual strain reaches 0.34% for specimens imposed with 40% ultimate strain and immersed in alkaline solution.
<fig id="fig5-0021998312457099" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Residual strains due to sustained bending in various environments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312457099-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Such high residual strain is attributed to the orientation of the resin matrix due to the long-term sustained deformation. The absorbed water molecules will plasticize the resin system and facilitate the orientation process. Therefore, the higher residual strains are formed for the samples under the combined effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312457099">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the orientation of the resin molecules due to sustained bending and extraction of uncured small molecules resulted in the improvement of tensile modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figures 3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312457099">4(b)</xref>) and the residual strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312457099">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to plot the curves of the tensile modulus vs. the residual strain, which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312457099">Figure 6</xref>. As shown, for both bending levels, the tensile modulus increases with the residual strain. This result support the assumption that the increase of the modulus with ageing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312457099">Figures 3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312457099">4(b)</xref>) is mainly coming from orientation of the resin molecules.

</fig></p>
<p>Compared to ambient aged UV-GFRP, the larger residual strain leads to relative lower modulus increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312457099">Figure 6(a)</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312457099"> and (b)</xref>), which is attributed to the offsetting effects from water plasticizing on the modulus increase.

As expected, the permanent damages (e.g., delanination and debonding of fibers) that may have occurred under high sustained bending leads to extra residual strain, which will not contribute to the increase of the tensile modulus.</p>

<p>In the present paper, effect of combined water/alkaline immersion and sustained bending on the degradation of a UV-cured GFRP composite was investigated, in terms of water uptake, tensile properties, residual deformation and viscoelastic performances. The following conclusions were drawn according to the study.
<list id="list1-0021998312457099" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Sustained bending accelerates the diffusion rate and increases the water uptake remarkably, the higher the bending strain, the more water absorbed and the higher the diffusion rate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Under combined alkaline solution immersion and sustained bending, the tensile strength of the UV-GFRP decreased remarkably with ageing time and sustained bending levels, while the tensile modulus increased slightly. For the case of water immersion, a similar trend was found but to a much lower extent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Water/alkaline solution immersion and sustained bending show a synergistic effect on the residual deformation for aged UV-GFRP strips.
