<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Guidelines for primary prevention recommend calculation of lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in addition to short-time risk. We aimed at evaluating the distribution of CVD lifetime risk and the percentage of Italians having low short-term, but high lifetime, risk.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Cross-sectional general population-based cohort study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: We included 8,403 (46% men) cardiovascular disease-free individuals aged 35–50 years, among those randomly recruited in the framework of the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> cohort. Participants were stratified into three groups: low short-time (10-year) (≤3% and non diabetic)/low lifetime, low short-time/high lifetime, and high short-time risk. Short-time risk was evaluated by the equation provided by the Italian <italic>CUORE</italic> project. Lifetime risk was evaluated using the algorithm derived from the Framingham cohort.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> High short-time risk was prevalent in 16% population (32% of men and 2% of women). Among individuals with low short-time risk, 80% had high lifetime risk (82% men and 78% women). The proportion of individuals with very low lifetime risk due to all optimal risk factors was 4.1% only (1.5% men and 6.3% women).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: A large proportion of Italian adults not qualified for CVD primary prevention because of their very low short-time predicted CVD risk, are in fact at high risk to develop a CVD event in their lifetime; therefore population-based approaches should be sought to modify the overall distribution of individual risk factors. These findings offer helpful information for policy makers involved in contrasting the burden of CVD, especially in women and young men.</p>

<p>The huge public health burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) requires renewed efforts to promote prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711410820">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711410820">2</xref></sup> Primary prevention of CVD is based on modification of one or more of multiple risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711410820">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711410820">4</xref></sup> Multivariable risk estimation methods, such as the Framingham Score for coronary heart disease (CHD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711410820">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711410820">5</xref></sup> the European SCORE for CVD mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711410820">6</xref></sup> the Italian <italic>Progetto-CUORE</italic> Score for CHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711410820">7</xref></sup> or the UK QRISK2 algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711410820">8</xref></sup> all produce estimates of risk over the next 10 years. According to these scores, large proportions of adults, particularly women and younger men, appear to be at low short-term risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711410820">9</xref></sup> This large ‘low risk’ population comprises those who will remain low risk as well those who will become high risk their lifespan along.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711410820">10</xref></sup> As a consequence, current risk assessment strategies may inadequately assess CVD risk in many women and younger men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711410820">11</xref></sup> USA national guidelines suggest to consider lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease in addition to short-time (10-year) risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711410820">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711410820">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref></sup> Better understanding of the lifetime risk for CVD may be useful in public health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711410820">14</xref></sup> Since either lifetime or short-time risk estimates provide an absolute risk assessment, they may be more easily understood than relative risks, and may help motivate beneficial changes in lifestyle or healthy behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711410820">14</xref></sup> A stratification system whereby individuals with low short-term predicted risk are then evaluated for lifetime predicted risk could improve prevention strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711410820">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711410820">15</xref></sup> At the moment, the distribution of CVD lifetime risk and the percentage of individuals having low short-term but high lifetime predicted risk have only been investigated in US population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711410820">15</xref></sup> The potential utility of identifying a low short-term/high lifetime risk group of individuals in populations outside the USA would be better appreciated if the population-specific prevalence of this group were known. Estimate of the distribution of short-time combined with lifetime risk strata in a population at low incidence of CVD, with a preponderance of individuals at low short-time risk, may help promoting the use of the lifetime CVD algorithm in primary prevention practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711410820">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, we applied published lifetime risk algorithm to the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711410820">16</xref></sup> Italian cohort to estimate the distribution of lifetime CVD risk and the prevalence of each of the following three risk groups: low short-term/low lifetime CVD, low short-term/high lifetime CVD, and high short-term CVD predicted risk.</p>

<p>We included all CVD-free participants aged 50 years or less randomly recruited in the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711410820">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711410820">17</xref></sup> Briefly, the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> project is a cohort study, started in March 2005. Participants, men and women aged ≥35, living in Molise, a Southern Italian region, were randomly recruited from city-hall registries. Up to April 2010, 24,318 subjects were recruited, and 8,701 were aged 35–50 years. We excluded participants with missing values for components of short-time or lifetime algorithms (<italic>n </italic>= 222). The final study sample consisted of 8,403 subjects aged 35–50 years.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1741826711410820"><title>Risk factor ascertainment</title>
<p>Cigarette smoking was defined by self-report of currently smoking and having smoked &gt;100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication and diabetes mellitus was defined by self-reported doctor diagnosis or the use of relevant medications that identified these conditions. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the ATP III criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711410820">18</xref></sup> Blood pressure was measured by an automatic device (OMRON-HEM-705CP) three times on the non-dominant arm, with the patient lying down for about 5 minutes. Serum lipids and blood glucose were assayed by enzymatic reaction methods using an automatic analyzer (ILab-350). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was calculated according to the Friedewald formula. High sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured in fresh serum samples within 3 hours from collection. A latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay (IL-Coagulation-Systems ACL9000, IL, Milan, Italy) was used.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1741826711410820"><title>Risk classification definitions</title>
<p>Short-term risk was estimated using the <italic>Progetto CUORE</italic> risk assessment tool,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711410820">7</xref></sup> which incorporates age, gender, total and high-density cholesterol levels, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes and treatment for hypertension into a multivariable equation to estimate 10-year risk for a major cardiovascular event (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome or stroke). The <italic>CUORE</italic> equation was derived from an Italian population. For the present study, ‘high’ 10-year risk was defined as risk &gt;3% or the presence of diabetes. Lifetime risk was estimated for five mutually exclusive strata of risk factor burden using previously published algorithm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410820">19</xref></sup> Risk factors considered were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, BMI, diabetes mellitus and current smoking. We defined ‘low lifetime predicted risk’ as the two lower risk strata which, according to prior analyses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410820">19</xref></sup> have predicted lifetime risk &lt;39%, and ‘high lifetime predicted risk’ as the three higher risk strata, which have predicted lifetime risk ≥39% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>). This stratification was chosen <italic>a priori</italic> based on the previously observed separation in lifetime risks of these two groups in US cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410820">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711410820">20</xref></sup>

<p>Baseline characteristics were computed for risk groups and presented as numbers and percentage, or mean values and standard deviation or geometric means and 95% confidence interval (for triglycerides, glucose, CRP and white blood cell). In all analyses, the risk group functioned as the independent variable, and the risk factors functioned as the dependent variable. Multivariable analysis of variance for continuous variables and categorical data analysis (PROC CATMOD for SAS) for categorical variables were used to adjust for age differences across risks groups. To test if our findings were largely due to any single major risk factors, we calculated the distribution of risk strata excluding at each run individuals with a specific major risk factor. To obtain an approximation of the overestimation of the lifetime risk in Italians introduced by applying the Framingham (FHS) lifetime score, we proceeded as follow: 1) in each risk strata group reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref> we calculated the mean predicted short-time risk using both the FHS and the CUORE 10-year algorithm; 2) we calculated how large the overestimation was; 3) we rescaled the predicted lifetime risk based on the assumption that the overestimation in lifetime risk was of the same amount as in the case of short-time risk.</p>

<p>High short-time risk (<italic>CUORE</italic> risk ≥3% or diabetic) was prevalent in 32.1% of men (47 were diabetics) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Table 2</xref>). Individuals with a predicted short-time risk were classified in five categories of increasing lifetime risk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Table 2</xref>). Only 17.9% of them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Table 2</xref>) were in the first two categories – which identify the low lifetime group, having a lifetime CVD risk lower than 36% in a US population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>). The majority (82.1%) of Italians having a low short-time risk were classified in the high lifetime group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Table 2</xref>), with a lifetime risk greater than 46% in a US population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In women, as expected, the prevalence of high short-time risk was very low (2.0%); one third of them were diabetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711410820">Table 3</xref>). Out of 4,433 women with a low short-time risk, 21.5% were classified as having low lifetime risk (lifetime risk &lt;27% in a US population) and 78.5% high lifetime risk (lifetime risk &gt;39% in a US population; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711410820">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Of note, the proportion of individuals with very low lifetime risk due to all optimal risk factors was very small, namely 6.3% in women and 1.5% only in men (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711410820">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Mean values of Framingham and CUORE short-time risk prediction values as well as rescaled lifetime risks for our population were also illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>, for each lifetime strata risk. As expected, the short-time predictions increased according to lifetime risk, and the re-proportionate absolute lifetime risk was largely lower than that reported for a US population.</p>
<p>Risk factor distribution according to strata risk is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711410820">3</xref>, separately for men and women. As largely expected, individuals with high short-time risk have a worse pattern of CVD risk factors. Within individuals with low short-time risk, the pattern of CVD risk factors generally worsen according to increased lifetime risk category. This is expected for the risk factors implicated in the definition of the lifetime risk strata, but is even more apparent for the other risk factors analysed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711410820">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711410820">3</xref>).</p>
<p>When high short-time risk was defined as &gt;10% (or diabetic) its prevalence was reduced to 1.4%, and was formed almost exclusively by diabetic patients (see supplementary material Table 4). When low HDL cholesterol and obesity were not included as major risk factors, the proportion of subjects with high lifetime predicted risk was lower (see supplementary material Table 4), and 6.4% of individuals moved from the low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group to the low short-term/low lifetime predicted risk group. We calculated the distribution of risk strata excluding at each run individuals with a specific major risk factor (see supplementary material Table 4). In all cases, the pattern of results was nearly similar, suggesting that no individual risk factor alone determined the findings.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741826711410820"><title>Principal findings</title>
<p>Our study reports the first analysis of the distribution of lifetime CVD risk strata in a non-US population, specifically, in an Italian population. Several important findings were obtained.</p>
<p>First, a large group of Italian adults not qualified for CVD primary prevention because of their low short-time predicted CVD risk, were in fact at high risk to develop a CVD event later in their lifetime. This group is substantially formed by women and younger men, both populations for which short-time risk assessment has a low discriminating power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711410820">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711410820">11</xref></sup> Previous studies on the distribution of lifetime/short-time CVD risk strata in US populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711410820">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711410820">20</xref></sup> found that large majority of individuals with a low short-time predicted CVD risk have a high lifetime risk.</p>
<p>Second, the low short-term/high lifetime risk group had a baseline unfavourable CVD risk profile in comparison with the low short-term/low lifetime risk group. Our results are in line with those obtained in the CARDIA and MESA studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711410820">20</xref></sup> which demonstrated that individuals with low 10-year but high lifetime risk have a greater subclinical disease burden and greater incidence of atherosclerotic progression compared with individuals with both low 10-year and low lifetime risk.</p>
<p>Third, the risk stratification applied was not due to any single major risk factor, but was dependent from the combined pattern of risk factors. Accordingly, favourable modifications of a single risk factor at individual level would result in a modest impact at population level, whereas a global improvement in CVD risk profile is needed to substantially reduce the percentage of individuals with high short-time predicted risk and the proportion of subjects in the group of low short-time but high lifetime predicted risk.</p>
<p>Although the database of the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> study was cross-sectional analysed, and no longitudinal data were available, our findings provide a reliable description of the population prevalence of short-time and lifetime CVD risk strata, obtained from a large cohort of adults well representative of the general Italian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711410820">16</xref></sup> Future analyses of the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> longitudinal observations will hopefully provide additional information, and precise evaluation of the lifetime risk in a low short-term risk population.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711410820"><title>Public health implications</title>
<p>Our results support the adoption of the proposed stratification system by healthcare professionals to aid risk communication to a large part of the Italian adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711410820">14</xref></sup> Communication of the lifetime predicted risk in the context of a primary prevention intervention would change the message to those individuals with low short-term but high lifetime predicted risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711410820">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711410820">23</xref></sup> Individuals with a low short-term but high lifetime risk, should be encouraged to adopt intensive lifestyle modifications as a primary preventive intervention. In addition, the use of lipid-lowering, antihypertension or antidiabetic medications when their LDL cholesterol or blood pressure or glycaemia remain high should be considered. However, coupling risk estimation assessment with clinical evaluation of each subject will provide the best specific guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>Our findings offer an innovative baseline for population burden of lifetime predicted CVD risk against which the effects of future public health and clinical interventions may be measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711410820">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711410820">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711410820">22</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711410820"><title>Potential limitations</title>
<p>The major limitation of our findings consists in the fact that for the calculation of the lifetime risk we used an algorithm that had been developed and validated in a US population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711410820">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711410820">19</xref></sup> We suppose that the application of such an algorithm to the Italian population can overestimate the lifetime risk, as the Framingham short-time risk equation overestimates the 10-year risk when applied to Italians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711410820">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711410820">24</xref></sup> Calibration of equations improved accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711410820">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711410820">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711410820">26</xref></sup> but the procedure for recalibration was not applicable to the algorithm of lifetime calculation, at least at the best of the available statistic methods. Based on the assumption that the overestimation in lifetime risk was of the same amount as in the case of short-time risk, we obtained an approximate appraisal of the overestimation introduced by the use of the lifetime Framingham algorithm in Italians. Nonetheless, the percentage of Italians with low short-time but high lifetime predicted CVD risk is so large that even if the lifetime risk would have been overestimated, the main message of this study would remain substantially unchanged.</p>
<p>The lifetime time risk prediction algorithms have not yet been validated, and large studies with a long follow-up, including the <italic>MOLI-SANI</italic> study, will hopefully be able to validate the risk stratification proposed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711410820">Table 1</xref>. In addition, country-specific population-based estimates of lifetime risk are needed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711410820" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A large proportion of Italian adults not qualified for CVD primary prevention because of their very low short-time predicted CVD risk, were in fact at high risk to develop a CVD event in their lifetime. Our findings suggest that the majority of the population is at high lifetime CVD risk, and therefore effective population-based approaches to modify the overall distribution of individual risk factors are likely to be particularly effective in modifying these risks (in addition to the clinical approach of identifying and treating those at high short-term risk). Individuals with a low short-term but high lifetime risk should be attracted to adopt primary preventive interventions. However, coupling risk estimation assessment with clinical evaluation of each subject will provide the best specific guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>Despite its potential limitations, our description of short-term and lifetime risk strata among Italian adults offers helpful useful information for policy makers involved in contrasting the burden of CVD in a low short-term risk incidence population.</p>
