<p>In <italic>Frames of Mind</italic>, Howard Gardner argues that the purpose of education is to enhance understanding of not only the world, but also the self and human experiences. John Dewey felt that schools should mirror life, not simply be a preparation for life. According to these philosophers, the purpose of education is to allow individuals the opportunity to better understand their world. Our students should have the opportunity to exercise their capabilities as well as have avenues for growth. Authentic assessment, specifically the music portfolio, provides students the chance to both learn what they can do now and what they can achieve.</p>
<p>While no one specific educational philosophy is directly related to authentic assessment, educational philosophy and assessment are nonetheless intertwined, since instructional decisions dictate assessment strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112470071">1</xref></sup> Educational reform during the past three decades has increasingly highlighted the desire to develop and implement high standards in every classroom. As a result, developing assessment strategies is necessary to determine if standards are being met. The debate continues about which type of assessment should be used to measure progress toward these standards. While some educators prefer the development of a standardized national achievement test like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), others promote authentic assessment as a means of melding assessment with instruction. Advocates of authentic assessment contend that tools like the portfolio can capture a wider array of student knowledge, problem solving, and critical thinking than is possible with multiple-choice or other structured format tests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112470071">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The move toward large-scale authentic assessment is evident in the proliferation of portfolio requirements in teacher education programs and public school capstone projects like the senior project, which has an embedded portfolio component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112470071">3</xref></sup> A portfolio can document student skills, abilities, growth, achievement, and attitudes. It can also reflect students’ learning processes and subsequently guide new teaching strategies. Portfolio proponents have used these arguments to justify the time and organization needed to successfully implement them in their classrooms and in their school districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112470071">4</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0027432112470071">
<title>What Is a Portfolio?</title>
<p>The portfolio in education has its origins in the art world: Artists use portfolios of their work as a means of showcasing their creative process and outcomes. In education, when used as a means of authentic assessment, a portfolio is “a purposeful collection of student work that exhibits the student’s efforts, progress, and achievements in one or more areas.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112470071">5</xref></sup> A number of elements are needed for creating effective portfolios. These include purposeful selection of material, student self-reflection, and criteria for judging student work. If the purpose of the portfolio is to exhibit student effort, progress, and achievement, then the items included in the portfolio (“artifacts”) should reflect those goals. Artifacts can include any number of assignments or creative tasks the students have completed in and outside class (e.g., performance tests, sketches from a composition project, concert reviews). In addition to teacher feedback, students use self-assessment to play an active part in their own development as learners. The third element, judging student work, can be the most daunting, since it typically involves creation of rubrics against which student work is judged.</p>
<p>Ideally, each artifact in the portfolio has been chosen to document student growth and has been assessed by both student and teacher against a detailed rubric. Teachers usually construct the requirements for these artifacts in the form of assignments or projects. Once both teacher and student have reflected on and assessed the work, it is placed in the student portfolio. Both teacher and student are involved in maintaining the portfolio. While traditional “paper-based” portfolios are still viable, electronic (web-based) portfolios have helped alleviate storage space issues. Either type of portfolio can provide teachers a thorough student profile supported by documented evidence of skills developed over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112470071">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Meaningful Music</title>
<p>In the book <italic>Vision 2020</italic>, music historian Michael Mark said, “Basic skills—reading, writing, and mathematics—are simply the tools that open the gate to education but are not an education in themselves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112470071">7</xref></sup> Similarly, performance is one of the tools music educators can use to open the gate to meaningful music education. Music educator Frederick Burrack noted that attendance and performance skills are important but should not be the sole basis for evaluation if educational objectives in music include creative thinking and problem solving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112470071">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>By experiencing all aspects of music, students are allowed the opportunity to fully understand what music can mean for them. It has been suggested that the music profession as a whole does not seem comfortable measuring the outcomes of our teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112470071">9</xref></sup> Perhaps this is where alternative assessment, specifically the music portfolio, can be a useful tool for music educators. The music portfolio offers a systematic approach to demonstrating and documenting students’ musical experiences with all aspects of music.</p>
<p>In describing the holistic nature of music education, music pedagogue Eunice Boardman stated that “an instructional theory can only be valid to the degree to which one’s responses result in a cohesive whole, each facet complementing and influencing all others. Only when such a whole emerges can the decisions one makes daily truly enable a teacher to reach the desired goal: to construct an environment where meaningful learning will take place.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112470071">10</xref></sup> Through performing, creating, and responding, students are engaged in the same kinds of thinking as professional musicians, albeit at a simpler level. The synthesis of these skills allows music educators to provide students with broader opportunities to experience meaningful music in a creative environment, not just a skills-based one. By incorporating performing, creating, and responding into the music portfolio, students can provide a demonstration of their musical growth over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0027432112470071">
<title>The Music Portfolio</title>
<p>The music portfolio is similar in approach to Arts PROPEL, a collaboration between Harvard’s Project Zero and the Educational Testing Service. This collaboration centered on the use of a “processfolio” to demonstrate students’ <italic>production, perception</italic>, and <italic>reflection</italic> in music, visual arts, and imaginative writing. Arts PROPEL was later expanded on in the Assessing Projects and Portfolios for Learning (APPLE) project, which focused on three questions: (1) What are effective ways of assessing student performances and project work? (2) How can a child’s work on a series of projects be documented and assessed fairly? and (3) What is required to implement portfolio assessment in a school so that it will take root and serve as an ongoing tool for the evaluation of programs as well as children?</p>
<p>Music portfolios serve as tools for demonstrating and documenting understanding of music beyond basic performance skills. This mirrors a statement in the book <italic>The School Music Program: A New Vision</italic>: “[Music’s] primary purpose is to improve the quality of life for all students by developing their capabilities to participate fully in their musical culture.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112470071">11</xref></sup> The music portfolio allows students to comprehensively demonstrate how they interact in music, not just through performance.</p>
<p>Through the music portfolio, students learn by doing, and in developing the portfolio “skills” (performing, creating, responding), the focus of the program becomes less concert-driven and more music-driven. As musicologist Christopher Small might say, students are “musicking,” and they become involved with the creative process by making critical decisions about their performances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112470071">12</xref></sup> What follows is a music portfolio model that has been successfully implemented in public schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0027432112470071">
<title>Performing</title>
<p>Music performance is the main output of the musical experience. Recent technology advances have allowed independent music-making to become more meaningful because students are performing alone and cannot depend on other musicians in the ensemble. Computer-assisted instruction and recorded performances enhance the development of technical skills without using group rehearsal time. Students’ recorded performances can also be assessed by printing out exercises/études and burning MP3/CD recordings of their performances. Assessments of these performances are accomplished through the use of teacher-completed performance rubrics and student self-assessments. The music portfolio thus contains “snapshots” of student performance development and allows students to judge and compare their own work repeatedly from works in progress to final completed works.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112470071">13</xref></sup> It documents student progress and their development as musicians.</p>
<p>Rehearsal recordings allow music learning to become both a process and a product. Recordings promote meaningful music by allowing students to hear the musical experience as a journey as they reflect on the music-making process. After recording a rehearsal, the teacher might have students complete a rehearsal critique in which they evaluate their performance in relation to several musical elements (see the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432112470071">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112470071">14</xref></sup> A technique particularly well suited to the music portfolio is recording rehearsals of the same piece, perhaps one to be performed in a concert, at different times in a quarter. After each recording, students complete a rehearsal critique and teachers assess the critique against a rubric.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112470071">15</xref></sup> These critiques are then placed in the student portfolio to document growth and improvement of both performance skills and self-evaluative skills over time.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0027432112470071" position="float">

</fig>
<p>By placing the recording, response sheet, and rubric in the student portfolio, students, parents, and administrators see that music is both a process and a product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112470071">16</xref></sup> The portfolio provides documentation of student progress as they reflect upon and evaluate their musical skill. It helps remove the need for inference in understanding students’ processes toward a finished product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112470071">17</xref></sup> This reflective process of continuous student self-evaluation is one of the major strengths of portfolio assessment. It encourages student reflection on their work and helps improve evaluative techniques that can improve achievement, not just monitor it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0027432112470071">18</xref></sup> Music is a journey that brings with it struggles and joys in overcoming obstacles. To paraphrase a statement attributed to philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, the lasting values we hold dear tend to be those that involve personal commitment and inner struggle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0027432112470071">
<title>Creating</title>
<p>The music portfolio is also used to showcase student creativity in music. Students take part in the craft of music-making through improvising, composing, and arranging. Improvisation is meaningful because it is a unique individual creation of expression on the part of the student. It is different every time, and emotions/states of mind can affect how it is performed. In addition, it allows students to begin thinking in music. Improvisation allows for experimentation in music and facilitates students’ understanding of the function of music. A variety of improvisation methods and software programs allow students to practice this skill in the comfort of their own homes. These exercises can be recorded to audio CD/MP3 and included in the music portfolio with a printout of the chord changes/improvisation étude. Here again, the portfolio provides an opportunity to display and document authentic musical behaviors and student growth through reflection and teacher feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0027432112470071">19</xref></sup> It provides continuous and ongoing information chronicling student development over time while allowing exhibition of student work at different stages of development and focusing on enhancing the instructional process. In addition, by broadening students’ experiences with improvisation, this might lead to increased participation in jazz band. Or at the very least, it can develop more comfortable improvisers in the jazz band.</p>
<p>Composing and arranging is meaningful in that students reflect upon their own music. This component of the music portfolio allows children to “begin reflecting on music-making, initiating dialogs which address central issues of philosophy of music . . . as children compose or improvise, [they are] participating in communities of practice, which deal directly with the core issues pertaining to music.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0027432112470071">20</xref></sup> Opportunities for composition can present themselves in a number of ways. The unit study lesson plan (from Robert Garofalo’s <italic>Blueprint for Band</italic>) and special class projects can become vehicles for teaching composition to students in performing ensembles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0027432112470071">21</xref></sup> A sample composition project and rubric are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0027432112470071">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0027432112470071">3</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0027432112470071">22</xref></sup> Additionally, the teacher might decide to hold composition workshops to help students to develop their compositional ideas; a local college or university could be contacted to allow preservice music teachers the opportunity to interact with students. To reemphasize music as a process, students should be encouraged to retain any scratch work they do prior to submitting the finished product. All this material, including the rubric, can be included in the student’s music portfolio. Students might also write a reflection on the composition process and perform their composition in class, thus illustrating the holistic approach to music (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0027432112470071">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0027432112470071">
<title>Responding</title>
<p>The final skill included in this music portfolio model is responding, which consists of the following four components: music analysis, music evaluation, relating music to the other arts, and relating music to history. Each of these components can be addressed both visually (score examples) and aurally. Music analysis can be particularly meaningful when students have already completed a composition of their own, thus allowing them to make qualitative judgments about their own compositions. This skill is also transferrable to the ensemble setting, where students can begin to make sound musical decisions, one hallmark of independent musicians. As part of the comprehensive approach to music education, students are allowed the opportunity to analyze music. The analysis component can manifest itself in a number of different assignments/projects. One specific assignment can use an excerpt of a piece being prepared for a concert performance. Using an excerpt of music, students identify and explain compositional devices and elements of music. For each excerpt, students are asked a series of questions assessing their knowledge of tonality, phrase structure, music vocabulary, and other analytical techniques. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0027432112470071">Figure 5</xref> is an example of a music analysis worksheet developed for <italic>Civil War Suite</italic> by Harold Walters. Teachers might decide to include this component as part of the unit study lesson plan or create similar questions for each piece being performed in the ensemble setting. These items would be placed in the music portfolio as evidence of meeting the standard for music analysis.</p>
<fig id="fig6-0027432112470071" position="float">
<label>Figure 5</label>
<caption><p>Sample Exercise to Illustrate Music Analysis of Music Being Performed in an Ensemble Setting.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112470071-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The second component of the responding domain is music evaluation. In reflecting on music and music-making, students have the opportunity to discover not only the technical aspects of music (form, key, orchestration, etc.), but also the emotive response. As music philosopher Panagiotis Kanellopoulos stated, “I argue that in their engagement with a process of reflection on music-making children are immersed in a meaning-making process . . . Through the study of talk we might locate clues which will enable us to glimpse aspects of children’s felt experience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0027432112470071">23</xref></sup> Following each performance, the music educator might choose to have students complete a performance self-assessment in which students evaluate their own contributions to the ensemble’s performance. Through the use of rehearsal recordings made available to students, each student makes critical evaluations and devises practice plans to remediate deficiencies in their performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0027432112470071">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig7-0027432112470071" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112470071-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The third and fourth components of the responding domain are relating music to the other arts and relating music to history. Sample assignments to place in the portfolio might manifest themselves in a unit study lesson plan. Pieces based on folk songs or inspired by literature can be particularly useful in addressing these final two components. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0027432112470071">Figure 7</xref> is an example of how <italic>American Sailing Songs</italic> (Gene Milford) was used by one student to make connections between music and poetry by rewriting the lyrics of a sea chantey, demonstrating an understanding of poetic meter and rhyme scheme. Through the use of these types of special projects, students can showcase their creativity in connecting what they learn in music class to other school subjects.</p>

<title>Implementation</title>
<p>In spite of the challenges of limited time, organizational direction, and training, a portfolio can be an effective means of documenting student learning over time. The portfolio reveals individual student development, documents authentic musical behaviors, and promotes higher-order thinking and depth of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0027432112470071">24</xref></sup> In addition to the instructional benefits, a secondary benefit of the music portfolio can be that of advocacy. A natural outcome of the music portfolio is the personal dissemination of new information and skills students gain while completing assignments. Portfolios are not just assessment tools; they can be communication tools during parent/teacher/student conferences. Conferencing has been identified as a central part of the portfolio assessment process, and portfolios have been used to guide parent/teacher/student conferences while focusing on student artifacts in the portfolio that demonstrate skill, accomplishments, strengths, and weaknesses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0027432112470071">25</xref></sup> I have used student portfolios (with student and parent permission) as a means of showcasing student learning and growth to a number of stakeholders (administrators, school board members, community members, etc.). This has included exhibitions of student work at school board meetings and school concerts as documentation of the holistic learning experiences students have in music classes.</p>
<p>Since each school is unique, specific suggestions would not apply to all situations. The following steps, however, offer a starting point for implementing the use of portfolios as authentic assessment in music programs.</p>

<p>Begin gradually: To start, students might create one portfolio assignment per semester.

<p>With the music portfolio, students collect a body of evidence throughout their school career that demonstrates various levels of proficiency in their assignments. Artifacts can include but are not limited to audio/video recordings, concert programs, rubrics, scores (listening assignments), recordings and printouts of études and ensemble literature, concert reviews, self-critiques, special band/orchestra/chorus projects, and comments from peers.</p>

<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Evaluating the music portfolio can be both formative and summative in nature. As the students collect bodies of evidence and place them in the portfolio, the music teacher may assess each piece and offer suggestions for refinement. A suggested evaluation process might be:</p>
<list id="list3-0027432112470071" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Students accumulate artifacts in the body of evidence accompanied by the assignment rubrics (formative assessment).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Each domain (performing, creating, responding) is evaluated using a domain-specific rubric to determine proficiency within each domain (summative assessment).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The entire portfolio is evaluated (based on the domain-specific rubrics) using a compensatory rubric to determine if proficiency was achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0027432112470071">27</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The portfolio and the subsequent evaluation process illustrate a holistic music experience, which in turn represents a number of meaningful music experiences provided for the students. While certainly more research is warranted, there have been well-researched and documented cases of success using portfolios in elementary, middle, and high school music classrooms to promote student learning and musical growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0027432112470071">28</xref></sup> It is suggested that the music teacher, along with the student, parent, and other stakeholders, review the music portfolio each year to determine if the student is achieving proficiency with regard to stated learning goals. Much like the music curriculum, the domain-specific rubrics should be considered flexible documents that can be revised with increased rigor as student proficiency develops. With recent legislative developments nationwide and increased accountability in the public schools, it is incumbent upon music educators to document and demonstrate student progress in an authentic manner. The music portfolio documents students’ progress over time and can serve as a glimpse into the music curriculum and illustrate the holistic nature of the subject matter to a wide variety of stakeholders.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the winter’s over? … The nightingale, back from his wanderings, has been made singing master over the birds. The trees reach out their congratulations … Nothing can stay bound or imprisoned … You say, ‘End this poem here, and wait for what’s next.’ I will. Poems are rough notations for the music we are.”</p>
