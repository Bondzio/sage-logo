<abstract>
<p>Institutional review boards are charged with overseeing that human studies research is conducted in accordance with federal and state regulations and with their own policies and procedures, with the goal of minimizing risks to participants and maximizing the quality of the research data. Nutrition research often involves vulnerable populations, including children and the cognitively impaired, for whom there are specific regulations. Ethical issues are common in nutrition research, and both the investigative team and the institutional review board should seek input regarding ethical issues that arise.</p>

<title>The Institutional Review Board and Regulatory Agencies</title>
<p>In today’s world of research on human subjects, the compliance requirements have become increasingly complex and the risks related to inadequate oversight are great. The number of differing sets of regulations that apply to a given research project is dependent on several factors, including the nature of the research, whether the U.S. government is providing funding, the subject populations being sought, and whether the institution engaged in research has agreed to apply the U.S. Department Health and Human Services (HHS) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612474042">Table 1</xref>) regulations to all research. Most clinical research studies involving a drug or device as a test article are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus requiring compliance with Title 21, Parts 50 and 56 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Most academic medical centers (AMCs) receive significant support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other institutes within the HHS and therefore must follow Title 45, Part 46 of the CFR and its subparts, often referred to as the Common Rule. Other U.S. federal government agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Justice, and Department of Education all have additional and unique requirements for research they are sponsoring or for which certain populations (ie, active military) are targeted.</p>

<p>Underlying their primary role and per the regulations, institutional review boards (IRBs) are charged with ensuring the criteria for approval, as defined by the applicable regulations, are met before allowing a study to commence. Although most IRBs are aware of these requirements, an inordinate amount of effort is focused on the informed consent document.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612474042">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612474042">2</xref></sup> As per 45 CFR 46.111 and 21 CFR 56.111, to approve a research study, IRBs must determine that (1) risks to subjects are minimized through use of sound research design without unnecessarily duplicating procedures, (2) risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits to subjects and the knowledge gained, (3) selection of subjects is equitable, (4) informed consent is attained and (5) appropriately documented, (6) there is an adequate plan for data monitoring to ensure the safety of subjects, (7) there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data, and (8) additional safeguards are in place for vulnerable subjects. Following submission of a new study for review, the IRB must first determine whether it meets the regulatory definition of research involving human subjects. Research involving human subjects may be reviewed in 1 of 3 ways, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612474042">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Today’s regulations were created to build on 3 basic ethical principles—respect for persons, beneficence, and justice—that should underlie the conduct of human research as defined in the Belmont Report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612474042">3</xref></sup> Respect for persons involves treating individuals as autonomous agents to be given the opportunity to make informed, voluntary decisions about research participation and providing protections for those with diminished autonomy who may lack the capacity for such decision making.</p>
<p>Investigators and their research staff have the primary responsibility for protecting the rights and welfare of research subjects and ensuring that the ethical principles in the Belmont Report are followed. Many institutions have initial and continuing education requirements (annually or every 2 or 3 years) for anyone who conducts research involving human subjects to inform investigators of their obligations. Some institutions choose to develop their own programs, whereas many purchase licenses to use commercial products that have been written by nationally recognized experts in human research protections. The value in licensing the commercial products is that they are maintained and updated on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Except when specifically waived by the IRB, individuals participating in nonexempt human subject research must provide legally effective informed consent. Typically, the informed consent process is guided by an informed consent document that includes the basic and additional elements of informed consent as required by HHS and FDA regulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533612474042">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The principle of beneficence requires maximizing the probable benefits from participating in research and minimizing the risks of harm. The principle of justice requires the equitable selection of individual subjects as well as the equitable societal distribution of the burdens and benefits of the research.</p>
<p>For an IRB to be most effective, it must have membership with diverse perspectives, including a strong focus on ethics and regulatory compliance, as well as individuals with a broad range of experiences and backgrounds as well as appropriate technical and medical expertise. The regulations specify that IRB membership meet all criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612474042">Table 4</xref>. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule is yet an additional set of regulations for which many organizations, known as covered entities, conducting clinical research on humans must comply. These regulations came into effect on April 14, 2003, and establish standards for the research use of protected health information (PHI). The intent of the Privacy Rule is actually to protect the confidentiality of data about a person and provides individuals the right to request an accounting of any disclosure of their PHI for research purposes for which they did not give specific authorization. As a result of the Privacy Rule, many IRBs were required to take on yet another responsibility and became “Privacy Boards” under the HIPAA regulations.</p>

<p>The Common Rule has been in effect since 1991, and although 15 federal departments and agencies adopted it, many have issued their own guidance and additional requirements for the protection of human subjects. This results in institutions with large research programs or broad portfolios of sponsors dealing with myriad rules and regulations that are not aligned and even conflict in some cases. There have been recent efforts among the federal agencies toward harmonization of the human research rules that are encouraging to researchers and their institutions. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) is the oversight body that provides regulatory guidance and enforcement related to human research that is conducted by or sponsored by the HHS. The OHRP and FDA have been working together to harmonize their regulatory requirements and guidance and in May 2012 issued separate, but coordinated, draft guidance documents to help institutions deal with the administrative complexities of transferring an already approved research study to a new IRB or research institution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612474042">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In July 2011, the HHS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), titled “Human Subjects Research Protections: Enhancing Protections for Research Subjects and Reducing Burden, Delay, and Ambiguity for Investigators.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612474042">5</xref></sup> In addition to providing uniform guidance on federal regulations, a number of changes are considered in the ANPRM, including a refinement in the requirements for IRB review based on risk, requiring the use of a single IRB for multisite studies, centralized reporting of unanticipated problems and adverse events, improvements to the informed consent process, establishing mandatory data security and confidentiality protections, and extending federal regulatory protections to all U.S. institutions that receive any funding from a Common Rule agency. This ANPRM is in alignment with the president’s executive order to provide for public participation in the rule-making process, innovate and streamline the rules based on careful examination of potentially outdated and insufficient regulations, and provide flexibility to reduce burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612474042">6</xref></sup> The ANPRM provides the opportunity to make changes to the Common Rule that many feel are sorely needed, the goal being to ultimately consider options for simultaneously enhancing protections for research subjects while improving the effectiveness of the federal oversight system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612474042">7</xref></sup> Although it remains unclear what changes will be coming with the ANPRM, we can expect that the rules and regulations governing research with human subjects will continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Going beyond all the regulations that govern the conduct of human research, many institutions have chosen to seek accreditation by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP), recognizing that enhanced programs should result in not only better subject protections but also a competitive advantage when seeking funding from federal agencies and industry sponsors. The accreditation process requires organizations to carefully self-evaluate their human research protection program (HRPP) against the AAHRPP standards, modify processes to meet the standards, and prepare an application for accreditation. Once the AAHRPP receives an organization’s application, a team of experts including AAHRPP staff as well as site visitors (peer reviewers experienced in human subject protections) perform a comprehensive review of the application. When an organization’s application is felt to meet the AAHRPP standards on paper, an on-site evaluation is conducted by the AAHRPP site visitors to assess whether the organization’s practice is consistent with the policies and procedures described in the application. Once it has been confirmed that an organization’s written policies and procedures as well as actual practice are consistent and meet the standards, AAHRPP accreditation may be granted. In addition to a commitment to high ethical and professional standards for the protection of human research subjects that exceed federal regulations, the benefits of AAHRPP accreditation include supporting a high-quality program that strives for continuous improvement, recognition by sponsors and oversight groups of those higher standards, and anticipated higher levels of trust by prospective research subjects as well as greater public confidence in the organization’s research program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612474042">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Facing the dichotomy of the responsibility for local oversight and the recognition that many different IRBs reviewing the same multicenter study most likely will not improve the safety of subjects, institutions and HRPPs are struggling to most effectively use their limited resources and find the right level of control and oversight. Given the increasing financial challenges faced by research programs, it becomes very appealing to administration to reduce redundancies and rely on external IRBs for their review process. The challenge becomes considering all the ancillary reviews required by most HRPPs independent of and in addition to the IRB—that is, radiation safety, conflicts of interest, departmental review for certain vulnerable subjects, data and specimen oversight groups, research billing oversight review, NIH-supported Cancer Center and Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Review Committees, and the VA Research and Development Committee. Although IRB review is a critical part of determining whether a proposed study can be done at one’s institution, significant challenges remain that cannot be delegated or outsourced, including budgeting, contracting, subject population feasibility assessment, local determination of whether equipment and support staff resources are adequate, and the ongoing monitoring and investigation of compliance. Some HRPPs are developing more advanced electronic systems to facilitate ceding review to an external IRB, but coordination of the other local aspects of getting a clinical trial approved and started often remains the greater challenge.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing sensitivity to “IRB scope creep” and the misconception that IRBs have authorities and responsibilities beyond those granted by the regulations and institutional policy. Although IRBs have great influence over the review and initiation of research involving human subjects, they are frequently looked to by their organizations for decision making that goes beyond their mandate. The evolution toward accreditation has helped to draw attention to the fact that the IRB is only one component of an organization’s HRRP. Unfortunately, the IRB continues to be singled out by some researchers as the bureaucratic poster child for why they cannot get their research up and running in a timely manner. Through process improvement methodology and the use of quality management principles, some institutions have made significant improvements in their IRB and other preaward processes. Such efforts allow for better standardized and documented business processes, orientation and training of staff and IRB members, more streamlined processing, and the establishment of performance metrics and operational performance monitoring. Once systems are developed for measuring and assessing performance, identifying and responding to nonconforming events, and seeking and understanding customer feedback, organizations can embark on continuous quality improvement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0884533612474042">
<title>Ethical Issues in the Planning and Execution of Research Studies</title>
<p>The Belmont principles—respect for persons, beneficence, and justice—provide guidance for every aspect of human research. Respect for persons addresses the autonomy of potential participants or their legally authorized representative and their right to have sufficient information about the risks and potential benefits of a research study to make an informed decision. This information should include conflicts of interest for the investigators and the institution where the research is conducted; the rationale and goals of the study; step-by-step details on what research participants undergo while in the study; restrictions on activity, diet, and medications during the study; risks including the need for birth control during and for a time after completion of the study; what will be done with biologic specimens collected in the study and the risks of disclosure of genetic information; who will have access to the participant’s protected health information; and who the participant may contact with questions about the study, with contact information. In 2001, the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) recommended 6 categories of vulnerability for IRBs to consider when assessing the autonomy of research participants: (1) cognitive and communicative vulnerability, with diminished capacity to receive or understand information due to cognitive deficits or language barriers; (2) institutional vulnerability, including students, military personnel, and prisoners; (3) deferential vulnerability due to a subordinate relationship to the consenting individual such as students and employees of the investigator; (4) medical vulnerability, as with patients with disorders for which there is no acceptable standard therapy; (5) economic vulnerability, with the risk of coercion to participate in a research study for monetary gains or access to health care; and (6) social vulnerability, using stereotypes to justify subjecting a social subgroup to a risk/benefit ratio that would be unacceptable to the population at large.</p>
<p>The principle of beneficence addresses the need to reduce the risks and maximize the benefits of research for the individual participant and for society at large. For example, an IRB may weigh the benefits of allowing continuation of a therapeutic trial for a rare disease that has poor enrollment and decide if the potential benefits for the population at large with the disease of possibly completing the study justify the risks to current participants of undergoing interventions in a study that may never be completed and may not generate valid medical knowledge. This principle also justifies closing a study prior to completion if new medical knowledge arises during the course of the study that makes the risk/benefit ratio unacceptable.</p>
<p>The principle of justice is that no group carries an unfair burden for research and there is equal distribution of responsibility for the research. Subgroups of the population such as pregnant women or children may not be excluded from the research without scientific justification. The costs of research-related injury must not place a financial burden on the participant. Remuneration for time and inconvenience and reimbursement for expenses must be equal for all participants in a study.</p>

<title>Ethical Issues in Nutrition Research</title>
<p>Ethical concerns that arise in nutrition research parallel those in clinical practice and include use of artificial nutrition and hydration in patients who are unable to consent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612474042">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612474042">10</xref></sup> consent and assent for dietary intervention for childhood obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612474042">11</xref></sup> and bariatric surgery for obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612474042">12</xref></sup> The Belmont principles can be used to frame the discussion about research in each of these areas. Investigators who plan research studies and institutional review boards that oversee the research studies should ensure that the study is designed to (1) respect the participant’s autonomy. Vulnerable populations are often the recipients of artificial nutrition, and potential research participants or their legally authorized representative must be given adequate information about the risks and benefits and about alternatives to make an independent decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612474042">9</xref></sup> Childhood obesity is related to socioeconomic issues as well as nutrition issues, and protocol-based intervention must ensure that the rights of the child and family are preserved by ensuring that participation is voluntary and that appropriate information about risks and alternatives has been conveyed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612474042">11</xref></sup> The obese individual faces societal pressures due to negative attitudes toward the obese and financial pressures due to the expense of surgery, and there may be a therapeutic misconception that the surgery alone, without changing dietary habits, will cause weight loss. An obese individual must understand the risks and alternatives to a research study that involves bariatric surgery, and the consent process should address the special issues for this group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612474042">12</xref></sup> (2) Beneficence is about minimizing risks to the participant and making the new knowledge from research applicable and available to society at large, and the same precautions and patient information are needed for research as for clinical practice. As with other therapeutic interventions, the goal of beneficence should prompt publishing negative or inconclusive research findings as well as positive studies. (3) Justice and equality in research involve equal access. The just use of artificial nutrition is an area of ethical as well as scientific uncertainty for the terminally ill, but the difficulty and controversy surrounding this question should not prevent research regarding the terminally ill, because exclusion of terminally ill persons from research is in itself unjust. Obesity more often affects the poor, and research on obesity must ensure equal access and avoidance of coercive claims or financial incentives.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are special ethical and social issues regarding nutrition therapy and human studies nutrition research, including vulnerable populations, socially disadvantaged groups, and end-of-life issues. The institutional review board must apply the same regulations and policies to human nutrition research as to other observational and interventional studies. Investigators and review boards should seek advice from ethicists, when appropriate, regarding study design and the consent process for nutrition studies.</p>
