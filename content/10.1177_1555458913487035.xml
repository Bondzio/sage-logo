<abstract>
<p>Due to the closing of the GM Manufacturing Plants, Grand Rapids, Michigan area experienced an extreme loss of jobs, which led to low-socioeconomic hardships such as “food insecurity” that was witnessed in the needs of the many students who attend the Grand Rapid Public Schools. This case provides insight into how educational leader Principal MaryAnn Prisichenko and community activist Mary K. Hoodhood collaborated to form the Kid’s Food Basket in 2001, which feeds more than 3,000 students with sack suppers every weekday. This type of program could be utilized as a model program for other districts that are experiencing similar issues due to low economic status and child hunger in their schools.</p>

<title>Case Narrative</title>
<p>This case came to fruition through research for a book titled <italic>Ordinary People Extraordinary Planet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555458913487035">Hipsky, 2011</xref>), in which people who have conquered obstacles and risen above to help and inspire others are profiled. Mary K. Hoodhood’s organization, the Kids’ Food Basket, is a positive example of community partnerships to help bridge the nutrition gap that exists in lower socioeconomic districts such as the Grand Rapids Public Schools.</p>
<sec id="section2-1555458913487035">
<title>Grand Rapids/Kent County Area</title>
<p>Between 2000 and 2006, children from elementary to high school ages who were living in low-socioeconomic homes increased from 9% to 16% in Kent County. At the time of this case study, 30,000 Kent County children lived in poverty. The closing of the large GM Manufacturing Plants in the Grand Rapids area took a negative hit to the local economy. Michigan was among the most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs in the nation, losing more than 218,000 manufacturing jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555458913487035">Friedhoff &amp; Wial, 2006</xref>). From 2000 to 2008, Grand Rapids had the largest spike (8.9%) in poverty among any city in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555458913487035">Kid’s Food Basket, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1555458913487035">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555458913487035">National Center for Educational Statistics (2009)</xref>, the Grand Rapids Public Schools District includes 80 schools with 1,307 teachers. The district has 19,815 students. There are 3,851 students with English Language Learning (ELL) and 4,300 students with Individualized Education Plans. Of the students in the Grand Rapids School District, 19% are Hispanic/Latino and 81% non-Hispanic/Latino (including White alone 53% and Black/African American alone 28% with smaller percentages in the areas of American Indian, Asian, Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander). The Grand Rapids Public Schools’ website reported that the student population represents nearly 70 countries with 49 different languages spoken.</p>

<title>The Kid’s Food Basket</title>
<p>The Kid’s Food Basket began in the winter of 2001 when MaryAnn Prisichenko, a principal in Grand Rapids, noticed children searching through trash cans. When they were questioned, they said that they were “looking for food.” When this concerned school leader inquired of her colleagues whether they had similar experiences, it became apparent that many kids were self-reporting that they are not eating at home. There simply was not enough money for the families to provide nutritious meals for their children daily.</p>
<p>When children have “food insecurities,” they are not sure that they are getting their next meal because their family is experiencing material hardships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555458913487035">Sherman, 2004</xref>). Research has shown that there are developmental consequences that include not only physical and nutritional concerns but social, behavioral (because it is anxiety producing and a stressor), and academic skills can be negatively affected as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555458913487035">Jyoti, Frogillio, &amp; Jones, 2005</xref>). Nationally, students are struggling with being food insecure. An anonymous author from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555458913487035">American Federation of Teachers (2010)</xref> reported that
<disp-quote>
<p>the problem has worsened, teachers say, describing symptoms of chronic hunger including headaches, stomachaches, lethargy and poor concentration. Nearly two-thirds of teachers surveyed say they spend their own money to buy food for students who often are thinking less about the day’s lesson and more about where they will get their next meal. (p.19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Something needed to be done in the Grand Rapids School District to fill this hunger void so that students could learn. Mary K. Hoodhood, a volunteer for Meals on Wheels, heard from school officials about the needs of the students and knew that she had to take action. Mary founded the Kids’ Food Basket and utilized her abilities to organize volunteers and set plans in motion so that the students in the Grand Rapids School District could have sack suppers to take home. The astounding fact about Mary K. Hoodhood (who received the Presidential Citizen’s Medal) is that she is a quadriplegic.</p>
<p>Honing on her ability to serve others rather than focusing on what she cannot do, Mary K. rallied the community. Brown bags, each containing a meat and cheese sandwich, fruit, a granola bar, and a juice box, were prepared and distributed. Initially, the group delivered 125 sack suppers to the elementary school where MaryAnn Prisichenko saw the children searching through the garbage cans for food. Now, the nonprofit organization is a finely tuned operation that feeds kids every weekday.</p>
<p>The 27 schools that the Kids’ Food Basket serves have a student population in which 80% or more of students live at or below the poverty line. Over a dozen schools are on the waiting list to obtain these services to fill the hunger needs of their students.</p>
<p>Every weekday, a total of 3,249 dinners packed at the Kid’s Food Basket feed the hungry children of Grand Rapids. That equates to more than 50,000 juice boxes and thousands of pounds of food that must be donated, prepared, packed, and delivered daily. In the 2010-2011 school year, there were more than 550,000 “sack suppers” served by Kids’ Food Basket. Multiple fundraisers such as Feast for the Kids (which raised US$46,000 in one evening) take place throughout the year, there are multiple corporate sponsors, and many organizations have collection drives so that the Kid’s Food Basket can have the food to distribute to the students.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine schools are served the sack dinners by 150 volunteers who range in age from 5-year-olds to 95-year-olds. They have an extremely large food warehouse that stores the donated food, the volunteers put together the sacks in assembly line-style, and adult volunteers deliver the supper sacks to the schools. Over one fourth of the volunteers are under the age of 18. Many of the younger volunteers understand that they are packing dinners for themselves or their classmates. This is an empowering process.</p>
<p>This initiative reflects a Freirean view of leadership. The needs of the community emerged and were heard and attention was paid. The Kids’ Food Basket meets the people where they are and the community is engaged and empowered to serve. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555458913487035">Freire (2009)</xref> stated, “Authentic education is not carried on by ‘A’ <italic>for</italic> ‘B’ or by ‘A’ <italic>about</italic> ‘B,’ but rather by ‘A’ <italic>with</italic> ‘B,’ . . . ” (p. 93).</p>

<title>Academic Developments</title>
<p>To provide insights into their recent academic growth, one can look at the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and other assessments. The No Child Left Behind mandates that all public school districts need to determine the AYP. The Grand Rapids Public Schools Elementary (3-5) met AYP in areas of math and reading; the Middle (6-8) met AYP in the areas of math and reading; however, the High School (11) did not meet AYP in math and reading. If a district makes AYP (in mathematics and reading in two of the three grade levels [elementary, middle, or high school]), they have AYP district status. Therefore, AYP was met in the Grand Rapids Public School District (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555458913487035">Michigan Department of Education, 2011</xref>). This is an improvement since 2006 and other gains are being reported as well such as
<disp-quote>
<p>Over that same period of time, the number of schools earning a “B” grade or better on the <italic>Michigan Education Yes! Report</italic> has nearly quadrupled from 7 to 27. Also, over this same period of time, GRPS saw MEAP scores increase in nearly every subject level and grade level for five consecutive years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555458913487035">Grand Rapids Public Schools, 2011</xref>, para.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is support for the positive impact of family and school collaborations on student achievement. Positive authentic family involvement within a school collaboration can be more of a predictor of grades than test scores for children of all racial ethnic and income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555458913487035">Desimone, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555458913487035">Henderson and Mapp (2002)</xref> stated, “When schools build partnerships with families that respond to their concerns and honor their contributions, they are successful in sustaining connections that are aimed at improving student achievement” (p. 7).</p>
<p>While it would be difficult to quantify the gains made in the schools based on feeding so many of the hungry children, the words of the children speak to their appreciation for Kids’ Food Basket as seen in the following letter written by an elementary school student who receives the sack suppers:<disp-quote>
<p>Dear Kids’ Food Basket,</p>
<p>Thank you! You feed my friends! You are nice! The zesty juice boxes are great! I love apples. I love pickles too! I see you people love us and care.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Halley</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other school districts could learn from this successful nonprofit charity to make positive impacts in the lives of children who are food insecure.</p>

<title>Schools, Communities, and Families</title>
<p>This case will be used in a course that will provide students with an opportunity to explore the complex interrelationships among communities, schools, and families. This course will include a service learning component. Educational leaders need to acknowledge the numerous influences on children’s lives and how the structures of home and community affect children’s learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>One of these influences is poverty. Children comprise 24% of the total population; however, they represent 34% of people who live in poverty. For children under the age of 18, 44% are living in low-income families and 21% are living in poor families. This percentage has been on the rise since 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555458913487035">Addy &amp; Wight, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There are risk factors, including emotional/social challenges, health and safety concerns, chronic and acute stressors, and cognitive lags, that affect children who live in poverty. Together, these factors pose substantial challenges to academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555458913487035">Jensen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While a substantial amount of educational research focuses on how to improve pedagogy and curricula, effective educators must recognize the critical importance of involving families and communities as equal partners with schools in the educational process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555458913487035">Meier and Wood (2004)</xref> noted “meaningful assessment and diagnosis in education depend on parents and professionals having time to examine an array of interesting data. School boards need to be engaged in helping the community gather and then understand the data” (p. 78).</p>

<sec id="section8-1555458913487035">
<title>Student Assignment</title>
<p>Put yourself in the role of a district administrator. (You may select a specific existing district or use a fictional one.) You are assigned the task of establishing three formal partnerships with organizations/businesses in the community within a year. Describe in detail (a) What types of partnerships you would identify as most valuable, (b) what specific organizations you would approach with your proposals, (c) what strategies you would use to entice them to participate, and (d) how you would present this information to the school board? What are the benefits for both the organization and the district? What are the costs for both the organization and the district? What are some of the other needs? List and discuss solutions that empower the people. What long-term engagements and partnerships can you envision that include the community addressing the needs that are expressed by the members of the community?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1555458913487035">
<title>Service Learning</title>
<p>The first step in the service learning process will be to talk with the local high school students to identify and assess the needs of the community (investigation stage). Then, the doctoral students will collaborate with the high school students to identify strategies that will meet the needs in the community (planning and preparation stage). Additional community, school, and family partners will be asked to serve alongside the university and high school students in the identified endeavors (action stage).</p>
<p>Journal reflections and relevant readings will be required of the doctoral students (reflection stage). The works of Paolo Freire will comprise a portion of the readings. Journal prompts will include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1555458913487035" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What have you learned about the importance of having the community identify their own needs? List your three most significant areas of learning and discuss them in detail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are your thoughts and beliefs now concerning working with community members to address their identified needs? How does this compare to your thoughts and beliefs before you engaged in this service learning experience?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the most significant learning that you have gained from this service learning experience? How will this impact your actions in the future?</p></list-item></list>
<p>A celebration of learning will be held to assess what has been learned and what may have changed since the collaboration began (demonstration and celebration stage). During this time, there should also be a discussion focused on how best to use this newly learned information to continue with the project. This celebration will be designed and attended by all members of the collaborative community (university, high school, local community, family) who engaged in the project.</p>
