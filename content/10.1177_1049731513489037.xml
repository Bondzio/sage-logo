<p>Brij Mohan’s new book is a unique and thought-provoking account of several philosophical concepts in relation to the nexus of <italic>human</italic> society and <italic>social</italic> justice. By implication, the purpose of the book is to promote the synthesis of knowledge and practice in social sciences, particularly social work. The book under review is an exceptional contribution to both humanities and social sciences. In the current social work literature, it stands out as a seminal critique of the “human condition” and the evolution of a profession that continues to be in search of its soul. It raises a fundamental question: “Is it a false dawn?”</p>
<p>The opening chapter of this book revisits historical moments and social movements to delineate the key concepts, which are the founding pillars of social welfare, policy, and research underlying social justice. The examples of oppressed groups in society and corresponding ideologies and practices are explored in the chapters that follow. Once you open the book, it is hard to resist reaching its end. And, that is a rare attribute.</p>
<p>A succinctly brilliant foreword by Professor Mark Hyde followed by author’s preface, prologue, and bibliography contextualize the substance and ethos of varied interrelated constructs that constitute the heart and soul of this formidable “omnibus.”</p>
<p>Chapter 2 proffers a glimpse into an amazing odyssey that brings out the evolution of a social work mind whose varied contributions stand out as a metaphor for social transformation, a theme that reverberates throughout his journey. Myriad of illustrations and models represent new directions for a globally emerging new social work that seems to have gone astray. He concludes: “Pragmatic expedience and wallmartization of knowledge and diplomas have thwarted the growth of fundamental principles of our calling” (p. 20).</p>
<p>In light of the enlightenment spirit, the author explains the concept and process of social intervention and its differential manifestations. In Chapter 3, with emphasizes on unification, he minces no words to remind us that the “goal of social work is the end of itself” (p. 22).</p>
<p>The author’s expertise on International Social Work comes alive in the fourth chapter, where the rebel seeking a revolution in neocolonial social work practice becomes an advocate for radical change. Questioning the top-down approach toward development of the third world, the author focuses on the concept of “universal family,” which is seemingly lost from the dictionary of current social work, theory, policy, and practice. He deconstructs International Social Work and offers a theory of new social development, which calls for new internationalism toward an “international society”—a <italic>counter-factual idealist fantasy</italic> (in his own words).</p>
<p>In the last chapter, Brij Mohan speaks aloud as a philosopher of science. It is both instructive and imperative to students, educators, research scholars, and practitioners of humanities and sciences to understand the complex nature and dimensions of “human-social” problems. “<bold>
<italic>Man remains incomplete and lonely in a crowded world of seven billion social animals</italic>
</bold>” (Emphasis original, p. 58). This assertion sums it up: “It’s not the culture of poverty, it’s the poverty of culture that breeds the most dangerous twins, ignorance and arrogance” (p. 59). Seriously analyzed, understood, and imparted, this hypothesis can fundamentally transform the structure of current research on social work practice.</p>
<p>The book weaves around a framework of several aspects, issues, and constructs that will go a long way to advance the development of social work theory, practice, and research in the 21st century. For the new generation of social work scholars, the concluding section of the book “Questions for Brij Mohan” will serve as a special treat. The postscript and afterword will further remind us how difficult, albeit important, it is to synthesize the essence of Darwin, Freud, Marx, and Gandhi in an otherwise civilized new world.</p>
<p>This book offers an intersection of universal philosophical concepts across social sciences that are founded on the guiding principle of universal human well-being. I strongly recommend this book for its richness of contents, boldness of criticism, and a new style of literary genre that makes it an intellectually challenging read for all social scientists.</p>
<p>A Magnum Opus of this quality, especially when self-published, is noteworthy for its limitations. Even though three coprofessionals assisted the author, not all that should have been included could be accommodated within 100 pages. An Index would have been an added asset to this volume. Still, the book stands out as a unique contribution in a discipline where high priced, glossy textbook publication has become a lucrative business.</p>
