<p>Treatment of ovarian granulosa cells and follicles with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor results in biphasic effects where nanomolar rapamycin (RAP) results in reduced proliferation, mitotic anomalies, and attenuated follicle growth, while the picomolar RAP results in accelerated follicle growth. Here, we tested whether such effects are specific to RAP or could be mimicked by 2 alternative mTOR inhibitors, everolimus (EV) and temsirolimus (TEM), and whether these effects were dependent on the presence of estradiol (E2). Spontaneously immortalized rat granulosa cells (SIGCs) were cultured in dose curves of RAP, EV, TEM, or vehicle with or without E2. Proliferation and phosphorylation of mTOR targets p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein (BP) were determined. Cell cycle gene array analysis and confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed upon cells treated with picomolar RAP versus controls. Nanomolar RAP, EV, and TEM reduced SIGC proliferation and decreased phospho-p70 and 4E-BP. Picomolar concentrations accelerated proliferation without affecting mTOR substrate phosphorylation. Acceleration of growth by picomolar inhibitor required E2. Picomolar drug treatment altered the transcription of cell cycle regulators, increasing Integrin beta 1 and calcineurin expression, and decreasing inhibin alpha, Chek1, p16ARF, p27/Kip1, and Sestrin2 expression. At nanomolar concentrations, mTOR inhibitors attenuated granulosa proliferation. Accelerated growth and alterations in cell cycle gene transcription found with picomolar concentrations required E2 within the intrafollicular concentration range. The low concentrations of inhibitors required to increase granulosa proliferation suggest a novel use to support the growth of ovarian follicles.</p>

<title>Mammalian TOR Inhibition, Granulosa Proliferation, and Fertility</title>
<p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that coordinates stress responses downstream of nutrional and environmental signals. The mTOR acts within the Phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/Akt)-signaling network to integrate these signals. During periods of compromised nutrition or stress, or if specific macrolide inhibitors like rapamycin (henceforth RAP, also known as sirolimus)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424447">1</xref>
</sup> are applied, mTOR activity is decreased, leading to pleiotropic downstream effects including reduced cell proliferation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424447">2</xref>
</sup> and tissue growth<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111424447">3</xref>
</sup>; and in T-cells, immunosuppression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111424447">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ovarian follicles consist of an oocyte and the intimately associated surrounding somatic cells including granulosa cells. Maturation of this unit (see Refs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424447">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111424447">6</xref>
</sup> for reviews) occurs when a small immature stage, the primordial follicle, enters a period of growth consisting of increased oocyte volume but mainly granulosa cell proliferation. Granulosa cells proliferate until the follicle either reaches a large, multilaminar preovulatory state, or dies via a regulated apoptotic process termed follicle atresia. Fully mature ovulatory follicles contain perhaps tens of thousands of granulosa cells that support the production of a mature, fertilization competent egg.</p>
<p>We and others have shown that RAP treatment of primary mouse granulosa cells and follicles results in altered granulosa proliferation. Alam et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424447">7</xref>
</sup> first showed that mTOR phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) occurs in primary rat granulosa cells in a manner that can be blocked by RAP. Kayampilly and Menon<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111424447">8</xref>
</sup> showed that the key follicle mitogen follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) upregulates mTOR signaling in a manner that correlates with increased tuberin phosphorylation and that involves extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling.</p>
<p> Consistent with reports showing that mTOR is involved in cell cycle progression at the G1 stage of the cell cycle,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111424447">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111424447">10</xref>
</sup> RAP treatment between 0.1 and 1000 nmol/L RAP resulted in increased numbers of granulosa cells in G1 stage of the cell cycle. No concentration of RAP was found to induce cell death by apoptosis, necrosis, or otherwise. Having detected direct effects upon granulosa mitotic machinery during M-phase,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424447">11</xref>
</sup> further analysis has revealed the induction of lesions termed anaphase bridges.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111424447">12</xref>
</sup> Treatment of the convenient spontaneously immortalized rat granulosa cell line (SIGC)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111424447">13</xref>
</sup> resulted in the same effects upon proliferation seen in primary mouse cells.</p>
<p>Rapamycin treatment of ovarian follicles cultured in vitro resulted in dose-dependent slowing of growth when follicles were treated with 1 nmol/L and greater concentrations of RAP.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424447">11</xref>
</sup> Anaphase bridges were found to be induced by RAP in mouse follicles grown in vitro and in vivo when animals were injected with the drug.<sup>11</sup> Quite strikingly, very low concentrations of RAP, from 0.01 to 1 pmol/L, were instead found to accelerate granulosa cell proliferation and significantly increase follicle growth,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424447">11</xref>
</sup> with no apparent deleterious effects upon follicle or oocyte quality. Here, we provide more information as to the molecular consequences of picomolar mTOR inhibitor treatment that correlate with this acceleration. The demand for new interventions to support ovarian function and fertility, and the promise of the in vitro culture of ovarian follicles as a clinical fertility preservation tool will require novel strategies to regulate the desired production of healthy eggs.</p>

<title>Consequences of mTOR Inhibition</title>
<p>Rapamycin blocks mTOR activity by binding to an intracellular receptor, FKBP12. The FKBP12-RAP complex then interacts with and inhibits the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424447">2</xref>
</sup> Inhibitory effects on mTORC2 have also been uncovered.<sup>

</sup> Rapamycin prevents mTORC1 phosphorylation of p70S6K and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP). Mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation of p70S6K is well known to support cell cycle progression by regulating protein synthesis. The loss of mTOR phosphorylation of 4E-BP results in 4E-BP binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424447">18</xref>
</sup> resulting in a general inhibition of translation. The net result of mTOR inhibition upon these proteins is the inhibition of translation of mTOR-responsive gene products associated with active metabolism and available nutrients,<sup>

</sup> As we look toward the clinical use of mTOR inhibitors to regulate fertility, orally bioavailable drugs would be an attractive option. The effects of 2 of these compounds, everolimus (EV) and temsirolimus (TEM), upon granulosa proliferation were evaluated in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719111424447">
<title>Everolimus and Temsirolimus</title>
<p>Everolimus (also referred to as SDZ-RAD and RAD001) and TEM (also CCI-779) were developed with the goal of increasing the oral availability of the parent RAP compound (see Ref <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424447">21</xref>
</sup> for a review). Due to their added side chains, EV (42-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin) and TEM (rapamycin 42-[3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropanoate) have greater polarity than RAP, but maintain their specificity for mTOR. While TEM has approximately the same activity/IC50 as RAP, EV has lower activity than RAP, including lower immunosuppressive activity in vitro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111424447">22</xref>
</sup> and in vivo. Each of these drugs is being used in clinical treatments and clinical trials, most often as an adjuvant therapy to a cytotoxic drug targeting malignancies. Temsirolimus in particular has shown promising results in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424447">23</xref>
</sup> (see Ref 24 for a review). As patient dosing regimens and the metabolism<sup>

</sup> of these drugs are well understood, their consideration as agents to regulate the development of ovarian follicles is reasonable, especially (in the short term) in in vitro follicle culture systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111424447">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111424447">26</xref>
</sup> Our preliminary results show that very low (picomolar) but constant concentrations of RAP are required to accelerate follicle growth and that they do with no apparent deleterious effect upon oocyte quality means that very low doses would be applied to patients, far below the doses required to combat malignancies and that are known to cause side effects.</p>

<title>Integration of Physiological Ovarian Follicle Growth Regulators by mTOR</title>

</sup> Oocyte-derived growth factors of the tumor growth factor β superfamily (in particular, growth differentiation factor 9 and bone morphogenetic protein 15) are required for the early rounds and continued granulosa cell proliferation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424447">5</xref>
</sup> Follicle development is also controlled via global systemic (eg, endocrine) factors primarily derived from the hypothalamus (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) and pituitary (FSH and luteinizing hormone),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111424447">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111424447">31</xref>
</sup> subject to feedback involving estradiol (E2) production by granulosa cells and E2-responsive signaling. It is important to note that since granulosa cells produce nearly all circulating E2, local levels found within the follicle are necessarily much higher than in the peripheral circulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111424447">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Exactly how granulosa cells integrate these signals in order to properly execute follicle growth is unclear. Our data support mTOR as an integrator of follicle growth signals, especially as relates to granulosa cell proliferation. Here, we are asking whether the 2 structurally related mTOR inhibitors, EV and TEM, result in the same effects on granulosa growth as RAP in vitro, and whether E2 impacts the effects of mTOR inhibition at low (growth accelerating) and high (growth inhibitory) levels. Of particular interest is whether these other mTOR inhibitors also result in the induction of anaphase bridges in granulosa cells as found with RAP at high (nanomolar) concentrations.</p>

Cell number was assessed indirectly by the CellTiter96 assay (Promega) 18 and 48 hours after the addition of ethanol vehicle, RAP, EV, or TEM (each from LC Laboratories).

First, 5000 cells were grown in wells of a 12-well plate as mentioned above, with ethanol vehicle or the specified concentration of drug and/or E2 in triplicate. At the end of the culture periods, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 100 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% trypan blue (EMD Chemicals); the number of viable cells was determined using a hemocytometer by counting those cells that excluded trypan blue. Successive measurements were made using the CellTiter assay and data were plotted where cell number in vehicle-treated samples was set to 100% at each time point. Two-way analysis of variance of data from viability experiments was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 statistical analysis software (GraphPad Software, Inc).</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>For analysis of intracellular proteins, cells were lysed using 1% Tergitol-type NP-40 (NP-40) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the presence of protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were calculated by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois). Proteins were then diluted with gel loading buffer to 20 g and boiled for 5 minutes. Proteins were resolved under reducing conditions on either 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (NEN Life Sciences, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 hour, with 5% powdered milk in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Primary antibodies used were anti-phospho-Thr389 p70S66 kinase (Sigma, #S6311, St. Louis, MO) and anti-phospho Thr 37/46 4E-BP (Cell Signaling Technology, #2855, Danvers, MA), or anti-rat alpha inhibin (Salk Institute, Peptide Biology Laboratories, La Jolla, CA), each diluted 1:10 000 in PBS-T/1% powdered milk. After 3 washes for 10 minutes, each with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody. After this incubation, membranes were washed 3 times as before and then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) in PBS-T/1% milk. After 3 washes for 10 minutes each with PBS-T and 3 washes for 10 minutes each with distilled water, the peroxidase-conjugated antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Sciences). β-actin was used as internal control, in addition to Ponceau Red, to validate the transfer quality and the amount of protein loaded onto the gels.</p>

<p>First, we sought to compare and contrast the effects of EV and TEM upon rat SIGCs with those found during preliminary experiments using RAP.

The effects of EV and TEM were consistent with those found for RAP treatment when applied at 10 nmol/L. All 3 drugs resulted in the acceleration of proliferation (significantly increased cell number vs controls) when applied at 0.01 pmol/L, with TEM demonstrating the greatest increase in cell number at 18 and 48 hours.</p>

<p>We went on to ask whether E2 is required for the effects of mTOR inhibition by removing the hormone from otherwise identical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111424447">Figure 1D</xref>-F). When E2 was not supplemented, there was no significant difference between cells treated with high (10 nmol/L) RAP, EV, or TEM and matching E2-treated cultures. However, a striking loss of the ability of all 3 mTOR inhibitors to induce increased granulosa proliferation at 48 hours versus controls was found. Here, no significant difference was found between the proliferation of vehicle-treated samples and cells treated with picomolar inhibitors, unlike the situation found in the presence of intrafollicular levels of E2.</p>
<p>In order to confirm that the acceleration of proliferation was dependent upon E2 signaling via its receptors, we went on to determine the effects of including the E2-receptor antagonist ICI 182780. In control cultures where E2 was present and 0.1 pmol/L RAP, EV, or TEM were added (representative data for EV shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424447">Figure 2</xref>), acceleration of proliferation versus vehicle was again detected at 48 hours (-E2Rant). Inclusion of 100 nmol/L ICI 182780 prevented this result, and no significant difference versus vehicle was seen even in the presence of low-concentration mTOR inhibitors. Inclusion of ICI 182780 alone (VEH, +E2Rant) did not result in significantly altered proliferation. These results supported a situation where the acceleration of granulosa cells proliferation with picomolar mTOR inhibitors was dependent upon active E2 signaling through its receptors.</p>

<title>Levels of Phosphorylation of Common mTOR Substrates are Unaltered When SIGC are Treated With Picomolar RAP</title>
<p>The consistent increase in cell proliferation when cells were treated with low concentrations of mTOR inhibitors caused us to ask whether the effects were dependent upon altered mTOR phosphorylation of its downstream targets. We hypothesized that while cell cycle inhibitory nanomolar mTOR inhibitors would reduce phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP, that instead, picomolar levels might increase activity of mTOR, increasing phosphorylation of those targets. To test this, we grew cells in each condition (in cultures containing E2 with vehicle or mTOR inhibitors as specified) and collected protein for Western blotting of these phosphoproteins. In each case, we determined the cell number in each treatment group and confirmed whether the cell number was increased or decreased versus vehicle in samples where protein lysates were prepared. We found that while inhibition of growth was indeed accompanied by significantly decreased phosphorylation of the 2 mTOR substrates tested, no significant difference in the phosphorylation of p70S6K or 4E-BP was found that correlated with growth acceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424447">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Altered Transcription of Cell Cycle Regulatory Genes in Response to Treatment With Picomolar RAP</title>
<p>As the treatment with picomolar levels of mTOR inhibitors did not detectably alter the phosphorylation of 2 of the most well-recognized mTOR substrates, we approached the question of an accelerated cell cycle by performing a RT-PCR-based screen of cell cycle regulators. This “PCR array” approach quantitatively measured the levels of transcription of 84 cell cycle regulators simultaneously. Genes are included in this screen that positively or negatively regulate cell cycle progression. We tested 3 pools of cells, which were treated with vehicle or 0.1 pmol/L RAP. We found that the expression of 9 genes demonstrated greater than 3-fold differences in expression versus controls when treated with picomolar RAP.</p>
<p>We went on to repeat the quantitative PCR measurements singly using new cDNA replicates. Here, cDNA samples from cells treated with 0.1 pmol/L RAP in combination with the E2-receptor antagonist were also analyzed. Strikingly, 7 of 9 genes maintained their approximate fold change in expression. In each case, cotreatment with the E2-receptor antagonist prevented the altered expression, returning measured levels to approximately baseline (no significant difference with vehicle alone). Even more strikingly, each of the genes shown to be downregulated (<italic>Chek1</italic>, <italic>Cyclin dependent kinases 1b/Cdkn1b/p27/Kip1</italic> and <italic>2a/Cdkn2a</italic>, and <italic>Inhibin alpha/Inha</italic>) was associated with negative regulation of the cell cycle, while the 3 genes shown to be upregulated (<italic>Intgb1</italic>, <italic>Ppp3ca/calcineurin</italic>, and <italic>Sestrin2</italic>) were associated with positive regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424447">Figure 4A</xref>). Western blotting of SIGC lysates for inhibin alpha confirmed that the downregulation in transcription resulted in a corresponding decrease in protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424447">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the acceleration of SIGC proliferation by picomolar mTOR inhibitors is associated with targeted alterations in the transcription of positive (upregulated) and negative (downregulated) cell cycle regulatory genes, and this effect is dependent upon active E2 signaling. Future experiments will seek to determine the causality of these alterations in gene expression in effects upon cell cycle length.</p>

<p>Significant changes in cell cycle regulatory genes result from treatment of spontaneously immortalized rat granulosa cell (SIGC) with picomolar mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. After an initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screen of 84 genes, 9 genes were identified with a greater than 3-fold change in expression when cells were treated with 0.1 pmol/L rapamycin. As shown in A, confirmatory quantitative PCR revealed that 7 of these genes demonstrated significantly altered gene expression versus vehicle, and in each case, cotreatment with the estradiol receptor antagonist (+E2R ANT) returned gene expression nearer the levels seen with vehicle. A Western blot for alpha-inhibin (B) showed that protein levels of the immature subunit (26 kDa) and the mature protein (62 kDa) were vastly lower in samples treated with 0.1 pmol/L rapamycin versus vehicle controls. Three unique replicates are shown per treatment with the corresponding β-actin loading controls below.</p>

<title>Development of Anaphase Bridges in Response to Treatment With EV and TEM</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, the agents EV and TEM were shown to regulate the rate of proliferation of rat SIGC and to induce mitotic abnormalities, each in a dose-dependent fashion, as seen previously with RAP.<sup>11</sup> Also like RAP, these other agents increased proliferation when applied at picomolar concentrations. This is consistent with the findings that mouse,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424447">11</xref>
</sup> bovine, and human (cultured per,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111424447">35</xref>
</sup> J. Johnson and E. Telfer, unpublished data) ovarian follicles grow faster (and larger) when low concentrations of RAP are applied.</p>
<p>Other groups have reported cross talk interactions between mTOR signaling and E2 signaling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111424447">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111424447"/>

</sup> Two themes stand out in this literature. First and most straightforward is the idea that E2 support of the proliferation and survival of estrogen-responsive reproductive tract cells and cell lines (uterine and ovarian cell lines) acts upstream of mTOR signaling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719111424447">39</xref>
</sup> This is congruent with the findings that mTOR inhibitors inhibit the proliferation of estrogen-receptor-positive (breast) cancer cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111424447">37</xref>
</sup> and with the striking outcome that inhibits both E2 and mTOR signaling, which simultaneously favors apoptotic cell death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111424447">36</xref>
</sup> Second, and less well understood is an adaptive situation, where low E2 results in the upregulation of mTOR (and other growth factor pathway) signaling,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111424447">38</xref>
</sup> compensating for the loss of E2 support. Our data also link the action of E2 with mTOR and provide more information about how low-dose (picomolar) mTOR inhibition results in the acceleration of ovarian follicle growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424447">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Low-dose mTOR inhibitors did not affect mTOR activity as measured by phosphorylation of the substrates p70S6K and 4E-BP. Instead, the acceleration of proliferation seen is due at least in part to effects of growth factors and cell cycle regulators on transcription (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424447">Figure 4</xref>) when low concentrations of mTOR inhibitors are present. It is striking that the cell cycle regulatory genes and growth factors that demonstrated significant alterations in transcription correlated (whether up- or downregulated) with the acceleration found with picomolar RAP. The downregulation of alpha-inhibin was confirmed at the level of protein expression as well. This transcriptional regulation after mTOR inhibitor treatment is distinct from the primarily translation control-dependent effects that have been reported to date.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424447">18</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>We have also shown here that anaphase bridges are induced by nanomolar concentrations of EV and TEM, in accordance with the mitotic anomalies previously seen with RAP treatment.<sup>11</sup> Anaphase bridges result from incomplete chromosome disjunction during mitosis, an outcome that has been shown to correlate with the onset of chromosomal aneuploidy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111424447">12</xref>
</sup> Anaphase bridges have been shown to arise from a lack of proper telomere maintenance<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719111424447">40</xref>
</sup> and/or from aberrant topoisomerase<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719111424447">41</xref>
</sup> or helicase<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719111424447">42</xref>
</sup> function. Further study is also required to determine the mechanism by which mTOR inhibition results in this specific type of mitotic anomaly. However they arise, their induction is likely to be contributing to the the negative effects on cell proliferation found with higher concentrations of mTOR inhibitors.</p>
<p>The overall effects of modulating mTOR upon follicle development are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719111424447">Figure 6</xref>. Here, the concentration of mTOR inhibitors applied is plotted against mTOR activity (red) and granulosa cell proliferation in the presence (black dashed line) or absence (black solid line) of E2. Follicle development is compromised at levels near 0.1 nmol/L drug due to G1 cell cycle arrest and induced mitotic anomalies. In contrast, follicle development is accelerated in the picomolar dose range of the mTOR inhibitors tested due to the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle factors. The mTOR inhibitors are thus supported as novel pharmacological tools to control the growth rate of ovarian follicles.</p>
