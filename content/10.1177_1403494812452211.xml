<title>New national agency structure proposed</title>
<p>A national inquiry on the central government’s health care and social services has now released its final report. The mandate for the inquiry was to suggest a long-term, sustainable system for promoting health, reducing ill health and future care needs and bringing about equal health care and social services throughout the country. The inquiry proposes that a collective organizational approach be adopted under a new agency structure, where 10 current government agencies (including the Swedish National Institute of Public Health, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Swedish Institute for Infectious Diseases, among others), a non-profit organization, and a state-owned company are replaced by four new agencies. The four new agencies proposed are:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494812452211" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Knowledge Agency, an operational agency responsible for knowledge support to health care and social services, as well as cooperation with service providers at the regional and local levels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Inspection Agency, an operational agency responsible for permits, licenses to practice, approval of drugs and enhanced supervision above the current agency resources</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Infrastructure Agency, an operational agency responsible for managing and developing IT and communication solutions within the sector</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Agency for Welfare Strategy, a strategic agency responsible for monitoring the overarching development of public health, disability issues, health care and social services and developing strategic policy.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The head offices of the agencies are proposed to be located in the same area to facilitate interaction, although the Inspection Agency, and potentially parts of the Knowledge Agency, would be regionalized according to the country’s regions.</p>
<p>The government is proceeding with a remittance period to obtain comments and suggestions about the inquiry’s proposals, after which a proposition will be prepared for the Parliament.</p>

<title>New government commissions to the Swedish National Institute of Public Health</title>
<p>The institute has received two new government commissions. The first involves increased support for regional actors regarding parental support activities according to the government’s national strategy for improved parental support. The institute will hold a series of regional conferences for decision-makers, civil servants and practitioners in the municipalities, county councils and voluntary organizations, as well as producing a new handbook for local and regional parental support work. Additionally, the commission involves a health economics assessment of the parental support strategy, improved follow-up, and investigating the possibility of implementing educational programmes at a school or university for those working with parental support. The commission will run through 2014.</p>
<p>The second new commission involves a research summary and evaluation of conducted efforts regarding cannabis abuse, as part of the government’s anti-cannabis work within the national alcohol, narcotics, tobacco and doping strategy. The research results and information regarding effective methods to prevent cannabis use will be spread as part of the commission to municipalities, county councils and voluntary organizations. A publication to parents of teenagers will also be produced during 2012 as it has been in previous years. The commission will run through 2015.</p>

<title>Antidepressants and pregnancy</title>
<p>Treatment for depression is necessary for some pregnant women, but is it safe for the foetus? Over 1% of pregnant women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) used medication for depression during pregnancy. A new sub-study shows no increased risk of congenital birth defects, premature birth or low birth weight after antidepressant use.</p>

<title>Vaccination statistics for 2011</title>
<p>Children in Norway are well vaccinated against diseases that are included in the childhood immunisation programme. This is shown by the 2011 figures from the Norwegian Immunisation Register (SYSVAK) at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Compared with 2010 vaccination statistics, there is an increase in vaccine coverage for several of the vaccines.</p>

<title>Relationships important for mental health</title>
<p>What significance do relationships have for the mental health of each partner? Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) suggest that low satisfaction in the relationship is an important risk factor for anxiety and depression in both women and men. The study also suggests that a good relationship acts as a buffer against stress factors such as physical illness, unemployment and low income.</p>
