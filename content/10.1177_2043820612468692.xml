And yet, whilst such analyses have explored the natural and physical sciences as a means of articulating the relationalities and commonalities that span species and kingdoms, an explicit consideration of the aesthetic has been largely absent. To a degree, this is because the aesthetic has been understood as a `humanist remain'. Here, we want to make a stronger claim for the value of the aesthetic as a stepping off point for thinking through post-human geographies. We begin by acknowledging a productive tension within Kantian and post-Kantian accounts of sense-making: that is, a series of questions that speak directly to the post-human have been raised by dwelling upon how the aesthetic can be related to bodily needs and desires, as well as a feeling that emerges from the exercise of judgement. Then, we make the argument that, as a means of developing our aesthetic sensibility, geography can usefully further its engagement with art theory and practice. This leads us to ground our own exploration of the post-human in a discussion of two projects created by artist Perdita Phillips. Moving from a consideration of bowerbirds in the savanna to thrombolites in a saline lake, and from evolutionary biology to a Deleuzo -Guattarian geophilosophy, we ask, where is the artistry?</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aesthetics</kwd><kwd>art</kwd><kwd>biology</kwd><kwd>post-humanism</kwd><kwd>sense-making</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><verse-group><verse-line>Turning and turning in the widening gyre</verse-line><verse-line>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</verse-line><verse-line>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</verse-line><verse-line>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</verse-line><verse-line>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</verse-line><verse-line>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</verse-line><verse-line>The best lack all conviction, while the worst</verse-line><verse-line>Are full of passionate intensity.</verse-line><verse-line>Surely some revelation is at hand;</verse-line><verse-line>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</verse-line><verse-line>The Second Coming!

Yeats, <italic>The Second Coming</italic> (1921)</verse-line></verse-group><sec id="section1-2043820612468692"><title>Introduction</title><p>Yeats’ visionary poem, written in the aftermath of the Great War, evokes images of compounding chaos and revolution as one mode of living, based around science, technology and democracy, gives way to one that has so far remained submerged, alien. His allegorical figures – the bird in flight and the wakening stone – inhabit these differing modes and, for Yeats, meet each other with mutual incomprehensibility. The writer and we as his audience are of the old order; encountering a blank and pitiless visage, we wonder, what rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p><p>In this paper we take on board similar figures – the ‘human bird’ and the ‘living rock’ – in order to talk about change and transformation, in the sense of both increasing uncertainty as to what the world is and the place of such figures within it, but also how to then think about and articulate the modes of relationality that bind and cleave. Where Yeats describes two inhospitable ways of living, each spiralling away from the other, we want to use these figures as ‘signposts’ for an exploration of the fractures and fissions, resonances and divergences, that make up what has been termed the ‘post-human’. The ‘post’ prefix here, as elsewhere, denotes an ontic and epistemic, as well as semantic, uncertainty; most significantly for our purposes, ‘post’ can refer to what Welsch calls a ‘radical break’ with the ‘modern decree that everything is to be understood in departure from the human and by referring it back to the human’ (2004: n.p.) including, we might add, the nature of ‘humanity’ itself.</p><p>Geographers have, of course, considered this same prospect numerous times, gradually moving, we would suggest, from a preoccupation with the shards of analytic categorisation made brittle by the crisis of representation, and a corresponding concern as to what the human as critical inquirer is considered to encompass and be capable of doing, toward a more explicit questioning of how, in the shift in thought that moves from ‘being’ to ‘becoming’, we go forth in the world to think and speak in terms of things and their qualities. And so geography has been witness to a number of attempts to ‘map’ a post-human disciplinary landscape of theoretical allegiances, figurings, concepts, techniques and objects of analysis (Braun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612468692">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2043820612468692">Johnston, 2008</xref>; Panelli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2043820612468692">2010</xref>) as well as the import of these for the traditional repertoire of geography, such as landscape (Whatmore and Hinchliffe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), site (Marston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2043820612468692">2005</xref>), scale (Bingham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468692">2006</xref>) and borders (Sundberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-2043820612468692">2011</xref>). Importantly, there has also emerged an effort to delineate how a geographic sensibility can in turn illuminate and even inflect our framing of the post-human via a dwelling upon the ‘where’ of encounter (Hinchliffe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), for example, as well as the geographies of assemblages (Allen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468692">2011</xref>).</p><p>Yet, amidst this work a critical reflection upon, and deployment of, the aesthetic has been largely absent. To an extent, this is because the aesthetic, whilst emerging in geography as a complex meditation upon the nature of existence within what were wide-ranging humanist debates (see Tuan’s, 1989 review), became decried, along with this ‘paradigm’, as a paean to a narcissistic individualism (e.g. Gregory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820612468692">1981</xref>). Specifically, for many humanistic geographers as well as their critics, the aesthetic became both a personal (sensuous and emotional as well as perceptive and cognitive) experience of landscape (e.g. Edensor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820612468692">2005</xref>), and the set of conventions that shape these experiences (Duncan and Duncan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2043820612468692">2004</xref>). Accordingly, geographic work on landscape has tended to deploy the aesthetic as a being-in-the-world characterised by a ‘dynamic resolution, a co-ordination and a harnessing of the tensions within experience’, a ‘field-event incorporating horizons of feeling, the objects of sense, and the foci of consciousness’ (Foster, citing Dewey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2043820612468692">1998</xref>: 336). Certainly, one of the distinguishing marks brought into play as a means of distancing the more recent ‘more-than-representational’ literature from an earlier humanistic geography has been a rejection of the latter’s emphasis upon the individual human being as sense-making (e.g. Wylie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-2043820612468692">2006</xref>). Notwithstanding the unfortunate simplification of a humanistic geography per se (Pickles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820612468692">1986</xref>), what has aided such a rendering, as we go on to flesh out below, is a broader scale, inter-disciplinary understanding of the aesthetic as derived from a Kantian celebration of human rationality, an understanding that has elided the ‘liveliness’ of the aesthetic within Kant’s philosophies.</p><p>There are a number of ways in which the aesthetic can be enlivened, but in this paper we work from within our own fields of cultural geography and art theory and practice, fields that, as we hope will become clear, share a considerable Kantian legacy. Whilst we make no claim to fully inhabit Kant’s texts, and this is by no means a paper about Kant’s philosophies, this liveliness, we go on to argue, can be usefully acknowledged as geographers proceed to work through – to call into being, one might say – the post-human. Indeed, its analytic value, we suggest, lies not in any sense of resolution as to what sense making is or should be, or what is appropriately human or not, but rather in the invitation to thought. And in a suitably post-Kantian framing, such thought is a thoroughly visceral affair. As Ruddick describes it, thought ‘does not proceed outwards from the <italic>cogito</italic>, nor is it inscribed in transcendent principles: it is a social act, emerging in combination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2043820612468692">2010</xref>: 28). What provokes such a disturbance? For Deleuze, it is the encounter with the monstrous other, an as yet unthought figure – the human bird, the living rock – that heralds unpredictability and change. Such encounters have the potential for the creation of new, unique events and entities, but more often herald the return to relatively redundant orders and practices.</p><p>We begin, then, by acknowledging a productive tension within Kantian and post-Kantian accounts of sense-making: that is, we delineate the broad contours of a debate that takes to task the aesthetic as related to the exercise of human judgement, but also (not necessarily human) corporeal needs and desires. Next, we make the argument that, as a means of developing an aesthetic sensibility, geography can usefully further its engagement with art theory and practice. This leads us to ground our own exploration of the binding and cleaving, inclusions and thresholds proffered by post-humanism in a discussion of two projects created by artist Perdita Phillips. The first project dwells upon a Darwinian framing of bowerbirds as ‘all too human’ in their artistry, whilst the second considers the aesthetic capacities inhering in the lithic, as well as the organic, via a consideration of ‘living rocks’, or thrombolites.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612468692"><title>Kantian aesthetics: between and betwixt</title><p>Without delving too deeply into Kant’s <italic>oeuvre</italic>, it is necessary to provide an initial context here in order to ‘place’ the discussion of aesthetics that follows. That is, in Kant’s work we find a number of iterations of the aesthetic insofar as he is engaged with <italic>both</italic> an ‘empiricist’ tradition, exemplified in the writings of Hume and Burke, for whom aesthetics were expressions of subjective feeling without cognitive content, <italic>and</italic> a ‘rationalist’ tradition, represented by figures such as Baumgarten, for whom aesthetics were based on the cognitive assessment of an object to have a particular property, thus making ‘universal’ claims concerning the nature of those objects possible. In post-Kantian aesthetic critiques, we can discern the same preoccupation with this tension, often expressed in the drawing of a marked distinction between, on the one hand, an aesthetics that is rooted in a sensuous, bodily nature, and which has become associated with both individuality and uniqueness, and, on the other hand, an aesthetics that offers the opportunity for thinking through how judgement can become a means of introducing new concepts that reference both an ‘external’ nature and an ‘interior’ human nature.</p><p>In Kant’s so-called ‘first critique’, from his <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2043820612468692">1996[1787]</xref>), the aesthetic is a science of all principles of sensuousness. He later describes this in his <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic> (1987[1790]) as a liking that is conditioned pathologically by stimuli and that ‘holds for non-rational animals too’, gratifying bodily needs and desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2043820612468692">Kant, 1987[1790]</xref>: 51, 52). Thus, aesthetics is based on feeling, as opposed to a perception such as the apprehension of the colour of an entity. For Kant, in referring to the domain of sensibility, there is a ‘transcendental aesthetic’ – or a priori forms of sensibility of space and time – that ‘structure’ these sensations of experience, as well as an ‘empirical aesthetic’ that refers to various sensations that populate the sensible, such as the sounds, tastes and smells that we encounter. The <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic> (1987 [1790]) also, however, contains a three-fold aesthetic – of the agreeable, of beauty (or taste), and of the sublime – articulated around the notion of judgement. Here, Kant outlines four ‘moments’ common to the beautiful and the sublime. These are a disinterested pleasure, universal recognition, a purposivelessness and a sense of the pleasure in the object as necessary and exemplary.</p><p>Importantly, in the <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic>, Kant describes a pleasure, felt in beholding the beautiful, that one cannot ascribe to the object in and of itself (see e.g. Section 1). Such pleasure unfolds from an appreciation of how these faculties provide for the conditions of a systematic (and hence universally human) judgement of something as beautiful; it must be stressed, however, that such a ‘law-like’ play is not in and of itself subject to the operation of a particular law or rule. It is with this caveat that the term ‘free’ is applied. The play of the imagination and understanding are also integral to Kantian considerations of the sublime, wherein the human power of reason is experienced as superior – as a super-sensible faculty – to a meaningless nature specifically (see especially Sections 23 and 28). Given the discipline’s traditional focus upon human–environment relationships, it is not surprising to find that it is the sublime, and particularly the dynamic sublime, that has proven particularly appealing to geographers. Here, the formlessness, or boundedlessness, of phenomena such as volcanoes and earthquakes evoke a wonder and awe that, whilst suggesting a physical powerlessness, and proposing the apparent limits of reason, nevertheless, when perceived as such, in turn evidence the superiority of understanding over and against imagination and sensuous experience (Baker and Twidale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468692">1991</xref>).</p><p>This articulation of aesthetics as, on the one hand, related to bodily needs and desires and, on the other, as a feeling that emerges from the exercise of judgement, is to catch Kantian aesthetics, as a number of post-Kantian theorists have noted, between two ‘irreducible domains’ (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>). That is, there is the theory of the sensible, which engages embodied, sensuous experience but is not confined to a human corporeality, and the theory of the beautiful and the sublime, which, in Deleuze’s words, ‘deals with the reality of the real insofar as it is <italic>thought</italic>’ (1994: 68 [emphasis added]) and, in Kantian terms at least, was often understood as the preserve of the human. Certainly, Kant’s legacy has often been summarised as a celebration of human rationality, predicated upon the firm rejection of a nature in and for itself.</p><p>In disciplinary terms, the most direct approach taken to Kant’s thinking remains, as Livingstone and Harrison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468692">1981</xref>) noted over 30 years ago, his work on physical geography (see more recently Elden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468692">2009</xref>; Elden and Mendieta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2043820612468692">2011</xref>). Yet, they go on to argue, there is no doubting a Kantian legacy within humanistic philosophies more broadly. And within some strands of humanistic geography, we can discern a Kantian, epistemic structuring of the world by the human subject. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-2043820612468692">Wright’s (1947)</xref> geosophic idealism, for example, pivots on outside working, structures and orders and the ‘most fascinating <italic>terra incognita</italic> of all … those that lie within the minds and hearts of men’ (1947: 15). In similar vein, Lowenthal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2043820612468692">1961</xref>) expands upon landscape by way of a question over the relation between ‘the world outside and the pictures within our heads’. More specifically, landscape is the joint product of sensory material and structures of consciousness, which ‘actively organize the continued flux of fragmentary impressions and interprets them by its own forms of understanding’ (Livingstone and Harrison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468692">1981</xref>: 366). In recent years, we find a continuation of this human-centred approach to a geographical treatment of the aesthetic, with particular attention to the sublime, in work on the human perception of the forms of animals and vegetables (Davies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820612468692">2010</xref>; Lorimer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2043820612468692">2007</xref>; Roe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2043820612468692">2006</xref>), as well as the politics of shock and awe (Anderson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), rubbish (Crang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820612468692">2010</xref>) and theorisations of politics more generally (Dikeç, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2043820612468692">2012</xref>).</p><p>Small wonder, then, that some, including those inspired by a speculative realism, to use a loose term, have made the argument that, in light of such a legacy, a ‘human–mind–social’ (over and against a ‘non-human–body–nature’) nexus of thought has characterised all manner of debates on the human–environment relationship (Anderson and Harrison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468692">2010</xref>; Hinchliffe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2043820612468692">2005</xref>). And as we note in the following section, that such dichotomous modes of thought have been challenged by the emergence of a post-humanistic geography. What is yet missing from such debates, we want to emphasise, is a more thorough engagement with post-Kantian aesthetics, particularly as manifest through the work of Deleuze, for whom the focus is the productive potential of Kant’s failure to escape epistemological structures that foreground the human.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2043820612468692"><title>Post-human sublimations</title><p>Making space for the invitation to thought proffered by Kantian and post-Kantian aesthetics, we suggest, allows for a rather different line of questioning to emerge around the post-human than has so far been manifest within geography. One particularly visible framing of a post-human research agenda has come from a wide-ranging effort to think how the ‘animal question’ illuminates the manner in which humans have been deemed to ‘exist’ – or, rather, are able to apprehend their own and other’s existence as well as related spatial qualities – rather than simply ‘be’, to use a stark, Heideggerian framing (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468692">Anderson, 2003</xref>, on this divisioning). Heidegger’s animal question, of course, was also a rethinking of Kant: he proceeded to place the worldlessness of stone at one end of a spectrum, and the world-forming nature of humans at the other, with animals somewhere in the middle, each sorted along a plane of equivalence derived from what is considered to be a uniquely human <italic>logos </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2043820612468692">1995</xref>: 274). Within the geographic discipline, it is the organic realm, however, that has garnered attention; utilising perspectives drawn from philosophy and critical theory, as well as a series of psychoanalytic, behavioural and neurobiological literatures, geographers have inquired as to whether or not there is indeed such a sharp disjuncture to be had.</p><p>This has helped foster speculation on how, for example, an emphasis upon the precognitive ‘being in the world’ of humans can be leveraged into a decentring of an enlightenment figuring of the human as master of all he surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468692">Bear and Eden, 2011</xref>; Johnston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2043820612468692">2008</xref>). Though often presented as an effort to think through the intersectionalities of the ‘lifeworlds’ of seemingly autonomous animals – a ‘being with’ that folds in ‘the inanimate, animate, sentient, speaking, thinking’ (Simpson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-2043820612468692">2009</xref>) – such a project has been more usefully specified as a means of interrogating the ‘spacings’ therein, brought to light via tropes such as ‘witnessing’ (Dewsbury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820612468692">2003</xref>), ‘solicitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2043820612468692">McCormack, 2003</xref>) and ‘singularity’ (Harrison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2043820612468692">2011</xref>). What this specification allows for is a further interrogation of what the ‘pre-’ in precognitive implies and disallows in our understanding of sense and sensibility. It has also become manifest in research that explores how the capacity for communication – as in indicative, rather than simply vocal – can itself be dehumanised. There is work, for example, that deploys Latour’s actor–network theory (as well as other bodies of thought) as a means of thinking through how the non-human can ‘speak’ within an environmental politics, such that its ‘excessiveness’ – understood here as the capacity to surprise – in the face of both science and politics is acknowledged (Hinchliffe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2043820612468692">2008</xref>; Hinchliffe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2043820612468692">2005</xref>). And geographers have identified Derrida’s concept of the ‘trace’ as a means of thinking through language as iteration, or the marking of difference, that takes place via, for example, genetic coding and territoriality as well as friendship (Bingham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468692">2006</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, questions have revolved around whether or not certain capacities such as ‘suffering’ (Lorimer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), ‘vulnerability’ (Harrison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2043820612468692">2008</xref>) or, more commonly, ‘creativity’ (Gandy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2043820612468692">2008</xref>) are to be accorded the status of a <italic>fundamental</italic> human/non-human distinction, overshadowing any ‘mere’ physiological or metabolic commonalities, or the transfer of energy and matter between entities. We find some geographers, for example, prompted by Agamben’s discussion of ‘bare life’, raising questions around the status of the ‘essentially’ human power of <italic>poiesis</italic>; that is, the creative act and its pure potentiality (Thrift, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2043820612468692">2004</xref>). By way of contrast, we can also see a number of studies (inspiring but not confined to geographers) that seek to ‘push the envelope’ in this regard, emphasising how, for example, bacteria can be considered ‘inventive’, as Hird puts it, by virtue of their originary role in ‘major forms of metabolism, multicellularity, nanotechnology, metallurgy, sensory and locomotive apparatuses (such as the wheel), reproductive strategies and community organization, light detection, alcohol, gas and mineral conversion, hypersex, and death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2043820612468692">2010</xref>: 36–37). Conversely, Dixon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612468692">2009</xref>) ponders the political efficacy of the ‘semi-living’, in the form of lab-grown, cellular assemblages. Small wonder that some have turned this question around to ask how and with what effect does the presumption of such inalienable differences justify and legitimise as ‘natural’ a calculated, managed approach to the purportedly non-human (Greenhough and Roe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2043820612468692">2010</xref>; Riley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2043820612468692">2010</xref>).</p><p>Some have, however, delved more deeply into the cleaving and binding of the organic and the inorganic as part and parcel of this broader rethinking of the human. Such efforts draw on a number of impulses – not all compatible by any means – including, for example, Serres’ writings on the ‘marking’ of the earth by flood (Clark, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), Meillassoux’s evocation of the ‘great outdoors’ (Saldanha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2043820612468692">2009</xref>), and a Deleuzian take on the molecular (Dewsbury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2043820612468692">2011</xref>). For some, a possible groundwork for this, it seems, is a sense of the evolutionary character of the human, an at once microscopic analytic that binds the animate and the inanimate over geologic, even cosmic, time-scales. Protevi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2043820612468692">2010a</xref>, n.p.), for example, speculates as to the working of a ‘genetic phenomenology’, wherein<disp-quote><p>… we have to show how single-celled organisms generate their own concrete space and time (a biological or metabolic transcendental aesthetic) as well as display ‘sense-making’ … AND how this develops along the evolutionary time scale into the potentials for what will develop along the human developmental time scale, that is, genetic phenomenology as the constitution of corporeal space-time and corporeal know how, from embryo to adult. And then finally we can trace the synchronic transformation of corporeal space-time and categories/ideas into science/human high reason.</p></disp-quote>For others, such a framing yet retains an anthropomorphism, however, insofar as their dwelling upon increased complexification speaks to a vitalism, the analytic co-ordinates of which revolve around some as yet un-acknowledged metaphysical pivot. And so for Woodward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), for example, the capacity to affect and be affected also directs attention beyond agency towards a welter of metabolic processes that undergird what we consider to be ‘life’. Writing on the unicellular bacteria <italic>Volvox</italic>, Woodward notes how these organisms ‘internalise’ their environment, and display a movement, orientation and so on; but, there is no necessary drive towards complexity.</p><p>In similar vein, Clark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820612468692">2011</xref>: 24) ponders what happens, in a post-Kantian world, when biology is removed from its yoking to the evolution of a human expressivity, and instead is allowed to persist otherwise? For such bodies also touch and are touched by an Earth that<disp-quote><p>bears the trace of an ‘infinity’ that is palpably not of this world, one that is extra-terrestrial in a material rather than an ethereal or otherworldly sense: an exorbitance that no form of reciprocity, no contract, no economy on this spherical planet or anywhere else will ever square up (Clark, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612468692">2010</xref>: 8).</p></disp-quote>Such speculation disavows post-humanism as a Latourian redistribution of ‘agency’, resonating instead with Harrison’s (2008) cautious questioning of what is the ‘remainder’ to just such an action-orientated concept, so often ranged alongside the capacities of intentionality, knowing, cognition and so on. To somewhat presumptuously sum up such a disparate body of literature, whilst the objects of analysis that enter our research under the rubric of the ‘post-human’ continues to expand, there is the increasingly careful querying of what the term ‘post’ signifies here, whether as a decentring of the human and/or the tracing of an anthropomorphism. And it is in reference to this body of work, we suggest, that a more explicit engagement with aesthetics can be of value insofar as it enables a thinking through of how and with what import we formulate sense making.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2043820612468692"><title>Post-human aesthetics/aesthetic post-humanisms</title><p>We noted above how Kant’s articulation of the aesthetic as both gratification and judgement has invited a series of interrogations as to the nature, quality and capacities of a putatively human corporeality. Here, we want to reprise some of this work as context – again, partially and with necessary brevity – before drawing out what we see as a productive engagement with the literatures and practices of art and art theory. We suggest this not because of their purported content, but because these are domains that have long struggled with just such a Kantian legacy, and where aesthetics have been ‘framed’ with a close attention to the ‘with-ness’ and the ‘spacings’ that mark the post-human. As such, they prompt us to consider what we understand sense making to be, and what the ‘thresholds’ are to such understandings. They do so, however, not via recourse to the domains of biology, chemistry and physics, or even philosophy, but rather by enrolling these within their own particular terms (and modes) of debate.</p><p>In order to introduce this work, we begin with an outline of how the invitation proffered by Kant’s aesthetics has been responded to within social theory more broadly. We find such a ‘revisiting’, for example, in Merleau-Ponty’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2043820612468692">1962[1945]</xref>) account of bodily intentionality, and particularly his desire to develop a concept of the mind adequate to this. In his early work (e.g. <italic>Phenomenology of Perception</italic>), which has had a significant impact on geographers’ bodily project, to be sure, Merleau-Ponty does not stray far from a Kantian transcendentalism, wherein there is an a priori structuring of a sense of space and time. There is a tendency here, as Harrison notes, ‘to treat sensuality primarily as sensible intuition and in this way regard it in terms of the synthetic work and information yielded to an already constituted and constituting consciousness or will’ (2008: 429). In later work, though, Merleau-Ponty reflects upon his own critiques of Husserl’s lifeworld – wherein consciousness bestows meaning upon ‘experiential essences’, thus reaffirming the presence of a transcendental ego – and by way of a response begins to lay out the <italic>chiasm</italic>. This is an inter-twining, or crossing, that enables what he calls a ‘sensate body’ possessing ‘an art of interrogating the sensible according to its own wishes, an inspired exegesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2043820612468692">1968[1964]</xref>: 135).</p><p>For Whitehead, Kant’s aesthetics are marked, like the rest of his philosophy, by an excessive cognitivism, this despite, he suggests, the generative possibilities that Kant affords to time. In contrast, Whitehead’s philosophy of organisms is, he claims in <italic>Adventures of Ideas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-2043820612468692">1967[1933]</xref>), an inversion of this. If, for Kant, the world emerges from the subject, then, for Whitehead, the subject emerges from the world: there is, thus, no way of knowing the world extra-experientially. As opposed to the subsequent, cognitive organisation of a Kantian ‘rabble of the senses’, aesthetics becomes the mark of ‘our concern for the world, and for entities in the world’ (1967[1933]: 176). We are reminded by Whitehead to engage with ‘feeling our bodies’, as well as ‘feeling with our bodies’. Such a rewiring of Kant’s sensible data into an ‘immanent being’, as opposed to the building blocks for a transcendent, conceptual representation, lays the groundwork for the continuities that Whitehead comes to identify between the two forms of Kant’s aesthetics. That is, for Whitehead, aesthetics become understood as the building of intensity that encompasses, as Shaviro observes, the ‘most rudimentary “pulses of emotion” (like the vibrations of subatomic particles)’. And at the highest end, ‘even God is basically an aesthete’ (2009: 68). Thus, Whitehead’s affect-based account of experience undoes the ontological privilege of ‘being’ human, extending ‘experience’ to encompass all subjects, whether they be ‘a dog, a tree, a mushroom, or a grain of sand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-2043820612468692">Shaviro, 2009</xref>: xii).</p><p>It is, perhaps, in Deleuze’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820612468692">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>) confrontation of an ‘enemy’ that we find the most celebrated reworkings of Kantian aesthetics across both geography and art theory/practice. If the ‘wrenching duality’ of the two ‘irreducible domains’ outlined above are to be reworked, Deleuze argues, then one must find the conditions that allow for both an ‘image of thought’ that rests in a biological cognition – an ‘organic synthesis’ – <italic>and</italic> a reworked ‘logic’ of sensation. Sensation here is neither cerebral nor rational, nor is it harboured in phenomenology’s lived body; rather, it is constituted by the vital powers and forces of rhythm and chaos (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820612468692">2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2043820612468692">Grosz’s, 2008</xref>, appraisal of Deleuze’s work, to which she brings an Irigarayan sensibility). Such a line of thought has much to contribute to geographic debate in particular, we might suggest, in that Kant’s space and time (which, according to Hartshorne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2043820612468692">1939</xref>, mark out the exceptional domains of geography and history, respectively) are here reworked as in dynamic genesis with the organic. But, what this project also provokes is the question of <italic>what</italic> precisely is capable of such a sensibility of sense? In other words, if the aesthetic subject is no longer a human being made exceptional by their ability to make sense of the world around them, and, crucially, to recognise their capacity for so doing, then what, if anything, remains of the human? And what does such a subject now encompass?</p><p>The aesthetic, then, is made to undertake a tremendous amount of work within social theory. And in these theorists’ explorations of sense making the issues raised speak time and again to the post-human. But how can the aesthetic become a more visible pivot for dialogues within human geography? For us, there is a productive engagement to be had with the practices and literatures of art and art theory. Given the place of art theory in the study of humanism, and the long tradition of artistic practices as producing and reproducing ideal forms of animals and of nature, it is unsurprising to find that herein lie fecund sites for post-human imaginings (Badmington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468692">2003</xref>; Haraway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2043820612468692">1991</xref>; Wolfe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-2043820612468692">2009</xref>). Indeed, the welter of artworks and exhibitions produced, and their accompanying theorisations, proffer a diverse body of post-humanisms, fuelled in equal parts by an art world enamoured with the social theory outlined above but also by hyperbolic and apocalyptic narratives of both the ‘perceptually vanishing animal’ and the rise of technology and commercialized science (Lippit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2043820612468692">2000</xref>).</p><p>Such artwork, exhibitions and critique have long been inspired, for example, by the languages and critical practices of deconstruction; that is, a querying of an anthropocentric <italic>logos</italic> via reference to the mark-making, as well as the affective materialities, of animals (Baker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468692">2000</xref>) They are also increasingly shaped by an artistic search for other ‘onto-stories’ of the post-human, whether through the forms of the cyborg (Lyons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2043820612468692">2010</xref>), the hybrid (Langill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2043820612468692">2009</xref>) or the becoming-animal (Thompson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-2043820612468692">2005</xref>). As Livitt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2043820612468692">2007</xref>: 230) notes, where once we may have identified a glib quotation of Deluezo–Guattarian formulations of ‘becoming-animal’, proceeding by way of everything from dance to new media works, there is now a closer examination of the ontological work to be done in the tensions between ‘the desire to animalise and the obligation to preserve’ (Chaudhuri and Enelow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820612468692">2006</xref>: 4).</p><p>Time and again the ‘crux’ of such works ensues from an (often playful) interrogation of scientific theory, method and practice. In particular, we can find the identification and enrolling of a variety of scientific domains – physics, chemistry, biology – within Kantian terms, each framed as a series of <italic>teleological</italic> rather than aesthetic judgements. <italic>Contra</italic> the liking for the beautiful, and the resolution of the sublime, Kant’s teleological judgements borrow their principles from reason, resolving concepts of nature according to their seeming ‘purposiveness’, that is, the rationality, comprehensibility and systematicity of nature. And so entangling the histories of biological science with a reading of the ‘monstrous’ in Kant, Kac and Ronell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2043820612468692">2007</xref>), for example, presents us with a bestiary of ‘extreme life’, the inhabitants of which tell a story of alternative evolutions. Such alternatives have reached their apotheosis, perhaps, in recent developments in art–science practices, wherein, and echoing concerns within speculative realism, artists deploy the apparatus and techniques of physics to challenge the inheritance of human-centred thinking through an engagement with ‘dark materialisms’, probing the annihilation of matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612468692">1</xref></sup></p><p>Though geographers tend to look to the materials and practices of art as a means of grounding dialogues on space, landscape, scale, site and so on, it is important to note that such post-human art projects are very much a negotiation of the ‘with-ness’ and ‘spacings’ of encounters, such that we find, for example, alliances drawn through contact with animals as ‘living flesh’, and ‘embodied beings’, rather than ‘cultural objects’. These include a reprise of Derridian ideas that leverage the ‘look’ of the animal into a rethinking of the human: in the optical and mimetic registers of art, the human ‘I’ is made in an engagement with the ‘eyes’ of the animal ‘other’, such that ‘nakedness and the animal body of the human come to function as a necessary supplement’ to human subjectivity (Broglio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612468692">2008</xref>). Elsewhere, and in a partial critique of such anthropocentric orientations, a body of artwork has developed that owes much to ethnology and particularly the work of Jacob von Uexküll. Here, artists seek to encounter (and to re-present) the subjective lifeworlds of the animals. Figuratively moving beyond the human – and to expose its boundaries through a different animal phenomenology – privilege is accorded ‘the mark of real’, with animals engaged by artists in making-processes, often through the marking of surfaces. The resulting co-produced artwork, most often for human consumption, then becomes read as the ‘genuine artifact of the event’, of the animal’s <italic>Umwelt</italic> (Baker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468692">2000</xref>: 13). We can also find the <italic>aporia</italic> of Derridean hospitality being employed within bio-art to develop an ‘aesthetics of care’, with the artistic creation and hosting of transgenic life forms offered as a consideration of hybridity, but also a ‘response-ability’ towards and of the non-human other (Aristarkhova, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468692">2010</xref>; Baker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468692">2003</xref>). The challenge to anthropomorphism is continued beyond the ‘animal question’ in those art–science practices whose adoption of the materialities and practices of nano- and genetic technologies serves to draw out the material continuity of human subject and world, specifically challenging the ‘membranes’ of skin and cell (Zurr and Catts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-2043820612468692">2002</xref>).</p><p>In our own work, we partake in dialogues within the fields of both cultural geography and art theory/practice, dialogues that do not so much share a common ground – though both, as we hope has become clear, inherit a great deal of the aesthetic legacy noted above – as they proffer ways of framing a post-humanism. And so, whilst we go on to flesh out this topic via reference to a particular set of what can be called ‘artworks’, each of which can be firmly located in the post-human art world outlined above, we want to emphasise that this is not accomplished via the ‘finding’ of geography within art, or, to turn this around, the making art of geographic debate. That is, we appreciate the differential points of entry, and lines of inquiry, that become available when we use artistic practices as a stepping off point for thinking about aesthetics as a field of knowledge that enables us to reflect and ask questions about post-humanism.</p><p>The particular works we explore in the following section are, appropriately then, by artist <italic>cum</italic> geographer Perdita Phillips, whose mediums are primarily installation art, sculpture, drawing, photography and sound, and whose projects turn time and again toward the ‘place’ of the human over and against both animals and minerals. The first work we engage is entitled <italic>Green, Grey or Dull Silver</italic> (2007–2008) and consists of a series of ‘in the field’ interactions with male specimens of the Great Bowerbird, specifically observation of their collection and arrangement of objects in their ‘display space’, and the vocalisations performed as part of their mating displays as well as installations, commentaries, photographs and sketches. The second is entitled <italic>The Sixth Shore </italic>(2009–2012). Here, layered sonic landscapes are imagined and realised, including the sound worlds of a colony of ‘living rocks’ (Glasgow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820612468692">2010</xref>) – thrombolites, whose distinctive dome-like structures are the carbonate build up from colonies of microbes – as well as various fauna, residents and scientists, all ‘inhabiting’ the shores of Lake Clifton, Australia. Drawing inspiration from Deleuze and Guattari’s geophilosophy, these works, as we go on to discuss below, speak to a series of ‘thresholds’, each fraught with philosophical, scientific and artistic meaning for the post-human, including art/science, academic/lay, lithic/organic, taxonomic/monstrous, anerobic/aerobic atmosphere and so on. We map our own journey across each by asking, where is the artistry?</p></sec><sec id="section5-2043820612468692"><title>The most human of birds … the most aesthetic of all animals</title><p>Found across the savannas of Australia, the 14 bowerbird species that construct bowers have become iconic for evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and biophilosophy as well as the subject of a number of artistic works. What is particular interesting to us about the project <italic>Green, Grey or Dull Silver</italic> (2007–2008) is its focus on a series of explorations into the collection practices and observances of the Great Bowerbird (<italic>Chlamydera nuchalis</italic>), collections that are read by bird behaviouralists and biologists as a culturally conditioned ‘sign’ of mate quality. This is itself a neo-Darwinian, aesthetic ‘play’ that aligns birds with humans in that they have behaviours and characteristics that transcend ‘mere’ natural selection; as Darwin himself remarked, birds are ‘the most aesthetic of all animals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820612468692">1871[2004]</xref>: n.p.).</p><p>The aesthetic enters into Phillips’ artwork by virtue of another manoeuvre, however, as we go on to explain below. That is, whilst she takes on board the scientific method of bird behaviouralists, and indeed her findings contribute to this body of research, there is nonetheless a remaking of the relation between observer and observed, human and bird. Enrolled in her work, the behaviouralist’s credence to the ‘taste’ for beauty shown by these birds in their mating displays is marked by what we might term, following Kant, a teleological judgement as to why and with what effect such a taste is deployed. As Phillips observes in a commentary for her mixed media installation, <italic>The World has No Shortage of Things</italic> (2007), ‘The males freely avail themselves of human made objects as long as they fit certain criteria of colour, size and roundness. These criteria are thought to be both genetically inherited and in part culturally learnt, and socially transmitted through generations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85a-2043820612468692">Phillips, 2007</xref>, n.p.; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2043820612468692">Figure 1</xref>) Bowerbird display is given a purposiveness and a systematicity – finding a quality mate via sexual selection – that can be apprehended by systematic observation.</p><fig id="fig1-2043820612468692" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Photograph from <italic>The World has No Shortage of Things </italic>(Phillips, 2007).

Specifically, this is accomplished via an emphasis upon a cross-species ‘expressivity’, made possible by a shared capacity for sense making. The consequent sense-worlds created, though, like Yeats’ widening gyres, are each alien to the other, spiralling away from this mutual grounding in biology. She writes ‘whilst conveying the <italic>Umwelt</italic> of the bowerbird might ultimately be an impossible task, the artwork explores this space of uncertainty between the human and the nonhuman’ (2007: n.p.). In <italic>The World has No Shortage</italic>, this space yawns to encompass the mineral world, represented by grey, geometric shapes, which, Phillips notes, the taxonomic system of Linnaeus floundered upon.</p><p>The artistry of Phillips’ works, then, we want to argue in this section, makes an interesting foil against which to engage with the artistry of the bower-birds themselves, an approach made possible by a series of scientific and philosophical interventions on their behaviour and biology. The focus of such fascination are the bowers the male birds ‘create’, varying by species from ‘avenues’, to stick ‘towers’ up to 3 m high, and ‘huts’ up to 4 m in diameter, and ‘decorated’ with as many as several thousand flowers, fruits, mushrooms, snail shells, butterfly wings, stones and other natural and increasingly human-made objects. How do we understand such activity? According to many bird behaviouralists, the answer lies both in how female bowerbirds respond to such bower collections and how male birds compete in building them.</p><p>Borgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612468692">1985</xref>), for example, has sought to investigate what is termed the ‘marker hypothesis’, wherein it is argued that female bowerbirds ‘prefer’ more highly constructed and decorated bowers, taking these as indicative of a male’s ‘quality’ as a mate. Observing satin bowerbirds over a 2-year period, Borgia and his team proceeded to remove from half of the 22 bowers under study some of the decorations (comprising blue feathers, yellow snail shells, cicada skins, etc.), though making sure to leave three yellow leaves which males hold in their beaks during their active displays. This ‘control’ was held to help isolate the impact of the bower as decorated construct. Not only did females ‘choose’ the more decorated bowers more frequently, the lower quality specimens were more likely to be attacked by competing male bowerbirds. For Borgia, such a preference makes sense – it has a purposiveness, we might say – insofar as ‘only the most dominant males can accumulate feathers and snail shells as decorations in such large numbers’ (1985: 270).</p><p>Diamond’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2043820612468692">1986</xref>) study of New Guinea Bowerbirds (<italic>Amblyornis inornatus</italic>), by contrast, sought to help explain the difference in ‘style’ between bowers of the same species in the same locale. Using numbered, coloured poker chips, Diamond was able to trace the differential preferences expressed between bowerbirds over space. Decoration colours, bower construction and height were all, he suggested, selected according to ‘culturally conditioned’, as opposed to genetically hard-wired, traits. Small wonder he refers to these as ‘the most intriguingly human of birds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2043820612468692">Diamond, 1982</xref>: 102).</p><p>The terminology deployed in such studies makes clear their indebtedness to a Darwinist framing of aesthetics, wherein there is a crucial difference noted between natural selection, which is predicated on the environmental fit of randomly produced traits (including an aesthetics of form), and sexual selection, which may well deploy seemingly ‘detrimental’ traits, such as elaborate bower construction. Indeed, it was Darwin’s focus on ‘secondary sexual characteristics’ that his critics, such as the geographer Alfred Russell Wallace, considered a futile point of analysis (Grammer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2043820612468692">2003</xref>). For Miller, however, such displays signal a truth about ‘the [bird] artist’s individual fitness’ (2001: 7). Sexual selection thus highlights the capacity of ‘choice’ in the selection of a mate in a way that shapes ‘artistic virtuosity as a fitness indicator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2043820612468692">2001</xref>: 20).</p><p>Phillips’ <italic>Green, Grey or Dull Silver</italic> (2007–2008) borrows considerably from this body of work. Over a period of 2 years, Phillips left a series of coloured objects around 13 bowers, observing and recording which were chosen by which individuals for collection and construction. It also harkens back to an earlier form of study, however, one that does not reside easily in either ‘scientific’ or ‘lay’ knowledges. In the 1960s, retiree Reta Vellenga and her husband undertook a study of satin bowerbirds in their backyard, located in the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney, over a 6-year period. Following some 426 male satin bowerbirds, Vellenga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-2043820612468692">1970</xref>) writes of bowers as ‘love parlours’ that serve as a ‘symbol of a males’ property rights’, a property to be protected aggressively from raids but that were also tended daily. Vellenga also left material ‘decorations’ for her ethnographic participants in the form of a blue celluloid band that was transferred between sites before becoming woven into one male bird’s bower.</p><p>Vellenga’s ‘thinking like a bowerbird’ has something in common with the mosquito hunter that Shaw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2043820612468692">2010</xref>) describe, whose work picks site, pace and purpose from the biogeographic life of the mosquito. But, it also raises questions around the purposiveness of collection practices and observances. Indeed, for Welsch, (2004, n.p.), the central question becomes ‘how is it that beauty and a sense of beauty arise in the context of utility, without being a sense of utility per se, or reducible to utility?’ In response, Welsch teases out an appreciation of beauty as a capacity in and of itself, one that cannot be reduced to an awareness of fitness and a desire to mate. For if, he argues, there is no clarity as to what the sources of the aesthetic are, then ‘one has no right to degrade animal aesthetics or even to exclude it from the realm of aesthetic consideration by pointing to its sexual grounding’ (2004, n.p.).</p><p>It also raises question around the ‘shared’ aesthetic experience of human and bowerbird. As Darwin went on to state ‘[w]hether we can or not give any reason for the pleasure thus derived from vision and hearing, yet man and many of the lower animals are alike pleased by the same colour, graceful shading and forms and the same sounds’ (1871[2004]: 88). For Darwin, the answer to the issue of an animal aesthetics lay in neurology, wherein, he argued, a ‘sense of beauty’ is aligned with both emotional and intellectual capacities. Their ubiquity enables beauty to be judged beyond both the species limit and a simplistic alignment with sexual drive and desire. In the morphology of the bower – from the rudimentary ‘practice bowers’ of an immature male to the constant maintenance of a mature males display bower – time and memory enable an aesthetic refinement, Welsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-2043820612468692">2004</xref>) insists, such that we might say an awareness of ‘agreeability’, rather than an immediate desire, emerges.</p><p>Framed in this way, Phillips’ bowerbird experiments resonate with Deleuze and Guattari’s (2004) understanding of the figure of the artist and the ‘work’ of art. Indeed, tracking the Brown Stagemaker (<italic>Scenopoeetes dentirostris</italic>), a species of bowerbird, across their plateaux is to find an increasingly populated world in which a veritable menagerie, including spiny lobsters and poster fish, amongst others, do theoretical work within a broader geophilosophy. The artistry of these various species moves us from the comprehension of territory as tied to aggression, such as we find in bowerbird science, to territory as a form of art tied to expression. That is, in reconnecting territory to rhythm and expressive marking, Deleuze and Guattari develop a series of examples of this ‘becoming-expressive-territory’, not least of which is the Brown Stagemaker, which<disp-quote><p>… lays down landmarks each morning by dropping leaves it picks from its tree and then turning them upside down so the paler underside stands out against the dirt: inversion produces a matter of expression. (2004: 348)</p></disp-quote>As Bogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612468692">1991</xref>: 89) explores further, each leaf is a component that is no longer simply part of a <italic>milieu</italic> – by which is meant an ensemble of qualities, substances and events – but has been converted into an artistic medium by dint of the repetitive, territorialising behaviour of the bowerbird. In Deleuze and Guattari’s text, this visual component of an avian aesthetic is linked into a sonorous element, the becoming expressive of rhythm and melody that is the site of the ‘territorialising factor’. Indeed, in describing the bower as a ‘ready-made’ (after the Dada artists), they note a common, cross-species denominator of working with what is to hand. Thus,<disp-quote><p>Territorial marks are ready-mades. And what is called <italic>art brut</italic> is not at all pathological or primitive; it is merely this constitution, this freeing, of matters of expression in the movement of territoriality: the base or ground of art. Take anything and make it a matter of expression. The stagemaker practices <italic>art brut</italic>. Artists are stage-makers, even when they tear up their own posters. Of course from this standpoint art is not the privilege of human beings. (Deleuze and Guattari, 2004: 349)</p></disp-quote>And yet, what does this mean to take anything and make it a matter of expression? To remake territory as an artistic movement? For us, such a post-human aesthetic raises all manner of questions around the ‘thresholds’ of such a statement, which may well take the form of a ‘limit’ as to what kind of material is under scrutiny, understood according to its particular ‘expressive’ capacities, but also in regard to our understanding of the practices that enable this expression and its recognition in others. A threshold may also, however, refer to a ‘point of no return’, wherein the Kantian aesthetic order spirals in ever-widening gyres till we can no longer refer back to the analytic coordinates that allowed us to make sense of sense. For us, these questions can be explored via reference to a second artwork by Phillips, <italic>The Sixth Shore</italic> (2009–2012), wherein, as we go on to describe below, science is no longer so easily boxed off as teleological judgement. Here, we find a biology that is not tied to complexification and evolutionary imperatives, but is instead a matter of stickiness and gliding, and the ‘inside/outside’ work of membranes. How, then, do we proceed to think through the science of sense making in this context? And, what is the import for our understanding of the nature of aesthetics?</p></sec><sec id="section6-2043820612468692"><title>Of tiny sounds and evolutionary alternatives</title><p><italic>The Sixth Shore</italic> (2009–2012) takes the form of a ‘sound-walk’ based on and around Lake Clifton, in the Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia. Audiences, walking in other locales, use headspeakers to ‘pick up’ geolocated layers of sounds from here, including the songs of birdcall, the wind rustling through trees, scientists discussing ecosystem states and local residents offering oral histories. Adding to the complexity of this sonic collage are the imagined sounds of thrombolytic time, centring on one of the few examples of these saline ‘living rocks’ to be found across the globe. Thrombolites are made up of a complex community of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, and cemented with crystallised or detrital minerals as well as a slime of biotic material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2043820612468692">Figure 2</xref>). Within this soundscape, Phillips creates ‘a spiral of tiny sounds, a descent into geological past and tiny pinprick sounds like the multitudinous field of microbes’ (2009: 4). These, she writes, help us to access a ‘vast panorama extending from the beginnings of life itself to the present day … opening us out onto scales beyond our senses, a window onto the sublime’ (Phillips, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2043820612468692">2009</xref>: 4).</p><fig id="fig2-2043820612468692" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Thrombolites of Lake Clifton, Western Australia.

As we go on to describe below, thrombolites do not revolve around reproduction, and hence evolutionary biology as Darwin envisioned it, but around accretion. In terms of ‘territory’, then, there are no behaviours to be explored via reference to sexual selection, but rather the working of viscera and membranes in the context of physiological and biochemical gradients. How, then, does this example and its attendant biology prompt us to think about the aesthetic?</p><p><italic>The Sixth Shore</italic> (2009–2012) was developed and funded as part of the art/science organisation SymbioticA’s on-going project, <italic>Adaptation</italic>, whose launch was timed to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin’s <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic>. And as with her bowerbird work, Phillips makes extensive reference to a body of scientific research, this time encompassing the study of climate change and its impact upon the ecology of Lake Clifton and its <italic>environs</italic> as well as the microbiology of the thrombolites. In regard to the former, the thrombolites of Lake Clifton have been identified by environmental scientists as being of significance because they are amongst the ‘oldest evidence of life on earth’: the probability is that such ‘ancient’ ecosystems ‘probably signalled the first appearance of cellular organisation and photosynthesis’ (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-2043820612468692">2010</xref>: 208). As evidence, their particular constellation of materials and forces deserve to be protected from the vicissitudes of environmental change, ‘especially in the context of global changes that the biosphere is experiencing in recent decades’ (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-2043820612468692">2010</xref>: 208). There is also an ‘originary’ moment acknowledged here, insofar as it was the emergence of cynaobacteria with their photosynthetic properties, fixing carbon dioxide and excreting oxygen that led to the ‘oxygen holocaust’ 2200–2400 million years ago, which in turn allowed for the ascendance of aerobic life (including humans). Certainly, Phillips’ reference to the (mathematical) sublime echoes this impulse.</p><p>The second body of scientific work she references, however, looks to the micro in making sense of the thrombolites. And it is here that we can see the thresholds of a teleological reasoning as the metabolic relations via which microbacteria help to form the thrombolite not only withstand cause–effect explanation, as we go on to show below, but reveal an in-betweeness that challenges taxonomic efforts. Indeed, at Lake Clifton, thrombolite growth has been associated with the work of the filamentous cyanobacteria <italic>Scytonema</italic> sp., especially, distinguishable by virtue of its particular metabolic functions rather than its morphology or cellular structure (Moore and Burne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2043820612468692">1994</xref>; Reed et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2043820612468692">1984</xref>). It is this research, at the level of the micro, which prompts us to think more carefully about a post-Kantian aesthetic that seeks to enrol and rework the ‘free play’ of imagination and understanding or sensibility and knowledge/cognition. Specifically, it prompts us to consider the ‘real conditions’ for the possibility of an aesthetics for thrombolite communities. If we can think of bats, for example, as developing sonar, a new form of sensibility through which this organism is enabled in the context of the complexities of its environment and via which it selectively relates to it (Bogue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612468692">2003</xref>), then in order to understand thrombolite aesthetics, we need to take account of their key capacity in relation to the complexities of their environment and that is accretion.</p><p>What microlevel analysis of the thrombolites highlights is that it achieves accretion via three processes, each working with largely the same materials, but via a variety of physical and chemical interactions, and over a number of time-frames. First, there is the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) from water in the form of calcite. This occurs when CaCO<sub>3</sub>-rich water reaches a saturation point, and the resulting coating forms a kind of ‘cement’ that embeds the existing material. Second, there is the trapping and intertwining of detrital sediments by ‘the “sticky” surface properties, sheath hydrophobicity, and gliding motility’ (Burne and Moore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612468692">1987</xref>: 243) of the tough, cellular walls of filamentous cyanobacteria as well as the ‘slimy’ extracellular DNA, proteins and polysaccharides extruded by microorganisms. And, third, several microbial groups – including cyanobacteria, but also aerobic heterotrophs, sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, sulphate-reducing bacteria and fermentative bacteria (Riding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2043820612468692">2000</xref>) – biogenically precipitate CaCO<sub>3</sub> once a saturation threshold has been reached, with crystals nucleating on and within the biomass. The ‘internal’ coherence and metabolic functioning of an individual cyanobacterium, then, is expressed as a complex sensible negotiation of environmental ‘outsides’, understood here as physiochemical gradients. This internal composition simultaneously impacts upon the relations expressed between and amongst cyanobacteria as well as on their production of lithic material (see Stal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-2043820612468692">1995</xref>). At Lake Clifton, cyanobacteria are sustained by carbonate and biocarbonate ions in the groundwater that seep into the lake and precipitate CaCO<sub>3</sub> as the mineral aragonite.</p><p>It remains a point of scientific debate, however, as to the cause–effect relations operating here. Indeed, the literature seems to point to the paucity of such a mode of thinking in light of the difficulty in retaining a sense of individual components acting upon each other. This includes the seemingly antithetical character of the organic and the lithic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820612468692">2</xref></sup> For example, there is a query over how the CaCO<sub>3</sub>-rich water reaches a saturation point, thus precipitating the deposition of the minerals that form the thrombolite’s lithic components (see Dupraz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2043820612468692">2009</xref>). On the one hand, the uptake of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis increases the pH surrounding the cyanobacterial cell, which favours carbonate precipitation. On the other hand, biocarbonate is the product of microbial sulphate and nitrate reduction, and its production also promotes CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. Calcification itself can cause ‘impregnation of sheath material by crystals (which ultimately results in the formation of macaroni-like tubes) or the encrustration of sheath material to form an external crust [giving] … molds of small intertwined and felted groups of sheaths rather than individual filaments’ (Burne and Moore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612468692">1987</xref>: 245). At the scale of the thrombolite, we find that ‘the living cyanobacterial mat grades into microgranular aragonite enclosing numerous remnants of cyanobacterial sheaths (capsules) and then, deeper, into pure aragonitic micrite’ (Kempe and Kazmierczak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2043820612468692">2007</xref>: 252). Aragonite is thermodynamically unstable in the ambient conditions of Earth, and tends to alter to calcite at scales of 10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> years; these are polymorphs, with the same chemical formula but a different chemical structure.</p><p>Bearing this scientific framing of the microlevel in mind, if we look to the cyanobacteria as an ‘entry point’ into the thrombolite we can in turn query in what form we find aesthetics. A first, and increasingly visible, route lies in biogenics (Lyon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2043820612468692">2007</xref>). Here, there is a concerted effort to understand how organisms such as cyanobacteria have an emergent level of complexity such as we see, albeit in different forms, in the aesthetic judgements of Kant’s third critique, and in the expressive actions of the bowerbirds. Bacteria have, under the scalar logics of normative cognitive science – that is, working down from human cognition – long been thought too simple and too reactive to have cognitive capacities. But, these recent biogenic approaches have insisted upon bacteria as having the capacity for remembering, problem-solving, learning and communication (Stotz and Griffiths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-2043820612468692">2008</xref>). Such approaches, taken up most forcefully in the biohumanities and cognitive biology, up-end normative arguments by seeking answers to what were psychological questions – principally around cognition – within the realm of the biological (see Shapiro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2043820612468692">2007</xref>). What is more, bacteria are not just to be considered singular entities collected <italic>en masse</italic>, but are also framed here in terms of their complex collective behaviours, ‘swarming motility’ or ‘wolf pack hunting’, all mediated by chemical forms of communication (Lyon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2043820612468692">2007</xref>). Biofilms, which include everything from the layers of plaque on our teeth to the complex communities of the thrombolites, become rendered as highly structured living arrangements that can contain many different species of bacteria, and which allow for the division of labour and mutual living.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2043820612468692">3</xref></sup></p><p>An alternative route, however, is focused not upon ‘humanising’ the traits bacteria are in possession of, but upon the wholesale working over of our understanding of cognition. Indeed, such an approach raises a slew of questions concerning our apprehension of aesthetics as a ‘science of the sensible’ in which biophysical and the biochemical are centralised. Specifically, and once more following Phillips’ lead, we can look to Deleuze, who identifies a ‘primary vital sensibility’, wherein organic syntheses – metabolism in other words – form the ‘building blocks’ for rational, conscious cognition (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>: 100). What is important for our understanding of aesthetics here is not that such ‘basic syntheses’ are a stepping stone for a cognition wherein we can recognise the modes and registers of aesthetics identified above; that is, as based on rational judgement or a form of sensed expression. Rather, under the rubric of the ‘biological transcendental aesthetic’ (see Protevi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2043820612468692">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2043820612468692">2010b</xref>), this is a biological, or enactive, cognition. In other words, ‘sense-making’ is no longer to be apprehended, as in Kant’s third critique, as a transcendental <italic>analytic</italic>, with aesthetics as a higher level of emergent complexity. Instead, biological sense making proffers the a priori, but always concrete, genesis, of organic time and space (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>: 98).</p><p>Without wishing to delve too deeply into Deleuze’s <italic>oeuvre </italic>this time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2043820612468692">4</xref></sup> sense-making is constituted here from a series of syntheses, not all of which are operative across all organisms. Thus, the active syntheses of thought are allowed for by the passive syntheses of perception; these in turn are allowed for by passive organic syntheses (or metabolism). The challenge lies in avoiding a reductive ‘tracing back’ whilst articulating how such passive syntheses are indeed constitutive. That is, in grasping how the organic synthesis of the elements of water, earth, light and air is not merely prior to the active synthesis that would recognise or represent them, but is also ‘prior to their being sensed … each organism not only in its receptivity and perception but also in its “viscera” (that is its metabolism), is a “sum of contractions, or retentions and expectations”’ (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>: 73, 99). ‘Local selves’, in this case cyanobacteria, are formed in terms of these contractions in the viscera, which thereby ‘account simultaneously for the possibility of experiencing sensations [and] the power of reproducing them’ (Deleuze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468692">1994</xref>: 98).</p><p>This gives us then, a biological (though not, it must be stressed, a biologically reductive) aesthetic. And yet, we wonder, do thrombolites challenge us to query aesthetics even further than do the cyanobacteria that help constitute them? What is the relationship between the aesthetics of cynaobacteria, as outlined above, and the accreted, thromobolite colony? By way of concluding this section, we want to take the opportunity to offer a speculative line of inquiry that looks a little more closely at <italic>milieu</italic>, a term that appeared in the preceding section. There, in the bowerbird context, <italic>milieu</italic> referred to leaves that, redistributed by the bowerbirds, became ‘expressive’ insofar as they allowed for a territory to emerge; such material recomposition being described by Deleuze and Guattari in artistic terms as a ‘ready-made’. In the thrombolytic context, however, questions around <italic>milieu</italic> and expression are cast in, more literally, molecular ways.</p><p><italic>Milieu </italic>becomes, in the first instance, an illuminating structural component, enabling us to better comprehend these biotic–non-biotic assemblages and the real conditions for their growth via accretion. As we noted above, a crucial means of cementation is the sticky, unsheathed DNA material extruded by microorganisms, and Deleuze and Guattari, in discussing organic expression at the scale of genes (amongst other scales), make a mention of proteins drawn from a ‘pre-biotic soup’ (2004: 42). Here, ‘expression’ means ‘putting of content to work’, with content in this case being amino acids, and expression being the nucleotide sequences and the gene itself (Deleuze and Guattari, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820612468692">2004</xref>: 42). Following on from this, is it possible to see thrombolites as a figuring of <italic>milieu</italic>, which, Deleuze and Guattari explain, grow ‘from the middle’ (<italic>au milieu</italic>) when molecular materials and substantial elements are exchanged and organised around a reversible boundary or membrane, forming a ‘unity of composition’ that is qualitatively unique? The resulting material assemblage incorporates all that is involved in the interactions between its elements, compounds, energy sources and organisms from the molecular to the molar levels. Can we sketch out a framing for the thrombolite science described above that proffers expression, and hence an artistry of a form, to these biotic–non-biotic assemblages? Specifically, in contrast to our bowerbird example, such a framing would be, in part, possible because genes become here a means of expression – they put content to work – not only via their role within reproduction (in this case, morphological bifurcation) but also via accretion. Are there hints, perhaps, of a post-human aesthetic that can be linked to a biology that persists <italic>otherwise</italic> than via the evolution of human expressivity?</p><p>In the second instance, thinking through <italic>milieu</italic> directs us to the manner in which the components that make up the thrombolite bind and cleave. In Deleuzo–Guattarian terms, living and non-living materials are both topological, insofar as they are an intensification of space and time, but Protevi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2043820612468692">2010a</xref>, n.p.) argues, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2043820612468692">Simondon (2007[1995])</xref>, organic life possesses a particular, dynamic topological configuration that allows for the ‘measured’ unfolding of time at both the molecular and species level. That is, ‘in the ontogenetic organic register, cellular displacement and temporality of gene expression networks are linked in embryonic development’, whilst ‘in the evolutionary organic register, the distribution of plastic developmental systems (multiplicity of concrete space and time of ontogenesis in a population) provides the variation for the temporality of genetic accommodation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2043820612468692">Simondon, 2007[1995]</xref>). Are thrombolites, perhaps, figures <italic>par excellence</italic> of Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘self-consistent aggregate’? These are composed of heterogeneous elements, as opposed to the homogeneous strata that ensue from a series of linear causalities between elements. In a passage that actually concerns itself with bowerbirds, Deleuze and Guattari write that with such self-consistent aggregates<disp-quote><p>instead of a regulated succession of forms-substances we are presented with consolidations of very heterogeneous elements, orders that have been short-circuited or even reverse causalities, and captures between materials and forces of a different nature: as if a machinic phylum, a destratifying transversality, moved through elements, orders, forms and substances, the molar and the molecular, freeing a matter and tapping forces. (2004: 370)</p></disp-quote>Rendered thus, the paradoxical figure of the ‘living rock’ – chimerical, alien, otherwise – that has so often been configured as a remarkable leftover from another time and place, both preceding and helping to beget life as we know it on this planet, no longer appears to slouch towards us in quite so confounding a manner. But, we wonder, is this because the analytic co-ordinates via which we have made sense of sense have now been set adrift in a post-human landscape? Have we reached the expressive limits of the aesthetic? Or, have we merely caught sight of new vistas?</p></sec><sec id="section7-2043820612468692"><title>In conclusion: the value of humanist remains</title><p>To deploy, for the moment, more traditional frames of reference for an understanding of the aesthetic, its analytic value, we suggest, as with science, lies not in any sense of resolution, but rather with the unfolding of question after question. The terrain it inhabits is an invitation to thought. This does not take the form of a systematic methodology, of course, but rather a ‘tracing’ between science, philosophy and art around the notion of sense-making. From Kant to Deleuze, biogenics to dark materialisms, we can see how aesthetic inquiry partakes of each – it acquires a motile lexicon of sense, sensibility and cognition – yet we do not see the final triumph of one or other framing, whether this be a biological reductivism or a transcendentalism. Instead, the aesthetic makes a display of its ‘constitutive outside’, inviting the arrival of new empirics, theories, speculations, all to be placed over and against each other as well as previous work. Conceived of as a sk(e)in that connects but never envelops its constitutive parts, the aesthetic surely resonates with a geographic discipline that continually negotiates the physical and social sciences as well as the humanities.</p><p>In particular, we want to conclude, it resonates with a ‘humanistic geography’ and a ‘post-human geomorphology’. In regard to the former, this is not, as we hope has become clear, because the aesthetic is allied with an uniquely human rationality and reason or is concerned with an individualistic, emotional response to art. Rather, such an aesthetic field of inquiry echoes the breadth of commentaries by geographers such as Tuan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-2043820612468692">1989</xref>), as noted earlier, and Buttimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612468692">1976</xref>), commentaries usually consigned to the underlying layers of a disciplinary palimpsest. Yet, bearing in mind the arguments made above, what could be more post-human, for example, than Buttimer’s (1976: 283) call for more in-depth inquiry into the ‘organic, cognitive, affective and symbolic foundations’ of our place in and with the world? Faced with the desire to decentre, as well as the obligation to preserve, this humanist impulse has indeed deepened over recent decades into a consideration of what remains of ‘the human’.</p><p>Indeed, it has become relevant to the halting emergence of what might be termed a ‘post-human’ geomorphology, insofar as this exploratory work calls into question the very foundations upon which a ‘human–environment’ relationship has been made central to physical geography. At first glance, recent interest in the framing of landforms as emerging from the intersection of human consciousness and quantum processes, such that consistent macroscopic ‘idealizations’ are perceived and cognised as landforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2043820612468692">Harrison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2043820612468692">Rhoads, 1999</xref>), would appear to very much resonate with a Kantian notion of knowledge production. The intent here, however, is to underscore the ontic, rather than epistemic, character of landforms, insofar as their emergence requires an immersive experience of a world characterised not so much by flow and flux as by materialities that ‘collide, congeal, morph, evolve, and disintegrate’ (Bennett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468692">2009</xref>: xi). Small wonder, then, that some geomorphologists have developed an interest in what may be termed the ‘affective capacity’ of landscape, such that awe and excitement are both mobilised and acknowledged as part and parcel of the research experience (Baker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468692">2008</xref>; Baker and Twidale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468692">1991</xref>; Tooth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-2043820612468692">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-2043820612468692">2009</xref>).</p><p>We hope to have made the argument that the aesthetic should play a substantive role in these debates, whether in the form of a post-Kantian questioning of the sense making subject, as we have outlined it, or via other routes, such as a Neitzschean partaking of process. For our part, we find within this tracing of the aesthetic a suite of concepts that cry out for further attention from geographers, not least of which are ‘play’ and ‘creativity’, the former consigned to the word of children, the latter making an emaciated appearance within the economic geography literature.
