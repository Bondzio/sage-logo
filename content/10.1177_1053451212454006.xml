<abstract>
<p>Teaching mathematics to diverse learners can be a challenge. The extensive and specialized knowledge that special education teachers need to possess to be considered high-quality teachers is often lacking in preservice and inservice education, yet is mandated by current teacher reforms and rigorous measures of accountability. To provide direction for supporting teacher growth in these areas, this article highlights four knowledge bases that special education teachers should develop and expand upon as a way to improve their instruction for diverse learners in mathematics. Numerous resources and materials are provided to support the development of teacher expertise in content, characteristics of diverse learners, technology, and pedagogy.</p>

<p>Mathematics education reform emphasizes excellence and equity for all students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053451212454006">National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053451212454006">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1053451212454006">National Mathematics Advisory Panel [NMAP], 2008</xref>). Furthermore, both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212454006">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA; 2004)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1053451212454006">No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; 2002)</xref> underscore the need for access to the general education curriculum as well as more rigorous standards for students with disabilities and their teachers (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010). Despite the greater recognition of the need for high expectations for all students, diverse learners continue to underperform in mathematics (e.g., National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053451212454006">National Center for Education Statistics, [NCERS], 2009</xref>, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454006">Gonzales et al., 2008</xref>). Underachievement in mathematics is particularly severe for diverse learners, including those with disabilities, English language learners (ELL), and students from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454006">Gonzales et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053451212454006">NCERS, 2009</xref>, 2011). Moreover, the significance and persistence of underachievement in mathematics is reflected in the TIMSS data demonstrating that there has been relatively little change in scores from 2003 to 2007 in spite of reform efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454006">Gonzales et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the expectations for higher achievement in mathematics and the continued achievement difficulties diverse students’ experience, there is a need for special education teachers to have strategies that they can utilize to support learners in these areas. This article provides special educators with information and evidence-based practices to more effectively teach mathematics to increase student success. As schools are increasingly utilizing a multitiered prevention model within a response to intervention (RTI) framework, this article focuses on diverse learners including students with learning disabilities as well students without identified learning disabilities who are struggling and need more support.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212454006">
<title>What Should Special Educators Know to Teach Mathematics?</title>
<p>The quality of special education teachers and their impact on student performance is currently a critical focus for funding, research, and evaluation (American Association of College Teachers [AACTE] Teacher Performance Assessment Consortium, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454006">n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454006">Drame &amp; Pugach, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1053451212454006">Sindelar, Brownell, &amp; Billingsley, 2010</xref>). Unfortunately, special educators’ preparation to teach mathematics is of particular concern. There is strong evidence to suggest that teachers, including special education teachers, lack sufficient mathematical content knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454006">Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454006">Borko, 2004</xref>). Many teachers have a poor understanding of teaching and learning for specific content areas, which can result in (a) an overemphasis on teaching procedural, lower-level skills and (b) poor use of materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212454006">Griffin, Jitendra &amp; League, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451212454006">Maccini &amp; Gagnon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1053451212454006">van Garderen, 2008</xref>). The challenge, then, is finding ways to help special educators identify and develop a sufficient knowledge base in mathematics.</p>
<p>Guidelines, principles, and standards to direct instructional practices have been proposed by various councils in general and special education. However, these are not specific to the needs of students with disabilities in academic content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454006">Council for Exceptional Children [CEC], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053451212454006">NCTM, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454006">Brownell, Sindelar, Kiely, and Danielson (2010)</xref> discussed the minimum content special educators should know to be “quality” teachers. They noted, “Special education teachers must demonstrate, at minimum, a sophisticated knowledge base that extends beyond that of general education teachers, and this expertise must add value to the general education that students with disabilities receive” (p. 371). They suggested that there are at least four well-integrated knowledge bases that special education teachers need, including
<disp-quote>
<p>understanding of (a) content and how to teach it, (b) specific problems that students with disabilities may experience in a particular content area, (c) the role of technology in circumventing learning issues or supporting access to more sophisticated learning, and (d) the role of specific interventions and assessments in providing more intensive, explicit instruction within a broader curricular context. (p. 369)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These four key knowledge areas provide an excellent framework that can be used to highlight a summary of the types of strategies and methods special educators should know for teaching mathematics to diverse students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454006">Figure 1</xref>). Information about specific evidence-based practices in mathematics instruction is provided (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454006">Table 1</xref>), and an array of resources to support teacher development are presented as well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451212454006">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Content Knowledge</title>
<p>Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454006">Brownell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454006">Hill et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that the <italic>domain expertise</italic> (i.e., knowledge of a discipline and how students build knowledge within it) possessed by a teacher is closely connected to both teaching and student learning. Effective teachers, therefore, not only have knowledge of the subject matter but are also able to use that knowledge successfully to respond to students’ diverse needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212454006">Haager, Gersten, Baker, &amp; Graves, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1053451212454006">Seo, Brownell, Bishop, &amp; Dingle, 2008</xref>). In addition, research on teaching and learning in mathematics suggests that effective instruction includes components such as</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212454006" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Conceptual understanding</italic>, which includes knowledge about the relationship of the mathematical concepts, operations and relations of a topic;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Strategic competence</italic>, which is the ability to formulate, represent, and solve problems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adaptive reasoning</italic>, which is the use of logical thought, reflection, explanation, and justification to solve problems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Productive dispositions</italic>, which includes seeing mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile along with a belief in one’s own ability and efficacy to do mathematics; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Procedural fluency</italic>, which is the having skills to carry out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053451212454006">NCTM, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1053451212454006">NRC, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Furthermore, this instruction is to be balanced with respect to the types of knowledge to be mastered. For example, a focus in computation would be on both developing procedural fluency (e.g., knowledge of the rules and procedures for carrying out an addition problem) as well as conceptual understanding (e.g., knowledge about the relationships or foundational ideas of what it means to add; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1053451212454006">Van de Walle, Karp, &amp; Bay-Williams, 2010</xref>). As another example, a focus in solving word problems would be on developing strategic competence (e.g., using a representation such as a diagram to both understand and solve a problem; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1053451212454006">van Garderen, 2006</xref>) as well as adaptive reasoning (e.g., recognition of when and where to apply a strategy to solve different problem types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212454006">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hamlett, &amp; Appleton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, knowledge of the content itself is critical. Understanding the content is crucial in order for special educators to identify key concepts to be focused on during instruction, develop a program that follows a good sequence and scope, and provide a balanced program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1053451212454006">Parmar &amp; Cawley, 1997</xref>). For example, central to early mathematical development for students is the idea of <italic>number sense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454006">Gersten &amp; Chard, 1999</xref>). Some might narrowly define number sense as computation. However, number sense as a concept covers a broad range of constructs such as conservation of quantity, magnitude, subsidizing, and order irrelevance, each of which needs to be understood in order to be applied at the level of instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454006">Clements, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454006">Fosnot &amp; Dolk, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451212454006">
<title>Learner Characteristics</title>
<p>Recently, research on learning and disability has grown both in volume and in sophistication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454006">Brownell et al., 2010</xref>). Teachers need to understand how these difficulties present themselves and impact learning to provide appropriate, targeted instruction. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451212454006">Johnson, Humphrey, Mellard, Woods, and Swanson (2010)</xref> highlight several findings regarding key deficit characteristics of students with learning disabilities in cognitive processes that may hinder learning in mathematics, such as (a) verbal working memory, (b) visual working memory, (c) processing speed, (d) attention, and (e) executive function. Each process appears to be related to specific difficulties students may experience with math fact fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454006">Geary, Brown, &amp; Samaranayake, 1991</xref>), problem solving, and number sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454006">Geary, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Research also suggests that a possible contributor to the mathematics difficulties students with disabilities experience relates to poor numerosity, in particular, a “number module deficit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454006">Landerl, Bevan, &amp; Butterworth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1053451212454006">Rousselle &amp; Noël, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454006">Butterworth (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454006">Landerl et al. (2004)</xref> proposed that this deficit may result in difficulty understanding critical number concepts such as magnitude, counting difficulties, number reading, number comparison, and, as a result, in learning numerical information in general. Interestingly, findings from a recent study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1053451212454006">Rousselle and Noël (2007)</xref> suggest that, in part, the difficulty children may experience with numerical symbols (magnitude) is related to poor understanding of their underlying meaning rather than difficulties in fact retrieval.</p>
<p>Students with learning disabilities and those who struggle due to other risk factors also have additional characteristics that affect their ability to be successful in math. Risk characteristics that need to be considered include, for example, attention issues, impulsivity, language deficits, hyperactivity, lack of prior knowledge or fluency with specific skills, memory difficulties, and motivation problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1053451212454006">Stormont, 2007</xref>). These characteristics create needs for both frequent assessment because of limited prior knowledge or fluency and additional supports such as frequent but distributed practice (due to attention problems) and connecting the importance of content to everyday life (to increase motivation). Teachers can plan their curriculum and instruction for the characteristics their particular learners’ manifest and utilize technological resources to assist them in meeting their needs. The importance of technology knowledge and utilization is discussed in the next section, followed by evidence-based practices that are effective given they include components that attend to the needs of students with learning disabilities and those who are at risk in math.</p>

<title>Technological Knowledge</title>
<p>Significant advancements in technology have been made, and these innovations hold tremendous potential for improving the education of students struggling in math (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451212454006">Figure 2</xref> for resources). In a position statement, <italic>The Role of Technology in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics</italic>, NCTM (2008) states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Technology is an essential tool for learning mathematics in the 21st century, and all schools must ensure that all their students have access to technology. Effective teachers maximize the potential of technology to develop students’ understanding, stimulate their interest, and increase their proficiency in mathematics.

<p>In the report <italic>Learning Technology</italic>, the Office of Educational Technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454006">Atkins et al., 2010</xref>) called for application of learning sciences and technology to enhance mathematics education. Low-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech devices—including calculators, computers, tablets, and software such as graphing and statistical programs—are all increasing engagement and learning for today’s students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454006">Atkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454006">Hasselbring, Lott, &amp; Zydney, 2006</xref>). For example, calculators, including computer-based, online, and talking versions, can provide support for students with working memory deficits and/or processing speed deficits; producing the accuracy and speed required with facts and computations to enable access to instruction in higher level critical thinking and problem solving in math. Graphic organizers, including online versions, create visual displays of mathematical information, making complex data accessible by helping students focus attention on critical information such as relationships and concepts. Graphic displays employ recommendations from the learning sciences that enable coding of information through multiple representations, increasing the probability of effective storage and retrieval in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454006">Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning, National Research Council, &amp; Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences in Education, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454006">Mayer, 2011</xref>).

<p>Universal design for learning (UDL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1053451212454006">Patton &amp; Roschelle, 2008</xref>) and the use of accessible instructional materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1053451212454006">National Center on Accessible Instructional Materials at CAST, 2011</xref>) have become increasingly important in the provision of mathematics instruction. UDL is a framework for curriculum design that removes barriers to learning by planning from the outset to include multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement and to use technology to promote access to the general curriculum for all students, including students who struggle in math. Accessible instructional materials (AIM) use technology to remove barriers for students with print disabilities, including students with sensory, physical, and intellectual disabilities. The role of reading and language in math success is often underestimated, and AIM provide math content using Braille, audio files, text to speech options, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1053451212454006">U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 2011</xref>). Technology offers powerful affordances that provide access to the general curriculum for diverse learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454006">Atkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454006">Hasselbring et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Pedagogical Knowledge</title>
<p>A central role of special educators is to provide interventions and assessment to diverse learners. Special education teachers must be knowledgeable about evidence-based intervention strategies that address the specific needs of diverse learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454006">CEC, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454006">Brownell et al. (2010)</xref> noted, “Unlike we imagined in previous eras, the diagnostic and intervention knowledge of special education teachers must be well integrated with content domain knowledge” (p. 369).</p>
<p>Many studies over the past 20 years have been conducted to determine intervention strategies that work for students with diverse needs. Admittedly, the majority of studies have been conducted in reading, with fewer in mathematics (e.g., see recent reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454006">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454006">Newman-Gonchar, Clarke, &amp; Gersten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454006">NMAP, 2008</xref>). However, several chapters and reports have been published in the past few years that can help direct best practices in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1053451212454006">Stormont, Reinke, Herman, &amp; Lembke, 2012</xref>). Several principles of instruction, intervention programs that can be applied to any topic area, and strategies for targeted content areas and topics have been identified that should be used when teaching mathematics to diverse learners. Furthermore, a hallmark of special education is the use of assessment to guide instruction; accordingly, evidence-based formative assessment practices in mathematics are critical. Recently, multitiered systems such as RTI have emphasized the need to use assessment to identify student needs and then systematically deliver interventions of the appropriate intensity and duration to remediate specific skill deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454006">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>). When special education teachers are in schools implementing RTI, they may have more support for using the following recommended practices.</p>

<title>Evidence-based practices in mathematics</title>
<p>Research in the area of effective mathematics instruction for diverse learners and those with learning disabilities underscores the importance of several key practices. These practices include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454006">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>; Stormont et al., in press) the following:</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454006">Table 1</xref> includes an overview of specific programs and practices that have been demonstrated as effective for learners with learning disabilities and/or those who struggle in math. Specific examples of intervention programs that are evidence-based in mathematics and include systematic and explicit lesson plan frameworks include Hot Math and Peer-Assisted Learning Strategies (PALS) in Mathematics. Hot Math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212454006">Fuchs, Fuchs, Prentice, Burch, &amp; Paulsen, 2002</xref>) is a structured intervention that can be used as a whole class or small group tutoring intervention and focuses on explicit instruction and self-regulation strategies. PALS math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212454006">Fuchs, Fuchs, Yazdian, &amp; Powell, 2002</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kc.vanderbilt.kennedy/pals">http://www.kc.vanderbilt.kennedy/pals</ext-link>) is an evidence-based, classwide tutoring method that has been researched with students at risk, with disabilities, and with ELLs, at both elementary and secondary levels. Both Hot Math and PALS can be implemented during general classroom instruction, with the general education and special education teachers collaborating to serve all students.</p>
<p>With respect to more specific strategies in the content areas, including mathematics, whole class and individually or small group–applied strategies are supported by research (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454006">Table 1</xref>). Examples of these include the following:</p>

<title>Formative assessment in math</title>
<p>To attain successful results from intervention implementation, interventions need to be implemented with integrity, and intervention progress needs to be evaluated formatively. One type of formative evaluation that has been strongly supported in the literature is curriculum-based measurement (CBM; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454006">Deno, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454006">2003</xref>). A CBM includes measures that are reliable and valid indicators of a particular subject and are efficient, easy to administer, and standardized. In the area of mathematics, CBMs have been developed in areas such as early numeracy (e.g., number identification, quantity discrimination), computation, concepts and applications, and algebra. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212454006">Foegen, Jiban, and Deno, 2007</xref> for a comprehensive review of measures in mathematics.) These mathematics measures generally take between 2 and 8 minutes to administer and can be administered in a group setting.</p>
<p>Curriculum-based measurement can be utilized for both screening and progress monitoring. When used for screening, measures are traditionally administered three times during the year to all students to identify students who might be at-risk. This identification process occurs as a result of examining all student scores and determining which students have the lowest percentages, or by comparing individual student’s results to already existing norms for the measures. Progress monitoring occurs on a frequent basis for students who are low-achieving. Once interventions are put into place, student progress is monitored on a frequent basis (most often weekly), and data are graphed and compared to a goal line. Decision-making rules are established so that teachers can examine the graphed data and determine if students are exceeding, meeting, or not meeting the individual goal that was set. These decision-making rules help teachers determine if intervention is effective and give teachers guidance about when instructional changes need to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454006">Deno, 1985</xref>). There are many resources available to support teachers in their use of CBM including commercially available systems like Easy CBM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://easyCBM.com">http://easyCBM.com</ext-link>), Aimsweb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aimsweb.com">http://www.aimsweb.com</ext-link>), Yearly Progress Pro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctb.com">http://www.ctb.com</ext-link>), and Monitoring Basic Skills Progress (MBSP; proedinc.com).</p>
<p>Teacher-made tests can also be developed to systematically probe for understanding. It is essential that assessments clearly target skills students are working on and that teachers assess often in order to inform instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1053451212454006">Stormont, 2007</xref>). Assessment can also be used to conduct error analyses to target specific areas through evaluation of error patterns on written work. Teaches can also conduct direct observations of students completing word problems to allow for probing students on strategies they are using to solve the problem.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article provides a framework, for special educators in particular, that highlights principles that are important to address for students with learning disabilities and those who struggle in mathematics content. Teaching mathematics to students with learning disabilities or who are at risk for mathematics failure can be difficult and requires a deep, rich knowledge of content, a strong pedagogical foundation, cutting-edge technology skills, and a foundational understanding of the characteristics of diverse learners. Although provision of quality instruction is a crucial component for improving student outcomes, it is one that is challenging, particularly with regard to mathematics. There are many evidence-based, high-quality resources available for teachers to access and use (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454006">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451212454006">2</xref>). For students to develop the mathematical competencies they need to be prepared, it is essential that they have teachers who plan instruction given the current evidence base and continue their professional development to provide the best possible service.</p>
