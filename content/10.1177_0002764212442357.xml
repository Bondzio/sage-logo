<abstract>
<p>Research has shown that rural high school students in the United States (and elsewhere) have lower academic achievement than their nonrural counterparts. The evidence for why this inequality exists is unclear, however. The present study takes up this issue with a narrowing of the focus. Using the database of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002-2004, the author investigates reasons for the rural achievement gap in mathematics during the last 2 years of high school. His approach focuses on the geographic disparities in the opportunity to learn advanced math. The findings show that geographic variation in high school resources and practices—operationalized as the availability of advanced math courses, evidence for track assignment by family background, and the quality of instruction—do not account for the rural math achievement gap. On the other hand, geographic variations in the opportunity to learn that result from differences in family socioeconomic status (SES) and the influence of friends’ academic commitments and aspirations do help to explain why rural high school students learn less mathematics than their nonrural counterparts. The observed effects on math achievement by family SES and friends are in part direct effects, but these factors also have critically important indirect effects because they appear to influence student motivation to take advanced math courses.</p>

<p>Social scientists have long contended that rural areas provide inferior cultural and economic opportunities and a lower standard of living to their populations than do urbanized areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212442357">Marx &amp; Engels, 1945-1946/1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212442357">Hawley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212442357">Lobao, Hooks, &amp; Tickamyer, 2007</xref>). The disadvantages of rural location also extend to education. Rural education has received cross-national attention in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764212442357">Williams, 2005</xref>), although most studies continue to focus on the issues of rural education in single countries. From these diverse sources, broad evidence exists that rural students are educationally disadvantaged by comparison with their nonrural counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212442357">Roscigno &amp; Crowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212442357">Roscigno, Tomaskovic-Devey, &amp; Crowley, 2006</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212442357">Provasnik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764212442357">Webster &amp; Fisher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764212442357">Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764212442357">Young, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764212442357">2000</xref>). The source of this educational inequality is unclear, however.</p>
<p>In a classic review of the rural education literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212442357">Khattri, Riley, and Kane (1997)</xref> concluded that the evidence for the supposed inferiority of rural schooling is mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212442357">Fan and Chen (1999)</xref> demonstrated that the rural achievement gap disappeared when rural-nonrural differences in family socioeconomic status (SES) were controlled. Using a growth modeling approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212442357">Reeves and Bylund (2005)</xref> found that although a static comparison of rural and nonrural schools in Kentucky showed a significant rural achievement gap, the growth of achievement in rural schools significantly exceeded that in metropolitan schools (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212442357">Reeves, 2003</xref>). Yet another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212442357">Israel, Beaulieu, &amp; Hartless, 2001</xref>) found that features of local communities had a significant effect on students’ academic achievement, and the tally sheet of advantages was by no means stacked against rural communities. In a national, multicohort trend analysis of high school senior achievement in English, mathematics, and science, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212442357">Konstantopoulos (2006)</xref> found that academic performance at the school level had become more unequal between 1972 and 1992, although rural location was not implicated as a factor contributing to this trend. It may be relevant, however, that this last study included variables for geographic regions of the country in which schools were located (e.g., South, Northeast, West), which may have suppressed the significance of rural school location on achievement trends.</p>
<p>Nor have data collected under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Education resolved the matter of rural educational achievement gaps. An official report, <italic>The Status of Rural Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212442357">Provasnik et al., 2007</xref>), has confirmed achievement gaps in rural schools in reading and mathematics. Nevertheless, this publication did not provide evidence that rural schools per se were the source of these gaps. Quite the contrary, the report provided evidence that that rural schools offered a better work environment than urban schools, that rural-urban differences in the quality of the teaching force were not substantial, and that course offerings in rural areas did not account for the achievement gaps.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence such as that reviewed above leaves open the question of what does account for the rural gaps in achievement or if they even exist. The present study addresses this issue by investigating various factors—both school related and nonschool related—that could explain a rural math achievement gap during the last 2 years of high school.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764212442357">
<title>What Could Explain a Rural Math Achievement Gap?</title>
<p>Unlike reading achievement, which is strongly influenced by family practices and the educational resources in the home, math achievement—especially at the high school level—is more likely the result of the opportunities to learn math that schools provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212442357">Koretz, 2008</xref>). Put very simply, students learn such topics as analytical geometry, trigonometry, and calculus in their schools, not in their homes. In this study, I use the term <italic>opportunity to learn</italic> to refer to the exposure of high school students to advanced math instruction in courses devoted to trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. If students do not enroll and persevere in the high school courses in which these subjects are competently taught, they are unlikely to acquire knowledge of these topics. The opportunity to learn advanced mathematics during the last 2 years of high school is a key concept for the present study.</p>
<p>In the field of education research, the opportunity-to-learn concept generally refers to classroom-related factors that bear on student achievement, such as course content exposure and coverage, teacher knowledge, and instructional practices and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212442357">Boscardin et al., 2005</xref>). As a research concept, opportunity to learn was first introduced in the 1960s in the First International Mathematics and Science Study. When the Second International Mathematics and Science Study was conducted in the mid-1980s, the concept of opportunity to learn mathematics was refined to refer to features of the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212442357">McDonnell, 1995</xref>). Then, in the 1990s, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study further refined and enriched the opportunity-to-learn concept by distinguishing between the intended curriculum, the implemented curriculum, and the attained curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212442357">Martin &amp; Kelly, 1996</xref>). The idea of the <italic>intended curriculum</italic> made reference to the standards of learning specified in government statute and education policy. The <italic>implemented curriculum</italic> referred to the issues of coverage of subject matter, teacher knowledge, and instructional practices and processes in the classroom—how effectively schools were able to implement the standards. And the <italic>attained curriculum</italic> referred to what students actually had learned, as measured by an assessment instrument. Since 2000, research dealing with the opportunity to learn has emphasized the attained curriculum, or assessment (i.e., achievement testing) outcomes, in addition to features of the intended and implemented curriculum (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212442357">Boscardin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212442357">Cueto, Ramirez, &amp; Leon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A somewhat broader interpretation of the opportunity-to-learn concept than is customary in education research will be used in the present study, for I want to emphasize not only the resources schools bring to bear on student learning but also the variable resources that students acquire as a result of their being embedded in families and friendship cliques. Thus, for my purposes, opportunity to learn has two broad aspects. To describe these aspects, I will borrow two concepts from economics and suggest that the opportunity to learn has a supply function and a demand function. The supply function of the opportunity to learn advanced mathematics topics refers to the resources that are found in the high school per se. Students will not learn topics in trigonometry and calculus, for example, if courses containing these topics are not offered by the high school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212442357">1</xref></sup> Thus, the school-level availability of advanced math units is a major consideration for assessing the opportunity to learn from the supply function perspective.</p>
<p>A second supply-side consideration is whether the school has an exclusive or an inclusive approach to admitting students to advanced math courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212442357">Gamoran, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212442357">1992</xref>). Although researchers have concluded that tracking is less pronounced in rural schools than in schools in other localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212442357">Alspaugh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212442357">Khattri et al., 1997</xref>), this will not be assumed in the present study. The salience of family reputations in rural communities is such that these could have spillover effects on how students are counseled when planning their academic coursework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212442357">Coleman, 1993</xref>). For instance, in rural high schools, the children of professional parents (educators, bankers, attorneys, physicians, engineers, and the like) may be more apt to receive counseling to take advanced math classes than children of nonprofessional parents. Rural teachers and school counselors, knowing the reputations of their students’ parents, may anticipate what courses professional parents would want their children to enroll in and counsel these children accordingly.</p>
<p>The quality of instruction is a third important supply-side consideration. High schools may offer courses that purport to teach advanced math topics, but the quality of instruction may be subpar, thereby reducing students’ opportunity to learn the subject matter. Anecdotal evidence suggests that rural high schools may experience difficulties recruiting qualified teaching staff with the requisite expertise in fields such as foreign languages and advanced mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212442357">Khattri et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>When one turns to the demand function of the opportunity to learn advanced mathematics, one is thinking largely of student preparation and motivation during the last 2 years of high school to enroll in trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus courses and to learn a difficult subject matter. Student motivation to learn advanced mathematics is partly a function of prior training in mathematics. Since mathematical knowledge is cumulative, it is reasonable to assume that only those students who have mastered preparatory topics will be motivated to take more advanced topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764212442357">Stevenson, Schiller, &amp; Schneider, 1994</xref>). In the present study, this aspect of student motivation will be controlled by using 10th-grade math achievement as a baseline against which achievement in the last 2 years of high school is measured. There are additional sources of student motivation to learn advanced mathematics. These sources could be diverse, but research suggests that such motivation is powerfully influenced by two social factors: the student’s family and his or her friendship clique. For a student to have a positive attitude toward learning advanced mathematics and a motivation to take the courses that high school provides on these topics, there should be sufficient financial, educational, and social resources in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212442357">Bowles, Gintis, &amp; Osborne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212442357">Breen &amp; Goldthorpe, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764212442357">Schneider &amp; Coleman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764212442357">White, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764212442357">White, Reynolds, Thomas, &amp; Gitzlaff, 1993</xref>). In the present study, I use a composite measure of family SES to represent the complex mix of family factors that undergird student motivation to persevere in studying advanced math during the last 2 years of high school. The higher the family’s SES, the greater is the likelihood that the student’s motivation will be supported by resources in the home.</p>
<p>The second major nonschool factor affecting student motivation to take advanced courses is the student’s clique of friends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212442357">Coleman’s (1960</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212442357">Coleman, Johnstone, &amp; Jonassohn, 1966</xref>) classic studies of the high school as a social system revealed that students are organized into cliques and friendship groups. The norms held by these peer groups powerfully influence the academic motivation and aspirations of their members (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212442357">Crosnoe, Cavanagh, &amp; Elder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212442357">Milner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212442357">Riegle-Crumb, Farkas, &amp; Muller, 2006</xref>). Although affirming the hypothesis that peer groups influence student academic achievement in high school, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212442357">Frank et al. (2008)</xref> singled out a broader reference group of <italic>potential</italic> friends that influences math course taking. Interestingly, this study found that it was mainly girls’ math course taking that was influenced by this more broadly defined social category transcending the friendship clique. In the present study, I will cleave to the more established position that students look to their friends per se when forming self-expectations of academic course taking and achievement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212442357">Burt (2010)</xref> has provided a recent overview of the literature on the effects of social network closure—a feature of adolescent friendship cliques—on the behavior of individuals who are embedded in such groups. As Burt makes clear, a key factor in closely knit networks is the compelling need to maintain one’s good reputation vis-à-vis peers. Fear of failing to measure up becomes a preoccupation that shapes the individual’s behavior. The operation of this mechanism in bounded groups was recognized more than a century ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764212442357">Max Weber (1906/2008)</xref>, who stated, “According to all experience there is no stronger means of breeding traits than through the necessity of holding one’s own in the circle of one’s associates” (p. 198). Similar ideas were applied to friendship groups by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212442357">Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954)</xref>. These authors identified homophily as a feature of friendship relations. <italic>Homophily</italic> means that friendship groups are characterized by the principle embedded in the old saw, “birds of a feather flock together.” According to Lazarsfeld and Merton, homophily is found in two major forms: Status homophily means that friends typically share similar social backgrounds, identities, and characteristics. Value homophily means that friends often hold common beliefs and values. In the population of high school students that are the subjects of the present study, status homophily appears to derive from the similar family SES backgrounds of students; value homophily derives also from family but perhaps even more significantly from friends. Status homophily and value homophily are not entirely separable, and in this study, it will be shown that the status homophily of family SES undergirds the value homphily of student friendships.</p>
<p>The discussion above suggests that family influence and the influence of friends on academic motivation intersect to a degree. A student’s friendship clique is not independent of his or her family’s SES. That a connection exists between student social class background and the academic commitments of friends and that both of these factors contribute to differentiated paths of course taking are supported by now-venerable research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212442357">Alexander &amp; McDill, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212442357">Alexander, Cook, &amp; McDill, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212442357">Campbell &amp; Alexander, 1965</xref>) and will be substantiated in the present study as well. The thesis of these studies is that high school students affiliate with friends of similar social backgrounds and that peer educational expectations along with family educational expectations influence a student’s course taking and academic outcomes. In the analysis presented below, I will use a path model to demonstrate the direct and indirect relationships between math achievement and geographic location, family SES, friends, and the opportunity to learn.</p>

<title>Sample and Variables</title>
<p>This study uses the Educational Longitudinal Study (2004-2006; ELS) Database (available from The National Center for Education Statistics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nces.ed.gov">http://nces.ed.gov</ext-link>). This is a longitudinal national probability sample of high school sophomores in the United States. The data set used for the present study is a trimmed sample that excludes less than 2% of the original longitudinal sample. The excluded cases for the most part are students who changed high schools between their sophomore and senior years. The rationale for excluding these cases was to eliminate the complication of sample members who were exposed to resources in more than one high school during their junior and senior years. Related to this rationale was the problem that the school location variable existed for the sophomore year but not the senior year. If students who transferred schools between the sophomore and senior years had remained in the sample, there would be every reason to suspect that some would have moved to different geographic locations, thereby confounding the results of this study to an unknown extent. The study sample (<italic>N</italic> = 11,170; population ≈ 2.5 million) represents 2004 sophomores who were on track to graduate in 2006 from the same high school in which they were enrolled 2 years prior.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212442357">Table 1</xref> displays the descriptive statistics for the variables used in this study. Math achievement gain is the gain score calculated by subtracting the 10th-grade IRT (item response theory) number right math test score from the 12th-grade IRT number right math test score. The school location dummy variables are provided in the ELS data set and are based on summary Urban Influence Code categories. Measures of student demographics include gender (female) and race-ethnicity (reference White). Private-school attendance is a dummy variable that combines attendance in Catholic and other private schools (reference public schools). Tenth-grade enrollment is used as a proxy for the size of the high school attended. Family SES is a variable provided in the ELS data set. It is a composite measure of three observed variables: family income, parents’ highest education level, and a prestige rating of parent’s occupation. I use two variables to denote the educational commitment and aspirations of a sample member’s friends. Number of friends dropped out of high school is a five-step categorical scale (1 = <italic>none</italic>, 5 = <italic>all</italic>). Number of friends planning to attend a 4-year college is also a five-step categorical scale (1 = <italic>none</italic>, 5 = <italic>all</italic>). The measure of opportunity to learn advanced mathematics is the total math units indicated in the student’s transcript. This variable is a sum of the units of trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus taken by the student by the end of the senior year. In some of the analyses that follow, I also use the math units earned, broken down by subject (e.g., trigonometry).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212442357">Table 2</xref> compares the means of the variables across school locations. The raw 10th- to 12th-grade math achievement gain is significantly smaller in rural high schools than in suburban schools. Interestingly, there is not a significant difference in the 10th-grade achievement status of rural compared to suburban schools. This suggests that the achievement differences in high school develop during the junior and senior years and are not carried over from earlier schooling. The means compared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212442357">Table 2</xref> also suggest significant differences between rural and suburban schools in their racial-ethnic composition, private-school attendance, school size, family SES, friends’ plans to attend a 4-year college, and total units of advanced math courses taken. In the regression analyses below, I will test the extent to which these differences explain the rural achievement gain deficit during the last 2 years of high school.</p>

<title>Methods of Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis will go forward in three phases. First, I will examine evidence for school-related (supply-side) sources of unequal opportunity to learn advanced math. This goal will be accomplished in three steps: First, I will consider the disparity between the average student’s advanced math units taken in the different geographic locations compared to the maximum number of units taken by a student in the school. A large disparity between these two measures will be inferred to indicate that the availability of advanced math units is not a constraint on the opportunity to learn. A second approach to investigating the supply of advanced math will be to look for evidence of constraints on advanced math course taking. This will be accomplished using survey regression models,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212442357">2</xref></sup> and the focus of the analysis will be to examine the comparative effects of family SES on course taking in the different school geographic locations. If family reputations play a greater role in course taking in rural schools than in suburban schools, this will show up in this analysis. The third supply-side consideration is instructional quality. The ELS data set does not provide direct measures of instructional quality; and, indeed, prior research does not provide strong evidence of what would constitute valid measures of instructional quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212442357">Ravitch, 2010</xref>). In the present study, the quality of instruction available in schools in different geographic locations will instead be inferred in the following manner. Separate regression models of math achievement gain will be estimated for each type of school location. The coefficients for the effect of one unit of an advanced math course will then be compared. This affords a head-to-head comparison of the efficiency of advanced math instruction (i.e., the gain in achievement associated with a one-unit increase in each math subject). If rural schools appear less efficient in this comparison, this may be taken as evidence of inferior quality of instruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764212442357">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second and third phases of my analysis assess the student-related (demand-side) factors that contribute to the opportunity to learn advanced math. The second phase makes use of survey regression to estimate a series of models that test the efficiency of my hypothesized student-related predictors of the math achievement gain. This accomplished, the third phase builds on the results of the second phase by specifying a path model that reveals the interrelations among the predictor variables and their relative effect sizes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the first phase of the analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212442357">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212442357">Table 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764212442357">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212442357">Figure 1</xref> shows the disparity by school location between the average units of advanced math and the maximum units taken per school. It is apparent that the disparity is nearly as large for rural schools as for schools in other locations. These results suggest that the availability of advanced math is not constrained in high schools generally nor in rural schools specifically. The average student could take more units of advanced math if motivated to do so, regardless of the school’s geographic location.</p>

<p>The ELS database does not allow a direct determination of whether counselors in rural high schools direct students to take advanced math courses using different criteria than those used in high schools in metropolitan locations. However, the results of the regression models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212442357">Table 3</xref> provide indirect evidence regarding this matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764212442357">4</xref></sup> The first column of coefficients (All Locations) reveals the effects of school location, 10th-grade math achievement, student demographic characteristics, private school, school size, family SES, and friends’ academic orientations on the total of advanced math units taken. These results show that net of other student characteristics, attendance at a rural high school is associated with an average deficit of nearly 0.1 credit of advanced math. Although this negative residual effect of rural high schools is not large, it is significant. Another factor is that 10th-grade math achievement is strongly associated with taking advanced math credits. As was surmised earlier, students’ preparation in math lays the groundwork for enrolling in advanced math classes.</p>
<p>Girls take slightly more units than boys, and minorities (except Native Americans and students of mixed ancestry) take more units than the average White student. Not surprisingly, students attending private schools take more advanced math units than students attending public schools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212442357">Hoffer, Greeley, &amp; Coleman, 1985</xref>). Family SES has a positive effect on the number of advanced math units. Friends also have a salient influence: A student who had friends that had dropped out of school took fewer units of advanced math, whereas a student whose friends planned to attend a 4-year college took more units.</p>
<p>A comparison of the other regression models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212442357">Table 3</xref> provides some clues to the source of the rural disparity in advanced math course taking. <italic>T</italic> tests were performed for differences in the coefficients obtained for each school location (reference suburban). No differences were found in the size of the urban coefficients compared to the suburban coefficients. However, there were some differences between the rural and suburban coefficients, but in other noteworthy instances, no differences were found. It is worth stating that no difference was found between rural and suburban schools regarding the influence of 10th-grade math achievement on advanced math course taking. This strongly suggests that students of equal ability will take the equivalent math units regardless of the geographic location of the school they attend. Rural schools do not appear to shortchange able students by restricting the supply of credits they may take. Another notable lack of difference between rural and suburban high schools concerns the effect of family SES on advanced math course taking. If the reputations of families in rural communities were a factor in math course placement, it should show up here, but it does not. The effect of family SES on the credits taken is slightly greater in rural high schools than in suburban ones, but this difference is not significant.</p>
<p>Where are the differences between rural and suburban high schools with regard to influences on advanced math course taking? In suburban high schools, girls take significantly more advanced math units than boys; in rural high schools, they do not. This finding could point to an important difference in rural and suburban schools that would help to account for the difference in achievement growth between the 10th and 12th grades. But it is not patent evidence that rural high school girls are steered away from taking advanced math courses by their teachers and school counselors. It seems just as likely that rural community norms operate here. The adult role opportunities of rural women do not require mathematics skills to the extent that is found in metropolitan areas. This, at least, is a hypothetical explanation for this unanticipated but important finding.</p>
<p>In suburban high schools, the size of the student body is associated with significantly fewer advanced math units taken; in rural high schools, the size of the student body is not a factor. This difference is probable evidence of more frequent use of math course tracking in suburban high schools than in rural ones. If this interpretation is correct, it lends further support to the comparative lack of supply-side constraints on the opportunity to learn in rural high schools. Last, in both suburban and rural high schools, friends who plan to attend college has a positive effect on advanced math credits, but this effect is significantly less strong in rural high schools. Again, I can only speculate on a possible explanation for this finding, and only future research may determine whether my hypothesis is correct. In rural high schools, friendship cliques may not be differentiated by value homophily in regard to preparing for educational attainment beyond high school to the same degree that they are in suburban high schools. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212442357">Reeves, Kindell, &amp; Felson, 2011</xref>) found that the disparity in median earnings between high school diploma recipients and the holders of baccalaureate degrees was $26,000 in suburban areas but only $14,000 in rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764212442357">5</xref></sup> Accordingly, the aspiration to attend college as a motivator to take advanced math courses may simply not be as salient an issue for rural high school students as it is for suburban students because of the remarkably smaller economic returns to the baccalaureate degree in rural areas.</p>
<p>The interpretations to be made of the evidence presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212442357">Table 3</xref> are several. First, well-prepared students are not disadvantaged by attending rural high schools, since they will take similar units of advanced math as students in metropolitan localities. Nor is there evidence that family reputations associated with socioeconomic factors exert a significant influence on math course taking in rural high schools compared to suburban high schools. The evident fact that students who attend rural high schools are slightly less exposed to advanced math topics than students in suburban schools is at least partly explained by rural girls taking fewer of these courses and the lessor influence of friends with plans to attend college. It is difficult to see how the latter in any way implicates the supply of advanced math units in rural high schools. The effect of gender, on the other hand, is not so easily disposed of. It could be that rural high schools do not encourage girls to enroll in advanced math courses as much as this occurs in suburban high schools. But if this is the case, it speaks as much to the economy and norms of rural communities as to counseling practices intrinsic to rural high schools. Furthermore, the effect of gender on course taking in rural high schools may reflect family and peer influences that were not investigated by this study.</p>
<p>The effect of instructional quality on math achievement can be assessed indirectly using separate survey regression models for each location. These regression models were specified with control variables for 10th-grade achievement, student demographics, private school attendance, school size, family SES, and friends’ educational engagement and aspirations. After specifying models to show the effects of the units taken in the subject areas of trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus, I estimated another model to determine the effect of the total units taken of advanced math. The results of these analyses are summarized by the bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764212442357">Figure 2</xref>. When measured in this indirect fashion, overall instructional quality actually appears to be a little better in rural schools than in other schools. Thus, the efficiency of rural high schools in producing math achievement from equal units of advanced math is equivalent to (if not slightly better than) the efficiency of high schools in other locations. Once again, there is no evidence for greater constraint on the supply side of the opportunity to learn in rural high schools.</p>
<p>The results of this first phase of the analysis point to the overall conclusion that school-related (supply-side) factors probably do not contribute to any sizeable degree to the differences in the opportunity to learn advanced math in rural versus nonrural high schools.</p>
<p>The results of the second phase of the analysis are presented in the five survey regression models displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764212442357">Table 4</xref>. In Model 1, we find that there is a significant rural gap in the growth of math achievement during the last 2 years of high school, when compared with the gain made in suburban schools, after controlling for 10th-grade achievement status. The size of the gap amounts to a little more than 0.1 standard deviation. The size of the rural gap in math achievement is very modest, therefore, but this finding should not deter us from attempting to understand its source. No comparable gap exists for urban schools.</p>

<p>Model 2 adds the effects of student demographic characteristics, private-school attendance, and school size. Although many of these variables are significant, their combined effect on the rural gap is rather slight. The rural gap is reduced 27% with the addition of these control variables, but it retains statistical significance. Clearly, the gap is not mainly attributable to these characteristics of students and the schools they attend.</p>
<p>In Model 3, we find that the addition of the opportunity-to-learn variable—total advanced math units taken—not only has a large effect on the math achievement gain, but it also accounts for more than two thirds of the residual rural gap and reduces the remaining gap to nonsignificance. Model 4 assesses the effects of family background and peer influence on math achievement net of the control variables. Family SES and the influence of friends are both very significant in this model. Moreover, these variables together reduce the rural gap to less than half its original magnitude, which now is also not significant. Finally, Model 5 adds the effect of opportunity to learn advanced math to the effects of family background and friends. In this instance, the size of the rural gap approaches zero. The sources of the rural gap are comprehensively accounted for by this final model. The interdependent changes in the coefficients produced by the regression models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764212442357">Table 4</xref> suggest that the predictor variables are interrelated. These interrelationships will be sorted out next.</p>

It is important to note that all of the coefficients shown in the path model have been conditioned by the control variables; thus, the coefficients are conservative estimates. A composite variable, derived from factor analysis and representing the effects of the two observed variables for the influence of friends, is used in this phase of the analysis to obtain a single coefficient.</p>

<p>The effect of rural location is negative, small in size, and entirely indirect. Rural location influences the math achievement gain because rural high school students are on average from lower-SES family backgrounds, have less academically motivated friends, and complete fewer units of advanced math. Moreover, recalling the results obtained from the first phase of the analysis above, the fewer units of advanced math taken by rural high school students appears to be influenced by the demand-side, motivational factors of lower family SES and less academically motivated friends rather than by the supply-side factors of math course availability, school tracking practices, and instructional quality.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764212442357">Table 5</xref> complements the causal path model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0002764212442357">Figure 3</xref> by presenting a decomposition of the total effect of each predictor variable into its direct and indirect effects. Here we observe that family background and friends have equivalent total effects on the math achievement gain. The total units of advanced math taken have the largest direct effect, nearly twice as large as the combined direct effects of family SES and friends. The sum of the direct effects of these three variables predicts nearly 0.5 standard deviation of the math achievement gain. Although this combined effect is large and noteworthy (especially so because the size of the coefficients are constrained by the presence of the control variables), ample unexplained variance persists. If the ELS data set had provided student grades for the advanced math units taken, a more sensitive and robust prediction of the dependent variable could have been realized. But we would not have learned anything more about the source of the rural math achievement gap. The available data were adequate for that task.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In keeping with most other studies, the present one has found a rural achievement gap at the end of high school among a recent national cohort of American students. Unlike other studies, this one has put this finding to a more rigorous test. First, I focused exclusively on math achievement, a domain of knowledge that is less likely to be influenced by nonschool factors, especially family factors. Second, I have used the gain in math achievement from the sophomore to the senior years as the test criterion, while controlling for 10th-grade achievement status. This restricts the focus to an achievement gap that develops within a span of 2 years, net of student achievement at the start of that period. This period of time is significant because it is during the junior and senior years that students are exposed to advanced math topics, if they are exposed at all. The opportunity to learn advanced math during this period of time is deemed crucial for the growth in math achievement during the last 2 years of high school. The present study gives strong support to this contention.</p>
<p>No rural gap appears in the 10th-grade achievement status. This supports the conclusion that the rural gap that develops during the junior and senior years is attributable to the lesser opportunity to learn advanced math topics and not to deficiencies that have accumulated during prior years. Student demographics, private-school attendance, and school size account for only a small part of the 10th- to 12th-grade rural gap. I further attempted to determine the source of the learning opportunity gap. The supply-side factors of advanced math course availability, track assignment according to student’s family background, and instructional quality—factors that pertain directly to school resources and practices—were the first to be examined. The results showed that resource and practice deficiencies of rural high schools do not appear to be a source of the opportunity to learn differences. Rural high schools do not offer their students less opportunity to take advanced math units than nonrural schools, and the inferred quality of advanced math instruction in rural high schools compares very favorably with that found in nonrural high schools. Moreover, placing students in tracks according to their SES backgrounds is not a significantly greater practice in rural high schools than in suburban and urban high schools, a finding that is supported by other studies.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast with the view that the major sources of the rural math gain gap are the result of differences in high school resources and practices, the evidence of this study strongly supports the contention that the sources of the gap lie instead in the influences of family and friends on the student motivation to take advanced math courses. Rural juniors and seniors are less inclined to take these courses, and the reason for this appears to derive from the characteristics of their families and friendship groups. Rural students come from lower-SES family backgrounds, a circumstance that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212442357">Breen and Goldthorpe (1997)</xref> associate with lower motivation to attempt difficult courses of study. Friends of rural students also have lower academic commitments and aspirations and, as a reference group, appear to sustain norms favoring a lower motivation to take advanced math courses.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It has been decades since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212442357">Coleman et al. (1966)</xref> stunned the U.S. educational establishment by demonstrating that most of the variation in student achievement could be attributed to factors that do not directly concern schools at all. Still, the drumbeat in education policy today is to see the problems of low academic performance as having their source in schools and, more specifically, in the presumed poor quality of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212442357">Ravitch, 2010</xref>). The present study addresses these very large issues in a very restricted manner. My results have nothing to say about the overall quality of American high schools and high school math instruction or even the eminence of advanced mathematics learning in the United States when compared with that in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764212442357">6</xref></sup> However, on the more limited topic of the source of a U.S. rural gap in math achievement that arises during the last 2 years of high school, my study reaches conclusions that harmonize with those of the earlier Coleman report. The main source of the rural gap appears to be external to the resources and practices of the school proper. It lies in the influence of families and close peers on student motivation to take advantage of the learning opportunities that rural high schools provide. This study also yields insight into certain aspects of the geographic structuring of inequality in American society, a topic that has been stressed in recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212442357">Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212442357">Lobao et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The survey regression procedure, implemented in Stata 11, uses the jackknife method to correct the standard errors resulting from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) nonrandom sampling design. The ELS sampling design entailed a two-stage methodology of randomly sampling schools and then randomly sampling students within schools. If corrections for this two-stage design are not made, then regression analysis using the sample will underestimate the size of the standard errors by approximately one half.</p>

<p>A recent cross-national study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212442357">Hanushek, Peterson, and Woessmann (2010)</xref> reveals striking deficiencies in advanced mathematics learning in American high schools. The United States trails other industrialized countries in bringing its students up to the highest levels of accomplishment in mathematics. The authors demonstrate that the deficiencies are because some states’ high performance is being offset by the low performance of other states. Nor are these deficiencies the result of immigrant or disadvantaged or minority students’ hiding the good performance of better-prepared students.

And, according to this report, only a small proportion of the children of the college-educated population is equipped to compete with students in the majority of the other industrialized countries.</p>
