<abstract>
<p>The Hippocratic dictum states that war is the best school for surgeons. A perfect exemplar of this is the life of Sir Harold Gillies, who pioneered the techniques of plastic surgery and, in particular, the pedicle flap during World War I. His work and tutelage not only encouraged an entire cadre of future surgeons but also played a vital role in the recovery, both mental and physical, of a great number of patients. His legacy of meticulous planning and preparation stands firm today.</p>

<p>Few clinicians can lay claim to creating an entire specialty. Sir Harold Gillies’ pioneering work during the Great War, 1914–1918, however, did exactly that. His development of advanced surgical techniques and the creation of modern plastic surgery have provided the springboard for the major evolution in the management of reconstructive surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611428115"><title>The origin of plastic surgery</title>
<p>The Indian surgeon, Susruta, first described the use of the pedicle flap around the year 600 BC. Wallace recalls how Susruta described ‘<italic>the process of affixing an artificial nose. First the leaf of a creeper, long and broad enough to fully cover the whole of the severed or clipped off part, should be gathered; and a patch of living flesh, equal in dimension to the preceding leaf should be sliced (from down upward) from the region of the cheek’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611428115">Wallace, 1978</xref>). At that time, it was not uncommon for the noses of unfaithful wives to be severed by their spurned husbands. The first known written account was in 1794 and believed to be the work of Colley Lyon Lucas, a British Army Staff Surgeon working in Madras. Between 1440 and 1937, the procedure was a closely guarded family secret, being performed by generations of the same family near Delhi. The details of the procedure were so secretive that daughters-in-law were permitted to assist with the operation but daughters were not, in the fear that they may take the secret outside the family. Patients were operated on in the sitting position in order to reduce the risk of blood loss and a handkerchief was used as a tourniquet around the neck to congest the forehead veins so that they could be used within the flap.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Italian surgeons took up the task of managing victims of syphilis and feuds. A father and son, by the name of Branca, from Sicily, were renowned for their rhinoplasty procedures. Gaspare Tagliacozzi, a celebrated Bolognese surgeon, went on to reconstruct nasal defects from forearm skin, allowing the skin flap to grow into place over the nose socket. Tagliacozzi’s text on the subject became recognised as a masterpiece of surgical literature.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until World War I, 1914–1918, that the development of the tubular pedicle came into clinical practise and changed the face of reconstructive surgery. One of the pioneers of the tubular pedicle flap and the father of modern Plastic Surgery, was Sir Harold D Gillies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408611428115"><title>Antecedent and early life</title>
<p>The Gillies family originated from Rothesay, Isle of Bute. Gillie’s paternal grandfather, John, made the decision to emigrate with his family to Otago Province, New Zealand in 1852. John’s eldest son, Robert, worked on the land and forged a successful career with Charles H Street. He later married his business partner’s daughter, Emily and they had 8 children together. Harold Delf, their youngest son was born in June 1882. Robert Gillies became a well-respected member of the community and later served in the New Zealand Parliament, although ill health forced him to relinquish his post after only one term of office.</p>
<p>Following his father’s premature death in 1886, Gillies’ mother moved the family to Auckland in order that her elder sons could enter the prestigious Wanganui College. Gillies’ childhood was a happy one; he thrived on outdoor pursuits, and demonstrated his craftsmanship skills, being an accomplished wood carver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611428115">Brain, 1993</xref>). In future years, he took up art as a respite from his studies. Harold was sent to preparatory school at Lindley Lodge, near Rugby, England in 1890. He later returned to attend his brothers’ alma mater, Wanganui College, where he excelled on the sports field, particularly in cricket. At one stage he was considered one of the most promising young players in New Zealand. However, despite an outwardly idyllic childhood, it remained a source of great regret that he had hardly known his father.</p>
<p>He left New Zealand, for England once again in 1901 and followed in the footsteps of two of his brothers by studying at Cambridge. He gained a chapel scholarship at Gonville and Caius College where he read medicine. During his time at Cambridge, and despite his weight being described as <italic>‘a misfortune’ (New Zealand Herald, April 2, 1904)</italic>, he was a member of the successful Cambridge crew in the annual Boat Race. Gillies came in for particular praise, with the <italic>Morning Post</italic> announcing that he <italic>‘came out of the ordeal splendidly, to the utter rout of his detractors’.</italic> He excelled not only in rowing but also gained a Blue in golf and went on to play for England in a number of competitions.</p>
<p>In 1906, he qualified from St Bartholomew’s Hospital. After graduation, he was determined to carve out a career in surgery, eventually deciding on Otolaryngology. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) in 1910, and in the same year was awarded the Luther Holden Research Scholarship at Bart’s. He was well liked and respected by his seniors. George E Gask, assistant surgeon at Bart’s describing him as <italic>‘the best house surgeon we have had at St Bartholomew’s for some years’.</italic> His supervisor, head of Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgery at Bart’s, Douglas Harmer, was even more glowing in his praise: <italic>‘He has a thorough knowledge of general surgery and is a competent bacteriologist. He intends to devote himself entirely to the study of diseases of the throat, nose and ear. I think there is every reason to believe that he will attain to a high position in his profession’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611428115">Pound, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>He was recruited by Sir Milsom Rees to be his assistant in private practice. Working with Sir Milsom, laryngologist to Their Majesties and the Royal Household, opened many doors to Gillies. It was during this period, that despite earlier protestations that he would never marry a nurse, Gillies married Kathleen Jackson, with whom he had a long and happy marriage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408611428115"><title>World War I</title>
<p>At the age of 32, with the Great War having broken out Gillies volunteered his services to the Red Cross. After waiting some months, he was eventually summoned at the end of January 1915 to Hoogstadt, near Furnes to work as a general surgeon. It was whilst in France that Gillies had what could be described as a seminal event in his life. It was a meeting with Charles Auguste Valadier, born of French and American descent, who had a grounding in both medicine and dentistry despite having no formal qualifications. Valadier was pioneering the treatment of jaw wounds, having established the 83rd General Hospital in Wimereux. The fashionable Valadier was a colourful character, always immaculately turned out in his highly polished and ornate uniform. Furthermore, throughout the War he travelled around the Front in his chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. He was, however, only permitted to operate under the supervision of a qualified clinician; a role Gillies was happy to accept. It was through this relationship that Gillies’ fascination with facial surgery began.</p>
<p>Gillies felt this was the turning point in his career. He also studied the work of the German surgeon, Lindemann, who had recently written extensively on the subject. He also endeavoured to visit Hippolyte Morestin, the most celebrated facial surgeon in Europe. Gillies later noted that during his early wartime experiences both sides seemed content for each other to learn from their operative experiences.</p>
<p>These experiences enthused and energised Gillies. By the end of 1915 he had convinced the higher echelons of the Army Medical Services (AMS) of the need to have an establishment devoted entirely to the demands of facial casualties resulting from conflict. Consequently, on the 11th January 1916, Gillies was requested to report to the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot. The War Office order stated that this was <italic>‘for special duty in connection with Plastic Surgery’.</italic> He made efforts to persuade the War Office that they should distribute special facial injury tags to the front in order that patients could be directed back to the Cambridge Military Hospital. When the medical staff seemed disinterested in his request, he went to the Strand in search of a stationer’s shop. There he purchased £10 worth of labels, which having addressed to himself, care of the hospital, he handed to the War Office to be distributed to the field hospitals in France. Gillies was greatly surprised when this simple intervention proved successful and the first patients began appearing at Aldershot with the labels attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611428115">Bamji, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst waiting for the unit at Aldershot to be fully equipped and up and running, Harold Gillies went with a French Ordre de Service to study <italic>‘the methods of plastic surgery’</italic> with the French Army’s specialist units at Boulogne, Etaples, Amiens, and Paris. At this time, most surgeons felt totally ill equipped to deal with major facial trauma. The commonest approach was simple apposition the wound edges in the hope that nature would be sympathetic. Occasionally the effects were miraculous, more often than not, they were not. The advancement flap closed defects but failed to replace lost tissue and cellular destruction often occurred. Furthermore, the rapidity with which men were returned to their units, often markedly disfigured, had a devastating effect on the morale of the fighting component. As a result of his studies Gillies insisted that <italic>‘the replacement must be as nearly as possible in terms of the tissues lost – bone for bone, cartilage for cartilage, skin for skin.’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611428115">Pound, 1963</xref>) This was the cornerstone of facial reconstructive surgery, which was to define Gillies practice in the years to come.</p>
<p>Gillies considered the work of the Plastic surgeon as artistic in nature. He recruited Henry Tonks FRCS who, despite his surgical qualifications had been deemed not to possess the requisite temperament to be surgeon, had become an assistant teacher at The Slade School of Fine Arts in London. At the age of more than 50 he accepted a Commission as a Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps and set about working in the orderly room of the Cambridge Military Hospital. In addition, Gillies, drawing on his knowledge of Valadier’s work on jaw injuries, for a dental surgeon to be seconded to Aldershot.</p>
<p>The next great hurdle for Harold Gillies and his team was the matter of anaesthesia<italic>.</italic> Fry had already identified the dangers of lying a patient flat and thereby occluding the airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611428115">Bamji, 2006</xref>). In the first few years of the Great War, major procedures were carried out with ether or chloroform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611428115">Matthews, 1979</xref>). The first major advance was brought about by Captain Rubens Wade who, having worked extremely closely with Gillies, pioneered anaesthesia in the sitting position in order to maintain the patency of the patient’s airway. Later, when the unit had relocated to Sidcup, Ivan Magill, of forceps fame, developed the practice of full endotracheal anaesthesia.</p>
<p>By 1916, Gillies and the team working at Aldershot had a steady flow of patients. The main burden was burns patients from the Battle of Jutland and the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps. However, by July, Colonel Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, the Army’s Director of Surgery, had forewarned Gillies to expect far greater demands on his service as a consequence of the offensive planned for the Somme. As a direct result of these planned operations, Sir William allocated Gillies a further two hundred beds at the Aldershot unit. Gillies did not, however, foresee what was to come and was shocked by the 2000 injured servicemen who needed his help in just 10 days of July 1916.</p>
<p>The Hippocratic dictum that war is the best school for surgeons was underlined by the momentum that the casualties from the Somme gave to the field of plastic surgery. Clinicians’ skills in performing flaps became paramount. The necessity to restore function and form were vital; tissue conservation was the watchword.</p>
<p>The nature of the injuries presenting to Aldershot required novel solutions. A prime example of this was the use of the rotational flap. This involved reopening the original wound and enlarging it so that it could receive a flap or flaps of skin from an adjacent region. The technique relied upon using the existing blood supply to the flap, to ensure its viability when closing the defect. One of the first cases involving this was that of Corporal Smith. He had sustained a gunshot wound to his mandible and lower lip. The bony injury was fixed with a satisfactory result. However, the lip remained grossly disfigured<italic>.</italic> Utilising the technique of the rotational flap, Gillies sought to repair the defect and the patient’s lip without the tension that had been so previously disfiguring<italic>.</italic> Just over a week after the procedure, Arbuthnot Lane paid an official visit to the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot. He was keen to inspect <italic>‘this new-fangled plastic surgery’.</italic> As an eminent clinician of the day and his immediate superior, Gillies was extremely keen to impress Arbuthnot Lane. He showed him the pre-operative photography of Corporal Smith and proudly revealed the reconstructed mandible and jaw to the Colonel. To Gillies abject horror, the Colonel extracted a small drop of pus from the scar, revealing an underlying stitch abscess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611428115">Bamji, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611428115">Pound, 1963</xref>).

<p>Sir William was, however, delighted with the work of the unit at Aldershot. He fought hard to secure adequate accommodation for the patients to recover. Eventually, the British Red Cross and Order of St John facilitated the purchase of Frognal, an estate belonging to Lord Sidney, at Sidcup, Kent. This was to become The Queen’s Hospital, Sidcup. The new facilities at The Queen’s Hospital far exceeded those previously held at Aldershot. Arbuthnot Lane was keen to develop The Queen’s Hospital into an institution of world renown. He wrote to Gillies in the autumn of 1917 saying that <italic>‘I want to make Sidcup the biggest and most important hospital for jaws and plastic work in the world and you consequently a leader in this form of surgery.’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611428115">Pound, 1963</xref>). Gillies took up the challenge with great gusto and Sidcup rapidly became the centre of excellence for facial plastics and reconstructive surgery. Surgeons from not only the British Empire but also the United States came to study at the hand of Gillies. As a result of these attachments, plastics attained a stronghold in medical practice across the globe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408611428115"><title>The pedicle flap</title>
<p>On 3 October 1917, Gillies made a monumental discovery that was to shape the future of plastic surgery for the years to come. The patient concerned was Able-seaman Vicarage. He had been extensively burnt in a cordite explosion during the Battle of Jutland whilst serving on HMS Malaya. He had lost his eyelids and lips and Gillies described it as the worst case of burns that Sidcup had encountered. As usual Gillies had planned the operation meticulously. He proposed to excise the skin on Vicarage’s chest to a depth of a quarter of an inch. This tissue would be used as a rotational flap, thereby maintaining its blood supply. The tissue would be used to cover the face, with apertures excised for the mouth and eyes. The blood supply to the flap would be enhanced by taking two pedicles, two inches in width, raised from the shoulders. It was in the formation of these pedicle flaps that Gillies made his groundbreaking discovery. He noted that the pedicles had a tendency to curl inwards. Gillies hypothesised <italic>‘If I stitch the edges of those flaps together, might I not create a tube of living tissue which would increase the blood supply to grafts, close them to infection, and be far less liable to contract or degenerate as the older methods were?’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611428115">Pound, 1963</xref>). This was the birth of the tubed pedicle flap. Vicarage’s recovery was startling; within 2 weeks the operation had been successfully completed. Rapidly the tubed pedicle revolutionised the practice at Sidcup.

<p>The advantage of the tubed pedicle flap over the open pedicle flap was that it negated the need for frequent dressings due to the exudate and reduced the risk of infection developing within the flap. Furthermore, the tubular nature of the pedicle reduced the occurrence of thrombosis and prevented the shrinkage and contracture of the flap. In regards to the aesthetics, the flap viability, and the positive outcomes of reconstructive surgery, this was a significant step forwards.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to Gillies, a year earlier, in 1916, Vladamire Petrovich Filatov, an ophthalmic surgeon at the Novorossiisk Eye Clinic, Odessa, Ukraine, had raised the first human tubed pedicle flap. He had perfected the technique on rabbit specimens and concluded that, as the hair grew back, it must have an adequate blood supply. On 9 September 1916, Filatov used the technique to reconstruct the eyelid of a 62-year-old gentleman with a recurrent malignant tumour. Filatov also made the observation that a long tube pedicle could be initiated as two tubes with a skin bridge between the two. It could subsequently be converted into one large tube for the transfer of tissue. Furthermore, he realised that the tubed pedicle could be moved using an intermediate attachment. In addition, Hugo Ganzer, a German Surgeon, used the same technique in 1917 with a patient with a palatal defect. It was only after these procedures that Gillies first performed his new found technique. The fact that Gillies name is routinely associated with the tubed pedicle flap, is in part due to the fact that Filatov’s work, published in Russia was not commonly read at that time; perhaps more importantly, however, it was because of Gillies pioneering development of the technique over the subsequent years. Compared with Ganzer and Filatov who performed the technique less than 10 times between them, Gillies used the pedicle flap on a regular basis, estimating that he used it at least two to three times weekly during the height of the casualty surge at Sidcup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611428115">Brain, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611428115">Wallace, 1978</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408611428115"><title>Career post World War I</title>
<p>The end of hostilities led to a period of change at Sidcup. Clinicians from Allied Nations returned home, many setting up their own units. At about the same time, Gillies was joined by Thomas Pomfret Kilner, who had no previous experience of Plastic Surgery. However, he took to his role as Gillies’ assistant with a great deal of success. During this time, the two men went into Private Practice together. Following the breakdown of this partnership, in somewhat acrimonious fashion, in the 1930s, Kilner and Gillies set up their own private practices within the same building. The rift between the two would continue until after World War II.</p>
<p>Gillies’ contribution to Surgery was recognised in 1930, when he was knighted. In 1931, Gillies was joined in his work by Archibald McIndoe, his cousin. McIndoe, a fellow New Zealander, had initially moved to the United Kingdom from Minnesota, in order to take up an appointment at St Bartholomew’s Hospital. Despite his excellent credentials, he was unsuccessful in his application and, left without employment, he approached Gillies who was able to assist. In future years, McIndoe would be knighted in his own right for his extensive work with the Guinea Pig Club of injured Royal Air Force pilots. Gillies and McIndoe were also joined in practice by Rainsford Mowlem, previously a General Surgeon. At the outbreak of World War II these three, along with Pomfret Kilner remained the only four Plastic Surgeons in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>At the onset of World War II, Gillies retained his position as Consultant to the Army, Royal Navy, and Ministry of Health. He was also instrumental in ensuring that McIndoe took responsibility for the Royal Air Force, position that was to lead to his subsequent fame. Throughout the war, Gillies played a vital role in the management and structuring of the surgical facilities of the Services, along with the selection and training of future surgeons.</p>
<p>Following the end of the War, Gillies remained in Basingstoke, where he had been prior to World War II. He continued to pioneer developments in surgical techniques, including the first female to male gender reassignment operation on Laura Dillon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611428115">Bamji, 2006</xref>). He became an entertaining speaker at conferences and travelled extensively to discuss his techniques and experiences in plastic surgery. After the death of his first wife, in 1957, he married his Surgical Assistant, Marjorie Clayton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611428115">Nagus, 1966</xref>). Gillies continued with Private Practice until his death in 1960, at the age of 78, from arterial disease contributed to by years of heavy smoking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408611428115"><title>Legacy</title>
<p>Since Gillies’ death, there have continued to be great advancements in plastic surgical techniques. The role of the tubed pedicle flap has reduced in favour. The increased use of more technically advanced flaps has allowed even more dramatic reconstructions to be performed, leading to improved function and quality of life for patients. However, despite all these advancements perhaps the most important principle Gillies demonstrated to his successors is the need for meticulous precision in both planning and executing procedures in order to maximise the results for patients.</p>
