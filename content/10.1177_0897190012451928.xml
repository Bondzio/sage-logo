<title>Background</title>
<p>Ideological and religious diversity can sometimes be a cumbersome issue in today’s society, especially when it interferes with the traditional medical management of patients. Jehovah’s Witness patients remain at the front line of this growing dilemma since human blood transfusions and blood products are not options in lifesaving measures in this patient population. Medical science and religious conviction frequently clash concerning acute anemia, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).</p>
<p>AIHA is characterized by the production of antibodies directed against one’s own red blood cells (RBCs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451928">1</xref>
</sup> AIHA is a fairly uncommon disorder, with an estimated incidence of 2.6 cases per 100 000 per year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451928">1</xref>
</sup> Cases of AIHA are classified according to the characteristic temperature reactivity of the RBC autoantibody as warm, cold agglutinin syndrome, mixed-type, and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. AIHA mediated by warm-reactive autoantibodies accounts for approximately 70% of all cases, where antibodies react optimally with human RBCs at 37°C.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451928">2</xref>
</sup> AIHA can be further subdivided into 2 categories, primary and secondary, based upon etiology. Primary or idiopathic AIHA displays no association with an underlying disease; while secondary causes are linked to disease states such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), infections, and primary immunodeficiencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451928">3</xref>
</sup> Some drugs may also cause secondary AIHA, with penicillin, cephalosporin, and methyldopa as some of the most common culprits. The clinical diagnosis of AIHA is based upon the presence of various factors such as low haptoglobin (serum protein which binds hemoglobin), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated indirect bilirubin, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451928">3</xref>
</sup> In adults, the disease is usually chronic and has a variable manifestation period that can span from months to years after the time of diagnosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451928">2</xref>
</sup> The clinical syndrome of AIHA may become life threatening when the patient is no longer able to maintain adequate oxygenation because of declining hemoglobin levels.</p>
<p>The traditional management of patients with AIHA is aimed at either reducing the amount of antibody being produced or reducing the body’s efficiency in destruction of the RBCs. The approach to treatment depends on the severity of the hemolysis, with corticosteroids serving as first-line agents. Approximately 80% of patients achieve a response with corticosteroids as sole therapy within 3 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451928">4</xref>
</sup> Patients without satisfactory response to corticosteroids may require a splenectomy and/or transfusion of RBCs to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. Other second-line immunotherapy and immunosuppressive modalities include intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and cyclosporine A.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451928">4</xref>
</sup> If hemoglobin levels continue to decline to critical values before an induced response with the aforementioned therapies, practitioners may use more aggressive medical management, such as concomitant therapies and/or blood substitutes.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 2 major classes of blood substitutes in clinical development, the hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and the perfluorocarbon emulsions (limited in clinical practice).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451928">5</xref>
</sup> Hemopure, a polymerized bovine form of HBOC is the only nonhuman-derived oxygen carrying agent. It is well documented in improving tissue oxygenation in animal models and human trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451928">6</xref>
</sup> Hemopure has the same oxygen carrying ability as whole blood and facilitates diffusive oxygen delivery, primarily by shortening diffusion distances between RBCs. It has a molecular structure similar to that of human hemoglobin and offers better perfusion in ischemic tissue, since it has a lower concentration of organic acids attached.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451928">7</xref>
</sup> The normal dose for patients with hemoglobin of less than 6 g/dL is 32.5 g (1 unit of Hemopure), followed by additional units as necessary to raise the hemoglobin above 6 g/dL. Hemopure has demonstrated its use as a viable alternative to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions to increase plasma hemoglobin levels and prevent marked ischemia. In a randomized trial conducted in orthopedic surgical patients given a single unit of Hemopure or PRBC as a first transfusion, Hemopure raised plasma hemoglobin levels an average of 0.63 g/dL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451928">8</xref>
</sup> Comparably, patients infused with a single unit of PRBC had an average increase in hemoglobin concentrations of 0.87 g/dL.</p>
<p>Hemopure is currently only approved in South Africa for the treatment of surgical anemia in adults.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012451928">9</xref>
</sup> In the United States, clinical trials have been previously stagnated over safety concerns that the product increased patients risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure, methemoglobinemia, hepatotoxicity, and death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012451928">10</xref>
</sup> In lieu of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted Hemopure to investigational drug status, permitting treatment under 21 Code of Federal Regulations for emergency or compassionate use only. Procurement of Hemopure is based on individual request from treating physician/physicians by the drug manufacturer, OPK Biotech LLC (Cambridge, Massachusetts). If deemed appropriate, Biotech will then notify the FDA and seek a single patient investigational new drug consent. The FDA is the final regulatory agency that grants approval and permits the release and delivery of the product to the treating physician/physicians. To date, the FDA has granted more than 50 emergency compassionate use protocols for Hemopure in critical situations of profound anemia.<sup>

<title>Patient Case</title>
<p>A 19-year-old female Jehovah’s Witness patient presented to the emergency department (ED) secondary to several episodes of dizziness and syncope. The patient had no previous significant medical history, and her physical examination was normal. Upon presentation to the ED, she was found to have a hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, with objective signs of hemolysis including elevated direct bilirubin and LDH. The patient was then admitted for further workup, with hemoglobin levels declining to 5.0 g/dL 24 hours later. RBC transfusions were not an option for medical management, as the patient and her parents emphatically refused for religious reasons. The diagnosis of AIHA was made after a positive Coombs test and further hematology workup showed warm reactive antibodies.</p>
<p>Following the last hemoglobin reading, the patient was started on 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone intravenously daily and consent was obtained to give 400 mg/kg of intravenous immune globulin (a human derived product) daily for 3 total doses. Two days postadmission and 1 day after the start of medical management, the patient’s hemoglobin declined even further to 3.5 g/dL. She became tachycardic with heart rates between 120 and 130 beats/min. The team of clinicians’ perceived the patient’s risk for bleeding outweighed the benefits of a total splenectomy, therefore, it was decided to pursue a partial splenic artery embolization to combat the declining hemoglobin levels. She was also started on 10 000 units of epoetin alfa subcutaneously every other day, to enhance the production of RBCs. Four days postadmission, hemoglobin levels fell to a nadir of 2.8 g/dL, and she showed signs of ischemia including marked abdominal pain and altered mental status.</p>
<p>Six days after her initial presentation to the ED, traditional medical management did not induce a sustained response as shown by her signs and symptoms and more aggressive management was deemed warranted. She was abruptly transferred to the medical intensive care unit (ICU), started on 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of rituximab intravenously once weekly, and a decision was made to ask the FDA for compassionate of approval of Hemopure. The FDA granted permission to use the medication, and she was infused with a total of 2 units (65 grams) of Hemopure at a rate of 0.25 g/min over 4 hours. She tolerated the infusion well without any signs of immediate adverse reaction. Following the infusion, she continued on 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone intravenously daily and 10 000 units of epoetin alfa 3 days a week. On day 7, her hemoglobin climbed to 4.5 g/dL, and by day 9 it was up to 5.7 g/dL. The patient was transferred out of the ICU and was back to her baseline mental status. Her hemoglobin climbed to a high of 8.7 g/dL and she was able to perform daily activities without decompensation. She was discharged to an outpatient hematology clinic for follow-up and continued the infusion of rituximab for a total of 4 doses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190012451928">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of Hemopure in this patient case was considered justified due to the rapidly declining hemoglobin levels that manifested into marked ischemia throughout her body and the patient’s refusal of blood products based upon religious beliefs. Most guidelines recommend transfusion with RBCs when hemoglobin levels are less than 6 g/dL, since untreated patients have an increased chance of developing ischemia, multiorgan failure, and death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012451928">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012451928"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012451928">15</xref>
</sup> This was not an option in this case.</p>
<p>Efficient and timely administration of Hemopure has been shown to decrease mortality in patients with a low hemoglobin (&lt;8 g/dL).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012451928">11</xref>
</sup> Six days elapsed before Hemopure was initiated in this patient. However, her therapy was coupled with multiple other pharmacologic strategies (eg, corticosteroids, intravenous immune globulin, and rituximab). During rapid declines in hemoglobin levels an aggressive treatment approach is warranted, including quick progression to subsequent treatment options. For example, intravenous immune globulin was followed by rituximab, initiated 4 days later. It is important to note that practice patterns differ concerning coadministration of these agents. Some clinicians separate doses by at least a week, while others have given intravenous immune globulin concomitantly with rituximab with no separation in the 2 medications. This concomitant administration is most well documented in solid organ transplantation and does not appear to influence immunosuppression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012451928">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The patient in this case displayed no immediate signs of the previously mentioned adverse events (AEs) attributable to Hemopure while in the hospital. No additional AEs were noted, as the patient was monitored for 3 months posthospital discharge in an outpatient hematology clinic. The safety of Hemopure has been well described in a case series by Mackenzie et al, with the 3 most frequent AEs observed being an increase in blood pressure, modest increase in liver enzymes, and the development of methemoglobinemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012451928">10</xref>
</sup> However, further analysis revealed that these AEs were more prevalent in patients with advanced age and multiple comorbidities. This may explain why none of the aforementioned AEs were noted in this patient case.</p>
<p>Currently, there is but one previously published case of improved outcomes from Hemopure infusion in a patient with refractory AIHA, by Mullon and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451928">7</xref>
</sup> In this case report, health care practitioners were able to sustain a non-Jehovah’s Witness patient without immediate or long-term evidence of ischemic injury, by initiating conventional management strategies including blood products as well as infusing a total of 11 units of Hemopure. The patient care team exhausted most of the previously mentioned conventional therapies and the patient’s hemoglobin continued to decline to critical levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190012451928">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This unique case is the only demonstration of the effective use of Hemopure in a Jehovah’s Witness patient with a primary diagnosis of AIHA. The patient previously refused all RBC transfusions due to religious beliefs with a hemoglobin nadir of 2.8 g/dL, before Hemopure was initiated. Hemopure was used as a “bridging treatment” and appeared to help save a patient from the devastating effects of ischemia resulting from severe anemia. As illustrated in this case, Hemopure may represent a lifesaving intervention in a subgroup of patients with severe symptomatic or refractory anemia who seek alternative management to human RBC products because of religious or ideological beliefs.</p>
