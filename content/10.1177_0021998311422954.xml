<abstract>
<p>Nanocomposite materials were prepared via glycerol plasticized soy protein as the matrix and in situ fabricated silica as thereinforcing phase. The silica nanoparticles were synthesized in the protein environment by sodium silicate as a precursor. The resulting composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile tests, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results revealed that silica particles were homogeneously dispersed in soy protein matrix at a nanometer scale with low silica addition (lower than 15%). Silica particles exhibited a high adhesion with protein matrix through hydrogen bonding and confined the motions of soy protein segments. The incorporation of silica as a reinforcing agent significantly improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of soy protein plastics.</p>

<p>Proteins are one of the three essential macromolecules inthe biological systems and could be easily isolated from natural systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311422954">1</xref></sup> The developments of nonfood applications of plant proteins are receiving tremendous amount of effort now for the growth of environmental concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311422954">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311422954">8</xref></sup> Soy proteins are mainly storage proteins like many other plant proteins and one of the most important resources with the lowest price among plant proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311422954">9</xref></sup> Research on soy protein plastics has begun inthe 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311422954">1</xref></sup> However, pure soy protein is a poor choice as the replacement of common plastics. It is difficult to process for the high modulus and the brittle and rigid nature without plasticizer addition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311422954">1</xref></sup> Glycerol was the most commonly used plasticizer for soy protein. The plasticizing effect of glycerol on the microstructure and properties of soy protein plastics has been intensively studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311422954">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311422954">11</xref></sup> Other plasticizers, such as hydroxylamine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311422954">12</xref></sup> amides,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311422954">13</xref></sup> sorghum wax, sorbitol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311422954">14</xref></sup> etc. were also used tofabricate thermoplastic soy protein. Mechanical properties are considered the most important of all theproperties in plastics. The incorporation of nanofillers promotes a more effective pathway to improve the overall mechanical properties of polymers over direct modifications of their molecular composition, due to the strong interfacial interactions and restriction of macromolecular mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311422954">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311422954">16</xref></sup> For this purpose, different fillers were incorporated in soy protein plastics to improve their performance, such as natural polymer-based nanocrystals or whiskers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311422954">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311422954">18</xref></sup> clays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311422954">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311422954">19</xref></sup> inorganic fillers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311422954">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311422954">21</xref></sup> plant fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311422954">22</xref></sup> and so on.</p>
<p>Silica has been used in polymeric compounds as an effective reinforcing agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311422954">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311422954">24</xref></sup> Much effort has been made to fabricate polymer/silica nanocomposites by insitu synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311422954">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311422954">26</xref></sup> However, the fabrication of silica particles in soy protein matrix has not been reported. With this aim, soy protein/silica composites were prepared through in situ fabrication and the structure and properties of the glycerol plasticized soy protein/silica nanocomposite plastics was studied. The effects of silica on mechanical performance and thermal stability were particularly investigated.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311422954"><title>Experimental part</title>
<p><bold>Materials.</bold> Pristine soy protein isolate (SPI) with a protein content of 90.38% was purchased from DuPont-Yunmeng Protein Technology Co. Ltd (Yunmeng, China). Sodium silicate nonahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrochloric acid, acetone, and glycerol were all of analytical grade and purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Co. (Shanghai, China).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311422954"><title>Preparation of soy protein/silica nanocomposites and plastics</title>
<p>The silica nanoparticles were prepared by adapting the precious published procedure with a little modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311422954">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311422954">28</xref></sup> Firstly, desired amount of sodium silicate was dissolved in 200 mL distilled water at ambient temperature with stirring. A total of 10 g SPI was added into the clear NaSiO<sub>3</sub> solution and mechanically stirred for 1 h to obtain an emulsion. The pH of the emulsion was adjusted with 2 N HCl solution to 6.5 ± 0.1 detected using a digital pH analyzer (Lida, pHS-25, China). The mixture was left under mild stirring at 30°C for 3 h. After the reaction, 250 mL acetone was added into the resultant emulsion to precipitate the SPI/silica complex. The complex was separated by centrifuging with a speed of 9,000 rpm at 25°C for 15 min, and then the resultant precipitate powder was washed by acetone for three times. Subsequently, the resulting SPI/silica composites were vacuum-dried for 24 h to obtain a yellow nanocomposite powder.</p>
<p>The nanocomposite powders with an addition of 33.3 wt% glycerol (the content of glycerol on total mass of sample) as plasticizer were mixed in a high-speed mixer for 15 min, and then were extruded with a single-screw extruder (PolyDrive with Rheomex R252, ThermoHaake, Germany) with diameter 19.1 mm and length: diameter of 25:1. The screw rotation speed was 40 rpm, and the temperature profile along the extruder barrel was 90, 110, and 120°C (from feed zone to exit). Subsequently, the extrudates were compression-molded at 140°C for 10 min under a pressure of 20 MPa. The plastics were conditioned in a desiccator with P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> as desiccant for 1 week at room temperature before characterization.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311422954"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the nanocomposite powders were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer (Nicolet, USA) in a range of 4000 to 400 cm<sup>−1</sup> using a KBr-pellet method with a resolution of 4 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was performed on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, USA) equipped with a Cu K<italic>α</italic> radiation source (<italic>λ</italic> = 0.154 nm). The diffraction data were collected from 2<italic>θ</italic> = 3–60° with a step interval of 0.02° with a scan rate of 4°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to investigate the morphology of the nanocomposite films. The films were frozen and fractured in liquid nitrogen. The fractured surfaces were sputtered with gold and observed on an SEM (S-570, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan) using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (Model Q800, TA Instruments, DE, USA) in tensile mode. Samples were first equilibrated at –100°C for 1 min, and then scanned from –100°C to 180°C at a heating rate of 5°C min<sup>−1</sup>. The measurements were performed in isochronal conditions at a frequency of 1 Hz. The setup measures the storage tensile modulus <italic>E</italic>′ and theloss modulus <italic>E</italic>′′. The ratio between the two components, loss angle tangent, tan <italic>δ</italic> = <italic>E</italic>′/<italic>E</italic>′′, was also determined. The temperature of the peak of the tan <italic>δ</italic> curve (<italic>T</italic><sub>tan</sub><italic><sub>δ</sub></italic>) was defined as the glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) of the samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the SPI/silica nanocomposite plastics was investigated on a STA 499 C instrument (NETZSCH Co., Germany) under a nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C min<sup>−1</sup>. The tensile strength (<italic>σ</italic><sub>b</sub>), elongation at break (<italic>ε</italic><sub>b</sub>), and Young’s modulus (<italic>E</italic>) of the sheets were measured on a universal testing machine (CMT6503, Shenzhen SANS Test Machine Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China) with a tensile rate of 5 mm min<sup>−1</sup> according to ISO527-3:1995 (E). Five parallel measurements were carried out for each sample.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311422954"><title>FTIR spectroscopy</title>
<p>The FTIR spectra for the soy protein/silica nanocomposite powders are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311422954">Figure 1</xref>. For pure soy protein, the band at 3298.8 cm<sup>−1</sup> was the amide A band of protein attributed to the hydrogen-bonded N-H stretching. The weak shoulder at a higher wave number may be attributed to the O-H stretch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311422954">29</xref></sup> or the ‘free’ N-H stretch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311422954">30</xref></sup> or both. The symmetrical bands centered about at 1659.8 cm<sup>−1</sup> were attributed to the amide І of soy protein ascribed to C = O stretching. The bands at 1531.3 and 1232.8 cm<sup>−1</sup> were the amide ІІ and III band resulting from N-H bending coupled with CN stretching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311422954">31</xref></sup> The spectrum of the soy protein/silica nanocomposites was characterized by the presence of the absorption bands typical of the pristine protein components. With addition of silica, the amide A and І bands moved to a lower wave number, while the amide ІІ and III band shifted to opposite direction. The changes in the characteristic bands in the spectrum suggested that hydrogen bonding was the underlying mechanism for the shift of absorption peaks.

<p>The bands assigned to Si-O-Si symmetric and asymmetric vibrations were reported to appear around 1092<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311422954">32</xref></sup> and 780 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and the Si-O stretching vibration band at 450 cm<sup>−1</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311422954">33</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311422954">35</xref></sup> with the intensity roughly proportional to the silica content. The Si-O stretching vibration band exhibited a red-shift with an increase of silica content in the nanocomposites. Usually, the forming of hydrogen bonds result in a red-shift of the stretching bands but a blue shift of bending bands. In view of the obvious change of the protein amide absorbance and the Si-O stretching peak, it was believed that the hydrogen bonding existed in the SPI/silica nanocomposites and the hydrogen bonding sites may be the oxygen atoms on the SiO<sub>2</sub> and the hydrogen atoms in the peptide bonds.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311422954">Figure 2</xref> shows the WAXD spectra of glycerol plasticized soy protein nanocomposites. Pristine soy protein plastics exhibited two characteristic bump peaks centered at about 9.8 and 19°, suggesting the mainly amorphous state of soy protein. With addition of 5% silica, the intensity and the width at half-maximum intensity of the two peaks decreased. However, the changes of these peaks were not obvious with further increase of silica. The silica particles in all the composites exhibited an amorphous state without any characteristic diffraction peak.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311422954"><title>Morphology</title>
<p>Unfilled protein film exhibited a smooth surface as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311422954">Figure 3(a)</xref>. Addition of 5 wt% silica into the protein matrix led to a coarse surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311422954">Figure 3(b)</xref>), indicating a strong interaction between the filler andmatrix. With the increase of silica contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311422954">Figure3(c)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311422954">d</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311422954">e</xref>)), the composites exhibited increasing concentrations of silica on the fractured surface. Nanosizied silica particles from several to hundreds of nanometers had a uniform distribution in the protein matrix especially for silica content below 15 wt%. It is worth noting that with a low silica content (not higher than 15 wt%), the silica had a strong adhesion with protein matrix and most silica particles were embedded into the matrix. However, with a high silica loading, more and more fillers floated on the fractured surface with little parts of the fillers embedded in the matrix. Moreover, there were also some larger particles present on the fracture surface. It led to a visible decreaseof elongation at break and a brittle property of the composites with higher silica contents, as discussed afterward.

At low temperatures, no obvious difference wasobserved for the storage modulus. For polymers at their glassy state, the modulus could be considered to be dependent of the matrix and independent of the fillers. In this state, molecular motions of soy protein were largely restricted to vibration and short-range rotational motions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311422954">36</xref></sup> leading to a high modulus and the silica couldhardly be appreciated as reinforcing filler in this temperature range.

<p>The relaxation magnitude at <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> increases while that at <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> decreases gradually with the increase of silica content. The intensity indicates the mobility of polymer chains inthe systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311422954">2</xref></sup> and mainly depends on the magnitude of the modulus drop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311422954">37</xref></sup> The effect of silica loading on the peak intensity of loss angle tangent associated with the <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation (<italic>I<sub>α</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>I<sub>α</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>) mainly involved: the decrease of relaxing entities (soy protein and glycerol) participating in the relaxation process and the concomitant lowering of the modulus drop due to the reduced molecular mobility of the confined the motions of soy protein segments with the increase of silica content [38], which all led to the decrease of <italic>I<sub>α</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>I<sub>α</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>. However, I should notice that glycerol was added to the samples with a proportion of 33 wt% compared with the mass of the total samples (soy protein and silica). With the increase of silica, the ratio of glycerol to protein may increase. Therefore it may lead to an increase of mobility of polymer chains and the intensity of loss angle tangent associated with the <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation. It seems that silica may have a larger confinement on the protein-rich domain. Therefore, the latter phenomenon had a greater effect on <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> relaxation and the former phenomenon was predominant in the <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation.</p>
<p>For SPI/silica nanocomposites, the two-step storage modulus drop was remarkably reduced, especially for temperatures higher than <italic>T<sub>α</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>. A pronounced increase in storage modulus of composites was found with theincrease of silica content. For example, it could be observed from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311422954">Table 1</xref> that the modulus of samples with 15% silica (27.7 MPa) was 5 times higher than that of the pristine films without silica (5.9 MPa) at 150°C, while it was only about 2 times at 50°C. The nanosized silica particles exhibited significantly reinforcing effect on glycerol plasticized soy protein plastics. The interactions between soy protein and silica could restrict the molecular motions of protein macromolecules, resulting in the enhancement of storage modulus of the nanocomposite plastics.</p></sec>

<p>The mechanical behavior of glycerol-plasticized soy protein was analyzed at room temperature and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311422954">Figure5</xref> shows the tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young’s modulus as a function of silica content.

<p>Unfilled soy protein plastics exhibited elastic behavior with a high elongation at break. The tensile strength increased quickly at a low strain and showed a neck tendency. The neck did not propagate continuously but producing horizontal stripes along the necked region perpendicular to the direction of the stress. There was not obvious strain hardening before the failure of the sample. The stress then increased gently with the strain until the break of the film. Addition of silica decreases the necking tendency. Plastics with 20% silica exhibit a fragile behavior. The lack of necking phenomenon may be attributed to the homogeneous nature of composites at a scale of a few hundred nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311422954">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elongation at break decreases with the increase of silica content as expected. With silica content less than15%, the diminution seemed to be linear. However, the negative effect on strain appeared to plateau at higher silica concentrations (more than 15%). The tensile strength enhanced with the increase of silica. The Young’s modulus exhibited a more pronounced increase. The modulus increased almost linear to 508.43 MPa with 15% silica content from 285.31 MPa for unfilled glycerol plasticized soy protein. The modulus values were far lower than those obtained by DMA tests. It should be the result of that the DMA tests only apply weak stress on samples and the adhesion between filler and matrix was not involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998311422954">40</xref></sup></p></sec>

<p>TGA is used to characterize the decomposition and thermal stability of materials and to examine the kinetics of the physicochemical processes occurring in the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311422954">41</xref></sup> The weight loss traces and their differential curves as a function of temperature are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311422954">Figure 7</xref>. Silica was thermally stable in the testing temperature range. The weight loss between room temperature and 120°C was attributed to the water absorbed in soy protein plastics. The weight loss in the temperature range of 120–280°C was mainly related to the evaporation of glycerol. When the temperature was higher than 280°C, soy protein degraded.

<p>The area under a DTG curve is proportional to the mass change and the height of the peak at any temperature gives the rate of mass change at that temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021998311422954">42</xref></sup> With addition of silica, the area under the DTG curves and the peak height for the two processes (glycerol release and protein degradation) both weakened. Silica could form hydrogen bonds with soy protein matrix and confine the segment motion, which could enhance the thermal stability of the resulted nanocomposites. For glycerol release temperature, the weight loss and the rate decreased due to the hydrogen bonds formed between silica and the matrix. For protein degradation temperature range, the decrease of weight loss and the velocity was partly attributed to the reduction of protein content with addition of silica, besides the effect of hydrogen bonds between protein and silica.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0021998311422954" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Nanocomposites were developed by in situ fabricating silica in soy protein isolate matrix with glycerol as plasticizer. The silica was synthesized in the protein environment by sodium silicate as a precursor. The structures and properties of the resulting nanocomposites strongly depended on the content of silica. Silica particles had a uniform distribution in the protein matrix. The glass transition temperatures associated with glycerol-rich and protein-rich domains were observed to increase with addition of silica, indicating that silica restricted molecular motions of soy protein molecules due to the strong hydrogen bond interaction between them. The two-step storage tensile modulus drop was remarkably reduced with addition of silica. Elongation at break decreased with the increase of silica while the tensile strength enhanced. The Young’s modulus exhibited a more pronounced increase. Temperatures at the maximum rate of weight loss determined by the peak of theDTG curves corresponding to glycerol release and protein degradation were largely enhanced by adding silica. The mass change and the rate of mass change at the two peak temperature also weakened. All the results revealed that silica particles acted as effective reinforcing filler and improved the mechanical and thermal properties significantly.</p></sec>
