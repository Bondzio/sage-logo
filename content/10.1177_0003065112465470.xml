<p>Psychoanalytic concepts can at times offer an intriguing account of personality, even in the imaginary universe of the novel. Introspection and observation of others were Freud’s main tools—as they remain the novelist’s. Throughout his life Freud maintained that a close relationship exists between literature and psychoanalysis; indeed, on one occasion he suggested that in the field of the unconscious the writer takes precedence over the analyst: “how hard it is for a psycho-analyst to discover anything new that has not been known before by some creative writer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112465470">Freud 1901</xref>, p. 205).In this essay I wish to present some psychoanalytic reflections on Michael Beard, the protagonist of <italic>Solar</italic>, an engrossing satirical novel by Ian McEwan, in my opinion one of the world’s greatest living writers. The novel, which on the surface focuses on the search for a source of solar energy to save mankind, reveals the integuments of one man’s conscious and unconscious processes—manic defenses, an inability to mourn or love, parricidal and filicidal wishes, castration anxiety, fear of death—all illustrating the kind of complex dynamics we come upon and explore in our work.</p>
<p>In each section I will present a summary of the relevant part of the novel, analyze Beard’s character traits from a psychoanalytic perspective, and then offer a concise theoretical discussion of the psychoanalytic concepts I have used.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003065112465470">
<title>Michael’s Mother: The Inability to Love</title>
<p>The protagonist of <italic>Solar</italic> is Michael Beard, a bald, overweight, unprepossessing scientist in his late fifties, whose best work is apparently behind him. He won a Nobel Prize for work he accomplished a long time ago, and since then has been trading on his reputation, lecturing for enormous fees, lending his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions, and halfheartedly heading a government-backed initiative to tackle global warming. For two decades he has done no serious work, instead expending his energies on his hectic love life—dozens of affairs and five marriages, none of which, to his relief, resulted in a child. Beard thinks nothing of his own cheating, but is outraged when he learns that his current wife, the beautiful Patrice, is having an affair.</p>
<p>I wish first to examine Beard’s relationship with his mother, which McEwan only briefly describes. In the last section of the novel we learn that Beard’s mother bottle-fed him with passion, and that he “came top in the Cold Norton and District Baby Competition, birth-to-six-month class.” In those harsh post–World War II years, the author informs us, the ideals of infant beauty resided chiefly in fat: “Babies were exhibited like prize marrows” (p. 265).</p>
<p>When little Michael was about five years old, his mother, Angela, began a series of love affairs that spanned eleven years. She confesses this to him on her deathbed when he is seventeen. Only after he arrives home, drinks three nightcaps with his father, lies on his bed fully dressed, and considers what she has told him does he grasp the extent of her “achievement”—seventeen lovers in eleven years. In one concise sentence McEwan explains to us the unconscious reason for her promiscuous behavior: “Without [these lovers], she would have hated herself and gone mad” (p. 269).</p>
<p>I suggest that Angela Beard’s series of affairs was a manic defense against the threat of depression and fragmentation. Angela had no anchor in her life. Early in marriage she withdrew her love from her husband, and with the termination of her symbiotic relationship with her baby, and having no ability to sublimate, the isolation and meaninglessness of her life came to threaten her sanity. Angela used promiscuity to flee depression and fragmentation, trying in this way to save her precarious psychic existence.</p>
<p>Michael has grown up with a depressed mother threatened by psychosis, which affected his psychic makeup. The ravenously hungry adult craving food and alcohol whom we encounter in the book conceals the baby craving his mother’s milk. Behind the suave seducer hides the pitifully helpless child searching for his mother’s love and devotion, condemned to an eternal search for the woman he will never possess.</p>
<p>Beard, unable to sustain a love relationship, is always on the go. Although he searches for women different from his mother, his repetition compulsion has him eliciting from them responses characteristic of his relationship with his defective mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065112465470">Lipin 1963</xref>). Thus, Beard is trapped in a reactive type of object choice that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112465470">Bergmann (1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112465470">1980</xref>) calls “counter-selection,” in which a state of conflict arises between the efforts of the ego to find an object different from the primary one and the coercive forces of the repetition compulsion. In this situation, the individual clings to the counter-selected object for safety, but seeks gratification with another one. This explains why Beard would cling so desperately to a woman, but at the same time would always be driven to seek new relationships.</p>
<p>Beard, who probably suffered from a problematic separation from his disturbed mother in the various subphases of separation-individuation, counter-selects his objects, with the unconscious expectation that love will heal the deficiency. Thus, he is always on the run for “the erstwhile ‘good’ symbiotic mother”; unfortunately for him, however, over time this image becomes the “potentially re-engulfing ‘mother after separation’” from whom he must escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003065112465470">Mahler 1971</xref>, p. 416).</p>
<p>Feeling unworthy of being loved, Beard is in constant need of social approval and narcissistic reinforcement. He invests great effort in catering to different types of audiences, especially to businesspeople, from whom he wishes to elicit admiration and financial support. As was the case with his mother, his series of wives and love affairs, which reflect his inability to have a permanent love relationship, are a defense against a life of isolation and meaninglessness. As Beard’s immature self is incapable of transforming idealization into gratitude, he is never able to journey from the stage of falling in love to that of enduring love.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112465470">Bergmann (1971)</xref> maintains that the capacity to love presupposes a normally symbiotic experience and a separation-individuation phase. Bergmann’s concept of “counter-selection” (1980) is based on Mahler’s concepts (1971; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003065112465470">Mahler, Pine, and Bergman 1975</xref>) of “sub-phases of separation-individuation” and particularly “sub-phase inadequacy.” Failure in any of the separation-individuation subphases might, in the future, transform a new love object into an object from whom one seeks liberation, with each new object sought only as an escape from the clutches of the old.</p>
<p>In contrast to Freud’s view of love as a process of “refinding” (the refinding of a person), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112465470">Bergmann (1980)</xref> suggests that love is a refinding of a lost ego state. From this perspective, Beard has spent his entire life looking for a state he is never able to refind.</p>
<p>Basing himself on Abraham’s developmental approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112465470">1924</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112465470">Kernberg (1974a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003065112465470">b</xref>) maintains that the capacity for mature love is the result of a progressive series of integrations. Abraham’s concept of postambivalent love and Kernberg’s concept of mature love have much in common; both theories hold that only those who have mature object relationships can experience love.</p>
<p>The interesting relationship between the mourning incurred in growth and separation and the capacity to fall and remain in love has been explored in the psychoanalytic literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112465470">Bak (1973)</xref> stresses the relationship between being in love and mourning, stating that being in love is an emotional state based on the separation of mother and child, and directed toward overcoming this, as well as future separations and losses involving important objects. In my view, the inability to love is influenced by the inability to mourn separation from the mother, as I have shown in a case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112465470">Kogan 1995</xref>). Later I will discuss Beard’s inability to mourn in a more general context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0003065112465470">
<title>Michael’s Father</title>
<p>In the last section of the book we get a glimpse of Beard’s father: “Henry Beard was a lean sort, with drooping moustache and slicked-back brown hair, whose dark suits and brown tweeds seemed a cut too large, especially around the neck. He provided for his miniature family well and, in the fashion of the time, loved his son sternly and with little physical contact” (p. 266).</p>
<p>McEwan informs us that Beard’s father was a man marked by war: “He had had a long war, serving as a junior officer in the infantry in Dunkirk, North Africa, Sicily and then, as a lieutenant colonel, in the D-Day landings, where he won a medal. He had arrived at the concentration camp of Belsen a week after it was liberated, and was stationed in Berlin for eight months after the war ended. Like many men of his generation he did not speak about his experiences . . .” (p. 267).</p>
<p>Beard’s father, like many British and American soldiers exposed to the horrifying sights of death and destruction in the concentration camps after their liberation, was most probably traumatized by what he had seen. Back in the U.K., he had had to adapt to life and normality without working through his traumatization. McEwan describes Henry Beard living a life of tranquility as a small-town solicitor. “At week-ends he mostly cared for his roses, or his car, or golf with fellow Rotarians. He stolidly accepted his loveless marriage as the price he must pay for his gains” (pp. 267–268).</p>
<p>To me Henry Beard’s tranquil life seems more like the tranquility of death. He gives the impression of a man who is going through the motions of life, but is partly dead. As a result of his traumatization, Henry Beard appears to be fixated in an interminable mourning, and to suffer from a masked depression. Consequently, he is unable to love either his wife or his son. The father’s lack of desire for life is expressed in his son’s rejection of a future by not wanting to become a parent himself and not wanting to have children of his own.</p>
<p>Since Michael’s father had little libidinal investment in his wife, and was constantly depressed, he could not serve as a male role model for his son. As a result, Michael could not give up his oedipal longing for his mother and identify with his father. Thus, Michael remained fixated in his oedipal conflict, wishing to erase his father and always searching for a mother.</p>

<title>Filicide</title>
<p>Having made the momentous discovery of the unconscious oedipus complex, and having revealed the incestuous and parricidal child in all of us, classical psychoanalysis has largely neglected the counterpart of this theme—the incestuous and filicidal impulses and fantasies of the parent. Contemporary psychoanalysts (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003065112465470">Raskovsky 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003065112465470">Raskovsky and Raskovsky 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003065112465470">Rangell 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112465470">Anthony 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003065112465470">Ross 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065112465470">Colarusso 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003065112465470">Moore and Fine 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112465470">Kramer 1995</xref>) offer views of the oedipal situation that show the intricate interaction between hostility toward the parents and aggression toward the child.</p>
<p>I suggest that Michael Beard transfers his unconscious wish to erase his absent, “dead” father to his “professional son,” Tom Aldous, a young physicist at the government research center where Beard works. One of Beard’s ponytailed post-docs, Aldous is working on solar energy—particularly, artificial photosynthesis—to solve the problem of global warming. Totally unaware of his competition with Beard in the realm of science, Aldous is convinced that by using Beard’s Conflation Theory (which McEwan wisely does not attempt to explain) he can devise a way of producing cheap, unlimited solar power. Aldous works with all the passion and brilliance that Beard himself has lost. At this point in time, Beard, fifty-three years old and decades beyond winning his Nobel Prize, has settled into the routine life of a scientific administrator. He can barely feign interest in the work of the Center for Renewable Energy, of which he is the nominal head. He channels all of his own energy into the de- bacle of his fifth marriage, with his wife Patrice openly having an affair in retaliation for Beard’s continual womanizing. Michael is outraged when he learns of her affair with a thuggish contractor named Rodney Tarpin. Patrice, as it turns out, has another lover as well.</p>
<p>One day Beard returns home from a trip to the Arctic to find Aldous sprawled on his sofa in a dressing gown. Although Aldous admits to an affair with Patrice, he tries to defend himself by attempting to persuade Beard to be “sensible” about the situation, arguing that they should put aside the pettiness of romantic rivalry in the interests of science. He suggests that they become partners in the search for a renewable source of energy. Aldous’s plea falls on deaf ears. Beard is too vain to accept his offer. Then a freak accident occurs: Aldous, running toward Beard to beg his forgiveness, slips on the polar bear rug in the sitting room, hits his head on the edge of a glass table, and is suddenly lying there, a pool of blood gathering under his head.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to help Aldous by performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (McEwan informs us that all scientists master this technique during their work in the lab), or by calling an ambulance or the police, Beard tries to make the scene look as if Aldous has been murdered by Tarpin. He takes some of Tarpin’s belongings, which had been left in the basement, and scatters them around the room, intending at once both to incriminate Tarpin and to save himself the bother of explaining to the police the unbelievable truth about the accident.</p>
<p>We learn about Tarpin’s trial, and Patrice’s reaction to the loss of her young lover: “She was in deep mourning for what she now believed was the love of her life” (p. 138). Patrice is convinced that Tarpin has killed her new lover: “The case against Tarpin was bad enough, but it was Patrice, also appearing for the prosecution, who sank him. . . . She mesmerized court and country with her account of Tarpin’s possessiveness and brutality, his jealous rages. He was an obsessive, she said, a deranged fantasist who had urged her to kill Aldous in his sleep if she ever saw the chance. . . .” And here we get a glimpse of McEwan’s humor: “Her most quoted, celebrated remark [to the press] must have been practiced in front of the mirror: ‘When he killed my Tommy, the nation lost a genius,’ she said. And I lost the only man I ever loved” (pp. 140–141).</p>
<p>Very quickly, Tarpin is off to jail, and we leap five years ahead to 2005, where we find Beard busy setting up a business that will supposedly make electricity out of sunlight. Upon Aldous’s death, Beard receives his notes on artificial photosynthesis from the Center, but pays little attention to them. It is only after Tarpin’s trial, when Beard examines the notes more thoroughly, that he realizes that Aldous’s proposal to deal with climate change by using artificial photosynthesis—harnessing sunlight to split water and yield hydrogen and oxygen, which could be used to drive fuel cells and provide cheap, clean electricity—might hold promise.</p>
<p>Beard sees this as a great opportunity. By applying this theory he can save the earth, as well as his flagging career (and bank account). He thus becomes a clean-energy messiah, addressing conference halls full of skeptical businesspeople, whom he transforms into devoted followers. Although the breakthrough technology is based on Aldous’s work, Beard gives the deceased young man no credit for it. In addition to considerable monetary gain, Beard wants sole recognition for the achievement; he wants the world to think that he, Michael Beard, Nobel Prize winner, is the omnipotent savior who will rescue the world from environmental disaster.</p>
<p>From the psychoanalytic perspective, I believe that lurking beneath Beard’s ambitions and his self-deception in stealing Aldous’s work is the unconscious wish to kill his student. Aldous, like Oedipus, broke the taboo of incest by having sex with Beard’s wife (on an unconscious level, Patrice, the mentor’s wife, is Aldous’s mother). Aldous’s incestuous behavior may have revived Beard’s own oedipal conflict, arousing the middle-aged, deteriorating professor’s hatred of Aldous and his desire to kill him. In this case, the filicidal desire may be the counterpart of Beard’s parricidal wish, which stems from his unresolved oedipal conflict.</p>
<p>Beard finds no reason to share his fame and glory with the man whose work he has stolen, especially as the man had hurt his pride. He justifies his intellectual theft by saying, “For what could precedence or originality mean to the dead?” (p. 259). Thus, Beard not only kills Aldous by not trying to save his life, but also steals his phallus (his intellectual prowess), claiming it for his own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003065112465470">
<title>Castration Anxiety and Fear of Death</title>
<p>Beard’s castration anxiety is vividly described at the beginning of the book, in a scene in which his penis freezes to his snowsuit during an al fresco micturition in the Arctic. This scene has such a concrete quality that it seems almost convincing: “When [after urinating] he put it away, his unfortunate cock was as hard as ice, but no longer white. It was also stinging, an excruciating hot-needle pain that slowed his efforts to get dressed. . . . As he raised a leg to hoist himself onto his place behind the guide, he felt, and even thought he heard, a terrible rending pain in his groin, a cracking and a parting, like a birth, like a glacier calving. He gave a shout . . .” (pp. 83–84).</p>
<p>Although the reader might be aware of the author’s dark humor, Beard’s fantasies leave no doubt that he has experienced a calamity: “The burning sensation in his groin was spreading, his cock had slipped round and was nestling under the crook of his knee, and they were speeding in the wrong direction, hurtling northwards towards the Pole, deeper into the wilderness, into the frozen dark, when they should have been rushing towards a well-lit emergency room in Longyearbyen. Surely, the intense cold would work to his advantage, keeping the organ alive. But microsurgery? In Longyearbyen, population fifteen hundred?” (p. 84).</p>
<p>Some time later, at the guest house, when Beard takes off his polar outfit, he hears a deep, pleasant female voice behind him calmly saying, “This just dropped from the bottom of your trousers.” We are then informed that what dropped out of Beard’s trousers was not his penis, but his lip salve. The calamity did indeed take place, but only in Beard’s fantasy. I believe that this fantasy stemmed from his castration anxiety, which originated in his fear of punishment for unconscious incestuous wishes.</p>
<p>Beard’s fear of death is present in the book from the start, though it is more prominent in the later chapters. Now older, he is afflicted with all sorts of physical ailments: “his weight, his heart which he thought beat too irregularly these days, giddiness when he stood up, pains in his knees, his kidneys, his chest, the smothering tiredness which was always on, or near him, a red blotch on the back of his hand that some months ago had turned purplish, the tinnitus that he could hear now, an airy, rushing sound which never left him, the pins and needle sensation in his left hand, also constant. He felt his symptoms as crimes. He should see a doctor and make a full confession. But he did not want to hear himself condemned” (pp. 256–257).</p>
<p>The reader becomes apprehensive about Beard’s future: Is he doomed to die of a stroke, a heart attack, or melanoma? Constantly faced with the threat of death, Beard reverts to his manic defenses and completely denies the reality of aging and decay.</p>
<p>I have reviewed the topic of the fear of death in the introduction to another case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003065112465470">Kogan 2010</xref>) so will only briefly summarize the relevant literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065112465470">Freud (1914)</xref> postulates that the narcissistic wound caused by our mortality is at the core of the tendency to avoid facing death. I find this view relevant to Beard, whose inflated narcissism allows neither the decline nor the decay accompanying the finitude of life. In Erikson’s terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065112465470">1959</xref>), Beard’s unconscious fear of death and his manic defenses show his lack of ego integration and the despair evoked in him by death (p. 98).</p>
<p>Freud was aware that fear of the inevitable end surely exists, though it is mostly denied. In his writings he searches for the origins of this phenomenon: in “The Ego and the Id” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065112465470">1923</xref>, p. 58) and “Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety” (1926, p. 130), he claims that fear of death <italic>(Todesangst)</italic> may have its origins in fear of castration, as well as in fear of losing the love object. With regard to the latter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065112465470">Freud (1926)</xref> suggests that the fundamental origin of fear of death lies in one of the earliest stages of human development. He states that anxiety, in general, is basically connected to the infant’s sense of helplessness occasioned by re- alization of the mother’s absence should she be lost to sight, and the fear that she might never return. It is an inborn fear that includes the fear of death. This helplessness is a wound to the primary narcissism of the dawning ego structure.</p>
<p>Freud argues that castration becomes imaginable through the daily experience of parting with the contents of the bowel and through the loss of the mother’s breast that is experienced in weaning; but nothing similar to death has ever been experienced, and if it has, like fainting, it has left no demonstrable trace. He therefore maintains that castration anxiety is the primary fear and considers it analogous to the fear of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065112465470">Freud 1926</xref>).</p>
<p>Viewed through a Kohutian lens, Beard is unable to cognitively acknowledge his mortality because he is unable to achieve a progressive self-definition by accepting his limitations. Similarly, Beard is unable to achieve wisdom, a “cosmic narcissism” that transcends individual narcissism and results in a calm acceptance of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065112465470">Kohut 1966</xref>, pp. 265–266).</p>

<sec id="section5-0003065112465470">
<title>The Inability to Mourn and Manic Defenses</title>
<p>One of Beard’s main character traits, prominent through all phases of his life, is his inability to mourn, to be emotionally aware of the pain evoked by his passage from one stage of life to another. He is fixated in an absence of conscious grieving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112465470">Bowlby 1980</xref>), a state of pathological mourning.</p>
<p>What is mourning? I have reviewed this concept in my <italic>The Struggle against Mourning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112465470">2007b</xref>). Mourning was first defined as a process occurring in reaction to loss of an object. The work of mourning thus includes a massive psychic effort to recover a link with reality and to detach oneself from the persecutory aspects of the lost object by assimilating its positive and kindly aspects. Viewing it from this perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065112465470">Burch (1989)</xref> regards mourning as “a kind of final act of love” (p. 622). Having examined the mourning process for nearly two decades, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003065112465470">Pollock (1978)</xref> arrived at a more nuanced conclusion, namely, that the mourning process is not linked absolutely to object loss. Instead, it is “a universal adaptational series of intrapsychic operations occurring in sequential successive stages involved in the reestablishment of a new level of internal and related external equilibrium” (p. 262). These operations are caused by different stages of change that occur throughout a person’s development and can be interpreted as threats to his or her integrity and self-identity, forcing the person to suffer deep, painful affects.</p>
<p>Like Pollock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065112465470">Grinberg (1992)</xref> maintains that mourning is not linked exclusively to object loss, but also to growth and to the passage from one stage of life to another. This process involves the loss of certain attitudes, ways of life, and relationships that, although replaced by other, more developed ones, nonetheless evoke pain and mourning. Living therefore necessarily requires that an individual go through a succession of mourning processes, which are not always successfully completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112465470">Kogan 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>Beard’s awareness of mourning is impeded by his depressive anxiety, pain, and “persecutory guilt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003065112465470">Grinberg 1964</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065112465470">1</xref></sup> He attempts to counteract these feelings, which could flood his ego, by reverting to manic defenses.</p>
<p>As I have noted, Beard is constantly persecuted by fear of death, which he tries to avoid by his perpetual flight from his love objects, by his gluttony, and by gratifying his narcissistic needs. These defenses help him deny his depressive anxiety and his feelings of hate, guilt, despair, and ambivalence. He uses manic defenses to escape from his chaotic, fragmented, and miserable self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112465470">Kogan 2007a</xref>), and it is only in rare moments that he realizes he will never actually be able to become more whole: “on the day he died he would be wearing unmatching socks, there would be unanswered e-mails, and in the hovel he called home there would still be shirts missing cuff buttons, a malfunctioning light in the hall, and unpaid bills, uncleared attics, dead flies, friends waiting for a reply and lovers he had not owned up to” (p. 311).</p>
<p>Beard uses manic defenses to flee his inner reality and to deny the limitations of age. He avoids pain by denying the decay that accompanies his aging body, by deceiving himself that he will never lose his youth, beauty, and creativity, which in reality are on the decline. He uses manic defenses to deny the powerful dependency needs he experiences in most of his relationships with women, as well as his vulnerability to loss and betrayal. Beard’s professional success is based on intellectual theft, and he wishes to hide his loss of creativity from himself and from the world. He avoids being in touch with his dejected feelings by transforming them into feelings of elation—in his role of saving mankind or seducing an endless series of women.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Struggle against Mourning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112465470">Kogan 2007b</xref>) I reviewed the literature on manic defenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065112465470">Freud (1917)</xref> points out that the ego uses these defenses to dominate object loss and to free itself from the accompanying suffering. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065112465470">Klein (1935)</xref> defines manic defense as a set of mental mechanisms aimed at protecting the ego from both depressive and paranoid anxieties. She describes manic defense essentially as the individual’s attempt to evade the intense pain and guilt in the early depressive position. The defense is really a collection of defenses involving a denial of psychic reality; a denigrating contempt for the objects that are loved, so that their loss will not be experienced as important; and a triumphant and omnipotent way of putting everything right. Thus, the ego “endeavours ceaselessly to master and control all its objects” (p. 277), thereby escaping dependency and potential loss. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003065112465470">Winnicott (1935)</xref> broadens the understanding of manic defense, emphasizing that it is intended to “deny the depressive anxiety that is inherent in emotional development, anxiety that belongs to the capacity of the individual to feel guilt, and also to acknowledge responsibility for instinctual experiences, and for the aggression in the fantasy that goes with individual experiences” (pp. 143–144). Winnicott’s important contribution is that he ascribes to manic defense the individual’s inability to give full significance to inner reality. It is an attempt to fly away from internal reality, especially if this reality includes depressive anxiety or mourning. In a situation where manic defense is used, mourning cannot be experienced.</p>
<p>I wish to add that Beard’s struggle against mourning has an adaptive aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112465470">Akhtar 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112465470">Kogan 2007b</xref>) that prevents him from drowning in the despair that often accompanies emotional awareness, and that helps him survive both physically and psychically. He pays a high price for his survival, however: it leaves him with a depleted, emotionally castrated self.</p>

<title>Finale</title>
<p>The novel’s third section is set in 2009, with Beard preparing for the opening of his photosynthesis plant in the New Mexico desert. A tsunami of calamities consequent on his psychopathic deeds descends on him, destroying all he has managed to build: his theft of intellectual property is discovered, and he is threatened with a lawsuit; his plant is damaged by Tarpin, who, now out of prison, takes revenge on him for the stupid reason that Beard refused his request for a job in the plant. McEwan summarizes these calamities in one exquisite sentence: “Beard’s past was often a mess, resembling a ripe, odorous cheese oozing into or over his present” (p. 358).</p>
<p>At the same time, Melissa, the mother of Beard’s little daughter, Catriona, arrives in New Mexico with her in tow. Apparently, she has learned that Beard has promised to marry his current girlfriend, Darlene, and she has come to claim Beard for herself. A meeting and a fight between the two women is unavoidable. Finally, both women and the little girl come into the restaurant where Beard is trapped, looking for him. Using his magic wand, the creator of the story transforms this moment of total loss into a moment of hope: “As Beard rose to greet [Catriona], he felt in his heart an unfamiliar, swelling sensation, but he doubted as he opened his arms to her that anyone would ever believe him now if he tried to pass it off as love” (p. 384). I believe that in this moment Beard gets a glimpse of the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>In <italic>Solar</italic>, McEwan tackles the theme of mourning and growth, as well as the fear of death, in a humorous and courageous way. By getting to know Beard and understanding him, we may indeed become aware of our own fears and limitations and our attempts to deny their existence. I have found a psychoanalytic examination of Beard’s personality an interesting challenge. His use of manic defenses to confront decline and decay, his inability to mourn and to remain in love, his wish to kill his “professional son,” his castration anxiety and fear of death, all resonate in the reader. In creating this protagonist, McEwan has given us the opportunity to be in touch with human frailties, which, alas, reside in us all.</p>

<p>This type of guilt, which includes anxiety and persecution caused by loss and frustration, appears in the most regressive states. Grinberg links “persecutory guilt” to the mechanism of the schizoid-paranoid phase, as described by Melanie Klein.</p>
