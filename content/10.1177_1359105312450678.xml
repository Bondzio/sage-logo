<p>I was pleased to have the opportunity to review a book on a topic that is so critical to health in contemporary society: trust in healthcare. It is my fundamental belief that this issue will dominate discussions and research on healthcare in this decade and likely for many decades to come. This volume will help to set the stage for those discussions and research. It represents work by individuals with expertise in political sociology, moral philosophy and the philosophy of psychiatry/psychology, clinical psychology and medical health policy. Certainly, it will help readers who are familiar with some or all of those disciplines to organize and crystallize their thoughts regarding trust in healthcare. The authors admit <italic>some</italic> limitations in their knowledge regarding the role of trust in healthcare as presented by political scientists, psychoanalysts, social psychologists, sociologists and philosophers. I would like to add <italic>health psychologists</italic> (broadly conceived) and <italic>developmental psychologists</italic> to that list in order to help readers to recognize constraints in the knowledge and information presented. In addition, the book focuses primarily, although not exclusively, on the healthcare system in the UK.</p>
<p>Critical to the book is the authors’ approach regarding trust that includes: (1) perspectives on trust; (2) levels of trust; and (3) depth and relational proximity of trust. The levels of trust category, in particular, comprise: psychological trust (trust in oneself); interpersonal and social level (trust in others); and the levels of systems and institutions. This is a useful way to conceptualize trust in healthcare but it rather unfortunately uses the term ‘psychological trust’ as one level. From a psychological perspective, trust in healthcare is ‘psychological’. It is recognized that social and political events affect how healthcare is provided and that, in turn affects, how much an individual trusts healthcare. Guided by this premise, when an individual (a potential patient) draws upon any healthcare service, his or her <italic>psychological</italic> trust (i.e. perspective on the trustworthiness of any healthcare person or organization) is a primary factor in determining healthcare interactions and health provision. From my perspective, it is important not to lose sight of that observation. Having stated this concern though, the book does draw our attention to the fact that an individual’s trust in healthcare is affected by a broad system of political, sociological and historical events which include current changes to the NHS in the UK.</p>
<p>One of the working assumptions of the book is that the individual’s trust in himself or herself shapes and defines their trust in healthcare: this proposition was based on the attachment theory that was developed by Bowlby (1979) and on other related psychoanalytic writings. Researchers have found that the quality of attachment during infancy is associated with, and longitudinally predicts, social relationships later in development (see the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312450678">Schneider et al., 2001</xref>). To my knowledge, researchers have not examined the relation between the quality of attachment during infancy and individuals’ later trust in healthcare. This proposition warrants empirical validation and thus must, at this point, represent an interesting speculation.</p>
<p>The book highlights some facets of trust that often go unnoticed. <italic>First</italic>, it highlights the point that trust in healthcare involves healthcare provider’s (e.g. physicians’, nurses’) trust in the patients as well as the patients’ trust in those healthcare providers and, consequently, represents dyadic or mutual interactions when contact is proximal. These propositions are compatible with more general interpersonal trust frameworks such as my own Basis, Domain and Target interpersonal trust framework (BDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312450678">Rotenberg, 2010</xref>) which has been applied to trust in healthcare providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312450678">Rotenberg et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Second</italic>, the book highlights the recurring dilemma regarding the conflict between patients’ trust in healthcare providers and the patients’ empowerment in healthcare. This dilemma includes the notion that a patient’s trust in their healthcare providers is necessary because they have expertise and skills required for effective treatment but that trust in healthcare providers places the patient at risk and undermines his or her empowerment in determining their healthcare. The authors review this issue historically, sociologically, politically, and ethically including the presentation of relevant case studies such as the Shipman Inquiry. It is worthwhile to point out that this issue has been empirically examined in health research such as the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312450678">Kraetschmer et al. (2004)</xref>. These researchers examined the relation between patients’ trust in physicians and preferred role in medical decision making. It was found that autonomous patients demonstrated relatively low levels of trust, passive patients were more likely to demonstrate blind trust, whereas shared patients demonstrated high but not excessive trust. The current book review cannot resolve the thorny question of the desirability of a given trusting orientation for high quality healthcare. Nevertheless, it is hoped that that line of inquiry and the discussions presented in this provocative book will encourage healthcare providers to give careful consideration to this dilemma for their practice.</p>
<p>This book must be applauded for addressing a controversial and vital topic. I would strongly encourage the authors, though, to broaden the scope of the material reviewed in future editions of their book. It should be extended to include the theory and research on trust in healthcare from the perspectives of an array of authors/researchers in the disciplines of social psychology, developmental psychology and health psychology.</p>
