<p>The hygrothermal effect on the flexural, interfacial and glass transition behaviors of 977-2A carbon/epoxy composites cured in an autoclave and by using Quickstep were evaluated in the previous paper. This article concerns with the hygrothermal effect on the mode I and mode II delamination resistance of the samples cured in an autoclave and by Quickstep. It was observed that the mean initiation and propagation G<sub>C</sub> values (i.e. G<sub>IC</sub> and G<sub>IIC</sub>) of both autoclave and Quickstep 60 cured specimens were apparently reduced after hygrothermal conditioning; however, the data obtained from both autoclave and Quickstep 60 cured specimens in dry and wet states were not statistically significant. The scanning electron micrograph confirmed the enhancement of matrix ductility; however, no effect of this matrix ductility was observed in the G<sub>IC</sub> and G<sub>IIC</sub> data.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684413486367" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymer matrix composites used in aerospace and other applications may be exposed to environments usually involving temperature and humidity. It is evident from the literature that both physical and mechanical properties of composites are strongly affected during hygrothermal conditioning, which eventually reduces the overall performance of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413486367">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413486367">2</xref></sup> The way in which composite materials absorb moisture depends upon certain factors such as temperature, fiber orientation, density and polarity of fiber, fiber volume fraction, diffusivity, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413486367">2</xref></sup> The most common moisture transport mechanism in polymeric composites is through diffusion which is explained by Adamson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413486367">3</xref></sup> Transport of moisture in epoxy composites below <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>, occurs in three stages. In the first stage, absorbed moisture occupies the free volume present in the form of ‘holes’ or voids. In the second stage, the absorbed moisture attacks the polymeric network sites resulted in the form of swelling and in the third stage, water finally enters the densely cross-linked region. The other common mechanisms are capillarity and transport through micro-cracks and voids. The last mechanism can be activated after material damage produced by water.</p>
<p>Effects of moisture can be observed in the fiber, resin and fiber–matrix interface. Most of the glass and carbon reinforcements are not susceptible to moisture absorption because of good hydrolytic stability. Aramid fibers are reported to be more vulnerable to moisture absorption and may absorb more moisture than the resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413486367">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In polymeric composites, the most exposed constituent to moisture is resin. Physical changes like plasticization and swelling and chemical changes like hydrolysis and chemical scission are usually severe and these can lead to significant reductions in strength and toughness properties. Plasticization is a well-documented phenomenon for thermosets and thermoplastic polymers and is found to be deleterious to a number of materials properties especially at elevated temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413486367">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The structural integrity and lifetime performance of polymeric composites are strongly dependent on the stability of fiber–matrix interfacial region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413486367">2</xref></sup> The fiber–matrix interface can be affected by moisture absorption, destroying the fiber bonding and providing space for the water to reside. Composite processing techniques can affect the hygrothermal behavior of composites because it is mainly a function of the resulting quality of the cured composites.</p>
<p>Delamination is a common damage mode of high performance composites, which can be particularly detrimental for structural behavior. This mode of failure depends not only upon the external loading conditions but also on the intrinsic properties of fiber and resin. It may also be introduced during processing or subsequent service conditions. In addition to these factors, the moisture and temperature may also induce the interlaminar stresses in the laminate. The environmental conditions considerably affect the mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness (critical strain energy release rate G<sub>IC</sub> (for mode I) and G<sub>IIC</sub> (for mode II)) of polymeric composites but, no general trend can be observed from the literature for carbon/epoxy composites.</p>
<p>No significant change on G<sub>IC</sub> was observed when graphite/epoxy specimens were subjected to hygrothermal conditioning of 70℃ and 50% RH for 98 days and a slight reduction in transverse fracture toughness was observed when the specimens were subjected to same condition for 62 days; however, a significant reduction in mode II delamination resistance of the specimens was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413486367">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413486367">7</xref></sup> Fischer and Arendts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413486367">8</xref></sup> reported the effect of temperature on mode I delamination resistance of carbon/epoxy composites and no significant change was observed until 80℃; however, a significant improvement in G<sub>IC</sub> was observed when the specimens were tested between 80℃ and 120℃. Zhao and Michael<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413486367">9</xref></sup> investigated the moisture effect on the mode II fracture toughness of two types of carbon/epoxy composites and observed different rate of reductions in G<sub>IIC</sub> for both types of specimens. Russell and Street<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413486367">10</xref></sup> found a reduction in G<sub>IC</sub> with the increase in temperature but the propagation values increased with increasing temperature. An opposite trend was observed by Davidson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413486367">11</xref></sup> where G<sub>IC</sub> increased with temperature and humidity. It is important to note that the increase in the strain energy release rate was especially strong for moisturized specimens at relatively high temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413486367">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, high performance composites parts are predominantly manufactured by the use of prepreg materials and autoclave cure. This requires high manufacturing temperature, pressure and a cycle time of several hours. As the aerospace timescale requirements are shortening, an increase in production rates is required and this is difficult to achieve with traditional autoclave manufacturing. Also, high capital expenditure, infrastructure requirements and time to commission has made autoclave processing, increasingly undesirable. Thus, the area of need arises in terms of speedy manufacturing and low production cost without sacrificing part quality.</p>
<p>Quickstep (QS) is a novel polymer composite processing technique designed and developed in Australia for out-of-autoclave processing of high quality, low cost components in comparatively short cure cycle times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413486367">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413486367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413486367">15</xref></sup> The technique is based on a unique fluid filled, balanced pressure, floating mould technology for the curing, partial curing and joining of prepregs and dry fiber/wet resin based composites.</p>
<p>The cure schedule provided by a prepreg manufacturer is usually designed for autoclave or other traditional processing techniques and the thermosetting resin systems are usually formulated for low ramp rate curing (typically 2–3 K/min). While in case of Quickstep, ramp rates of up to 15 K/min can be achieved, thus changing the chemorheology of the resin system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413486367">16</xref></sup> This also affects the overall quality of the product.</p>
<p>The 977-2A carbon/epoxy prepreg is used in aircraft primary and secondary structure, ballistics, cryogenic tanks, space structure or any application where there is a requirement of impact resistance and light weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413486367">17</xref></sup> The impact of hygrothermal conditioning on composite material behavior is of significant importance since it can result in the deterioration of structural components with the change in storage and operating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413486367">2</xref></sup> The investigation of the long-term durability of the composites panels fabricated from novel Quickstep and traditional autoclave is, hence, of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The effect of the environmental conditioning on the flexural, interfacial and glass transition behavior of the composites panels manufactured from autoclave and Quickstep was presented in the previous paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413486367">18</xref></sup> This article deals with the effect of hygrothermal conditioning on the mode I and mode II delamination resistance of the samples cured in an autoclave and by using Quickstep.</p>

<p>Cytec Cycom977-2A-based prepreg containing epoxy resin was used in this study which is made up of woven 6 K HTA carbon fiber having volume fraction of 63%. The cured ply thickness was measured as 0.362 mm.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684413486367"><title>Processing of the laminates</title>
<p>In this study, 5 harness satin weave is used and since it is asymmetric about its mid plane, in order to avoid any fiber deformation in the part after cure, the plies are laid up in such a way that the laminate has balanced fiber direction through its thickness.</p>
<p>For this purpose, it is assumed that warp dominated side is on the top and that if it is on the bottom, it would be considered as flipped. In this work, the plies were stacked in the warp direction back-to-back like flipped pairs so that the whole stacking sequence was semi-symmetric about the mid plane [0/0<sub>f</sub>].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413486367">19</xref></sup> The dimensions of the prepared laminates are width = 200 mm, length = 200 mm and nominal thickness = 3.2 mm. All the laminates composed of six plies [0/0<sub>f</sub>]<sub>3</sub> were with their fibers aligned in the warp direction. The laminates were vacuum bagged and cured. The cure cycles employed for autoclave processing and for Quickstep processing (based on chemo-rheology information of the neat resin) were similar as stated in the previous publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413486367">18</xref></sup> Three cured panels made-up from each cure cycle were subjected to conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413486367">Figure 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec5-0731684413486367"><title>Environmental conditioning</title>
<p>The cured composite panels were subjected to hygrothermal conditioning in a Binder climatic chamber, model KBF 115. Before the conditioning process, the composites specimens were dried at 105℃ for at least 3 h. Procedure B of ASTM standard D5229 M-92 was used for selecting the conditions for equilibrium conditioning of the specimen before they were further characterized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413486367">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The climatic chamber was set to 70℃ and 85% RH during conditioning and the weight of panels was monitored continuously as a function of time until the limit of saturation (constant weight) was achieved. It is important to maintain the temperature of the composites well below the glass transition temperature so that any irreversible damage can be avoided which permanently changes the absorption behavior of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413486367">21</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684413486367"><title>Characterization equipment and procedures</title>
<p>Mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was determined using double cantilever beam (DCB) apparatus) according to ASTM D 5528-01<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413486367">22</xref></sup> whereas, mode II interlaminar fracture toughness testing was carried out through mixed mode bending (MMB) according to ASTM D 6671-01.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413486367">23</xref></sup> The testing was performed on an Instron 5564 test machine.</p>
<p>Hinges were bonded to both the DCB and MMB test specimen for load introduction. A 15 µm thick PTFE film was inserted between the central layers of the laminate prior to processing to produce an initial delamination crack. The dimensions of specimens were 160 × 20 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. Four specimens were tested from each panel. A crosshead speed of 1 mm/min was selected for all the specimens.</p>
<p>The strain energy release rate (G<sub>IC</sub> and G<sub>IIC</sub>) the correction factors and other necessary calculation for mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness were performed according to the above stated ASTM standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413486367">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413486367">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec7-0731684413486367"><title>Scanning electron microscope</title>
<p>The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope which is capable of producing high-resolution images of sample surfaces. For the fiber-reinforced composites, it is a very important tool for post-fracture analysis of composites surfaces. In this study, SEM was used to investigate the fracture surfaces of composite samples after they were subjected to mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness testing. The composite samples were examined using a Philips model XL30 field emission gun (FEG) SEM microscope. Small sections of mode I and mode II fractured surfaces were cut from test samples and were placed on metal stubs using double-sided carbon tabs. The stubs with the fracture surfaces were then coated with a very thin layer of carbon using Edwards S150B sputter coater in order to enhance the conductivity of the surface.</p>

It seems contradictory to the results of previous published work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413486367">18</xref></sup> that QS-cured panels have slightly higher moisture absorption because of the high resin content and high cross-link density of the polymer network.

<p>It is evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413486367">Table 1</xref>, however, that the value of diffusivity co-efficient (Dz) for the QS-cured panel was about 33% greater than Dz measured for the autoclave cured panel.

Initially, the applied load was found to increase linearly due to the implanted delamination for both autoclave and QS-cured specimens until the initiation of the crack propagation. With the growth of the crack, the load experienced several load drops until the desired delamination of the DCB specimen reached.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413486367">Figure 7</xref> shows typical load versus crosshead displacement curves for the mixed mode bending tests to determine G<sub>IIC</sub>, performed on specimens fabricated using the autoclave and QS-60 cure cycles and hygrothermal conditioned at 70℃ and 85% RH. Initially, the load increases linearly with the deflection at the mid-span to the initiation point and then the load–deflection curve becomes non-linear. With the growth of the crack, the load experienced several load drops until the desired delamination of the MMB specimens was reached. The critical load and the crack length were recorded at the onset of the crack propagation and on desired points during crack propagation.
