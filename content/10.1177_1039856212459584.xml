<title>Definitions</title>
<p>The word ‘shame’ is derived from the German root <italic>scama</italic> meaning ‘to cover oneself’ and from the Indo-European root <italic>skam</italic>, meaning ‘to hide’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212459584">1</xref></sup> Whilst there are many different definitions of shame, shame is defined for practical clinical utility in this article as a painful self-conscious emotion arising from negative dishonorable self-evaluations, as seen through one’s own eyes, associated with the urge to hide.</p>
<p>Validation is defined in this article, with clinical utility in mind, as being when one believes that the other person understands and makes sense of one’s experience. In common language terms, validation has occurred when one knows that the other person ‘gets’ where we are coming from. Self-validation is when we understand and make sense of our own experience.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856212459584" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clients whom this article is about, describe intense experiences of severe chronic self-hating, self-disgust and self-contempt that has existed for many years and which they see as continuing permanently into the future. This includes but goes beyond situation-specific shame and having generally low self-esteem, feeling inferior, unlovable or incompetent to include deep experiences of self-disgust, self-revulsion, global shame and feeling fundamentally flawed that is pervasive across a range of settings, contexts and mind states. (and not phenomenologically psychotic in nature). The person may speak of themselves offensively as an animal (e.g. pig), as offensive matter (e.g. scum) or as deserving of punishment. This article is not about clients for whom these experiences are psychotic in nature.</p>
<p>I am proposing that it is the attitudinal emotional stance taken to one’s shame that makes self-loathing possible. These attitudinal stances include contempt, disgust and disdain with oneself and may include a pervasive sense of irreparable badness, of repulsiveness or of being fundamentally flawed. This proposal is partially supported by Whelton and Greenberg’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212459584">2</xref></sup> research demonstrating that it was the attitudinal emotional stance of self-contempt and self-disgust when applied to self-criticism that distinguished people who were depressed from those who were not depressed.</p>
<p>Self-contempt involves condescendingly looking down upon oneself and passing judgment, often this is associated with self-directed anger and thoughts of deserving punishment for being whom one is. One function of self-harm is to punish oneself, serving to temporarily regulate emotions that may include overwhelming self-contempt. Self-disgust is often associated with self-repulsion and a desire to distance or get rid of that which is repelling in oneself. Where all of oneself is considered repulsive, suicide can be seen as a means of getting rid of that which is considered repulsive.</p>
<p>The importance of self-loathing in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is underlined by the inclusion of closely related constructs in the wording of the current proposed revision of the DSM 5 description of BPD, ‘pervasive shame; feeling of inferior self-worth; excessive self-criticism’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212459584">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst there are a few studies that have successfully targeted and measured improvements in the often related but different construct of shame in several client populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212459584">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212459584"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212459584"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212459584"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212459584">8</xref></sup> there are no studies to date of behavioural treatments of people with BPD that this author is aware of, in which chronic self-loathing is specifically targeted and measured. A MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL literature search using the key words ‘borderline personality disorder’ and ‘self-loathing, self-hatred, self-contempt, self-disdain or shame’ did not reveal any outcome studies specifically targeting and measuring self-loathing. Consequently these two articles are largely opinion papers, and the intention is to support clinicians by filling the gap until such time as there is targeted research guiding treatment of severe chronic self-loathing in people with BPD.</p>
<p>The focus of these two articles is primarily clinical, emphasising aspects that the author considers of meaningful clinical utility. The author works in a DBT program where all the clients meet clinical and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212459584">9</xref></sup> criteria for BPD. Behavioural therapy in these articles describes not just externally observable actions that are subject to behavioural principles but also, and equally, internally observable thoughts, emotions and body sensations. This article acknowledges other very effective approaches to treating self-loathing in people with BPD while choosing to focus on behavioural approaches.</p>

<sec id="section5-1039856212459584">
<title>Problems with standard behavioural approaches</title>
<p>Standard behavioural interventions and therapists’ well-meaning encouragements that often work for less self-loathing clients appear to be frequently ineffective with severe chronic self-loathing clients, and might even trigger a more vigorous experience of self-loathing thus actually setting back clients’ journeys towards psychological health.</p>
<p>Standard change-focused behavioural approaches addressing low self-esteem might include naming or inviting clients to look for positive attributes, qualities, skills or achievements with therapist and client reinforcing all behaviours associated with positive self-esteem. Standard interventions that attempt to build self-esteem that often work for less self-loathing clients are frequently experienced by severe chronic self-loathing clients with BPD as invalidating the severity of their problems, the difficulty of change, and as being discordant with their self-loathing perception. Efforts to encourage change may be perceived by clients as evidence of their unacceptability and thereby serve as a stimulus for further self-loathing.</p>
<p>Standard acceptance-focused behavioural interventions can be equally problematic. Clients with BPD with severe chronic self-loathing often find therapists’ well-meaning encouragement of self-care, self-acceptance and self-soothing as superficial, facile, glib, ineffective or even aversive. These clients often find such self-acceptance and self-care extremely difficult, challenging as it does a self-perception of being undeserving or even triggering a more vigorous experience in clients of self-loathing and self-punishment.</p>
<p>All of these factors may result in our well-meaning efforts as therapists to increase client self-worth actually to be experienced by our clients as invalidating and therefore damaging of the therapeutic alliance or triggering a deepening of our clients’ self-loathing, setting back our clients’ journeys towards recovery (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856212459584">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Behaviourally integrating psychodynamic constructs of transference and counter-transference</title>
<p>Drawing on psychodynamic knowledge of transference and counter-transference will assist behavioural therapists. For example, functional analytic psychotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212459584">10</xref></sup> integrates such knowledge using behavioural principles to collaboratively explore clients and clinicians in-session relationship as a here and now example of transference (current relationships influenced by schema and emotions originating in past relationships). For example, ‘So, let’s explore how you got to believe that I don’t like you’. Explorations also include the therapist’s use of their internal experiences (counter-transference broadly) as an instrument of change (e.g. ‘I feel . . . what might this tell me about my client and myself?’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212459584">
<title>Functions and reinforcers of the self-loathing cycle</title>
<p>Self-loathing may occur as a classically conditioned response or be reinforced by serving ongoing functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212459584">Figure 1</xref>). Assessment of the function of self-loathing and the reinforcers for maintaining self-loathing is a crucial first step. These functions and reinforcers include validation of one’s self-construct, protection from external punishment or the perception of external punishment, avoidance of primary emotions (e.g. fear, anger, sadness) and fear of personal stagnation. Anecdotal experience is that validation of a self-loathing self-construct (e.g. ‘badness’ or ‘fundamentally flawed’) is the commonest self-loathing maintaining factor and the one that is most resistant to therapist efforts.</p>

</fig>
<p>Swann’s self-verification theory outlines how it might be more reinforcing for people to maintain a negative self-view (schema, identity), despite contradictory evidence, because it verifies or validates their self-conceptualisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212459584">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212459584">12</xref></sup> For example, self-criticism validates a self- construct, schema or identity of, say, ‘badness’ thereby meeting self-verification validation needs, avoiding the distress of cognitive dissonance. In the short-term, this serves to emotionally regulate, leaving the person more emotionally settled than if they had opened to the idea that their previous negative view of themselves may have been inaccurate.</p>
<p>Voicing self-criticism can also function effectively to avoid external punishment serving to reinforce self-criticism. For example, in a child subject to abuse when not compliant and self-depreciating, self-criticism might be a highly effective behaviour in decreasing the frequency and severity of the abuse. Often people with such histories engage with adult partners who are abusive and the cycle continues. Even where the person ceases to engage with abusive people, the person may be sensitised to the dangers of abuse and may automatically and incorrectly perceive the likelihood of external punishment and respond with self-criticism. This is an example of classical conditioning and because the process is habitually automatic it may take place without awareness of the original function of attempting to avoid external punishment.</p>
<p>Self-loathing, serving the function (reinforcer) of avoiding primary emotions, and avoiding fears of personal stagnation are discussed later and in the second article in this series.</p>

<title>Interrupting the self-loathing cycle by self-validation</title>
<p>Understanding the reinforcers for self-loathing will be important in looking for reinforcers of alternative healthier behaviours that will interrupt the self-loathing cycle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1039856212459584">Figure 2</xref>). Obviously as therapists we do not want to validate the unhealthy self-loathing self-construct and so we need to find alternatives to validate. Without this, the treatment of self-loathing can remain stuck. The challenge is for clients to find something that they can self-validate whilst not being harshly condemnatory of their self-loathing. The metaphor used to describe this process is that of ‘putting a floor’ under the downward spiral, preventing the self-loathing construct getting more deeply embedded. The metaphor is deliberately an action metaphor suggesting that this is something that one can actively choose to work on; initiating what Jacob et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212459584">13</xref></sup> refer to as a ‘ceasefire with oneself’.</p>

</fig>
<p>Understanding reinforcers for self-loathing, where relevant, as meeting self-verification validation needs will assist therapists attending to the first crucial step of encouraging clients to find other healthier ways to validate themselves, thereby interrupting the vicious locked-in downward self-generating spiral of self-loathing. Instead of validating ‘badness’, clients might validate how understandable it is that they got to the present situation of self-loathing. For example, ‘It makes perfect sense that I am so self-critical currently given my past’; ‘It is sad that I currently feel fundamentally flawed, however this makes sense given . . .’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212459584">14</xref></sup> Instead of, ‘I am bad, rotten and despicable’, clients might self-validate by saying, ‘Given my childhood experiences of being told that I was bad, rotten and despicable, it is no wonder that I feel bad, rotten and despicable; and have yet to feel good about myself’. This approach can have the effect of shifting stuck self-perpetuating self-loathing to fluid sadness, anger and grieving.</p>
<p>Huber,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212459584">14</xref></sup> a Zen teacher, suggests using inherently paradoxical statements that invite self-acceptance by starting with self-acceptance of this moment of self-criticism, or self-acceptance of this moment of non-self-acceptance. Thus; ‘If I could have compassion for hating myself, I would no longer be hating myself, I’d be loving myself, and nothing about me would need to change’.</p>
<p>In addition to the above present moment self-acceptance of self-criticism, therapists can turn attention more precisely to past antecedents and future consequences. Where relevant, therapists can invite clients to self- validate their shame and self-loathing as an understandable and adaptive way in the past to avoid punishment, rejection or abuse from others that is either maladaptive in the present or, where still adaptive at preventing external punishment, can be explored for future alternative healthy behaviours that will be equally, or more, protective from current and future abuse.</p>
<p>Where self-loathing has functioned to avoid emotions (e.g. fear, anger, sadness) validation where applicable of the biological underpinnings of these emotions will help to interrupt the locked-in downward self-criticism spiral. Here, clients can validate how biological temperament, such as emotional sensitivity and intensity, would make it hard for anyone with such a temperament to manage their emotions. Whilst it is early days in research on the neurobiology of emotion regulation, clients might be able to validate the difficulties of skilful behaviour when one has altered neurobiology. This can include altered frontal, prefrontal, hippocampal and amygdala areas of the brain, serotonin systems, and selective deficits of executive functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212459584">15</xref></sup> As therapists we will need to be skilful to ensure that any encouragements to validate difficulties of biological origin are not associated with a capitulating, giving up, victim-like attitudinal stance and avoidance of change-focused behaviours.</p>
<p>Awareness of self-loathing as avoidance of virtually unbearably painful emotions that clients do not know how to otherwise deal with can enable clients to begin to be empathic to, and validating of, their experiences of self-loathing in a non-blaming way. In this way, self-loathing can be validated as having in the past served the adaptive function of personal survival, alongside the need to find new healthier ways in the present and future.</p>
<p>Where self-criticism occurs in response to having emotions that clients berate themselves for having (‘I should not be feeling . . .’) empathic understandings of the traumatic childhood, adult and socio-cultural origins of these emotions can begin to interrupt the cycle of self-criticism. Often these linkages have been lost to awareness with self-loathing and shame being the dominantly experienced self-construct and emotion. Here the work of therapy is about making these linkages, so that clients can validate how normative it is for anyone with such traumatic childhood, adult and socio-cultural experiences to have these emotions. Accepting one’s experience of shame, without being also ashamed about feeling shame, might be a way of beginning to interrupt the downward spiral of shame and self-loathing.</p>
<p>Clinicians might initially focus on body sensations of emotions which appear to be easier for some clients to accept without negative evaluation (e.g. ‘I have sensations of heaviness in my chest’) than emotions overall and cognitions which may often be associated with negative evaluations (e.g. ‘I should not feel . . .’; ‘I should not have such a thought’) .</p>
<p>Providing an evolutionary explanation for distressing emotions might, because of the normalising common humanity effect, assist clients to move towards acceptance for having these emotions. Darwin articulated the evolutionary value of emotions in increasing survival of the species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212459584">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212459584">17</xref></sup> In a non-blaming way, more recently, Gilbert’s clinical writings focus on validating the normative evolutionary value of distressing emotions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212459584">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212459584"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212459584">20</xref></sup> as ensuring survival of the species by activating the threat system, hence the survival of our ancestors that were fearful or angry. Ekman describes how responding to a rope as if it was a coiled snake resulted in our ancestors surviving and breeding children who now may experience problematic anxiety by interpreting danger where danger does not exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212459584">21</xref></sup> We may now be responding to matters that were important to our ancestors but are no longer as important. This again is intended to normalise (in the context of evolution) certain emotions thereby interrupting the vicious cycle of self-criticism of distressing emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212459584">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interrupting and putting a floor under the self-loathing spiral paves the way to the next step of collaboratively identifying decreasing self-loathing and increasing self-compassion as valid important treatment targets and goals, and from there collaboratively identifying relevant treatment interventions which is the topic of Part 2.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Behavioural treatment of severe chronic self-loathing in people with BPD can be challenging for client and clinician with standard approaches that include efforts at skills training, cognitive change, exposure, client self-reinforcers and acceptance often being ineffective. Assessment of identifying reinforcers of the locked-in downward spiral of self-loathing will guide interventions for clients to interrupt this vicious cycle, enabling self-loathing and self-compassion to be placed firmly on the therapy agenda and setting the stage for collaborative exploration of a range of tailored behavioural interventions.</p>
