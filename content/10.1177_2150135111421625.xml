<p>Submitted May 6, 2011; Accepted August 3, 2011. The survival into adulthood of patients with unoperated complex congenital heart disease with anomalies often considered life threatening in infancy and childhood requires a complex interplay of “balanced” defects allowing for cardiovascular physiology compatible with long-term survival. We report on a series of three cases from our advanced imaging database of middle-aged adults presenting with multiple similar defects providing a hemodynamically balanced circulation. The constellation of defects seen in each of these patients included congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, and in two cases anomalous coronary arteries. Cardiovascular computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were important to the characterization of the multiple defects and their three-dimensional relationships in these cases. Treatment decisions in patients with this constellation of findings are challenging, given the limited data due to the rarity of survival of patients with these defects into middle adulthood and the paucity of data related to decisions and approaches to medical management, surgical correction, or transplantation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital heart disease is an increasingly prevalent issue among adults, as a result of improved surgical techniques and medical management. Rarely, however, patients may initially present in adulthood with serious congenital cardiac defects. In these cases, there is often interplay of balancing features of the congenital anomalies, such as intra-cardiac shunting through septal defects with coexisting pulmonary stenosis. Decisions regarding surgical treatment of patients who present in adulthood can be difficult, since there is a risk of disturbing this balanced physiology. We report on three cases from our advanced imaging database of middle-aged adults presenting with multiple similar defects providing a hemodynamically balanced circulation. These defects included congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (cc-TGAs), large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, and in two cases anomalous coronary arteries. Advanced cardiac imaging with cardiovascular computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were important to the characterization of the multiple defects and their three-dimensional relationships in these cases.</p>

<sec id="section2-2150135111421625">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The patients were retrospectively identified from the Cardiovascular CMR/CCTA Database in an academic tertiary care and public hospital. The database was approved by the institutional review board and the procedures followed were in accordance with institutional guidelines. Data including clinical history and cardiac imaging findings were reviewed.</p>

<sec id="section3-2150135111421625">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 50-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, palpitations, and monomoprhic ventricular tachycardia with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock therapy. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmias and had an ICD placed 5 years previously. He was known to have unoperated congenital heart disease. His measured PR interval on electrocardiographs (ECGs) varied between 174 and 210 ms.</p>
<p>A 64-slice CCTA characterized the following anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111421625">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111421625"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135111421625">3</xref>): dextrocardia, cc-TGAs, a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect with a small, rudimentary septum, pulmonary valve stenosis with poststenotic dilatation of the right pulmonary artery, and anomalous coronary arteries with the left and right coronary arteries arising via separate ostia from the anterior-most sinus of Valsalva of the aorta. The systemic (morphologic right) ventricle and pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricle were concentrically hypertrophied with normal overall shortening. The left main coronary artery coursed anterior to the anteriorly located aorta. No obstructive coronary atherosclerotic disease was demonstrated. Biatrial enlargement was present. There was no anomalous pulmonary venous return. Abdominal situs was normal. Echo revealed mild regurgitation of the systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve, which morphologically was a tricuspid valve. The patient’s ventricular arrhythmias were controlled with amiodarone.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 51-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, palpitations, and atrial fibrillation. He had experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past but had otherwise been asymptomatic. The patient was known to have congenital heart disease which had not been fully characterized.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging identified the three-dimensional relationships important to characterizing this patient’s complex anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2150135111421625">Figure 4</xref>). The patient had multiple unoperated complex lesions including cc-TGAs, a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect with a rudimentary ventricular septum, pulmonary valvular stenosis with a dysmorphic and functionally bicuspid (fused right and left cusps) pulmonary valve with poststenotic pulmonary artery dilatation, and anomalous coronary anatomy, with the left main coronary artery arising from the right sinus of Valsalva and taking a preaortic course. The systemic (morphologic right) ventricle and pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricle were concentrically hypertrophied with mildly depressed shortening (ejection fraction 45%-50%). Trace-to-mild systemic AV valve (morphologic tricuspid valve) regurgitation was present. Biatrial enlargement was present. There was no anomalous pulmonary venous return. Abdominal situs was normal. A small secundum atrial septal defect was also seen on the ECG. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated pulmonary stenosis with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 31 mm Hg, diastolic of 8 mm Hg, and a mean of 19 mm Hg. The maximum peak to peak gradient across the pulmonary valve was 60 mm Hg. The patient was cardioverted back to sinus rhythm with improvement in symptomatology. His postcardioversion PR interval was normal (130-160 ms).</p>

The pulmonary valve was trileaflet with partial cusp fusion. There was no pulmonary regurgitation. The right coronary artery had mirror-image rotation. The left main coronary artery was not well seen. The systemic (morphologic right) ventricle and pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricle were concentrically hypertrophied with normal function. Moderate systemic AV valve (morphologic tricuspid valve) regurgitation was present. There was no ventricular late gadolinium enhancement. Biatrial enlargement was present. There was no anomalous pulmonary venous return. Abdominal situs was normal. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated moderate pulmonary artery stenosis with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 22 mm Hg, The maximum peak-to-peak transpulmonary gradient was 60 mm Hg. Coronary arteriography demonstrated two coronary ostia with a large right coronary artery coursing inferiorly supplying the systemic ventricle and a small coronary artery supplying the pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricle. An electrophysiology study demonstrated an HV interval of 100 ms. A permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted via a left subclavian approach with right atrial and pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricular transvenous leads.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report three patients who presented with symptomatic arrhythmias in middle adulthood with similar multiple complex lesions rarely seen unoperated in this age group. In these patients, a constellation of congenital cardiac abnormalities led to a balanced circulation, including cc-TGAs, a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. All patients had associated coronary artery anomalies as well.</p>
<p>Congenitally corrected (L-type) TGAs is an unusual cardiac defect comprising less than 1% of all forms of congenital heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111421625">1</xref></sup> This defect is due to the combination of AV and ventriculoarterial discordance and is commonly associated with a heterogeneous group of other abnormalities. In a study by Lundstrom et al, of the 111 patients with cc-TGAs, all but 10 had associated anatomic abnormalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111421625">2</xref></sup> The presence and severity of associated anomalies contribute to the complex and varied presentation and clinical course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111421625">3</xref></sup> In isolated L-transposition of the great vessels, or in situations where other anomalies are less contributory to morbidity, patients may come to clinical attention due to systemic AV valve regurgitation (the morphologic tricuspid valve), conduction abnormalities, or impaired function of the systemic (morphologic right) ventricle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111421625">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Congenitally corrected transposition with ventricular septal defects and pulmonary stenosis provides challenging decisions for optimal approach to surgical treatment in infancy and childhood due to the complexity of the anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111421625">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111421625"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111421625"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111421625">8</xref></sup> When ventricular septal defects and severe pulmonary stenosis occur, hemodynamic physiology can be similar to Tetralogy of Fallot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111421625">2</xref></sup> Alternatively, minimal pulmonary stenosis in the face of a nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect can result in pulmonary overcirculation. In our patients, a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect was present without Eisenmenger physiology. In these patients, severe pulmonary hypertension would have been anticipated without survival to midlife if it were not for the protective effects of pulmonary stenosis. The natural history of patients with cc-TGAs is variable, since these patients have a spectrum of clinical presentations depending on the type and severity of associated abnormalities. Manifestations relate to both hemodynamic and electrophysiologic issues.</p>
<p>In regard to electrophysiologic disease, patients with congenitally corrected transposition are predisposed to developing conduction system disease. Among pediatric patients, up to 10% have complete heart block at initial presentation and up to a third of patients have some degree of AV conduction delay. The rate of spontaneous complete heart block has been estimated to be approximately 2% per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111421625">9</xref></sup> Given the discordant atrial–ventricular relationships, the functional AV node is displaced anteriorly and the penetrating bundle and conduction fibers are elongated and prone to mechanical trauma over time, resulting in progressive fibrosis, conduction delay, and eventual conduction block.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111421625">10</xref></sup> Of the 3 cases presented here, none had complete heart block at presentation in adulthood, which may be a favorable prognostic factor in this patient population. One patient though did have a significantly prolonged HV interval with subsequent pacemaker placement. Preservation of intrinsic AV conduction over time permits continued AV synchrony, synchronous ventricular activation, and physiologic chronotropic ventricular rate response, all of which likely contribute to improved hemodynamics and preservation of systemic right ventricular function compared to patients with more significant degrees of conduction system disease. Interestingly, two of the three patients presented with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, highlighting the importance of AV synchrony to the balanced hemodynamics in these patients.</p>
<p>Hemodynamic issues relate to ventricular dysfunction, valvular abnormalities, other associated congenital anomalies and effects of abnormal conduction and arrhythmias. One study found that approximately 67% of patients with associated cardiac lesions have congestive heart failure, in comparison to 25% of patients with no associated or minor lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111421625">11</xref></sup> Other risk factors for congestive heart failure include advancing age, history of arrhythmia, pacemaker implantation, and prior cardiac surgery. These risk factors result in increased prevalence of congestive heart failure in patients with cc-TGAs, usually due to failure of the systemic ventricle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111421625">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111421625">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Additionally, patients may present with regurgitation across the systemic AV valve (morphologic tricuspid valve). The prevalence of significant tricuspid insufficiency in patients with cc-TGAs has been reported in the range of 20% to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111421625">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111421625">14</xref></sup> Indeed, tricuspid regurgitation is another significant factor that can affect long-term morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111421625">15</xref></sup> A study of 20-year survival in 40 pediatric patients demonstrated that operated patients with cc-TGAs had a survival of 34% versus 90% depending on whether tricuspid regurgitation was present or absent. Unoperated patients in this study had a survival of 60% versus 100% depending on the presence or absence of tricuspid regurgitation. None of our three patients had significant depression of ventricular function or severe systemic AV valve (morphologic tricuspid valve) regurgitation.</p>
<p>There is, however, no large series on which outcomes can be predicted in our patient population. This is due to the rarity of the combination of lesions that the patients presented with and also due to the late presentation of these patients, which is a further, unusual feature. Given the improvement in clinical status with rhythm management and balanced circulation, none of the patients were felt to be cardiac transplantation candidates at the time of evaluation.</p>
<p>Surgical approaches for management of patients with cc-TGAs include physiologic versus anatomic biventricular repair, and functionally univentricular palliation. Physiologic repair strategies center on the direct repair of isolated defects while leaving the morphologic right ventricle as the systemic ventricle. Alternatively, anatomic repair aims to restore the normal ventricular–arterial relationship. Single and biventricular repair options are undertaken based on the types of associated lesions present together with the consideration of ventricular size. The anatomic surgical repair of cc-TGAs achieves restoration of the morphologic left ventricle-to-aorta connection, thereby eliminating the otherwise natural progression of systemic right ventricular failure. This repair approach generally involves an atrial level switch of the Mustard or Senning varieties in combination with either an arterial switch operation or a ventricular septal defect baffling procedure (Rastelli procedure) to restore the normal ventricular–arterial relationships. Malhotra et al proposed the incorporation of a hemi-Mustard and bidirectional Glenn anastomosis, which partially reduces the extensiveness of the atrial surgery and also helps to off-load the right ventricle, which may have some element of functional compromise even after connection to the pulmonary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111421625">16</xref></sup> Performing a bidirectional Glenn anastomosis as part of the anatomic repair has also been described as being protective on its own, as it reduces the degree of atrial suturing involved, improves the atrial space for intra-atrial baffling, and may reduce intraoperative ischemia time during the double-switch procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111421625">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111421625">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The double-switch operation has the best outcomes when performed early in life. When this surgery is performed after infancy or early childhood, morbidity and mortality progressively worsen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111421625">19</xref></sup> As a result, in older patients, treatment is usually directed at associated anomalies, such as tricuspid regurgitation, or conduction abnormalities. Surgical repair in which the morphologic right ventricle still functions as the systemic ventricle results in higher incidence of tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular failure and is, therefore, a less desirable option.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111421625">20</xref></sup> While anatomic surgical repairs have been performed with technically good outcomes, there is limited data to suggest that performance of an anatomic repair significantly improves mortality in otherwise asymptomatic adult patients with cc-TGAs. Specific criteria with consistent prognostic value remains ill defined to aid in appropriate patient selection for these interventions in adults.</p>
<p>There are several features that make the patients we describe unique. The first is the age of these unoperated patients. Large ventricular septal defects were present with pulmonary stenosis which was protective of the pulmonary circulation. The presence of these two defects in cc-TGAs has been proposed as a more favorable anatomic substrate for consideration of the double-switch surgical repair. The presence of a nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis likely promotes and maintains a more appropriate hypertrophic response of the left ventricle, such that it is favorably trained to handle systemic afterload following the double switch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111421625">21</xref></sup> Alternatively, the presence of these two defects may also be favorable in patients with unrepaired cc-TGAs. With the appropriate degree of pulmonary stenosis, ventricular level shunting is minimized while maintaining equal systolic pressures across the ventricular septal defect in both ventricles. Pulmonary vasculature is protected from overcirculation and there may be more optimal right–left ventricular interdependence, cooperative handling of systemic afterload, and better septal positioning and excursion to minimize tricuspid insufficiency. Two of the three patients were also observed to have coronary arteries which arose from a single, anterior sinus. In both of these patients, the left main coronary artery coursed anterior to the great arteries. The third patient had mirror-image coronary artery anatomy. Advanced imaging techniques were able to define the multiple major anatomic abnormalities, important to the noninvasive characterization of complex congenital heart disease and are important for cardiologists, radiologists, and surgeons to understand.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The survival into adulthood of patients with defects usually requiring surgery in infancy and childhood, in this case cc-TGAs in combination with a large nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect and valvular pulmonary stenosis, requires a complex interplay of “balanced” defects. In the patients presented, the protective effects of pulmonary stenosis to the pulmonary vasculature as well as lack of significant depression of ventricular function, preserved AV nodal function, and lack of significant systemic AV valve regurgitation may have been the factors contributing to survival into adulthood without surgical intervention. Interestingly, although all three patients presented during adulthood with important arrhythmias, none had congenital or acquired complete heart block, which is somewhat unusual for patients with cc-TGAs. Both CCTA and CMR techniques were useful in characterizing the multiple defects. Treatment decisions in patients with this constellation of findings are challenging given (1) the rarity of survival of patients with defects often considered life threatening in infancy and childhood, (2) the possibility of destabilizing a balanced circulation in efforts to achieve definitive surgical repair, (3) the paucity of data on surgical approaches and outcomes for patients in this age group with this specific constellation of cardiovascular abnormalities, and (4) the difficulties in decision making regarding the relative risks and benefits of cardiac transplantation versus reparative surgery. Further data on adults with such complex and balanced defects are required.</p>
