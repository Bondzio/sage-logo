<abstract>
<p>In this article, we show that large-scale macro-political change can powerfully condition how institutional practices shape individual cultural choice. We study the paired comparison of Portugal and Spain, two long-similar societies that moved from authoritarianism to democracy through divergent pathways in the 1970s. Data from the 2001 Eurobarometer indicate that while the cultural choices of persons born <italic>before</italic> democratic transition are comparable across the two cases, Portuguese youth born under democracy are substantially more omnivorous than their Spanish counterparts. We shed light on this puzzle through a structured, focused comparison. Our argument is that whereas revolution in Portugal overturned hierarchies in numerous social institutions and unleashed an ambitious program of cultural transformation, Spain’s consensus-oriented transition was largely limited to remaking political institutions. We show that this macro-political divergence resulted in a key cross-case difference at the institutional level. Whereas pedagogical practices in Portugal encourage young people to adopt the post-canonical, anti-hierarchical orientation toward aesthetics constitutive of the omnivorous orientation, corresponding practices in Spain restrict omnivorousness by instilling a hierarchical, largely canonical attitude toward cultural works.</p>

<p>Cultural taste may appear to be one of the strongest marks of human individuality, yet the most consistent finding in the sociology of taste is that social position systematically shapes cultural preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413478816">Katz-Gerro 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0003122413478816">van Eijck 2001</xref>). In this article, we show that case-specific macro-historical processes are capable of powerfully influencing <italic>how—</italic>and <italic>how much—</italic>social position shapes cultural choices, identifying educational institutions and pedagogical practice as a crucial intermediate arena linking macro-political change to the dynamics of taste acquisition at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413478816">Lizardo 2008</xref>). We do so by examining how a crucial historical turning point generated a substantial difference between cultural consumption patterns in Portugal and Spain, two long-similar countries that experienced divergent democratic transitions in the 1970s. We show that the polar opposite roads to democracy of the Iberian Peninsula neighbors led to nonhierarchical educational institutions and practices in one case and relatively hierarchical ones in the other, and that this contrast, in turn, generated a large cross-national disparity in the cultural tastes of youth.</p>

<title>Putting Cultural Omnivorousness in Context</title>
<p>We focus on the most well-documented empirical generalization in the sociology of cultural taste—the connection between markers of social status and the tendency to make either narrow (boundary-drawing) or broad (boundary-crossing) cultural consumption choices. Contemporary scholars conceptualize these opposing patterns of aesthetic consumption as constituting a distinction between “univores” and “omnivores,” respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122413478816">Peterson 1992</xref>). Scores of studies show that individuals from educated and professional strata are more likely than low-status individuals to make diverse, or “omnivorous,” aesthetic choices that cross boundaries, such as the divide between opera and rap music, to take but one example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413478816">Katz-Gerro 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122413478816">Peterson 2005</xref>). This phenomenon, first detected in the United States in a classic series of studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413478816">Peterson and Kern 1996</xref>), appears to be characteristic of every rich Western country that has fielded an arts participation survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0003122413478816">Virtanen 2007</xref>). The cross-national generality of this finding is one of the primary motivations for our study, for we seek to identify and theorize mechanisms driving variation (and similarity) among national cases. In what follows, we shed light on the processes linking educational institutions and omnivore taste while asking what this much-replicated finding tells us about the underlying linkage between case-specific macro-societal processes and individual cultural preferences.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses of the literature on cultural omnivorousness concern the relative neglect of the generative mechanisms underpinning the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413478816">Lizardo and Skiles 2012</xref>) and, as a result, the lack of attention to the (macro to micro) linkage between institutional context and individual patterns of cultural choice. There has been no systematic examination of whether the production of omnivorous taste publics is contingent on processes embedded in structured, case-specific configurations of institutional practices, themselves the product of historical trajectories. In this article, we address this gap in the study of culture and stratification while also contributing to the growing comparative literature on the cultural and social consequences of historical processes of macro-political change. Our primary aim is to trace the mechanisms through which cross-national variation in macro-historical change differentially reshapes social institutions’ impact on the acquisition of cultural orientations.</p>
<p>To accomplish these objectives, we make use of a methodological strategy combining quantitative survey data analysis with the qualitative paired-comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413478816">Tarrow 2010</xref>) of two carefully chosen national cases, the Iberian Peninsula neighbors of Portugal and Spain. These historically similar, geographically proximate countries moved to democracy through opposite pathways in the mid-1970s. Because these societies experienced fundamentally dissimilar historical turning points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413478816">Abbott 2001</xref>), their comparison is particularly relevant to the question at hand. We pair these cases to examine whether divergent historical trajectories can reshape within-country causal processes linking institutions and collective actors to patterns of cultural choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122413478816">Katz-Gerro 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122413478816">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A key implication of this study is that research on cultural consumption can benefit from case-sensitive methodologies that explore the macro-level interplay of processes at work in the political, social, and cultural spheres, a strategy that has paid-off handsomely in other areas of research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413478816">Hall and Lamont 2009</xref>). One important advantage of our approach lies in its capacity to demonstrate explicitly how some of the key causal dynamics (e.g., linking status to cultural taste) that analysts have conceptualized as operating independently of context are actually contingent on historically embedded societal configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413478816">Griffin et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122413478816">Ragin 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>On the Absence of Case-Oriented Logic in the Sociology of Taste</title>
<p>Contemporary work on the cultural taste/stratification linkage rests on a methodological premise that is open to question: the assumption that causal processes operate in a largely case-free manner (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122413478816">Peterson [2005]</xref> for a plea to engage in case-based comparative analysis). This work sometimes seeks to identify general theoretical implications of empirical patterns observed in one national setting—usually the United States (see, in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1991</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413478816">Griswold and Wright 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413478816">López-Sintas and Katz-Gerro 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413478816">Peterson and Kern 1996</xref>)—which is taken as emblematic of case-transcending tendencies. Even work that attempts to specify the explanatory impact of cross-national variation in structures, institutions, and individual competencies theorized to shape tastes and consumption patterns retains the fundamental assumption that causal processes operate similarly across national cases.</p>
<p>Within this methodological framework is a lively tradition of survey-based work on multiple countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413478816">De Graaf 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122413478816">Katz-Gerro 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122413478816">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122413478816">Kraaykamp and Nieuwbeerta 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413478816">Lambert, Bergman, and Prandy 2005</xref>) as well as in-depth, multi-method, single-country studies outside of the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413478816">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>). This research establishes that the dynamic connecting high-status markers, such as educational or occupational attainment, to either omnivore or highbrow taste manifests across quite diverse national contexts. Nevertheless, the generalizability of these findings across national cases remains tied—in the studies cited above—to ad hoc comparative designs, in which issues of (survey) data availability rather than theoretical or methodological considerations dictate which cases serve as the basis for comparison.</p>
<p>Such scholarship typically relies on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122413478816">Ragin (2008)</xref> refers to as variable-oriented design: researchers seek to ascertain the net effect of a set of independent variables on a given dependent variable in the countries—or other units of analysis—under study. This implicitly assumes that complex case histories leave unaltered the cross-case causal impact of independent variables. In this article, we adopt a different analytic approach. We conduct a strategic comparison of two cases characterized by numerous structural and historical similarities as well as several crucial differences of direct theoretical relevance for our purposes. Comparison of these two cases has attracted the interest of social scientists in a variety of disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122413478816">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Portugal and Spain Comparison as A Strategic Research Site</title>
<p>The historical and structural similarities of the Iberian neighbors are quite striking. Their developmental parallels, and record of mutual influence through cross-border diffusion, extend backward in history to their early modern role in pioneering the European colonization of the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413478816">Modelski and Thompson 1996</xref>) and their nearly contemporaneous expulsion of Jews and Muslims. Following the weak but resilient emergence of liberalism in the nineteenth century, ambitious but contested republics replaced monarchies in both countries in the early twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122413478816">Linz 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122413478816">Schwartzman 1989</xref>). In both cases, right-wing authoritarians subsequently overthrew these republics, inaugurating repressive regimes that would last until the mid-1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122413478816">Linz and Stepan 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122413478816">3</xref></sup> Both were late economic developers in the west European context, with large agricultural sectors employing much of the labor force (until relatively late in the twentieth century) and focused on the cultivation of a similar mix of crops. Land tenure patterns varied from tiny owner-cultivated farms in the North to large estates worked classically by day laborers in the South. Both economies experienced rapid growth accompanied by intense urban expansion in the 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
<sec id="section4-0003122413478816">
<title>Democratic Transitions as Turning Point</title>
<p>The parallelism of the two cases breaks with their highly dissimilar paths to democracy in the 1970s. We argue that this historical turning point induced a broad divergence between the cases. Portugal moved to democracy through a process of social revolution rooted in a classic pattern of state crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122413478816">Skocpol 1979</xref>), and Spain through a consensus- oriented transformation led by reformers within the prior regime and its democratic opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413478816">Fishman 1990a</xref>). Portugal’s revolutionary path to democracy quickly induced a major transformation of social structures, encompassing not only nationalization of much of the economy but also a partial inversion of hierarchies in numerous institutions, including government ministries, schools, and the news media. This was accompanied by a recasting of cultural processes—including ways of defining and transmitting national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413478816">Fishman 2011</xref>). This pattern of change was vastly different from that of Spain, where the consensus-oriented regime transition was largely limited to a remaking of political institutions, leaving other spheres (e.g., educational institutions) relatively untouched. The cross-case consequences of these divergent democratization paths are manifest in formal institutions—for example, the extraordinarily broad inclusion of social rights in the Portuguese Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122413478816">Magalhaes forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0003122413478816">Vieira and Silva 2010</xref>)—and informal social practices that govern routine action in civil society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003122413478816">
<title>Outline of the Argument</title>
<p>Our main causal claim is that institutional features and forms of practice linked to these sharply different pathways to democracy—and manifested within the contemporary educational systems—resulted in the relative flourishing of the omnivorous cultural disposition among youth in Portugal and its comparative underdevelopment in Spain. We do not intend to argue that all social dynamics underpinning the acquisition of omnivorous cultural tastes are embedded in nationally specific histories. Scholars often assume that much of the dynamic leading to expansive tastes is broadly transnational and tends to diffuse across national borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122413478816">Johnston and Baumann 2007</xref>). Our claim is that nationally specific configurations and forms of practice can substantially intensify or diminish the strength with which institutional actors assimilate, elaborate, and transmit such transnational cultural currents.</p>
<p>Our argument elaborates the view that political and aesthetic practices, dispositions, and trajectories co-evolve or, at the very least, are subject to similar influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1984</xref>). From this perspective, cultural omnivorousness is constituted via the application of values of multicultural tolerance and liberal anti-authoritarianism to aesthetic choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413478816">Ollivier 2008</xref>). This hypothesis is congruent with the long line of empirical research showing that tolerant or inclusivist patterns of cultural choice have an elective affinity with tolerant and inclusivist political values and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413478816">Elchardus and Siongers 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122413478816">van Eijck and Lievens 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413478816">Ollivier (2008)</xref> suggests, omnivorousness is tied to specific orientations toward politics and culture that value an “openness to diversity” as well as their associated relational configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1987</xref>);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122413478816">4</xref></sup> such dispositions include an orientation toward world culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413478816">Lizardo 2005</xref>). This theoretical and substantive linkage between omnivorousness and anti-hierarchical inclusivism, or broad humanism, provides the rationale for our focus on omnivore taste patterns (and not other forms of taste) in what follows.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-0003122413478816">
<title>Generations and Patterns of Cultural Choice in Portugal and Spain</title>
<p>We begin by establishing the cross-case contrast in cultural omnivorousness among post-transition cohorts. Here we rely on micro-level data of European Union (EU) citizens’ culture consumption habits from the August to September 2001 Eurobarometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413478816">Christensen 2003</xref>). This Eurobarometer (<italic>N</italic> = 16,200 respondents) included a special module on participation in a wide variety of cultural activities, from mass media (radio and television) to music and the arts. Although our argument rests on a broad concern for cross-national variation in cultural tastes, we focus here on this strategically paired comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122413478816">Tarrow 2010</xref>) because of its ability to highlight causal dynamics rooted in macro-historical change processes.</p>
<p>Our total sample consists of 2,000 respondents, 1,000 for each of the two countries. Each respondent in the survey was asked the following question: What kind of music do you listen to? Responses were organized into 11 broad musical categories, or genres: (1) rock and roll and pop rock, (2) heavy metal and hard rock, (3) easy listening, (4) electronic dance music and house, (5) techno and ambient, (6) rap and hip hop, (7) folk and traditional music (including American country music), (8) jazz and blues, (9) world music, (10) classical music, and (11) opera. We assigned respondents a value of one on each dichotomous indicator if they reported having listened to a live or recorded performance of the genre at least once in the past month.</p>
<p>We created a simple omnivorousness scale by volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0003122413478816">Warde and Gayo-Cal 2009</xref>), adding the musical genres consumed for each respondent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122413478816">5</xref></sup> We do not argue that this linear scale captures all possible dimensions of the omnivorousness phenomenon (which entails more than simply the quantity of genres chosen). We use the simple linear measurement for two reasons. First, recent research shows that omnivorousness by volume has good criterion validity: it correlates well with other sociodemographic and cultural behavior markers thought to be distinctive of this class of consumers and is a good predictor of the sociopolitical orientations characteristic of omnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413478816">Elchardus and Siongers 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413478816">Lizardo 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0003122413478816">Warde and Gayo-Cal 2009</xref>). Second, while the use of additive scales to measure omnivorousness has been criticized on methodological grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122413478816">Peterson 2005</xref>), our own experimentation with typologies derived from data using more complex methodologies did not result in substantively different findings. We adopted the simple additive scale because the results generated are substantially easier to interpret and present than the alternative, and very little if any underlying connection to the phenomenon of interest is lost through this approach.</p>
<p>We rely on items covering musical (and not other) taste for several reasons. First, omnivorousness has been most thoroughly investigated in music; choosing this focus provides continuity with the bulk of previous research. Second, arts participation surveys and qualitative studies show that music is the most widespread culture consumption activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413478816">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413478816">DeNora 2000</xref>); at the same time (in contrast to television viewing), music shows strong patterns of historical and social differentiation by genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122413478816">Lena and Peterson 2008</xref>). Music listening thus strikes closer than other cultural practices to taste and limits the possible confusion of an individual’s preferences with the impact of exogenous factors reflective of cultural access, leisure time, and material resources. Third, both classic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1984</xref>) and more recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413478816">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>) find that music is a distinctive realm of cultural taste, in which the link between the degree of cultural openness (i.e., among omnivores who like several genres) and analogous attitudes in other domains (e.g., politics or values) can be clearly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413478816">Bennett and colleagues (2009</xref>:75) conclude in their recent study of the British public’s cultural habits and practices, “music is the most clearly separated of all our cultural fields . . . it is the most divided, contentious cultural field of any that we examine[d].”</p>

<title>Cross-National Differences within Generations</title>
<sec id="section8-0003122413478816">
<title>Cross-case differences in expected omnivorousness within generations</title>
<p>We begin by examining whether systematic differences exist between the two national cases in the prevalence of cultural omnivorousness within age cohorts. Our theoretical perspective emphasizes the enduring impact of large historical turning points, such as the divergent democratization scenarios of the Iberian neighbors in the 1970s. Accordingly, we expect that cultural omnivorousness should vary by country among respondents born after the transitions, but not among individuals belonging to cohorts that reached adulthood and developed cultural tastes prior to the 1970s regime transitions. Some effects of the transitions, though, could emerge among individuals who were acquiring musical tastes in the historical context of democratization. Our theoretical perspective allows us to make predictions on the direction of this generational variation. The revolutionary nature of the Portuguese road to democracy led to a situation in which hierarchies of all sorts, including aesthetic ones, came into question from an egalitarian perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122413478816">6</xref></sup> The Spanish transition, in contrast, tended to promote a broad consensus that discouraged potentially polarizing endeavors—such as the fundamental questioning of hierarchies. We thus expect to observe a relative advantage of Portuguese youth over their Spanish counterparts in the expansiveness of their cultural preferences and underlying aesthetic tolerance.</p>

<p>A note of caution on interpreting results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413478816">Figure 1</xref>. Our methodology is intended to establish contrasts between the two countries for members of each age cohort but does not provide an adequate basis to interpret differences between age cohorts <italic>within</italic> either country. In the absence of panel data we cannot draw firm conclusions about within-country differences across age groups, because observed differences reflect an unknown amalgam of age, cohort, and (possibly but least likely) period effects. It would thus be questionable to interpret the age/cohort differences as specifying within-country trends, because differences across age cohorts could reflect average age-effects in cultural engagement (e.g., the fact that older people are less culturally active or are less familiar with novel musical genres than are young people) rather than historically embedded cohort effects. We thus focus our interpretations on the country effect <italic>within</italic> age groups (e.g., cross-national differences within panels) and not on within-country contrasts <italic>across</italic> age/cohort groups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413478816">Figure 1</xref> clearly shows that the country effect is null—as reflected by the overlapping confidence intervals—for members of cohorts born before democracy but that a substantial country effect emerges for cohorts born after democratization took place. Respondents born before 1962, and thus at least partially socialized in musical consumption prior to the return of democracy, are virtually indistinguishable between the two countries. Respondents born between 1963 and 1976 appear marginally different (but still statistically indistinguishable) between the cases. Respondents born under democracy (1977 or later), on the other hand, are substantially different on the two sides of the Iberian border. This indicates there is no uniform cross-national difference in breadth of cultural engagement, but Portuguese youth are distinct from their Spanish counterparts, whereas middle-aged and older adults are essentially the same across the two cases. The substantially higher level of omnivorousness among Portuguese youth seems especially surprising from the standpoint of conventional accounts of the macro-social correlates of this phenomenon (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413478816">Peterson and Kern 1996</xref>), because Spain outperforms Portugal in standard measures of economic development and educational expansion. In the Portuguese case, the expansion of educational access is a more recent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413478816">Candeias et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0003122413478816">Vieira 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We sought to determine how distinctive the Iberian pattern—of divergence in the post-1977 cohort—is by contrasting this two-case pairing with other sets of longtime (more or less) similar countries. We examined patterns in Denmark and Sweden, Germany and Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Greece and Italy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122413478816">7</xref></sup> The data show that none of these pairings share the pattern seen in the Iberian Peninsula neighbors, namely that of comparable breadth in the number of cultural choices in older cohorts giving way to a strong divergence in the youngest cohort. The Belgium–Netherlands pairing shows the reverse pattern: differentiation in the older cohorts yielding to similarity—and no country effect—in the youngest cohort. The Portugal–Spain pairing stands out as quite distinctive when compared to other obvious two-way pairings in European data. This dyad thus serves as a strategic research site to shed light on how an instance of macro-political divergence can reshape national processes of cultural taste acquisition.</p>

<title>Cross-case differences in the distribution of number of choices within generations</title>
<p>In this section, we present an analysis of cross-case differences in the full distribution of number of musical genres chosen; we examine the score for our dependent variable for each of our four generational groups. This analysis allows us to identify patterns not revealed by the average difference of about one genre among persons born under democracy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413478816">Figure 2</xref>, the univariate distribution of number of genres chosen is very similar across our two cases for the pre-democracy cohorts, suggesting that (at least for these groups) it was appropriate to rely on mean differences. For persons born under democracy, however, we see a substantial divergence between the two cases, with the two distributions no longer overlapping.</p>

The third column shows the ratio between the Portuguese and Spanish percentages. As the table clearly shows, the cross-national difference is manifested at all points in the distribution of musical genres chosen. Whereas about one-fifth (20 percent) of Portuguese born under democracy are univores, restricting themselves to only one genre, this figure is 34 percent in the Spanish case (a comparable cross-national gap exists for persons who chose only two genres, 19 versus 28 percent). By contrast, the number of Portuguese who chose multiple genres is consistently higher than in Spain for all values of three or above.</p>

<p>We performed a Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the (null) hypothesis that the two national distributions come from the same underlying population for each generational group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122413478816">Mann and Whitney 1947</xref>). This test fails to reject the null hypothesis for all three generational groups born before transition (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), confirming the impression provided by a visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413478816">Figure 2</xref>. For the cohort born under democracy, however, the Mann-Whitney test decisively rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions come from the same population (|<italic>z</italic>| = 5.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), establishing a strong basis for our claim of a country effect in the youngest cohort. This is an important substantive finding, lending credence to the argument that before democracy the populations of the Iberian cases represent comparable samples, at least for the criterion under consideration here (number of cultural choices), and that for strict statistical purposes they could theoretically be pooled. However, this is not the case among younger cohorts, who represent two nationally distinct populations in terms of their cultural behavior.</p>

<title>Cross-case differences in expected omnivorousness between educational groups within generations</title>
<p>Our data—and this study’s comparative design—allow us to examine whether schooling induces systematically different effects on members of the post-transition cohort in the two cases when we examine how given levels of educational attainment affect the cultural dispositions reflected by the number of musical genres consumed. If our argument is well-founded, schooling after democratization should have a more culturally liberating effect in our post-revolutionary case, Portugal, than in Spain, where institutional change was substantially more restrained.</p>
<p>The only measure of schooling available in the Eurobarometer survey is an indirect one: respondents reported the age at which they “stopped full-time education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413478816">Christensen 2003</xref>:22). For students who were still in school this variable was thus the same as their biological age. We assigned the following qualitative cutoffs to this education indicator: A respondent who reported having stopped education at the age of 15 years or earlier (or who was 15 at the time of the survey but still in school) was considered to have received a <italic>primary</italic> level of schooling. We considered respondents who reported having stopped their full-time education between the ages of 16 and 19 years, or who were within that age group at the time of the survey and still in school, to have received <italic>secondary</italic> level schooling (roughly equivalent to high school). Finally, respondents who reported stopping their education at or after age 20 years, or who were of that age at the time of the survey and still in school, were considered to have received (at least some) <italic>post-secondary</italic> schooling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413478816">Figure 3</xref> provides evidence that the effect of education differs systematically between the two cases, and this contrast is manifested precisely among the youngest respondents schooled in the two very different democratic contexts. The key comparison pertains to the difference between respondents who were in high school at the time of the survey (or stopped their schooling at that level), indicated by the black circle, versus those who received only a primary education, indicated by the white circle. This figure reproduces the basic result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413478816">Figure 1</xref> (null cross-national differences for persons born pre-transition). The panel corresponding to the post-transition cohort reveals one important new finding: Spaniards exposed to secondary education are not (statistically) distinguishable—in their propensity toward omnivorousness—from their counterparts who received only primary schooling. In Portugal, in contrast, receiving some form of secondary education under democracy generates a substantively and statistically significant enhancement of cultural activation. As shown in the second and third panels (displaying the same results for cohorts born prior to or during the transition to democracy), this activation effect of secondary education is absent for the two older Portuguese cohorts, suggesting this phenomenon is not a consistent primordial characteristic of the Portuguese educational system.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The central empirical puzzle posed by our analysis of the Eurobarometer data concerns the divergence between two previously quite similar countries in the effect of high school education on cultural omnivorousness. After the Iberian countries’ dissimilar pathways to democracy in the 1970s, the effect of high school education diverges sharply. High school studies exert a taste-expanding effect far greater in Portugal’s post-revolutionary democracy than under democracy in Spain or in either country under authoritarian rule. We rely on a qualitative case-oriented methodology to locate the mechanisms that can account for this contrast.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section12-0003122413478816">
<title>Unpacking the Puzzle: A Case-Based Strategy</title>
<p>Our goal is to look beyond the average and distributional differences established by the survey data. In particular, we seek to specify the causal processes that account for the post-democratization cross-case contrast. The most striking finding thus far is that the disparity in omnivorous taste between the two countries is almost entirely concentrated among young people born under democracy. Respondents socialized prior to democratization are statistically indistinguishable across the national settings. This pattern of results, coupled with our systematic paired comparison design, provides us with analytic leverage useful for causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413478816">Brady, Collier, and Seawright 2010</xref>), letting us rule out some initially appealing but now less credible alternative explanations. Crucially, these findings undercut any account of taste-formation that searches for causal dynamics rooted in constant or essentialist differences between our cases—such as the presence of regional-nationalist minorities in Spain juxtaposed against the unitary national identity of the Portuguese—or any factor embedded in either country’s distant past. Our findings also undercut an explanatory recourse to hypothesized causal dynamics that could be expected to produce an effect on members of all age cohorts—as in the case of national economic performance, social policy regimes, or patterns of income inequality.</p>
<p>The cohort-specific differences among respondents born under democracy are consistent with an explanation rooted in more temporally proximate causes capable of reshaping prior case trajectories. Such causal factors are highlighted in historical approaches that emphasize over-time contingency and path-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413478816">Abbott 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413478816">Isaac 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122413478816">Mahoney and Rueschemeyer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0003122413478816">Pierson 2004</xref>). One finding discussed earlier helps focus our search for an explanatory account: Portuguese youth exposed to high school education are considerably more omnivorous than their Spanish counterparts. In spite of the fact that Portugal is a somewhat later developer and a poorer society than Spain, in their cultural choice patterns Portuguese youth (but not their older counterparts) are more similar to their peers in the prosperous and socially advanced societies of Northern Europe than to their Southern European counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122413478816">8</xref></sup> How and why a relatively poor Western European nation displays a cultural consumption pattern unlike that of its long similar neighbor is the puzzle to which we now turn.</p>
<p>We proceed as follows: In the next section, we explore the culturally meaningful traits of the Portuguese and Spanish roads to democracy. We show that while Spain’s macro-political transition emphasized consensus, Portugal’s transition generated cultural transformation and a partial inversion of hierarchies. We will show how the consensus-oriented regime transition in Spain had the decisive consequence of inhibiting as full a transformation of educational institutions as in revolutionary Portugal. <italic>We argue that educational institutions constitute the crucial intermediating mechanism, causally linking macro-level historical change to processes of taste formation at the individual level.</italic> We follow with a focused comparison of the two educational systems that delineates the legacy of macro-political divergence in the 1970s for pedagogical practice and outcomes in the two cases. We rely on a variety of secondary sources including existing scholarly literature, documentary evidence, and findings from two large teacher and student surveys carried out throughout Europe. Finally, we provide supplementary evidence taken from our own qualitative fieldwork—involving in-depth interviews with high school teachers and educational experts—in both national cases. This in-depth analysis allows us to trace the within-case causal processes involved in generating the Iberian difference in cultural activation among post-transition cohorts.</p>

<title>Divergent Political and Cultural Pathways</title>
<p>The problem we address deals with a larger point of debate in the study of regime transformations. Do differing roads to democracy generate contrasts in the end-result, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413478816">Stepan (1986)</xref> and others have argued? Or is the democratization process subject to the principle of equifinality—according to which varying pathways lead to essentially the same result—as others have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413478816">Karl and Schmitter 1991</xref>)? Although the existence of major contrasts between the Iberian cases in the form taken by regime change is essentially undisputed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413478816">Fishman’s (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413478816">2011</xref>) recent argument that these contrasting democratization scenarios have induced major enduring social consequences has not yet elicited such broad consensus. Our analysis addresses the larger debate in a novel way, broadening the playing field by including macro-level differences in cultural dispositions as an outcome worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>In developing our argument, we build on the work of others. Democratization and equivalently large processes of macro-political change should transform not only formal political institutions but also, to varying degrees, social practices and dominant cultural understandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413478816">Cook, Hardin, and Levi 2005</xref>). From this perspective, case-specific features of democratization scenarios should result in concrete modifications of previously existing national linkages between politics and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413478816">Berezin 2009</xref>). The two cases on which we focus differ fundamentally in the nature of the cultural processes that developed in the context of regime change. We therefore expect the two cases to differ also in the broad cultural understandings and informally institutionalized patterns of practice left behind after democratization.</p>
<p>The cultural dimension of Spanish democratization involved forging consensus-oriented symbols and discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413478816">Edles 1998</xref>), a project that promoted an interpretation of the country’s past emphasizing dangers of polarization and discouraging a return to historical antagonisms, especially the country’s civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413478816">Aguilar 2002</xref>). In congruent fashion, the principal political constraints and strategies of the Spanish transition gave priority to the search for wide sociopolitical consensus and, consequently, avoidance of polarizing initiatives in all spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122413478816">Gunther, Montero, and Botella 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122413478816">Linz and Stepan 1996</xref>). Many activists who had earlier aspired to wide-ranging social and cultural change in their opposition to the Franco regime internalized the case for moderation and self-restraint in sociopolitical action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413478816">Fishman 1990b</xref>). The assumptions underpinning the Spanish transition discouraged radical and transformative endeavors.</p>
<p>The Portuguese revolution, in contrast, quite self-consciously took an expansively cultural turn, attempting to activate new sensibilities and capacities while also creating new sources of identity and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122413478816">Maxwell 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413478816">Stoer 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413478816">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0003122413478816">Vespeira de Almeida 2007</xref>). A fundamental and related feature of the April 1974 revolution was the partial inversion of hierarchies. This process first became salient in the military itself, and then in a variety of other state and social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413478816">Fishman 2011</xref>). Crucially for our purposes, educational establishments and other cultural institutions experienced an inversion of hierarchies. Students and left-oriented teachers carried out purges at the high school level and in university faculties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413478816">Costa Pinto 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413478816">2006</xref>). This led to rapid changes in both the personnel engaged in educational endeavors and the prevailing cultural climate and institutional paradigm within the educational sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122413478816">Stoer 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413478816">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413478816">1986</xref>). Workers occupied urban enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413478816">Durán Muñoz 2000</xref>) and agricultural estates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413478816">Bermeo 1986</xref>). Gender relations were substantially transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413478816">Ferreira 1998</xref>). The widespread challenge to social hierarchies broadly influenced urban neighborhoods and movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413478816">Hammond 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122413478816">Ramos Pinto 2008</xref>). Such actions generated a variety of spillover effects transforming practice itself, as reflected in the enhanced civic participation and efficacy, for example, of agricultural workers who formed farming cooperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413478816">Bermeo 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the consensus-oriented cultural energy of the Spanish transition quickly lost strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413478816">Edles 1998</xref>), the transformative cultural endeavors forged in the Portuguese revolution proved to be durable in important ways. This is exemplified by the institutionalization of official commemorative symbols and popular practices of remembrance that are constitutive of collective memory, as reflected by the retelling and annual commemoration of Portugal’s revolutionary story of April 1974. This collective commemoration, with its explicit emphasis on the partial inversion of hierarchies and the poetic opening of new cultural spaces and forms, re-creates elements of the original liberation from dictatorship on a yearly basis thoroughly woven into normal life within and outside official institutions. The annual commemorative session of parliament, the demonstrations and celebrations in the streets, and the anniversary activities organized within schools and other institutions keep the story of social revolution alive in contemporary Portugal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122413478816">9</xref></sup> The cultural energies devoted to formal efforts to teach children the story of the revolution, exemplified in the instructional books written by a group of scholars led by a prominent social theorist, underscore this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0003122413478816">Santos, Cruzeiro, and Monteiro 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The revolutionary beginnings of Portugal’s democracy have shaped democratic practice as well as more strictly institutional legacies; this is evident in numerous settings—from schools to media newsrooms—where participatory and consultative bodies provide greater voice for subordinates than in many other contemporary democratic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413478816">Fishman 2011</xref>). Whereas the cultural project intertwined with Spain’s transition was a cautious one emphasizing consensus and reconciliation, the one intermeshed with Portugal’s route to democracy was expansive, questioning established authorities, challenging such traditional boundaries as the line between school and external creative activity, and seeking to activate citizen capacities.</p>

<title>Transition’s Effect on Educational Institutions</title>
<p>Our two cases’ divergent pathways to democracy resulted in fundamental differences in their school systems’ post-transition institutional design and, crucially, in actual educational practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122413478816">10</xref></sup> We argue that these differences have had major consequences for the extent to which any given level of educational attainment activates the capacity for omnivorous cultural tastes. Crucially, we provide evidence of, and a rationale for, <italic>the divergent effects of formally equivalent education for the development of certain cultural dispositions</italic>. Our structured comparison of the two Iberian cases is especially well situated to uncover the potential for such cross-national difference in the effect of schooling. Revolutions typically pursue fundamental educational change as a central objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413478816">Ewing 2005</xref>), a pattern repeated in the Portuguese case. In contrast, Spain’s consensus-oriented road to democracy rendered unlikely a fundamental cultural reframing of the educational system and instead solidified rather hierarchical understandings and practices within schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413478816">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The Spanish transition’s search for consensus among former historical adversaries led to an education pact providing for compromise between republican advocates of educational innovation and conservative defenders of traditional and Catholic education, much of it carried out in private schools enjoying public financial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413478816">Fernández Mellizo-Soto 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413478816">Maravall 1995</xref>). Spanish democrats’ ability to pursue fundamental cultural change through transformative public education—as had been attempted in Spain’s polarized Second Republic of the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122413478816">Boyd 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122413478816">Jorganes 2008</xref>) and again, decades later, in Portugal’s social revolutionary road to democracy—was curtailed by this agreement. Socialist governments centered their educational reform initiatives on mass access to education rather than an effort to remake educational philosophy and pedagogical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413478816">Fernández Mellizo-Soto 2001</xref>). As we shall see, the dynamics constraining Spanish education from pursuing an agenda of expansive cultural change are reflected not only in official policy but also in teacher practice.</p>
<p>In Portugal, students and left-oriented teachers purged numerous high schools and university faculties of right-wing supporters of the old authoritarian regime following the captains’ coup of April 25, 1974, which initiated the democratizing Carnation Revolution. This resulted in a rapid transformation of the internal dynamics of educational institutions. Although many of those purged were subsequently welcomed back to their previous positions, entry of the revolution’s supporters into positions of responsibility, and the shift in predominant forms of practice, left an enduring mark. Portuguese educational centers also experienced an abrupt transformation of their decision-making structures and educational philosophies—including those related to cultural capacities. The Portuguese revolution, like other social revolutions, was quite self-conscious and explicit about its aspiration to transform national culture. In the first year after the Revolution of the Carnations, the left-oriented Armed Forces Movement (MFA), which took power in April 1974, launched a large-scale, if controversial, cultural dynamization campaign intended to change the thinking and practices of uneducated and rural citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0003122413478816">Vespeira de Almeida 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The revolution’s cultural climate and agenda encouraged teacher initiatives intended to expand students’ cultural and civic horizons. Meanwhile, its anti-hierarchical tendencies reduced organizational constraints on such endeavors. An MFA informational bulletin published in the fall of 1974 presented this new outlook in telling fashion: “We have to win the cultural battle, which is not only what the books teach. The schools [must] go out to the streets and the streets [must] go into the schools, through musical bands, folklore, orchestras, songs, dances, poetry, theater, the circus, the cinema, artisanry, and the plastic arts” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413478816">Stoer 1986</xref>:155). Admittedly, the revolutionary effervescence characterizing the year and a half following April 1974 was ultimately reined in by the push for normalization and re-institutionalization. Nevertheless, as Stoer’s work shows, long after the assembly-like atmosphere had faded, the Portuguese educational system retained the institutional and ideational legacies of its encounter with revolution. This includes a student-centered educational ethos articulated around “a radical pedagogy which tried to encourage the personal freedom and autonomy of students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122413478816">Stoer 1982</xref>:17; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122413478816">Stoer 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122413478816">1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Educational Practice and The Role of Culture in The School Curriculum</title>
<p>Given our argument thus far, we should be able to observe clear cross-case differences in the contemporary make-up, practices, and outcomes of educational institutions. In this section, we review the comparative evidence. The two cases differ markedly in the time and resources devoted to cultural education. A 2009 report prepared by the European Commission’s educational agency found that—at the primary school level—the time devoted to cultural education in Portugal was more than twice that of Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413478816">Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency [EACEA] 2009)</xref>. This contrast was also evident one decade earlier when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122413478816">Pedró and Puig (1999)</xref> noted Spain’s relatively limited allocation of primary school time to cultural matters.</p>
<p>Additionally, following the 1970s transitions, education spending consistently represented a higher share of GDP in Portugal and the teacher/student ratio at the primary level has been significantly better: a 1992 study found a 1 to 17 ratio in Portugal as opposed to 1 to 26 in Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413478816">Husen, Tuijnman, and Walls 1992</xref>). Even more telling is the contrast in how the two systems evaluate student work. In Portugal, assessment of performance in cultural subjects during the first years of primary school avoids quantitative categorization, whereas Spain is one of only three European countries in which students can be held back a grade if they fail cultural knowledge exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413478816">EACEA 2009</xref>). A 2007 to 2008 study of the EACEA noted that the Spanish system conceptualizes student evaluation as an assessment of “the degree of knowledge acquisition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413478816">EACEA 2007/08b</xref>:9). In the Portuguese system, with its emphasis on capacity-building and nonhierarchical practice, evaluation of students includes a discussion-centered approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413478816">Blyth and Galton 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The two systems also differ in their understandings of the purpose and composition of culture in the curriculum. Portuguese schools, but not Spanish schools, are expected to offer students cultural options, and the Portuguese system—but not the Spanish one—is committed to systematically linking extracurricular and curricular activities. The Portuguese place greater emphasis on school outings as well as visits by outsiders to the school for multiple purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413478816">Blyth and Galton 1989</xref>); in Spain, extracurricular activities require approval by internal school boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413478816">EACEA 2007/08b</xref>). In the case of musical education, Portugal has prioritized enabling students to sing multiple genres and styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122413478816">EACEA 2007/08a</xref>). In devising ways to meet cultural objectives, the Portuguese system has fostered greater connections with the surrounding community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122413478816">Kallen 1997</xref>). Both the subject matter of cultural education and the social relations among those involved are understood in less hierarchical ways in Portugal than in Spain.</p>
<p>This pattern of cross-national difference is reflected in findings of teacher and student surveys at the high school level. A mid-1990s survey of 9th-grade history students and teachers carried out across Europe showed Portugal and Spain were located at opposite ends of the continuum in the extent to which students agreed with the statement that “we discuss [in class] different explanations about what happened in the past.” Portuguese students were the most likely (3.54 out of a possible five points) and Spanish students the least likely (2.41 out of the possible five points) to agree that their discussions in history classes incorporated alternative explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413478816">Machado Pais 1999</xref>:43). The same study found that when asked about their pedagogical objectives, Spanish teachers were substantially more likely than their Portuguese counterparts (4.11 versus 3.63 out of a possible five points) to report that they attempt to cover “the principal facts of history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413478816">Machado Pais 1999</xref>:55).</p>
<p>Data from TALIS, a large-scale Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study of teachers in 23 mostly European countries, provide additional evidence of the contrast between our two cases. When asked to identify the criteria used to evaluate their own work, Portuguese teachers were above the cross-national average and Spanish teachers below that average in mentioning three key categories: first, consideration of extracurricular activities with students (72.9 versus 59.8 percent); second, inclusion of student feedback (82.7 versus 54.9 percent); and third, incorporation of parental feedback (73.3 versus 59.7 percent). Portuguese teachers were also more likely to be evaluated on the basis of their use of innovative teaching practices (69.4 versus 59.5 percent), whereas Spanish teachers were more likely to be judged by the relatively conservative benchmark of student test scores (69.5 versus 64.4 percent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122413478816">OECD 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita’s (1993)</xref> in-depth research inside Spanish schools shows how teachers’ professional self-conception typically involves a hierarchical approach to students, a narrowly technical understanding of pedagogy, and skepticism toward extracurricular initiatives including field trips. In perhaps his most critical assessment of social relations within Spain’s educational system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita (1993</xref>:87) suggests that “as in the army, the principle of authority at times presents itself as more important than the content of its exercise.” In earlier work based on field observation in Spanish schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita (1987)</xref> found teacher conduct to be not only hierarchical but also academicist, organizing classroom activities around the transmission of knowledge that teachers acquire at the university. Crucially, Fernández Enguita argues that teacher practice in Spain has retained such an approach even when governmental reforms sought to transform it. For instance, in the wake of an official effort to shift musical education away from the teacher-centered and canonical model, his fieldwork in four Madrid-area schools found that only one of them adopted a student-centered, multigenre approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita 1987</xref>). Similarly, representational structures designed to open spaces for student involvement in schools failed to generate meaningful participation, and hierarchical conceptions— especially of the teacher–student relationship—remained dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413478816">Fernández Enguita 1993</xref>). These findings are corroborated in the work of other scholars who conclude that while institutional reforms in Spain have attempted, in some measure, to promote innovative and capacity-enhancing pedagogy, actual practice has lagged behind official design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413478816">Doz Orrit 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413478816">Morgenstern de Finkel 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0003122413478816">O’Malley 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Elaborating Mechanisms through Fieldwork</title>
<p>Having established the existence of substantial differences of institutional design and practice in the two cases’ educational systems, we consider material from a small number of qualitative interviews with educational practitioners in the two countries. This qualitative material complements the macro-comparative analysis presented earlier by providing finer-grained contextually oriented insight into within-case mechanisms implicated in producing stark asymmetries in educational practice between the two cases, as well as the link between these practices and cross-case differences in cultural tastes among youth.</p>
<p>We interviewed 14 teachers and visited four high schools in the two countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122413478816">11</xref></sup> We also interviewed one educational inspector and several university-level professors of education. We used this fieldwork as an opportunity to ask our informants about their personal views and activities <italic>and</italic> to collect detailed information about their own perceptions of the practices and predispositions typical of the respective educational systems. Due to the characteristic mobility of teachers over the course of their careers in our two cases, informants’ experiences encompassed numerous schools other than the ones in which they currently taught. Indeed, one of our Portuguese interviewees had taught in nine other schools prior to her current one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122413478816">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our analytic goal is to use this qualitative material as the basis for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413478816">Brady and colleagues (2010</xref>:24) call “causal process observations.” These are “observations about context, process, or mechanism [that] provide an alternative source of insight into the relationship among explanatory variables.” In contrast to dataset observations, whose utility is normally judged in terms of quantity (breadth of coverage), causal process observations are judged in terms of quality or “depth of insight” because “even one causal-process observation may be valuable in making [causal] inferences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413478816">Brady et al. 2010</xref>:24).</p>
<p>We followed an interview approach closely aligned with the logic that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122413478816">Small (2009</xref>:24–27) formulates as “sequential interviewing.” From our first interview—outside Lisbon in the Queluz Liceu—we treated each teacher’s experience as a <italic>case</italic> capable of highlighting at least one mechanism promoting or discouraging omnivorous taste among students. Our line of questioning developed progressively to either replicate earlier findings of such a mechanism or elucidate an alternative mechanism. With a small number of interviews, we were able to provide substance to our understanding of the causal processes at work. We make no distributional claim based on our qualitative fieldwork. Instead, we use it to strengthen our argument about <italic>how</italic> practices found in the two school systems <italic>can</italic> generate the patterns of cultural choice manifested in our quantitative data. These in-depth interviews help us build a situated and nuanced understanding of currents present in high school teachers’ implicit culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122413478816">Wuthnow and Witten 1988</xref>) and institutionalized practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122413478816">Sewell 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122413478816">Swidler 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-0003122413478816">
<title>Cultural Activation via the Pedagogical Cultivation of Critical Attitudes</title>
<p>Our first interview, with a physical education instructor, highlighted how some Portuguese teachers self-consciously seek to activate the capacities necessary for questioning dominant perspectives. Luis proudly noted how he likes to inform students of their rights and of ways to demonstrate to defend those rights, adding “when there are student demonstrations in Lisbon I tell them when and how to demonstrate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122413478816">13</xref></sup> He also noted with pride the existence, in the high school where he teaches, of an extracurricular student theater group led by a fellow teacher and students’ participatory role in decision-making. We saw the same mechanism in teachers’ efforts to expand students’ cultural sensibilities and tastes. Elsa Castro, a teacher of Portuguese and French language and literature, noted her endeavors to activate students’ critical abilities and sense of the world: “I encourage them to learn about new kinds of music. Sometimes I choose Chopin, Verdi, classical music. I put on classical music when they are reading and working. One student told me a week later, ‘I saw my father has classical music at home and now I am starting to listen to it.’” Castro added, “This is the little seed we put in the ground.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0003122413478816">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>If exposure in educational settings to musical styles such as classical differs systematically between the two cases, we should expect strong cross-national differences in classical music preference among youth. The 2001 Eurobarometer data provide suggestive evidence. Whereas only 8 percent of Spanish youth born after 1977 reported listening to classical music, the corresponding figure in Portugal doubles to 16 percent (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The cross-case contrast becomes starker if we consider only respondents who were younger than 20 years old and who were still enrolled in school at the time of the Eurobarometer interview. Only 3 percent of Spaniards in this category reported listening to classical music in comparison to 12 percent of Portuguese (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) (a four to one ratio). The cross-national difference in classical music preference does not exist among persons born before 1977. In fact, Spaniards born during or before the transition were slightly more likely than their Portuguese counterparts to listen to classical music (25 versus 20 % <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), ruling out an essentialist interpretation of this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0003122413478816">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0003122413478816">
<title>Cultural Activation via Student-Centered Rather Than Curriculum-Centered Practices</title>
<p>Several of our informants noted their efforts to build student capacities extending beyond the curricular material and disciplinary knowledge transmitted in the classroom. Sara, a philosophy teacher, emphasized her commitment to expand student capacities: “We try to open their minds so that they think by themselves, not like their parents.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0003122413478816">16</xref></sup> She added, “The teacher is someone who tries to develop the abilities of students and doesn’t just transmit information.” Isabel, a history teacher, noted that “every time there is a possibility I take students to museums, monuments, etc. I take students to see works of Kandinsky, Picasso, and so on.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0003122413478816">17</xref></sup> Both of these teachers articulated an inclusive multivocal conception of culture and noted their commitment to nurturing creativity and the expansion of cultural horizons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0003122413478816">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>This informant’s remarks elucidate a systematic difference between the two cases. Only about 4 percent of Spaniards who were younger than 20 years old, and still enrolled in school at the time of the 2001 Eurobarometer, reported being frequent visitors (at home or abroad) to a museum (coded as having attended four or more times in the past year). The corresponding figure in Portugal is about three and a half times as large (14 percent), a substantial cross-national contrast in cultural participation among youth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0003122413478816">19</xref></sup> It is likely that museum visitors in the Iberian Peninsula fit the profile of museum visitors in other settings, who tend to be relatively tolerant in terms of broader values and multicultural in their orientation toward aesthetic appreciation (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413478816">DiMaggio [1996]</xref> for the case of the United States). This cross-national disparity in engagement in the arts among younger cohorts is indicative of both the effectiveness of the cultural activation strategies institutionalized in the Portuguese educational system and the concomitant creation of qualitatively distinct taste-cultures among youth in the two cases.</p>

<sec id="section19-0003122413478816">
<title>Cultural Activation via the Absence of Institutional Restraints on Teacher Creativity</title>
<p>Given our interest in how the relative degree of hierarchy in social relations within schools may affect the viability of capacity-enhancing education, we asked all of our respondents whether they had experienced—or were aware of—restraints on creative teacher initiatives in cultural activation. All of our Portuguese informants (with one exception, noted below) indicated that their creative curriculum-expanding endeavors met with institutional support. Crucially, they also noted that it would be unheard of for school authorities to interfere with teacher initiatives intended to activate student cultural capacities in a creative way. They were emphatic in insisting on the absence of any top-down interference with teacher initiatives in such matters as external trips to political or cultural events, invitations to external actors to visit schools, and musical, theatrical, artistic, and civically oriented activities within a school. We understand such teacher confidence in their ability to engage in unrestrained innovation as a mechanism supportive of robust educational efforts at cultural activation.</p>
<p>The one exception to this pattern was a special projects (<italic>area do projeto</italic>) instructor in the country’s high-school-level military academy where the school’s institutional structure was far more hierarchical than in the rest of the Portuguese system. That instructor reported being expected to seek approval from the academy’s (military) director for special curriculum-expanding activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0003122413478816">20</xref></sup> The contrast between this teacher’s experience and that of all the other interviewed teachers in Portugal reflects the importance of the lack of perceived hierarchical interference in teacher creativity as a mechanism supportive of taste-expansion in high schools.</p>

<sec id="section20-0003122413478816">
<title>Roadblocks to Cultural Activation via Hierarchical Restraints on Teacher Creativity</title>
<p>Our interviews with Spanish teachers identified three mechanisms—hierarchical restraints on teacher and student creativity, widespread pressure to cover predesigned curricular plans fully, and a pervasively canonical understanding of culture—that play a key role in limiting the potential for development of omnivorous dispositions among Spanish youth. In our interviews, we probed to see whether mechanisms at work in Portuguese high schools were also operative in the Spanish context. Some Spanish teachers who were personally predisposed toward cultural activation and the broad development of student capacities reported encountering institutional and organizational constraints and resistance. The institutional climate left in place within Spanish schools by the consensual transition proved to be substantially less supportive of teachers’ pursuit of cultural activation strategies than the institutional parameters and forms of practice created by Portugal’s revolutionary road to democracy.</p>
<p>Maria (a pseudonym), the director of the most prestigious public high school in the center of a midsized provincial capital south of Madrid, noted how hierarchical teacher attitudes toward students, along with professional rigidities imposed by school directors and others (including teachers opposed to innovative practices), can interfere with development of student cultural capacities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0003122413478816">21</xref></sup> She related the experience of a student who printed out artistic reproductions from a web-based source, and upon presenting them proudly to her teacher was reproached for taking an initiative that the educator felt inappropriate for a student. “The student came to my office in tears,” related Maria; she further noted other similar cases. She added that creative teacher initiatives, such as inviting musicians into the school to perform for students, are sometimes met by criticism from educators concerned about time lost from the pre-established curricular plan. She also noted that field trips out of the school require (an all too often absent) flexibility from school directors in the setting of schedules and so forth. Maria added that creative teachers often find that school authorities or their colleagues “raise so many difficulties, they announce all of the possible catastrophes” in order to limit innovative activities—such as school visits by musical bands and other cultural actors or external field trips to museums or concerts—that transcend officially designated lesson plans.</p>
<p>Elvira, an innovative teacher in Madrid, related similar experiences. She developed a taste for culturally innovative activities with students in her first teaching assignment. However, after changing to another high school in the Madrid metropolitan area, she encountered a lack of support from colleagues, making it impossible for her to continue extracurricular efforts to develop students’ artistic sensibilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0003122413478816">22</xref></sup> Another teacher in the greater Madrid area noted instances of institutional reticence from school authorities to support innovative field trips she had proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0003122413478816">23</xref></sup> This teacher particularly regretted the lack of support preventing her from carrying out a field trip to a theatrical performance. She lamented that the curiosity of younger students is not cultivated by the school and that older students appear less curious.</p>

<title>Roadblocks to Cultural Activation via Curriculum-Centered Pedagogical Practices</title>
<p>Spanish high school teachers are certified based on their mastery of disciplinary knowledge rather than pedagogical technique. Many are influenced by a sense of duty to cover all of the officially designated material for their courses. Our interviews made it clear that such proclivities constitute a mechanism helping to explain <italic>why</italic> high schools in Spain fail to expand student musical tastes as fully as in Portugal. Raúl, a young and thoughtful literature teacher in Madrid, reported a strong emphasis in his school on meeting the expectations of centrally designed syllabi, and his own commitment to covering all of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0003122413478816">24</xref></sup> Tere, a recently retired high school philosophy teacher in Barcelona, echoed that perception, noting that most of her colleagues were primarily concerned with fully meeting the curricular guidelines of established course syllabi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0003122413478816">25</xref></sup> A Madrid teacher, Minuca, described pressures from school authorities and parents for basic instruction, rather than a capacity-enhancing emphasis on development of creative and critical abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0003122413478816">26</xref></sup> Feliciano, a broadly knowledgeable history teacher in Madrid, observed that high school teachers’ practice shows a weaker interest in efforts to develop student capacities and a greater attachment to official curricular objectives than is suggested by the official philosophy of Ministry of Education policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0003122413478816">27</xref></sup> Culturally and historically rooted forms of practice, as well as formal institutional design, underpin the cross-national difference.

<p>Our Spanish informants were unanimous in indicating that a canonical approach to cultural education, emphasizing widely recognized great works and assuming the existence of meaningful consensus on the principal historical and cultural references, predominates among their colleagues. In contrast, among their Portuguese counterparts, many educators conceptualized culture and its benefits in an inclusive manner, incorporating many (extra-canonical) expressive voices. Contemporary research in the sociology of taste suggests that the canonical approach to cultural works stands opposed to the anti-canonical (or post-canonical) attitude of the cultural omnivore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413478816">Ollivier 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122413478816">Peterson and Kern 1996</xref>). Thus, the dominant canon-centric form of educational practice in the Spanish case stands as an important mechanism accounting for the failure of Spanish youth to develop an omnivorous disposition to the same extent as their Portuguese peers.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our analysis of secondary evidence and qualitative material on post-transition educational policy and practice in Spain and Portugal sheds light on processes responsible for the observed differences in the manifestation of the omnivorous disposition between Portuguese and Spanish youth. We have shown that the Portuguese system is characterized by a <italic>student-centered, capacity-building</italic> approach to education as well as an expansive sense of the cultural products—and capacities—meriting attention in school, with evident consequences for Portuguese youth. Teachers in Portugal contribute to activation in a variety of ways encompassing civic engagement, cultural consumption, and production. In their efforts at cultural activation, the Portuguese teachers we interviewed were motivated by an <italic>inclusive multivocal</italic> sense of culture—dialogic in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413478816">Bakhtin’s (1981)</xref> sense—incorporating diverse voices, styles, and perspectives within the material and experiences to which students were exposed. This emphasis on civic and more narrowly cultural forms of activation is important, as research shows omnivorous patterns of cultural taste are systematically related to a distinctly open and multicultural orientation toward the political and civic realms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413478816">Lizardo 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413478816">Ollivier 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122413478816">van Eijck and Lievens 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The Spanish system, in contrast, is marked by a <italic>content-centered</italic> and relatively <italic>hierarchical</italic> approach to education emphasizing a <italic>canon-based conception</italic> of the cultural products deserving inclusion in instruction. Portuguese schools treat cultural education, including music, as an important matter in students’ transformation and growth, a strategy that incorporates a broad range of experiences into schooling and helps facilitate the omnivorous disposition. Spanish schools provide less emphasis on cultural education, treating it as one element of the codified material to be transmitted to students and on which to test their knowledge. The revolutionary impulse to use education as a force promoting cultural and civic activation, and as a setting for nonhierarchical participatory engagement, remains evident in Portugal. There, teacher innovations, and efforts to cultivate in students an understanding of difference, are encouraged. The Spanish system, in contrast, is more focused on teachers’ sense of professional responsibility to impart concrete programs of canonical knowledge. The evidence reveals that these differences—constituted by a broad array of factors and rooted in the two countries’ dissimilar pathways to democracy<italic>—</italic>are amply manifested in both the official design of education and actual practice.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study offers a new perspective on the making of cultural tastes and the interconnection of political and cultural processes—emphasizing their joint embeddedness in macro-historical transformations that vary by country. Our theorization is built on a multi-method analysis of the post-democratization divergence between Portugal and Spain in patterns of cultural choice. We made use of the strategic paired comparison provided by these two cases to specify mechanisms and processes that underpin the social production of omnivorous tastes and to establish the capacity of macro-historical turning points to reshape such processes in consequential ways. We have argued that the two countries’ dissimilar pathways to democracy generated a sharp difference in institutional practices within the school system and that this post-democratization divergence led to fundamentally different patterns of cultural consumption in the youth of the two countries.</p>

<title>Opening up the education black box</title>
<p>This article contributes to recent work on the emergence of the patterned tolerance represented by omnivorous taste as well as scholarship on the intersection of politics, institutions, and lifestyle practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413478816">Bryson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122413478816">Johnston and Baumann 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122413478816">Ollivier 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122413478816">van Eijck and Lievens 2008</xref>). The correlation between markers of status (e.g., educational attainment) and omnivorous taste is a well-established finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413478816">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122413478816">Peterson and Rossman 2008</xref>). The most plausible explanation for this effect is that school is the primary institution (outside of the family) where persons acquire and hone dispositions toward the consumption of cultural goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413478816">Lizardo 2008</xref>). No study that we know of has actually examined whether this is the operative mechanism because research relies on correlational evidence of the education/omnivorousness link. Such evidence, although adequate for establishing the phenomenon, is not useful for elucidating the mechanisms that generate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413478816">Hedstrom and Swedberg 1998</xref>). Our research helps to deepen understanding of processes through which education expands cultural tastes or fails to do so, thus opening up this particular black box. We show that the empirical generalization that education promotes omnivorousness rests on specific institutional practices. These practices are, in turn, contingent on the historical development of political and educational arenas in national cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413478816">DiMaggio 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Rethinking our understanding of the connection between social change and cultural taste</title>
<p>A key theoretical implication of our analysis is that contextually rooted institutional dynamics produce systematic differences in the strength of the link between education and omnivorous taste. We expect such variation between national cases and within cases across historical periods. We conclude that case-specific processes that result in more student-centered and less canon-oriented forms of educational practice should be more effective in activating students’ cultural aptitudes, resulting in the production of omnivorous taste publics. Individuals with lower levels of formal education in one context may manifest levels of cultural activation characteristic of persons with higher education in another. This appears to be the case with Nordic welfare states such as Denmark and Finland, where omnivorousness is more equitably distributed across education levels than in other European cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0003122413478816">Virtanen 2007</xref>). In the same way, changes in educational practice, either progressive (from less to more student-centered) or conservative should create systematic differences in students’ cultural openness, differences that should leave cohort-specific traces. Rather than focusing on biological age we emphasize the effect of educational systems—themselves subject to historical change—on specific generations.</p>

<title>Contributions to the Study of Macro-Historical Processes of Social Change</title>
<p>This study contributes to our understanding of the cultural consequences of democratic transition processes. We show how the enduring impact of divergent democratization scenarios manifests in social arenas—such as educational systems and national patterns of cultural consumption—that on the surface may seem far removed from the institutional core of political regime transition. We build on work arguing that democratic transitions may transform not only political institutions but also, to one degree or another, social practices and understandings across a wide range of spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413478816">Cook et al. 2005</xref>). Our findings suggest that researchers interested in the enduring consequences of democratization scenarios should take note of educational practice and cultural consumption outcomes. We thus offer novel grounds of support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122413478816">Stepan’s (1986)</xref> classic argument that historical pathways to democracy hold independent causal significance.</p>
<p>Our empirical work shows that differences between the two national settings in the historically grounded social relations, predominant ideas, and institutional structure found within schools and among teachers help to explain the fundamentally divergent effect of secondary education on cultural sensibilities among Spanish and Portuguese youth. We view these contrasts in educational practice as one of the primary micro-level mechanisms generating the observed cross-case contrast in cultural choice among individuals born post-transition. Yet, the educational contrast rests, in turn, on the macro-historical mechanism: the impact of democratizing pathways on the design and practice of schooling. Other differences may serve as complementary causal mechanisms, contributing to the magnitude of the cross-case difference, but the contrasts we identify in the contexts within which teachers carry out their work are robust ones, generative of a consequential divergence in educational practice.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the macro-historical underpinnings of national patterns of taste formation is consistent with a body of work showing that transnational processes—such as economic globalization or construction of the European Union—are filtered through historically embedded lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122413478816">Diez Medrano 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413478816">Guillen 2001</xref>). Similarly, nation-specific causal configurations grounded in history help to determine the kinds of practices that predominate within institutions—such as the educational system. The structured comparison of Portugal and Spain provides a lens that helps us appreciate three things. The first is how nationally concrete histories and politics powerfully shape routine institutional practices. The second is how these practices may activate cultural sensibilities differently across cases. The third is how the affinity between political and cultural openness may best be conceptualized as resting on their shared link to historical processes and carriers of change, and not simply on their affinity qua broad “cultural logics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122413478816">Swidler 2001</xref>:187). These three claims share two important features. One is their common emphasis on the causal force of large-scale historical processes. The other is their stress on complex interactions between the arenas of culture, politics, and social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413478816">Hall and Lamont 2009</xref>). In the end, our study demonstrates the utility of an approach to social scientific analysis that emphasizes these factors, one that is rooted in a Weberian sensibility that is simultaneously configurational, historical, and mechanism based. We show that historically contingent processes of change shape how institutions affect individuals and thus how such effects, themselves, may be subject to change—especially in the wake of major historical turning points.</p>

<p>The scale reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s α) for the pooled sample was .63 (Spain = .58; Portugal = .70). Note that in what follows, we use (robust) Poisson regression because the counts we are dealing with do not appear to be over-dispersed and in fact exhibit slight, but not substantial, under-dispersion (µ = 1.95, σ = 1.54 for Spain; µ = 2.09, σ = 1.74 for Portugal), obviating the need to resort to regression models for over-dispersed counts (such as the negative binomial model). A rather unremarked but well-established result in the econometric literature (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0003122413478816">Winkelmann 2008</xref>:32) is that the Robust Poisson model will give consistent (and unbiased) estimates of the relevant coefficients under any arbitrary violation (e.g., over-dispersion, under-dispersion, or bi-modality) of the mean-variance equality assumption.</p>

<p>Similar differences exist for such newly consecrated artistic genres as jazz and blues. While only 7 percent of Spanish youth under age 20 who were enrolled in school during the survey reported listening to this type of music, the corresponding figure in Portugal was 15 percent (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

<p>Observation during our visits to schools contributed to our full appreciation of the mechanisms at work. The Portuguese commitment to cultural activation was evident in multiple ways including not only classroom—or extracurricular—activities but also the very physical form taken by high schools. This is important given the emphasis that certain practice theories put on diffuse forms of nonconscious cultural transmission mediated by the material environment in the creation of practical dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413478816">Bourdieu 1990</xref>). In Portugal, numerous high schools’ external and internal walls are decorated with student-made copies of well-known nineteenth- and twentieth-century artistic works. We encountered such paintings in our first high school visit in Portugal in the Queluz Liceu outside Lisbon, and all the interviewed Portuguese teachers indicated that this use of paintings within high schools is quite common—with the notable exception of the military high school in Lisbon where future army officers are trained.</p>
