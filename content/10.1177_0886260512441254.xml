<abstract>
<p>Studies have shown that there is a significant association between violent victimization and criminal behavior. One potential explanation for this association is that genetically mediated processes contribute to both violent victimization and criminal behavior. The current study uses data from the twin sample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (<italic>n</italic> = 2,568) to examine whether genetic and/or environmental factors explain the correlation between violent victimization and criminal behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Results from the bivariate genetic analyses reveal that genetic factors explain 39% of the covariance between violent victimization and delinquency in adolescence and 20% of the correlation between violent victimization and criminal behavior in early adulthood. The remaining covariance between violent victimization and criminal behaviors is attributed to the same nonshared environmental factors operating on both. The implications of these findings in relation to the victimization literature are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Violent victimization refers to events where a person is physically harmed or where others threaten bodily harm to the victim. The typical prevalence rates of violent victimization range from 5% to 20%, depending on how violent victimization is measured and the age group assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441254">Johnston, Bachman, &amp; O’Malley, 2001</xref>). Studies have shown, however, that the prevalence rates tend to be higher among individuals who are engaged in antisocial or criminal behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512441254">Lauritsen, Sampson, and Laub (1991)</xref>, for example, found that 45.2% of delinquents reported being assaulted within the past year, compared with 12.3% of youths who did not engage in delinquency. These findings have led some researchers to suggest that there is a relationship between violent victimization and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Indeed, empirical studies suggest that there is a significant association between violent victimization and criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512441254">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512441254">Sampson &amp; Lauritsen, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512441254">Jensen and Brownfield (1986)</xref> found that adolescents were more likely to be victimized if they participated in activities that involved “the pursuit of fun” rather than less risky activities. Youths who engaged in activities such as joyriding, going to bars, and going to parties were more likely to be victimized than youths who did not engage in such activities. Similar results were reported by Sampson and Lauritsen (1990) using data from the British Crime Survey. Specifically, they found that self-reported violence increased respondents’ risk of personal victimization, assault, being attacked by a stranger, and being attacked by an acquaintance or family member, independent of personal characteristics and neighborhood crime rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441254">Shaffer and Ruback’s (2002)</xref> analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health also revealed that individuals who engaged in violent crime were almost six times more likely to be violently victimized than individuals who did not engage in violent crime. Conversely, individuals who were violently victimized were approximately three times more likely to engage in violent crime than individuals who were not violently victimized. These results converge with those from additional studies to suggest that there is a substantial amount of covariance between violent victimization and criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512441254">Hoyt, Ryan, &amp; Cauce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512441254">Messner &amp; Blau, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512441254">Miethe &amp; Meier, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512441254">Sparks, 1981</xref>). That is, victimization is associated with changes in criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441254">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>), and changes in criminal behavior are associated with increased risk of violent victimization.</p>
<p>Despite the substantial amount of covariation between violent victimization and criminal behavior, it remains open to debate why these two phenotypes are connected. One potential explanation for the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior is the population heterogeneity perspective. The population heterogeneity perspective argues that time-stable traits, such as preference for risky behavior and being embedded in a criminogenic neighborhood, may place one at-risk for both violent victimization and delinquent/criminal behavior. Drawing from the population heterogeneity perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441254">Schreck (1999)</xref> found that low self-control was significantly related to property victimization, violent victimization, and criminal behavior. Other studies have also reported that low self-control is related to violent victimization and criminal behavior, even after controlling for previous levels of violent victimization and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512441254">Schreck, Stewart, &amp; Fisher, 2006</xref>). These results indicate that low self-control may help to explain both an individual’s level of delinquent involvement as well as an individual’s risk for victimization.</p>
<p>If low self-control and other time-stable personality traits are relevant to explaining the overlap between violent victimization and criminal behavior, the next step is to investigate the factors which contribute to low self-control. The origins of self-control are still being debated among researchers, but there are empirical reasons to believe that genetic factors contribute to individuals’ self-control and preferences for risk. Behavioral genetic and molecular genetic studies have shown that genetic factors are related to risk taking, risk seeking, and low self-control. For instance, Beaver and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441254">Beaver, Wright, DeLisi, &amp; Vaughn, 2008</xref>) found that genetic factors explained approximately 50% of the variance in levels of self-control in adolescence and young adulthood. Behavioral genetic studies argue that variation in behavior is a function of genetic factors (A), shared environmental effects (C), and nonshared environmental effects (E), and the goal of behavioral genetic studies is to examine the percentage of variance in behavior that is explained by genetic or environmental factors. Shared environmental factors exert the same effects on individuals within a home, whereas nonshared environmental factors are those that are unique to each individual. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441254">Beaver et al.’s (2008)</xref> findings can be interpreted as saying that 50% of the between-individual differences in self-control are explained by differences in genetic factors, with the remaining percentage being explained by environmental differences that are unique to each sibling (i.e., differences in parental treatment, differences in peer groups).</p>
<p>It is important to note that other behavioral genetic studies have also reported that genetics account for approximately 50% of the variance in risk taking, sensation seeking, or self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512441254">Hur &amp; Bouchard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512441254">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, Zhong et al.’s analysis of 232 twin pairs revealed that genetic factors explained 57% of the variation in economic risk taking, whereas nonshared environment explained 43% of the differences in economic risk taking. In addition to the results from behavioral genetic studies, molecular genetic studies have found that specific genetic polymorphisms are related to preferences for risk. Kreek and colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512441254">Kreek, Nielsen, Butelman, &amp; LaForge, 2005</xref>) literature review showed that impulsivity and risk taking were related to genetic polymorphisms in the dopaminergic, serotonergic, catecholaminergic, and GABAergic systems. Together, these findings suggest that genetics are important to understanding individuals’ self-regulation and preferences for risk.</p>
<p>Given that genetic factors explain a substantial percentage of variance in self-control and other antisocial propensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441254">Boisvert, 2009</xref>), and that low self-control may contribute to violent victimization and criminal behavior, it may be hypothesized that genetic factors may contribute to the relationship between victimization and antisocial behavior. To our knowledge, few studies have examined the violent victimization–criminal behavior relationship from a biosocial perspective. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441254">Vaske, Wright, and Beaver (2011)</xref>, however, revealed that the TaqIA polymorphism, a genetic variant on/near the dopamine receptor gene, was related to the co-occurrence of violent victimization and delinquency. Specifically, their analyses found that males who were violently victimized and who engaged in delinquency were more likely to carry the A1 risk allele of the gene than males who were not violently victimized and who did not engage in delinquent activities. Furthermore, multinomial regression models revealed that male offenders who were victimized were more likely to carry the A1 risk allele than male offenders who were not violently victimized. These results suggest that genetic factors related to the dopamine system may help to explain the co-occurrence of victimization and delinquency in males. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441254">Vaske et al.’s (2011)</xref> study used a molecular genetic approach to the investigation of genetic effects on violent victimization and criminal behaviors, other studies have relied on behavioral genetic methodologies.</p>
<p>Results from behavioral genetic studies have found that genetic factors explain a moderate amount of variance in criminal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441254">Krueger, Hicks, &amp; McGue, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512441254">Lyons, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512441254">Moffitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512441254">Rowe, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512441254">Rushton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512441254">Taylor, McGue, &amp; Iacono, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512441254">Taylor, McGue, Iacono, &amp; Lykken, 2000</xref>) and in victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441254">Hines &amp; Saudino, 2004</xref>). In a novel study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441254">Hines and Saudino (2004)</xref> examined whether genetic factors explained the covariation between the use and receipt of intimate partner violence. Their analysis of 185 same-sex twin pairs revealed that use of psychological aggression was significantly correlated with the receipt of psychological aggression (r = .85) and that genetic factors accounted for 26% of the correlation between the use of psychological intimate partner aggression (IPA) and the receipt of psychoIPA. Furthermore, they found that use of physical aggression was correlated with being a victim of physical aggression (r = .59) and that 22% of the correlation between the use of physical IPA and the receipt of physical IPA was accounted for by genetic factors. Their analyses also revealed that the same genetic factors explained the use of intimate partner aggression and the receipt of intimate partner aggression. This was the first study, to our knowledge, to show that genetic factors may explain the correlation between being a perpetrator of IPA and being a victim of IPA. Thus, genetic factors may partially explain the co-occurrence of antisocial behavior and victimization and the same genetic factors (rather than different) that explain this association.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441254">Hines and Saudino’s (2004)</xref> study suggested that genetic factors may explain some of the overlap between the use and receipt of intimate partner violence, but research has not yet empirically evaluated the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior using behavioral genetic methodology. Given the contextual differences between violent victimization, intimate partner violence, and criminal behavior, one would need to empirically evaluate these statements to see if they are in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441254">Hines and Saudino’s (2004)</xref> study.</p>
<p>In light of this gap in the literature, the purposes of the current study are threefold. First, the current study examines the degree to which genetic and environmental factors explain variance in violent victimization and in criminal behavior. Second, this study investigates whether the same genetic and environmental factors explain the association (i.e., covariance) between violent victimization and criminal behavior. If the results show that the same genetic (or environmental) factors contribute to the victimization–offending link, this would suggest that violent victimization and offending share similar etiologies (e.g., low self-control and opportunity).</p>
<p>Finally, the current study also examines whether similar genetic factors explain the association between victimization and offending at two different stages of development, adolescence and early adulthood. There is some evidence to suggest that genetic contributions to phenotypes change across the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512441254">Kendler &amp; Prescott, 2006</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441254">Guo, Wilhelmsen, and Hamilton (2007)</xref> found that genetic polymorphisms were significantly related to alcohol abuse in early adulthood but not adolescence. Thus, the strength of the genetic effects on the association between violent victimization and offending in adolescence may differ from that in early adulthood.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is important to note that the analyses used in the current study are correlational in nature. That is, the study is examining the correlation between violent victimization and delinquent/criminal behavior, without making a statement on whether violent victimization causes criminal behavior, whether criminal behavior causes violent victimization, or whether genes or environment causes either phenotype. Research on lifestyles theory has suggested that criminal behavior may cause violent victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512441254">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>), whereas research on Agnew’s general strain theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441254">Hay &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>) and recent ethnographies on suburban drug dealers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441254">Jacques &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>) suggest that violent victimization may cause changes in criminal behavior. These perspectives have competing ideas about the temporal ordering of violent victimization and criminal behavior, as well as hypotheses about the nature/direction of the effects; therefore, we do not specify the direction of effects because this is still open to debate. The current study also does not presume that genetic or environmental factors cause violent victimization or criminal behavior. The nature of the analyses itself is interested in explaining the covariance between items, and it does not reference the temporal ordering or mechanism of the associations. Thus, any significant genetic or environmental effect should be interpreted as correlational effects.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0886260512441254">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data for the current study come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a nationally representative sample of youths in Grades 7 through 12 in the United States. There are currently three waves of data available for analysis: Wave I (1994-1995), Wave II (1995-1996), and Wave III (2001-2002). During Wave I, approximately 90,000 youths completed in-school surveys that inquired about youths’ family characteristics, friendship networks, extracurricular activities, health problems, and delinquent behaviors. A random subsample of youths was then asked to complete an in-home interview. A total of 20,745 youths and their caregivers (<italic>N</italic> = 17,700) participated in the in-home interview process during Wave I. Youths and their caregivers were interviewed about a variety of topics, such as family dynamics, neighborhood characteristics, antisocial behaviors, education, and romantic relationships. Youths from the in-home interviews were then followed up in Wave II (<italic>N</italic> = 14,738) and Wave III (<italic>N</italic> = 15,170). Youths were approximately 12 to 20 years old in Wave II and 18 to 26 years old in Wave III.</p>
<p>The Add Health data are unique in that they include a subsample of siblings. During Wave I, youths were asked in the in-school survey and in the in-home interview whether any other household member was enrolled in Grades 7 through 12. A total of 2,658 twins, 208 nontwin siblings of twins, 1,611 full siblings, 1,177 half siblings, and 491 nonrelated siblings were selected into the sibling subsample in Wave I. Youths who stated that they were twins were asked additional questions to assess their zygosity. Specifically, they were asked to report whether they were identical or fraternal twins, how much they look alike, and whether teachers or family members get them confused. Zygosity was also determined by DNA analysis during Wave III by comparing twins on 12 short tandem repeat genetic polymorphisms. Twins that were identical on five or more genetic markers were considered monozygotic (MZ). Results from the survey questions and DNA analyses were compared to determine zygosity. Overall, twins accurately identified their zygosity 92% of the time, resulting in 307 MZ twin pairs and 452 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The remaining 25 twin pairs were deemed uncertain. For the purpose of these analyses, the uncertain twin pairs are coded as DZ twins to provide a conservative test of genetic similarity on behavioral outcomes.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260512441254">
<title>Violent victimization in Wave II</title>
<p>The current analyses included a measure of violent victimization during adolescence. Specifically, violent victimization during Wave II consists of four questions. Youths were asked how often they had been shot, cut or stabbed, had a knife pulled on them, or jumped during the past 12 months. The response categories for the four questions were 0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>once</italic>, and 2 = <italic>more than once</italic>. These four questions were individually standardized and then summed to form a composite score, where higher scores reflect greater violent victimization (α = .64). Scores for the measure of violent victimization at Wave II ranged from −0.81 to 35.47 with a mean of −0.02 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.77). Approximately 15% of the sample stated that they had been violently victimized at least once during the past 12 months. Other studies using the Add Health data have used the same scale to measure violent victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512441254">Hagan &amp; Foster, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441254">Shaffer &amp; Ruback, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512441254">
<title>Violent victimization in Wave III</title>
<p>Violent victimization was also assessed during early adulthood. Specifically, violent victimization at Wave III was assessed using six questions. Participants were asked whether they had been shot, stabbed, had a gun pulled on them, had a knife pulled on them, had been beaten up but nothing was stolen, and had been beaten up and did have something stolen from them (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). These six items were standardized and then summed to form a composite scale, where higher scores reflected greater violent victimization (α = .63). The range for the measure of violent victimization at Wave III was from −0.66 to 62.04 with a mean of 0.03 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.55). Approximately 9% of the sample stated that they had been violently victimization during the past 12 months in Wave III.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260512441254">
<title>Delinquency in Wave II</title>
<p>The current analyses also include two measures of offending: one measure to assess delinquency during Wave II and one measure to assess criminal behavior during Wave III. The measure of delinquency in Wave II consists of 17 questions. Youths were asked how often they had in the Past 12 months: gotten into a physical fight, seriously hurt someone in a fight, used a weapon to get something from someone, taken part in a group fight, painted graffiti, deliberately damaged others’ property, lied to parents, shoplifted, ran away, stolen a car, sold illegal drugs, broken into a home to steal something, stolen something more than US$50, stolen something less than US$50, and acted unruly in public (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>one or two times</italic>, 2 = <italic>three or four times</italic>, and 3 = <italic>five or more times</italic>). Youths were also asked how often they had pulled a knife or gun on someone and how often they shot or stabbed someone (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>once</italic>, 2 = <italic>more than once</italic>). As the response categories differ between some of the items, all 17 items are standardized and then summed together to form a composite scale (α = .84). Higher scores on the measure of delinquency at Wave II indicate greater delinquent involvement. The scores for the measure of delinquency at Wave II ranged from −5.17 to 108.06 with a mean of −0.16 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512441254">
<title>Criminal behavior in Wave III</title>
<p>Criminal behavior during Wave III was measured using responses from 14 questions. The content of the questions changed during Wave III to reflect changes in the types of antisocial behaviors exhibited across the life course. For instance, items inquiring about lying to parents and running away from home were no longer included in Wave III. Instead, more age-appropriate items regarding antisocial behaviors in adulthood were included, such as writing a bad check. More specifically, participants were asked how often, during the past 12 months, they had used a weapon in a fight, seriously hurt someone in a fight, used a weapon to get something from someone, taken part in a group fight, deliberately damaged someone else’s property, stolen something worth more than US$50, gone into a building to steal something, sold illegal drugs, stolen something worth less than US$50, illegally used someone else’s credit or bank card, deliberately written a bad check, and bought/sold/held stolen property (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>one or two times</italic>, 2 = <italic>three or four times</italic>, 3 = <italic>five or more times</italic>). Participants were also asked whether they had pulled a knife or gun on someone and shot or stabbed someone (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). These 14 items were standardized and then summed together to form the criminal behavior measure in Wave III (α = .78), with higher scores reflecting greater criminal involvement in early adulthood. The mean for the measure of criminal behavior at Wave III is −0.05 with a standard deviation of 7.19 (range = −2.39 to 100.08).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512441254">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The analyses proceed in a series of three steps: (a) intraclass correlations, as a baseline estimate of heritability in both violent victimization and criminal behavior at Waves II and III; (b) univariate genetic analyses to examine whether genetic, shared environment, and nonshared environment influences explain variation in violent victimization and criminal behavior (at Waves II and III); and (c) bivariate genetic analyses to examine if genetic and environmental factors explain the <italic>covariation</italic> of violent victimization and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>First, intraclass correlations are calculated for both MZ and DZ twin pairs. This is accomplished by correlating Twin 1’s score with Twin 2’s score on a variable for interest for both MZ and DZ twins, separately. If the correlation of MZ twin pairs is larger than the correlation of DZ twin pairs, this suggests that genetic factors are influencing the behavior of interest. MZ and DZ correlations are then used to calculate a crude estimate of heritability (h<sup>2</sup> = 2[rMz − rDz]). Following this, the correlation coefficient (r<sub>p</sub>) between violent victimization and delinquent/criminal behavior at the two time periods is calculated. The amount of covariance between the two variables that is attributed to the same genetic and/or environmental factors is then calculated through bivariate genetic analyses using the structural equation modeling program Mx.</p>
<p>Univariate genetic analysis simply decomposes the variance of a trait/behavior into its genetic (a<sup>2</sup>), shared environment (c<sup>2</sup>), and nonshared environment (e<sup>2</sup>) components. The degree to which genetics, shared environments, or nonshared environments explains variation in the phenotypes are determined by fixing and freeing a<sup>2</sup>, c<sup>2</sup>, and e<sup>2</sup> parameters in a series of steps and then identifying the best fitting models. To obtain the best fitting models, the full saturated model is compared with two submodels. First, the saturated model is compared with the CE submodel, which fixes the A parameter to zero, to test the significance of the genetic influence. Next, the saturated model is compared with the AE model, which drops the C parameters, to test for the significance of the shared environmental factor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512441254">1</xref></sup> The goodness-of-fit of these two submodels are then compared with the full model by examining the chi-squared (χ<sup>2</sup>) statistics, the probability values, and the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441254">Akaike, 1987</xref>). The best fitting model will be the one with a nonsignificant <italic>p</italic> value for the difference in chi-square test with the smallest AIC value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512441254">Neale &amp; Cardon, 1992</xref>). For instance, an AE submodel, where the parameters for C are fixed to zero, is considered a better fitting model compared with ACE if the probability of the chi-square test is nonsignificant. This implies that setting the C parameters to zero does not significantly decrease the fit of the data. If, however, both the AE and CE submodels result in a nonsignificant <italic>p</italic> value for the difference in chi-square test, then the submodel with the smallest AIC value (i.e., the largest negative value) will be deemed the most parsimonious model.</p>
<p>Bivariate genetic analyses are an extension of univariate genetic analyses. Bivariate genetic analyses allow for the decomposition of the correlation between violent victimization and delinquent/criminal behavior (r<sub>P</sub>) into the proportion that is due to the same genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors operating on both variables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512441254">Figure 1</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512441254">Table 1</xref> provides the intraclass correlations for MZ and DZ twins separately along with the crude measures of heritability. As evident in the table, the intraclass correlations for MZ twins are larger than the intraclass correlations for DZ twins for all measures of interest. This indicates that there are genetic influences operating on violent victimization and delinquent/criminal behaviors at both time periods. First, the heritability estimates for victimization during adolescence and adulthood are 0.64 and 0.14, respectively. Second, the heritability estimates for delinquent behavior in adolescence and criminal behavior in early adulthood are 0.28 and 0.24, respectively. Using intraclass correlations to calculate heritability estimates is a preliminary way to estimate the degree to which genetic factors are influencing a trait/behavior. A more sophisticated method to calculate heritability, however, involves the use of structural equation modeling that incorporates both variances and covariances.</p>

In regard to heritability estimates, the proportion of the variance in violent victimization at Wave II accounted for by genetic factors was 29% whereas nonshared environmental factors accounted for the remaining 71%.

<title>Bivariate Genetic Results for Violent Victimization and Delinquency in Wave II</title>
<p>The next step in the analyses is to examine whether (a) there is a significant correlation between violent victimization and delinquency in Wave II and (b) the covariance between violent victimization and delinquency is due to the same genetic, shared environmental, or nonshared environmental effects. The results show that violent victimization is significantly correlated with delinquency at Wave II (<italic>r</italic> = .53).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512441254">Table 2</xref> also reveals that the genetic correlation between violent victimization and delinquency at Wave II is 0.61 (<italic>r</italic>

The genetic correlation and nonshared environmental correlation suggest that the same genetic and nonshared environmental factors are relevant to explaining the covariance between violent victimization and delinquency. The genetic and nonshared environmental correlations themselves, however, do not tell readers the percentage of the correlation between violent victimization and delinquency that is attributed to genetic or nonshared environmental influences.

<p>Knowing that the correlation between violent victimization and delinquency at Wave II is 0.53 (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>), the proportion of this correlation that is explained by the same genetic and nonshared environmental effects is then calculated.

<title>Bivariate Genetic Results for Violent Victimization and Criminal Behavior in Wave III</title>
<p>The next step in the analyses is to examine whether the correlation between violent victimization and criminal behavior at Wave III (0.41) is due to the same genetic factors. The results from the AE model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512441254">Table 3</xref> reveal that the common genetic effects explain 20% of the correlation between violent victimization and criminal behavior at Wave III (A: √.09 × .59 × √.18 = .08/.41 = .20). The remaining 80% of the correlation between violent victimization and criminal behavior at Wave III is explained by the same nonshared environmental factors (E: √.91 × .38 × √.82 = .33/.41 = .80).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study examined the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior in adolescence and adulthood. First, the results revealed that genetic facexplained a modest amount of variation in both violent victimization and criminal behavior. Specifically, genetic factors accounted for approximately 9% and 29% of the variance in violent victimization during adulthood and adolescence (respectively), and approximately 20% to 40% of the variance in criminal behavior during adulthood and adolescence. These results are in line with previous research that have also shown that the heritability of intimate partner victimization is approximately .26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441254">Hines &amp; Saudino, 2004</xref>) and the heritability of criminal behavior is around .50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512441254">Moffitt, 2005</xref>). Our results contribute to the growing body of research that shows that genetic factors are relevant to explaining individual differences in victimization and antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441254">Beaver et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the results revealed that similar genetic factors explained the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior in adolescence and adulthood. Approximately 40% of the correlation between violent victimization and delinquency in adolescence is due to shared genetic factors, and 20% of the link between adulthood violent victimization and offending is due to shared genetic factors. These findings suggest that similar genetically mediated processes may lead to violent victimization and criminal behavior; thus, violent victimization and criminal behavior may partially share the same etiological pathways. As discussed in previous research, genetically mediated individual traits—such as poor self-regulation—may place one at risk for both antisocial behavior and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512441254">Ousey, Wilcox, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441254">Schreck, 1999</xref>). Due to these considerations and the current findings, it may be beneficial for future research to examine whether genetics contribute to the interrelationships between individual traits (such as self-control), violent victimization, and criminal behavior. A finding that genetics contribute to the interrelationships between individual traits, violent victimization, and criminal behavior would further extend on the population heterogeneity per by illuminating a potential cause of such traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512441254">Ousey et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The results also highlight the importance of nonshared environmental influences on violent victimization and criminal behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Nonshared environmental influences explained approximately 60% and 71% of the variance in adolescent delinquency and violent victimization, respectively, and they accounted for 82% and 91% of the variance in adulthood offending and violent victimization. These findings are in line with those from previous research, which show that the nonshared environment explains a substantial amount of variation in criminogenic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441254">Beaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441254">Boisvert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441254">Boisvert &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the current results revealed that 60% to 80% of the association between violent victimization and offending is due to the same nonshared environmental factors. Although our findings highlight the importance of nonshared environments in the occurrence and co-occurrence of violent victimization and antisocial behavior, the current study cannot address <italic>which</italic> nonshared environments are important for explaining victimization and offending. It is important for future research to explore the specific nonshared environments (i.e., delinquent peer groups, exposure to high-risk or “party” environments) which may place one at-risk for both violent victimization and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The current study extends on previous research by exploring whether genetic and environmental factors explain the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior. Traditionally, researchers have explored whether these associations were due to either individual or neighborhood characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512441254">Fagan, Piper, &amp; Cheng, 1987</xref>). The current research, however, shows that a biosocial approach may be a fruitful model for explaining the co-occurrence of violent victimization and offending. The biosocial approach opens up new vistas for exploring these relationships. For instance, the current findings show that the same genetic factors are relevant to the study of violent victimization and criminal behavior. The next step in the research may be to examine <italic>which</italic> specific genetic factors influence the likelihood of violent victimization and criminal behavior. For example, previous research has suggested that genes related to the dopamine system may explain the co-occurrence of violent victimization and criminal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441254">Vaske et al., 2011</xref>). Other research may expand on this work by examining additional dopaminergic polymorphisms (i.e., additional dopamine receptor genes or transporter genes), as well as genetic polymorphisms related to other neurotransmitter systems, such as the serotonin system (i.e., 5HTTLPR, 5HT<sub>2A</sub> polymorphisms) or degradation enzymes (i.e., monoamine oxidase A or catechol-O-methyltransferase). These polymorphisms may lead to aberrant behavior by influencing the functioning of neurotransmitter systems (via transcription, translation, protein folding, and neurotransmission), which subsequently affects how one perceives and interacts with their social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512441254">Vaske, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One important point to note in the analyses is that genetic factors seem to be less relevant to the explanation of violent victimization and criminal behavior in adulthood compared with adolescence. The heritability coefficients for violent victimization and criminal behavior in adulthood were 9% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the heritability coefficients for violent victimization and criminal behavior during adolescence were 29% and 40%, respectively. This pattern of results is inconsistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441254">Bergen, Gardner, and Kendler’s (2007)</xref> meta-analysis of behavioral genetic studies which revealed that the heritability coefficients for externalizing behaviors increased from adolescence into adulthood. However, this pattern of results is consistent with the results emerging from other investigations of delinquency and criminal behavior from the Add Health data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441254">Boisvert, 2009</xref>). One potential reason for these differences in results may be the behavior under question; broad measures of externalizing behavior may include delinquency in addition to various other externalizing behaviors, whereas the recent investigations from Add Health focus exclusively on delinquency. Future research may investigate whether heritability estimates vary by the breadth of the measures used in the analyses, as other studies have reported very high heritability coefficients when antisocial behavior is broadly measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512441254">Baker, Jacobson, Raine, Lozano, &amp; Bezdjian, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While the current study extends on previous research by investigating the biosocial contributions to the victimization–offending relationship, there are at least five caveats that must be considered when interpreting the current results. First, the current study employs twin data from the sibling subsample of the Add Health study, and the sibling subsample is not a probability sample. Siblings and twins were recruited into the sample based on whether their sibling was included in the in-school or in-home samples; therefore, their probability of selection was contingent on their sibling’s sample status. This mode of selecting a sample may introduce larger amounts of sampling error to the data, and bias parameter estimates. Due to this methodological concern, the current data may not be representative of the general population.</p>
<p>Second, the current study examined the independent effects of genetic and environmental influences on the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior. It may be likely, however, that each of these processes is a result of gene–environment interactions. There is evidence within the literature that gene–environment interactions are relevant to explaining variation in violent victimization and antisocial behavior. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441254">Beaver and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that the TaqIA genetic polymorphism interacted with delinquent peer association to influence violent victimization among males. Research has also shown that delinquent and criminal behavior may be a function of gene–environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441254">Guo, Roettger, &amp; Cai, 2008</xref>). It could be possible, therefore, that the association between violent victimization and antisocial behavior also results from the interaction of genetic influences and environmental factors. Future research should test this hypothesis, using the current study’s findings as a foundation for those analyses.</p>
<p>Third, the current study cannot disentangle “true” nonshared environmental effects from the effects of measurement error. Behavioral genetic analyses combine the effects of nonshared environment and measurement error into a single parameter (E). As measurement error is encapsulated into the “E” parameter, and violent victimization and criminal behavior suffer from measurement problems, it may be likely that the nonshared environmental effects are overestimated using the behavioral genetic approach. It should be noted, however, that studies using alternative approaches have found that nonshared environmental factors are important to explaining differences in antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441254">Boisvert &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, behavioral genetic models are predicated on the assumption that there is not assortative mating between twins’ parents. Assortative mating occurs when individuals chose to mate with other individuals who share similar characteristics as themselves. This phenomenon may increase the degree of similarity between DZ twins, and it may lead researchers to underestimate the degree of heritability in a trait. Although researchers have argued that the effects of assortative mating on heritability may be small, it is important for future studies to use extended-kinship designs that include phenotypic information from both parents and siblings to incorporate the effects of assortative mating into the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512441254">Neale &amp; Cardon, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the current measures of violent victimization are limited in scope. The data did not include questions related to the seriousness of the victimization or the context in which victimization took place. Without this type of information, the violent victimization questions may capture a variety of victimization events that are heterogeneous in nature and context. The use of general victimization questions may potentially mask important distinctions in different circumstances related to violent victimization. Furthermore, the violent victimization measures have low to moderate reliability estimates (.58-.60). These estimates are slightly below those noted in prior studies (i.e., near .70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441254">Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>), suggesting that the current measurement of violent victimization may need to be reevaluated and improved on.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current findings suggest that nonshared environments and genetically mediated processes partially explain the occurrence and co-occurrence of violent victimization and criminal behavior in adolescence and adulthood. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has used a behavioral genetic model to examine the correlation between victimization and criminal behavior. Unlike previous biosocial work on violent victimization, the current study helps researchers address the questions, “How important are genetic and environmental factors to the association between violent victimization and criminal behavior?” and “Do the same genetic and environmental factors explain violent victimization and criminal behavior?” Overall, the results suggest that genetic factors are relevant to explaining the co-occurrence of violent victimization and offending and that largely the same genetic and nonshared environmental factors increase one’s risk for violent victimization and offending. The results from this report support the continued use of biosocial approaches in the explanation of violent victimization and criminal behavior.</p>
