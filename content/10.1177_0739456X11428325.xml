<p>This study compares the changes in the household characteristics and income distributions of men and women in the Toronto census tracts that gentrified in the 1970s with the changes taking place across the metropolitan area. Higher-income women were gentrifiers from the beginning and lower-income men were more likely to be displaced. The factors driving gentrification are also transforming the rest of the metropolitan area, making the continuation of gentrification appear inevitable unless aggressive social housing programs are implemented to secure tenure for lower-income households and help mitigate the loss of lower priced housing in the inner city.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To some, gentrification destroys communities, burdens the poor, redistributes access to the downtown, and serves as yet another example of the moneyed interests riding rough over working people. To others, gentrification is the antidote; it reverses neighborhood decline, refaces unsightly streets, increases tax revenues, and best of all, it’s a “hands off” urban renewal policy, the natural outcome of a market process with no obvious government involvement or expenditure. To some, gentrification is class warfare, while to others it is the means toward a more prosperous city. The critics point to the ensuing housing shortages and ask planners to stop or at least slow the rate of change and help secure tenure for the remaining low-income renters. Others want to “revitalize” decaying neighborhoods, make them attractive to the new middle-class workers of international corporations and bring on an urban renaissance. A planner holding images of displaced people and broken communities but recognizing the need for the city to respond to new conditions might try to reconcile the conflict by seeing gentrification as the means for making neighborhoods “sustainable” and “socially mixed”—the desideratum of city planners these days. Often gentrification is viewed as a neighborhood issue inviting a local response.</p>
<p>This study places gentrification in a metropolitan context by comparing the changes in the census tracts that gentrified in the 1970s to changes taking place in the rest of the inner city and metropolitan area. The aim is to characterize the transitions taking place within the gentrified neighborhoods and the resulting displacements. The study examines changes in housing stock, household age and size composition, education, income levels and distributions, women’s income and labor force participation rates, and indirectly, changes in the marriage market. It shows how well the trends within the gentrified neighborhoods fit in the pattern of change across the census metropolitan area (CMA). It shows how the forces that drive the gentrification process are also changing the rest of the city. This, in turn, expands the planning problems attributed to gentrification and points to the need for housing policies and programs to replace the loss of lower priced housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0739456X11428325">Walks and August 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X11428325">Newman and Wyly (2006</xref>, 31) see displacement as “the leading edge of the central dilemma of American property—the use values of neighborhood and home, versus the exchange values of real estate as a vehicle for capital accumulation.” Households are displaced by rent increases, demolition, renovation, or conversion of family houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X11428325">Atkinson, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11428325">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11428325">Grier and Grier 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X11428325">Hartman, Keating, and R. LeGates 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X11428325">Marcuse 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X11428325">1985b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739456X11428325">Wyly and Hammel (2001</xref>, 214) recognized that displacement is often indirect and gradual, making measurement difficult and, thereby, making the costs induced by gentrification even more difficult to assess. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X11428325">Hardman and Ioannides (2004</xref>, 369) saw “economic segregation as a feature of US neighbourhoods [that had] attracted little attention from economists until recently.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X11428325">Galster and Booza (2007</xref>, 422) found “only a modestly sized scholarly literature on the distribution of economic groups within neighbourhoods.” As late as 2008, it was “yet to be established whether gentrification results in greater or lesser social diversity over time, and/or whether it heightens or reduces levels of income polarization within the neighbourhoods it affects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11428325">Walks and Maaranen 2008</xref>, 295).</p>
<p>An obstacle to studying changes in neighborhood income distributions is the lack of spatial detail in household-level data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X11428325">Hardman and Ioannides 2004</xref>). Some studies have tried to overcome this problem by using aggregated statistics to estimate the total number of people displaced nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739456X11428325">Newman and Owen 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X11428325">LeGates and Hartman 1986</xref>) while others focused on particular cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11428325">Grier and Grier 1978</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11428325">Schill and Nathan 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X11428325">Marcuse 1986</xref>). Some have used succession studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X11428325">Henig 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739456X11428325">Spain et al. 1980</xref>) while others have relied on resident and out-mover surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X11428325">Lee and Hodge 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11428325">Schill and Nathan 1983</xref>). This study assessed displacement indirectly by tracing the changes in the income levels and income distributions in the gentrified tracts as compared to the rest of the metropolitan area.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X11428325">Newman and Wyly’s (2006)</xref> survey found tens of thousands of people displaced annually in New York City. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X11428325">Mayer (2001)</xref> estimated the variance of income within census tracts (but not necessarily gentrifying tracts) for each U.S. state and found that “most census tracts are quite economically heterogeneous and did not become much less heterogeneous over time” (p. 21). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X11428325">Galster and Booza (2007)</xref>, using a sample of 38,499 U.S. census tracts and the index of ordinal entropy developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739456X11428325">Reardon et al. (2006)</xref>, found a dramatic increase in the number of bipolar neighborhoods since 1970 but concluded that gentrification accounted for only a small share of this growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11428325">Van Criekingen (2008)</xref> found a discernible increase in low-status individuals moving out of gentrifying neighborhoods and comments on the growing social-spatial polarization within Brussels in the early 2000s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739456X11428325">Wyly and Hammel (2001)</xref> saw gentrification as an inherently polarizing force that promises worsening inequality in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X11428325">Bondi (1991</xref>, 192) suggested that “social polarization may be even more marked among women than men. It is also evident that in different cities and different parts of cities, women are involved in or affected by gentrification in different ways.” Manuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X11428325">Castells (1976)</xref> pointed to increasing polarization breeding reciprocal fears, stigmatization, and conflict.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11428325">Hamnett (1991</xref>, 174) characterized gentrification as “one of the main arenas of conflict between proponents of culture, preference and human agency and the imperatives of capital and profitability.” While the structuralists see gentrification driven by the flows of capital, others point to changes in the labor market, income distribution, family formation, tastes, forms of self-expression, and risk perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X11428325">Beauregard 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11428325">Rose 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11428325">Skaburskis 2010</xref>). The implications differ as the structuralists’ explanation call for the kind of change that employed city planners cannot advocate while the demand-side explanations typically lead to an acceptance of the market as the vehicle for restructuring the city and ask for incremental adjustments to smooth the process. This approach is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739456X11428325">Vigdor (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X11428325">Freeman and Braconi (2004)</xref>, who suggest that gentrification does not necessarily harm low-income households; rather, the population changes are brought about by the market process of housing succession; when rental units become vacant in gentrifying neighborhoods they are more likely to be leased by middle-income households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X11428325">Freeman and Braconi (2002</xref>, 4) also conclude that “low-income households actually seem less likely to move from gentrifying neighborhoods than from other communities. Improving housing and neighborhood conditions appear to encourage the housing stability of low-income households to the degree that they more than offset any dislocation resulting from rising rents.” Only indirectly, by gradually shrinking the pool of low-rent housing in the city, does the reurbanization of the middle class harm the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X11428325">Freeman and Braconi 2002</xref>, 4). Displacement in Toronto, with its rent-controlled housing, is through voluntary moves but after a tenant moves the landlord can raise rents to market levels. The main problem raised by occupancy transitions is their reducing the supply of low-priced housing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11428325">Walks and Maaranen (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X11428325">Filion (1991)</xref> explained how gentrification, mediated through displacement, changes the income distribution of neighborhoods and why the change should matter to city planners:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Regardless of the driving factors . . . incoming groups make political claims that protect their privileges and property values, and they erect barriers of entry to outsiders and to new development through historic designation, downzoning, and opposition to shelters, clinics, and other services and housing for low-income residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X11428325">Filion, 1991</xref>). Thus, as gentrification progresses, the neighbourhood joins the club of elite residential areas, and as the class structure becomes more homogenous, levels of income polarization, inequality, and social diversity might be expected to eventually decline. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X11428325">Walks and Maaranen 2008</xref>, p. 298)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The change in community power brought about by gentrification destroys the rationale for market-led determination of city structure. It would be hypocritical to argue in favor of leaving neighborhood change that displaces low-income people up to the market but then call for planning intervention to prevent the market from continuing to change the neighborhood. The savvy citizens brought in by gentrification may have the ability to block further construction that would destroy their “unique” neighborhood. Planners would be called on to downzone the neighborhood to block projects that would increase density, help ease housing shortages, and lower prices. And city councils would bend to their residents’ demands. Hypocritical arguments or none, we have seen this play before; just look at the low density surrounding San Francisco’s downtown. Neighborhood planning efforts to moderate gentrification, to make the neighborhood livable for all, may yield tokens for the disadvantaged and mobile renters but end up as preserved low-density neighborhoods on expensive inner city land for the well off.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11428325">Hackworth (2002</xref>, 815) defined gentrification as “the production of space for progressively more affluent users,” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11428325">Walks (2001)</xref> showed that the expanding employment in finance, insurance, and real estate created a “pool of gentrifiers who can out-compete the poor for space within inner city housing markets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11428325">Walks 2001</xref>, 409). To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X11428325">Bondi (1991</xref>, 131), “profit-making for some is impoverishment for others; the ‘lifestyle choices’ of some deny those of others.” These characterizations bring to mind the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X11428325">Rex and Moore (1967)</xref> followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X11428325">Pahl (1975)</xref>, who spoke of the unitary value system, the common desire of everyone to live in the suburbs, the inequality inherent in the allocation of spatial resources, the scarcity of the valued locations, and the role of urban managers in containing the potential conflict. Now, the direction has reversed and the struggle is not about who can move to the suburbs but over who has to move out of the inner city. While job descriptions may ask city planners to help contain the conflict, one might still want to think about the displacement problem without drawing too much on ideology.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study uses census tract data to compare the changes in household characteristics and income distributions across three sectors of the Toronto CMA: the tracts that gentrified in the 1970s, the other inner city tracts, and those forming the rest of the metropolitan area. The tract boundaries in the 1971, 1981, 1991, and 2001 census were matched to their 1981 boundaries through the laborious process of recombining tracts that had split and splitting tracts that had combined. Most of the realignments took place in the suburbs and practically no changes were needed for the inner city tracts that are the focus of this study. The gentrified tracts were identified by the changes between 1971 and 1981 in their residents’ occupational characteristics and education levels as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X11428325">Ley (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X11428325">1988</xref>). Changes in household or personal income were not used to identify gentrifying neighborhoods because according to the stage theory gentrification can start with the entry of “creative people” with relatively low incomes. The tracts identified with census statistics were reviewed with Toronto city planners to ensure that these neighborhoods were also recognized as having gentrified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X11428325">Meligrana and Skaburskis 2005</xref>). The inner city census tracts were identified by having more than half of the dwellings in the 1971 census built before 1946 and by their proximity to the central business district. A few tracts with newer buildings near the boundary were included to preserve the contiguity of the inner city. The remaining 1981 census tracts form the rest of the census metropolitan area. Suburban census tracts added outside the 1981 census metropolitan area boundaries are not included in the statistics.</p>
<p>Most data-oriented gentrification studies use change in personal income as a proxy for social change, but it is household income that determines the demand for housing and is the most relevant variable in examining the changes in income distribution across the city. However, because households have been getting smaller with fewer income recipients, changes in household income understate the extent of the social change that is actually taking place. The average household income, for example, can drop in a neighborhood when young, single professionals displace working-class families with several low-wage workers. Personal income has been used in most studies because it reflects changes in education levels and, therefore, changes in social status without being affected by the decrease in household size. However, personal income is also an imperfect proxy for social change and displacement because it is affected by changes in unemployment rates, in the nature of available jobs, in labor force participation rates and in the gender and age composition of the labor force. For instance, between 1971 and 2001 the male labor force in the gentrified tracts decreased by 2.8 percent while the female labor force increased by 15.9 percent. The lower average income of women would cause the aggregated personal income statistics to understate the extent of social change. Similarly, when proportionally more young people form households in the inner city, the personal income measure understates the social changes as the young typically earn less than older workers with the same qualifications. At the very least, studies of change should distinguish the sexes and adjust for their age. Unfortunately, income breakdowns by age are not available in the census tract data. This study looks at changes in the distribution of personal income of men and women, household income, and a measure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X11428325">Tony Atkinson (2002</xref>)—household income divided by the square root of household size. This composite measure keeps household income as the unit of primary interest but partially controls for differences in household size and expenditure needs.</p>
<p>The census tract data list the number of households and people in each income category, and the number of categories is the largest for household income and smallest for women’s income. The number of categories increased in consecutive censuses, thereby increasing the reliability of the Gini coefficients. The average income in each sector was calculated by adding up the number of people in each category and assigning each an income equal to the center of the category’s range. The mean values for the lowest- and highest-income categories in the census tract data were calculated using the 3 percent samples in the Public Use Microdata Files (PUMF) on households and individuals.</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient is used here because most planners are familiar with this measure of inequality and because other measures such as the Atkinson and entropy indexes gave similar results. While there are several ways of calculating the Gini coefficient with aggregated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X11428325">Higgins 2010</xref>), we use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11428325">Abounoori and McCloughan (2003)</xref> method for grouped data as in equation (1):</p>

<p>This method, as other methods using grouped data, is biased by “granularity,” the number of categories available in the aggregated data. The more categories used in the calculation, the higher the granularity and the more accurate the calculated Gini coefficient. Here, the bias is mostly overcome after comparing the metropolitan-wide Gini coefficients calculated with the aggregated census tract data with those calculated with the microdata on a 3 percent sample of individuals and households. The microdata do not identify location below the metropolitan level, leaving us with no choice other than the census tract data.</p>
<p>The normative implications of inequality measures are not always obvious: at the national level a low inequality index is good but this is not necessarily the case at the neighborhood level. The Gini index for local areas reflects the spatial distribution of incomes across the metropolitan area, not the distribution of income in the society. High levels of inequality in a neighborhood suggest the potential for a rich social mix provided the income distribution is not polarized. However, we cannot a priori say that increasing or decreasing inequality in any part of a city is good or bad without comparing the changes to those taking place in the rest of the metropolitan area. Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X11428325">Atkinson (2002</xref>, 12) warns that “it is perfectly possible for the distribution to change significantly but for the Gini coefficient to remain unchanged,” we will also examine the share of households and individuals in the lowest and highest income categories in each census.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X11428325">Figure 1</xref> compares the changes in Toronto CMA’s Gini coefficient since 1981 to changes in household and personal income, the standard deviation of household income, and the proportion of people over the age of 15 who were either unemployed or were not in the labor force. The decrease in the average household income in 1996 brought about by increasing unemployment increased the Gini coefficient, suggesting that the greatest income loss was at the low income levels. Inequality in the CMA increased in 1996 as the spread of income had declined slightly in the preceding five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0739456X11428325">Skaburskis 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739456X11428325">2006</xref>). The rise in inequality in light of the decrease in the spread of income in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X11428325">Figure 1</xref> is due to the drop in the average level of income (the coefficient of variation increased). Had the business cycle affected all Toronto households in proportion to their income, the 1996 Gini coefficient would not have peaked as it did but would have stayed the same. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X11428325">Figure 1</xref> profiles show that the recession hurt lower-income people the most. But conclusions based on changes in a single index can be misleading because they can be due to factors other than those being examined, and we will, therefore, rely on more than one indicator of inequality.</p>

<p>The study uses the census data to describe the changes that have been taking place in Toronto’s gentrified tracts and compares them to changes in the rest of the metropolitan area. It examines the main factors driving housing demand to illustrate the extent of the shifts in the spatial structure of the metropolitan area. A sense of the displacement brought about by gentrification is gained by examining the changes in income levels and income distributions in the gentrified tracts and the rest of the city. The work is mostly descriptive and census data are used primarily to develop images of the changing city. Conclusions are drawn by observing the interrelationships in the patterns of change across the three city sectors.</p>

<title>Changing Housing and Household Characteristics</title>
<p>The occupied housing stock increased by 32 percent in the gentrified tracts over the thirty-year period, proportionally more than in the rest of the inner city (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739456X11428325">Table 1</xref>). The period of construction statistics suggest that 18,200 (31.9 percent) of the 57,095 dwellings occupied in 2001 were built since 1971. Since the net increase in the number of units was only 13,955, at least 4,245 (9.8 percent) of the 1971 dwellings had to have been lost through demolition or conversion and their occupants displaced. This estimate matches the 18,295 net increase in the number of low- and high-rise apartments in the neighborhoods. Many of the new apartments were condominiums aimed at single people and particularly young women who wanted to own their dwelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11428325">Kern 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Gentrification in Toronto did not replace a population of renters with homeowners but brought new occupants to the changing rental stock. The proportion of owner-occupied dwellings increased in the gentrified tracts as did the number of rentals; of the 13,955 net additions, 5,980 were rentals. The ownership rate increased more in the gentrified tracts than in the rest of the inner city, but the proportion was much lower at the start in 1971: 37 percent compared to 47 percent in the inner city and 55 percent in the suburbs. The relative decline in the proportion of owners in the inner city and in the gentrified tracts during the 1980s was due to the large increase in the number of subsidized rental units coming on stream. Nevertheless, rents and dwelling values increased most in the gentrifying tracts during the 1970s but then settled to follow the metropolitan trend for the rest of the study period. By 2001 the gentrified rents were on average 10 percent higher than the CMA average and dwelling values were 25 percent higher. Apartments in the inner city are typically much smaller than apartments in the suburbs, making these statistics understate the extent of the price increases.</p>
<p>The number of households in the gentrified neighborhoods increased by 32 percent over the study period while the population decreased by 5 percent. The rest of the inner city had a steeper decline in population despite the plethora of new condominium towers on the skyline. The gentrified neighborhoods had the largest drop in average household size (31 percent) from an average of 3.05 people per household to 2.19. By 2001 almost half (48.2 percent) the households had only one person, up from 27.7 percent in 1971, an increase of 15,590 one-person households. The rest of the inner city and the metropolitan area had smaller proportions but similar trends. The ordinary least squares line tracing the distance/household-size relationship in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0739456X11428325">Figure 2</xref> shows how much steeper the gradient became over time and locates the gentrified tracts in the bottom half of the scatter plot. The gentrified tracts are distinguished from the other inner city tracts by having smaller households but household sizes were decreasing throughout the metropolitan area. In 1971 the gentrified tracts had almost twice the metropolitan proportion of divorced, widowed, or separated people (15.9 compared to 9.0 percent) but by 2001 the difference had reduced substantially (16.4 compared to 14.1) largely. These statistics do not show that the widowed, divorced, or separated persons were being singled out for displacement.</p>

<p>The spatial distribution of university graduates follows the changing age profile but in a more diffused manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0739456X11428325">Figure 4</xref>). In 1971, the gentrified tracts already had twice the CMA proportion of university graduates, a fact that should modify images of homogeneous working-class communities being displaced by financial engineers and their friends. The rest of the inner city also had a higher proportion of university graduates than the suburbs and followed the trend exemplified by the gentrified tracts. As the spread of university graduates increased across the metropolitan area, the dark 1971 band of tracts at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0739456X11428325">Figure 5</xref> dispersed. Young, well-educated adults were forming new households in the inner city and in particular in the gentrifying census tracts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X11428325">Ley (1986)</xref> showed that few households migrate from the suburbs to the inner city.</p>

<p>Mobility was high in the gentrifying neighborhoods in 1971 as 25 percent of all households, both renters and owners, had moved within the previous year and 60 percent had moved within five years compared to 19 and 56 percent for the CMA. The 2001 census shows that only 12 percent of all households had moved in the previous year and 40 percent had moved within five years. The mobility of renters was much higher, with 22 percent moving within a year of the 2001 census and 65 percent within five years. The high mobility rate, the declining population, and the increase in the proportion of young households point to the displacement or a replacement of the original 1971 population. However, since rent controls were introduced in 1976, much of the displacement would have been through voluntary moves. The erosion of Toronto’s old ethnic communities is expected given the shift from mostly European to mostly Asian immigrants moving to the inner city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X11428325">Skaburskis 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Changing Income Distributions</title>
<p>Household and individual incomes increased the most in the gentrified tracts in the 1970s and then continued to increase in the following decades.

At the start, the gentrified and other inner city tracts had the same average household income adjusted for size, but by 2001 the income in the gentrified tracts in constant dollars had more than doubled (2.16) while the rest of the inner city’s income increased by only 68 percent. By 2001, gentrified tracts, despite their smaller and younger households, had the highest average household income ($103,550) compared to the rest of the inner city ($88,310) and the suburbs ($93,052).</p>

<p>The average personal income more than doubled for men (2.11) and for women (2.28) in the gentrified tracts while the CMA had a modest increase for men (1.19) but a substantial one for women (1.71). By 2001 the average personal income was the highest in the gentrified tracts: for men it was $74,100 compared to the CMA average of $53,240; for women it was $47,810, well above the CMA average and close to that of suburban men. The ratio of women’s to men’s income increased over the thirty years but it changed the least in the gentrified neighborhoods, where it was by far the highest at the start in 1971. In 1971, 79.6 percent of women in the gentrified tracts had an income compared to 69.7 percent across the CMA. Of the women in the 1971 labor force, 23.3 percent in gentrifying tracts were managers, professionals, teachers, and artists compared to 17.5 percent in the rest of the inner city and 16.9 percent in the rest of the CMA. The comparable statistics for men are 22.0, 17.0, and 21.4 percent showing no locational preference. These statistics are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739456X11428325">Rose and Villeneuve’s (1998)</xref> explanation of gentrification being encouraged by professionals being more likely to find work in the downtown. Inner city locations also help solve the colocation problem of well-educated dual-career couples and can “preserve the marriages of dual career households” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11428325">Costa and Kahn 2000</xref>, 1289).</p>
<p>Labor force participation rates among adults rose across the region but the growth in suburban employment peaked in 1981 and dropped during the 1990s recession while the gentrified neighborhood and inner city tracts kept increasing their proportion of employed adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X11428325">Table 2</xref>). The more skilled workers living in the inner city were less affected by the business cycle than the suburban workers. The proportion of women in the labor force increased from a little less than a half to 51 percent in each of the three sectors, a surprisingly small change. Women’s participation rate is not differentiated across the sectors, and changes in women’s labor force participation do not distinguish the gentrified census tracts. However, the highest proportional increase in income was for the women in the gentrified tracts, a fact consistent with other observations of professional women’s tendency to locate near the city center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739456X11428325">Rose and Villeneuve 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11428325">Skaburskis 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X11428325">Wekerle 1984</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739456X11428325">Table 3</xref> presents the Gini coefficients for households and for men and women. The first row of coefficients in each set was calculated for the CMA using census microdata with no granularity bias. The second row lists the Gini coefficients for the CMA calculated with the census tract data that gives the location of the tracts but lists income only in categories. The number of categories increased in the later censuses, reducing the granularity bias, and it is higher for men than for women, making the statistics for women less reliable. The third row lists the Gini coefficients calculated with the census tract data. The fourth shows the ratio of the gentrified tracts to the metropolitan average after adjusting for granularity bias by multiplying by the ratio of the first to second rows. The last two rows in each section show the change in the gentrified and in the CMA Gini coefficients since 1971. The CMA coefficients were calculated with the microdata without granularity bias.</p>

<p>Inequality in household and in men’s personal income increased across the CMA while women’s income inequality stayed about the same across each of the three sectors. Household income inequality rose steadily over time in the metropolitan area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739456X11428325">Picot et al. 2011</xref>) while it stayed about the same in the gentrified neighborhoods! The increase in the metropolitan area’s household income inequality was in part due to the changing behavior in the marriage market as “between 1971 and 2001 the proportion of educationally homogonous [similar] marriages among young Canadian adults (34 and under) rose from 42 per cent to 55 per cent of all marriages. This was a period when the employment and earnings gap between the more and less educated was also rising” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X11428325">Myles 2010</xref>). The increasing propensity of well-educated women to partner with well-educated men increased inequality in household incomes across the metropolitan area. Although the calculated Gini coefficient stayed about the same in the gentrified tracts, even as their average income rose much faster than in the rest of the metropolitan area, the inequality in the gentrified tracts decreased by 16 percent relative to the CMA change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739456X11428325">Table 3</xref>). The households in the gentrified tracts became more equal but at a higher income level, and the neighborhoods became less “socially mixed” relative to the metropolitan area’s potential or representative mix.</p>
<p>The Gini coefficients would have stayed the same if incomes had increased proportionally for all people and the coefficient would have declined had all incomes moved up by the same amount, showing an increase in equality; an equal increase in income represents a larger proportional increase for those with lower income. The decrease in the Gini for men in the gentrified tracts coupled with their increasing average incomes suggests that differences were narrowing as the lower-income men were replaced by higher-income men. More than with household income, the men’s income distribution in the gentrified tracts became less representative of the metropolitan potential as their average income rose.</p>
<p>Compared to the metropolitan average in 1971, the gentrified tracts had a smaller share of households (0.83) in the highest income category compared to the CMA and a much smaller proportion of men (0.68) in this category, but by 2001 the situation had reversed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0739456X11428325">Table 4</xref>). By 2001 the gentrified tracts had a larger share of households (1.11) in the highest income category, a much higher share of men (1.47), and a very much higher share of women (2.10). The smaller change for households entering this category is due to the increase in the proportion of one-person, one-earner households. The proportion of high-income women in the gentrified tracts was higher than the CMA average in 1971 and the proportion increased dramatically between 1971 and 2001, from 1.39 times to 2.10 times the metropolitan average. Women were gentrifiers from the start.</p>

<p>Changes in the lowest income category mirror those in the highest for households and for men but not for women! The gentrified tract households grew much wealthier but by 2001 they still had a much higher proportion of households in the lowest income category. The gentrified tracts had a smaller proportion of women in the lowest income category in all periods. Gentrification brought higher-income men and higher-income households into the inner city neighborhoods but higher-income women were there from the start. The largest decrease in the share of men and women in the lowest income category was during the decade the tracts started to gentrify, a statistic that points to displacement or replacement during the first phase of gentrification. The decrease in the Gini coefficient for women in the gentrified tracts during the 1970s (0.441 to 0.385 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739456X11428325">Table 3</xref>) coupled with large increases in their average income (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X11428325">Table 2</xref>) shows women as active gentrifiers.</p>
<p>The above average increase in women’s income between 1971 and 1981 (50 percent compared to 37 percent across the CMA), the decrease in the CMA share of women in the lowest income category (from 0.77 to 0.63), coupled with the substantial decline in population (131,630 to 105,350) points to the displacement of lower-income women but it does not support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X11428325">Bondi’s (1991</xref>, 192) suggestion that there is a “prominence of women among those liable to displacement.” Men’s average income rose by almost as much but the gentrified tracts share of men in the lowest income category dropped much more than for women, from 1.56 to 0.86 times the CMA average and the Gini coefficients declined relative to the CMA trend. Both low-income men and women were displaced, but more low-income men experienced the shift. The much larger share of women in the highest income category in the gentrified tracts at the start, the large increase in the proportion of homogenous marriages among young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X11428325">Myles 2010</xref>), and the increase in their numbers in the gentrified tracts points to transitions driven by the marriage market. These statistics are consistent with a view of gentrification being encouraged by well-educated young women increasingly over time choosing better educated men for their partners. For less well educated men, displacement may mean more than the loss of a dwelling.</p>
<p>By 2006 the distribution of personal and household incomes across the three sectors had evened out, yielding the surprisingly similar profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0739456X11428325">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0739456X11428325">8</xref>. The proportion of households in the highest category is the same in the gentrified as in the suburban tracts but the share of high personal incomes is much higher in the gentrified tracts. Differences in household incomes across the three sectors in the lowest category are small given the large proportion of one-person households in the inner city. The inner city and gentrified tracts share of the lowest personal income category is below that of the suburbs. The distributions across the middle-income categories are practically the same but they are differentiated within the rest of the metropolitan sector as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11428325">Hulchanski (2007)</xref>. However, the emerging profiles are consistent with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X11428325">Brueckner and Rosenthal (2009</xref>, 725) prediction that “central-city suburban differences in economic status will narrow . . . especially in the larger metropolitan areas as American cities become more gentrified.” This is not to say that the suburbs are undifferentiated as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0739456X11428325">Figure 5</xref> shows the decreasing average incomes in the tracts between 10 and 20 kilometers from the center.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristic of the gentrifying tracts is in the magnitude of the increases in income, not their timing, as the increase continued well after the first phase of gentrification had finished. The view developed through the Figures is not of a specific set of low-income neighborhoods being transformed into upper-middle-class enclaves through an invasion of the well-to-dos but of a continuous process of evolution that is also working its way through the inner city. The figures place the gentrified tracts in their expected positions but they also point to many other inner city neighborhoods that were changing as much and some even more.</p>

<sec id="section5-0739456X11428325">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>We infer that lower-income people were displaced by gentrification in Toronto by observing large increases in average incomes and growing similarity in income distributions. The changes in income profiles suggest that low-income men, more often than low-income women, were losing housing opportunities in the gentrifying neighborhoods. Higher-income women were in the gentrifying tracts from the beginning and the increasing propensity of women to partner with equally well educated men would have contributed to the rising household income of gentrifiers. New development increased the housing stock to accommodate the growth in the number of one-person households and it would have helped reduce pressure for the conversion of the older dwellings. Overall, the effect of the drivers—the changing household and family formation rates, rising income levels, and changing income distributions—is pronounced in the census tracts that were seen to have gentrified in the 1970s, but their effects are also seen across the rest of the inner city. The gentrified tracts are the ones with the largest changes but they are not unique. As the factors driving housing demand are not expected to change, we should not expect the pressure for the continued gentrification of the inner city to abate.</p>

<sec id="section6-0739456X11428325" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Looking back through 40 years of census data, we may think of Toronto’s inner city as being transformed gradually without apparent problems. The changes are most pronounced in the census tracts that gentrified in the 1970s but the trends are reflected in the rest of the inner city, and they are driven by societal changes affecting the inner city and metropolitan region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11428325">Skaburskis 2010</xref>). The social impact of the displacement in Toronto was eased by rent controls that prevented economic evictions and by social housing programs in the 1980s and 1990s that secured tenure for a sizable number of lower-income households in the inner city. The social cost of gentrification was mostly created by the reduction in the low-priced housing stock and in the regressive reallocation of access to the downtown. The impacts, however, generated no persistent chorus of protest. In Toronto, the transitions were mediated by working-class homeowners selling and moving out or by renovating their property to capture the windfalls created by the growing demand for inner city locations by well-educated young adults. The renters, a mobile population in general, moved out on their own accord.</p>
<p>Gentrification in Toronto may appear as a smooth transition but it is the distance of time that has shaped this view. We may have forgotten the housing crisis of the 1970s and the problem context within which gentrification arose and which gentrification, a term Ruth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X11428325">Glass (1964)</xref> had just coined, helped fuel. The most pressing social problem in the 1970s was the shortage of rental housing and the tremendous increase in rents in Toronto and through most of the Province. No neighborhoods were identified as being targeted by invaders or unscrupulous landlords; the housing problem was ubiquitous and serious enough to call for a policy response leading to the bitterly fought provincial election of 1975. The deeply divisive conflict was over the need for rent controls, and the Conservative party vowed that they would never implement them, never constrain markets, and never create disincentives to investment in rental housing. They won the election and six months later implemented strict rent controls. Housing supply responds slowly to rent changes, but the public responds immediately to newspaper headlines with photographs of evicted grandparents standing on a sidewalk next to their pile of furniture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X11428325">Nash and Skaburskis 1998</xref>). Rent controls moderated the consequences of gentrification, and the social housing programs of the 1980s and 1990s helped secure tenure in the inner city for a large number of lower-income households. The modest social mix in the inner city today is due to the social housing rent controls.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we expect gentrification to continue to transform the inner city to displace the remaining lower-income households not living in social housing. Much of Toronto’s inner city continued to change after the first phase of gentrification in the 1970s, and, because the forces reshaping housing demand are such fundamental drivers, they will continue to change the city and occasion the loss of more lower-priced housing. As the underused industrial sites in the inner city are built out, the pressure for more neighborhood renewal and redevelopment will increase. Replacement construction or extensive renovations will displace the remaining working-class population from the neighborhoods and after a while the early gentrifiers will also move out with windfalls if they owned their property or with long housing searches if they were renters.</p>
<p>Given the fundamental shift in the determinants of housing demand over the past forty years, attempts to stop the market’s response will likely prove the economists’ mantra regarding the impossibility of keeping water from finding its way downhill. City planning efforts can reduce the rate of change to the physical housing stock but cannot stop the occupancy transitions that give wealthy households the opportunity to live in low-density housing on prime downtown land. Gentrification is brought about by a fundamental shift in demand that reshapes the structure of cities and the problems it creates call for a response in the form of housing programs that secure tenure for their clients and ensure a moderate degree of social mix in the inner city.</p>
