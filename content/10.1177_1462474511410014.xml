<sec id="sec1-1462474511410014"><title>Anna Eriksson, <italic>Justice in Transition: Community Restorative Justice in Northern Ireland</italic>, Willan: Cullompton, 2009; 232 pp.: 9781843925187, £39.50 (hbk)</title>
<p>Anna Eriksson's new book <italic>Justice in Transition</italic> is about how community based organizations in Northern Ireland have assumed responsibility for addressing crime, anti-social behaviour and conflict in their local communities. It describes how the often violent political conflict in the north of Ireland created the opportunity to reclaim ownership of these problems from the State and its professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511410014">Christie, 1977</xref>). Its purpose is to assess the effectiveness of this example of ‘informalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511410014">McEvoy and Mika, 2002</xref>) based upon restorative justice.</p>
<p>There are two main community based restorative justice projects in Northern Ireland: Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI) based primarily in republican or nationalist areas and Alternatives Northern Ireland (Alternatives NI) based in loyalist or unionist areas. The conditions that facilitated the development of community based restorative justice in these areas included the ‘contested legitimacy of state policing’, paramilitary forms of public protection and punishment and the incidence of offending and anti-social behaviour typical of most deprived communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511410014">McEvoy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Eriksson has had contact with the community projects over a five year period. Her research is based primarily upon extensive interviews with practitioners (most of whom were ex-combatants). She had limited contact with young offenders and victims and interviewed a range of relevant stakeholders including politicians and representatives of statutory agencies. She also examined some quantitative data recorded by the various projects.</p>
<p>The book includes a brief literature review of restorative justice. Arising from this review, Eriksson outlines a theoretical framework for community based projects. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511410014">Roche’s (2003)</xref> four core values for restorative practice (personalism, participation, reparation and reintegration), she adds empowerment. This fifth value enables her to emphasize the importance of process over outcomes, which is central to her thesis that the existence of community restorative justice projects has a value in itself in a transitional society irrespective of other outcomes. As a result she devotes more attention to community than victim or offender.</p>
<p>This leads into an interesting chapter arguing for the relevance of both criminology and restorative justice to societies in transition. Eriksson makes the case for restorative justice offering a bottom–up approach to challenging cultures of violence and building relationships between communities and the State. She uses criminological research into crime prevention to argue in favour of informal social control in working class areas. She also discusses the negative aspects of informal social control in Northern Ireland, paramilitary punishments and vigilantes, out of which community restorative justice projects emerged.</p>
<p>Eriksson describes how the community based projects established their legitimacy through a process of debate and consultations at local levels. The involvement of ex-prisoners and combatants was crucial in gaining the authority required to break radically from a punitive form of informal social control. The connection with paramilitary organizations was also a source of opposition to these developments particularly from some political parties and certain statutory agencies.</p>
<p>Eriksson provides a range of statistics on the work of Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI) including sources of referrals, categories of cases and case statistics. Most of the work involved indirect mediation and referrals to other agencies. Around 15 per cent resulted in direct mediations. The cases that are described seemed closer to good social work than restorative practices focusing on repairing harm done to people.</p>
<p>Eriksson does not offer the same detail regarding statistics for Northern Ireland Alternatives due to lack of access to case files. During the period of the research the loyalist projects were more focused on young people subject to paramilitary threat though as time passed more diverse sources of referral emerged. These projects had also developed co-operative relationships with the police unlike the projects based in republican areas. Key activities included intensive youth work with young people under threat of paramilitary punishment, preventative work with young people at risk and work to meet victims’ needs. The project workers might work with young people for up to two years before they are ready to meet their victims. The projects do not deal with high risk cases such as violent or sexual offences.</p>
<p>Eriksson contends that the real value of community based restorative justice is changing embedded cultures of violence in local communities through a unique combination of leadership from ex-combatants, a grass roots ethos embodied by local volunteers and key restorative justice values. A huge effort to train large numbers of volunteers is the primary means of educating the community to turn away from ‘rough justice’. While levels of crime and anti-social behaviour continue to be high, paramilitary punishments have significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Eriksson devotes a chapter to the struggles between local communities and the State over social control and the ownership of justice. This chapter outlines the historical origins of this conflict and describes the protocols developed to ‘legitimize’ community based restorative justice projects. The following chapter demonstrates how the reform of the State, particularly the police service, presents community restorative justice with new challenges. Eriksson concludes that local communities contain high levels of social capital and collective efficacy and that they should be seen a resource to a modern criminal justice system rather than a threat.</p>
<p>This book has much to commend it. It provides an in depth description of how a grass roots initiative can challenge violence and support the transition towards a peaceful society. It adds to our understanding of the flexibility and potential of the restorative justice paradigm.</p>
<p>Eriksson poses but does not answer the most critical question. Is community restorative justice simply a product of a society in transition out of conflict? Will it then gradually disappear as the society becomes normalized and the state criminal justice system regains control?</p>
<p>Her methodology relied heavily on interviews with the managers and staff of the community based projects. These people were highly committed to and almost completely positive about their practices. The projects controlled her limited contact with young people and victims with whom they engaged. She does not seem to have observed practice and had limited access to recorded information in the case of Alternatives. As a result there is a lack of hard evidence for the quality and effectiveness of the restorative programmes. Such evidence may prove vital once the value of supporting transitional justice is redundant.</p>
<p>This idealized view of community based restorative justice may not ultimately serve the projects well. They face difficult times ahead. As the democratic reforms of the Northern Irish state become embedded, the criminal justice system will regain its confidence and will increasingly assert its authority over social control and justice. Community initiatives may be marginalized once more.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges community based restorative justice needs a critique of itself and an analysis of how grass roots organizations might sustain themselves once a society becomes normalized. This book does not provide such a critique or analysis and as a result is best seen as a fairly partisan historical record.</p>
