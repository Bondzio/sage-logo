<abstract>
<p>Media forms play a vital role in making cultural and political sense of the complex economic developments and profound ideological uncertainties which have accompanied the global recession. This article analyses how popular genre cinema tackles the inequalities – in particular, gender inequalities – that follow from the financial crisis, situating Hollywood’s representational strategies in the context of recessionary media culture. It posits and analyses two sub-genres which demonstrate different approaches to an altered socio-economic climate: the recessionary ‘chick flick’ and the corporate melodrama. Amid the financial crisis these sub-genres shift emphasis to respond to changing circumstances, notably in relation to the once-ubiquitous trope of choice central to post-feminist media culture; neoliberal choice rhetoric is now considerably harder to maintain. The two case studies contrast the different ways in which female-centred chick flicks and male-centred corporate melodramas address unemployment, downward mobility and the challenges of work–life balance.</p>

<p>In a culture where neoliberal ideas represent a widely circulating current, the free, ubiquitous and all-encompassing character of ‘wealth’ is a dominant theme. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413481880">Hall, 2011</xref>: 722)</p>

<p>While it might not be at the forefront of financial journalism or even wider media coverage of the downturn, gender is a key term in thinking about the consequences of the post-2008 financial crisis. To the extent that this unfolding recession has impacted on men and women in different ways, how are these differences being articulated by media culture? Given the tendency for gender to fall out of the picture – and indeed the frequent implication that equality and diversity are issues to be reserved for times of affluence rather than adversity – feminist scholarship at this particular moment needs to reiterate the ongoing influence of gender politics and make gender visible, particularly alongside other determining categories such as class and citizenship. While fields including economics, sociology, equality studies and others have much to contribute in the work of analysing the recession’s social economics, media studies offers a unique disciplinary pathway for interpreting recession culture, given its focus on the analysis of collective symbolic environments that hold enormous sway in shaping public views.</p>
<p>The news media in the UK and USA alike seem confused with respect to the differential fate of men and women in the so-called ‘Great Recession’. Certainly, there has been plenty of interest in scenarios of male crisis against a context of female achievement: interest which has focalised around <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549413481880">Hannah Rosin’s (2010)</xref> much-remarked <italic>Atlantic</italic> magazine article, ‘The End of Men’, which was developed in 2012 into a book, <italic>The End of Men and the Rise of Women</italic>. Suggesting the end of male dominance in education and management, Rosin’s dramatic, compelling catchphrase denotes fears of broad male economic and cultural obsolescence. Such eye-catching strategies are widely used in making sense of complex economic and social developments. Under the title ‘Men Hardest Hit by Recession’, a feature in the British Sunday broadsheet <italic>The Observer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549413481880">Batchelor, 2010</xref>), is illustrated with an evocative image featuring a man cleaning the home while clutching a bemused-looking baby under his arm. As the baby looks out at the reader, the man’s face is not shown, suggesting a representative, everyman status, while capturing a sense of male diminishment. The caption reads: ‘Debt-ridden and jobless, more men are left holding the baby while partners go off to work.’ Not that surprising perhaps, but for the fact that the accompanying story includes neither statistics on, nor discussion of male unemployment; similarly, the role of women or mothers as breadwinners is absent from the feature. Instead, the focus is on an apparent decline in male incomes within a recessionary context: the chair of the charity Consumer Credit Counselling Service, Malcolm Hurlston, is quoted as saying: ‘Men have been hard hit by the recession and are emerging as the new underclass … This deterioration in the economic circumstances for men, still the main breadwinners in most homes, has serious implications for many households’ (Hurlston, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549413481880">Batchelor, 2010</xref>). Whatever the content of the article itself, the usurped male breadwinner serves as a handy visual reference point, the image evoking an absent, haunting scenario of a father left holding the baby while his female partner takes his role in the workplace.</p>
<p>Such commonplace representation in news media suggests the extent to which unfolding economic events are filtered through capsule images and soundbites that, in turn, draw on longstanding cultural assumptions about men, women, work and parenting. Scholarly studies are drawn into this emerging narrative of disrupted gender norms and patterns of family life. News of a symposium on gender equity in the recession held at Cambridge University in 2009 was reported via news agencies such as Reuters. Making recourse to familiar gender scripts, the Fox News website used the event to anchor a feature headed ‘Recession Harder on Men Than Women, Study Says’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413481880">Fox News, 2009</xref>). The thrust of the argument is not that men are more likely to become unemployed, but that they are more anxious about that possibility, more prone to depression and less likely than women to recover psychological security on ‘finding an insecure job’. The sociologist Brendan Burchell is quoted thus: ‘men retain traditional beliefs that their masculinity is threatened if their employment is threatened’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549413481880">Fox News, 2009</xref>), a commentary that underlines the centrality of gender hierarchies in making sense of the effects of recession. Such tropes have proved a persistent feature of media coverage. In March 2011 <italic>Time</italic> magazine ran a feature speculating ‘Why the Recession May Trigger More Depression Among Men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549413481880">Park, 2011</xref>). The piece offers commentary on the kinds of employment hit by recession – for example, construction trades – along with longer-term trends such as technological innovation and outsourcing, processes that are ‘forcing more men than women out of work’. Drawing this time on psychology, the piece suggests that: ‘With men culturally shouldering the role of primary breadwinner for their families, unemployment hits men particularly hard, as their self-esteem, an important factor in depression risk, is often contingent on their role as provider’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549413481880">Park, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Across a wide rhetorical spectrum, then, the notion of men as particularly and singularly impacted by economic adversity has become culturally commonsensical and affectively potent. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549413481880">Heather Tirado Gilligan (2011)</xref> has pointed out, this is hardly a new phenomenon:<disp-quote>
<p>[E]nd-of-men crises have cropped up repeatedly since the late nineteenth century, until they have assumed almost mythic stature. They are most acute whenever there is an economic slowdown, often resulting in a backlash against women in the workforce, instead of a focus on the factors that lead to such downturns in the economy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549413481880">Tirado Gilligan, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Hamilton Carroll has noted that ‘white male injury, phantasmagoric though it may be, is a phenomenon that attempts to recoup political, economic and cultural authority in the face of a destabilized national consensus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549413481880">2011</xref>: 2). Rosin’s arguments on male decline have been skilfully rebutted by the social historian Stephanie Coontz, who shows that if anything, such accounts mask an increasing ‘convergence in economic fortunes, not female ascendence’. She asks:<disp-quote>
<p>How is it, then, that men still control the most important industries, especially technology, occupy most of the positions on the lists of the richest Americans, and continue to make more money than women who have similar skills and education? And why do women make up only 17 percent of Congress? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549413481880">Coontz, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pointing to an apparent cultural inability to critique the privileged male meaningfully, we argue here that many recessionary texts mobilise and give new force to longstanding tropes of white masculinity in crisis. For scholars concerned with gender and culture (such as Tirado Gilligan), the concept is familiar by now that crises of masculinity (like those of the economy) are a cyclical phenomenon. Indeed, it is possible to say that contemporary cinema regards masculinity as <italic>constituted by</italic> crisis. The priority accorded to male suffering is, we argue, particularly telling. In particular, the focus of attention on the middle-aged, middle-class white guy as the sign, symptom and victim of recession is a prominent feature of current media imagery of economic crisis. Put simply: women and young people who are impacted significantly by economic events do not have the media or cultural visibility that their situation warrants. Recessionary femininity is not routinely associated with crisis in the manner of masculinity; rather, it is presented often as adaptive and resourceful, if typically in domestic and consuming rather than public or professional contexts.</p>
<p>Our focus in this article is on the mediation of recession: the process of making the experience of insecurity, redundancy and the economic inequalities that are such an apparent feature of the recession culturally meaningful via genre cinema. While the news media use images such as the house-bound father as hooks to make sense of employment trends and cultural responses to them, such concerns are registered in Hollywood cinema in rather more elaborate ways. It is worth reiterating here that what the majority of us know (or think we know) about economic matters is garnered from a variety of popular media forms. Crucial to our argument is that journalism and the news media constitute only one dimension of this process. We maintain that it would be a mistake to attribute recessionary inflections only to news formats and those genres and forms historically associated with objectivity and neutrality. As the examples above testify, news media make extensive use of a visual/ideological repertoire which depends on conservative cultural assumptions. Moreover, fictional forms have proven to be particularly adept at rationalising the inequalities that thrive within neoliberal economies. Indeed, the ease with which women and young people have been marginalised within, or erased from, the cinematic discourse of recession, is striking.</p>
<p>With respect to gender, the presentation of an individual’s economic or social status as a result of choice is particularly remarkable. Notably, the representation of the at-threat male worker picks up on already established cultural themes of professional dissatisfaction. Building upon over a decade of cinematic representation in which crisis of masculinity has been a ubiquitous Hollywood formulation, and taken together with a neoliberal emphasis on choice and self-fashioning, male downsizing is refigured frequently as an <italic>opportunity</italic> for personal development. Male redundancy has functioned also as a source of comedy, presumably since being without productive labour renders a man ridiculous. For women, by contrast, work is not figured as an issue of identity in quite the same way. As Laurie Ouellette and Julie Wilson observe, US self-help commentators such as Dr Phil McGraw take ‘for granted that today’s women work outside the home to provide for their families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549413481880">2011</xref>: 552), even while downplaying ‘careers’ and paying only minimal attention to paid jobs. In media discourse, that is, women’s paid work is presented as an activity undertaken primarily on behalf of others.</p>
<p>Our focus here is on US popular culture, both for its concentrated power and appeal to privileged constituencies and its high transnational circulation. American popular forms play a significant role in shaping not only US but also European understandings of the recession, its significance and consequences. These two elements are not easily disentangled. To put gender into the frame of recessionary culture means taking account of both official reports and their presentation in news media; we need to factor for underlying trends and patterns, but also to understand the contradictory ways in which media commentary makes sense of these developments. As we hope to show, when it comes to gender this has as much to do with the elision of certain features of the recessionary picture, as it does the foregrounding of others.</p>
<p>In order to elaborate these concerns, we explore two emerging sub-genres of American cinema, each of which foreground a distinctly gendered account of recession: the recessionary ‘chick flick’ and the corporate melodrama. The former showcases new femininities, while the latter centres on reshaping men and masculinity for a recessionary context. Each makes use of the downturn as a setting in which the central characters must respond to the cultural and economic uncertainties of recession. Each adapts already familiar generic conventions – those of the post-feminist romance, American melodrama and the office movie – for a recessionary context, characteristically turning to well-worn gendered scripts to make sense of changing times. Evidently aware of contemporary economics and culture, yet with an eye fixed on the past, both the recessionary chick flick and the corporate melodrama are simultaneously nostalgic for, and discontented, with traditionally gendered hierarchies and spaces (the masculine workplace, the feminine domestic sphere). For example, although the corporate melodrama insists on the vitality of male labour and the culturally destructive consequences of white-collar male redundancy, typically it is predicated on assumptions about the bleak emptiness of a corporate world which is aligned with greed and the pursuit of wealth. Recession-era corporate melodramas such as <italic>The Social Network</italic> (dir. David Fincher, 2010) and <italic>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</italic> (dir. Oliver Stone, 2010) do not reject wealth and status by any means (indeed, they are obsessed with it), but the most sympathetic male figures are always those for whom money itself is not the primary goal.</p>
<p>In their recognition of inequalities and attempt to insist that these can be overcome via a combination of tried-and-tested gender scripts and US entrepreneurial spirit, these genres exemplify both post-feminist media culture and the contortions of neoliberalism. Indeed, post-feminism proclaims for gender what neoliberalism advocates in a broader sense: both assert that the individual bears ultimate responsibility for their social status. The prevailing cultural emphasis on individualism and choice – whether expressed via self-fashioning or entrepreneurial endeavour – seems increasingly tenuous when it is made without reference to the economic conditions in which choices are made. Yet, the cultural investment made by post-industrial societies in these values, and the consumerism that underpins them, have proven difficult to dislodge. It is apparent that choice is a fundamentally gendered domain, not least when ‘women are expected to be enterprising subjects who work for pay [as] well as caring for families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549413481880">Ouellette and Wilson, 2011</xref>: 560). As numerous commentaries on post-feminist culture have demonstrated, popular culture schools women (and indeed men) in making the ‘right’ choices around work, domesticity, reproduction and relationships. As economic circumstances become so intensely straitened, we must ask whether these gender scripts are being modified, and if so how: to what extent do conservative cultural forms such as Hollywood genre cinema acknowledge the contradictions of contemporary gender culture when they are placed under stress? Moreover, we suggest that these particular sub-generic forms distinctly articulate some of the ways in which ‘the promise of the good life no longer masks the living precarity of this historical present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549413481880">Berlant, 2011</xref>: 196).</p>
<p>One of the most distinct representational trends in contemporary Hollywood has been the centralisation of the ‘boy-man’. Played by a succession of stars including Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Matthew McConnaughey and Hugh Grant, the ‘boy-man’ arguably operates as the most distinctive prototype of contemporary media masculinity. While the boy-man type in comedy has been persuasively analysed by Brenda Weber as centralising ‘fraternity-type puerile humor in stories geared toward adolescent male audiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549413481880">2011</xref>: 70), neither the centrality of such characterisation in melodrama, nor the fate of this figure in the recession, have received particular scrutiny. Clearly, the outsider or underdog status of the archetypal frat-pack construction of masculinity chimes with the melodramatic iteration of ordinary men as the biggest losers, in recession-themed films such as <italic>The Company Men</italic> (dir. John Wells, 2010). Writing just before the onset of recession, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549413481880">David Denby (2007)</xref> astutely shows how the couple comprised of the infantilised male and his hyper-responsible, high-achieving female partner is founded on economic cynicism. In the ‘slacker–striver romance’ formula, the male figure recognises that contemporary aspirationalism is a rigged game and withdraws from playing it; his female counterpart has not yet realised this. We contend that such fictional representations must be situated within a broader discursive matrix of ‘falling white men’ which has made political and economic jeremiads on cable television news (performed by histrionic figures such as Glenn Beck and Jim Cramer) a prominent form of contemporary spectacle. Given the new urgency attached to economic responsibilities and roles, there is a need to investigate how popular genres and forms such as Hollywood’s ‘slacker–striver couple’ signify in dramatically changed global circumstances, and indeed shed light on particular national conditions of reception for texts of this kind. US film and television is characterised frequently as being globally hegemonic, but as scholars such as Barbara Klinger have shown, such straightforward assessments need to be significantly complicated, subject as they are to ‘diverse decodings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549413481880">2010</xref>: 112) as they circulate through international markets.</p>
<p>Once one pays attention to the gender implications of recession, there rapidly accumulates an expanding amount of material which can be considered under the rubric of recessionary culture. Surprisingly, discourses of gender have been just as significant, if not more so, within these texts than those of class, which might be expected to dominate (Hollywood cinema continues to actively suppress racial inequalities and take a romanticised approach to issues of class). Some of the texts we discuss here, such as <italic>The Company Men</italic>, have a clear relationship to the recession: downsizing and corporate job losses are the overt content of this film. Other examples have a less explicit or obvious relationship to recession. Whether the recessionary context is implicit or explicit, we seek here to foreground the centrality of discourses of gender in the way that the financial crisis is figured, and in the sorts of fantasies of accommodation and resolution offered in certain forms of popular cinema.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is not the case that the economic unravelling of September 2008 inaugurated a series of entirely new representational tropes, but one of the premises of this analysis is that new modes of gendered expressivity are coming to the fore in recessionary popular culture, and that pre-existing archetypes are being inflected in new ways. In short, we argue that there are significant continuities with the gender discourses of boom culture as well as features that seem more particular to a recessionary moment. Media forms as diverse as feature films, reality television, financial journalism and advertising manifest highly gendered responses to the global financial crisis. Of course, any comprehensive mapping of the complex media ecology of the recession is impossible here. Instead, we focus on two developments that we take as indicative of wider representational changes, and which media studies has yet to account for: the emergence of male-centred corporate melodrama, and the highly routinised production of chick flick romantic comedies and dramas that acknowledge but maintain a strange dissonance with their recession context. While these are not necessarily the generic sites that critics might immediately turn to for an articulation of themes of power and inequality in recessionary times, we contend that they constitute crucial forms within which a process of cultural sense-making currently is being conducted. As a system that produces entertainment through exploiting familiar conventions in novel ways, genre cinema has long been understood as revealing both cultural anxieties and the fantasised solutions which emerge in response to them. Our formulation of genres of inequality attempts to pinpoint popular cinema’s naturalising of gender hierarchies, a process that we take to be particularly acute in recessionary times. The restatement of traditional gender scripts forms one response to a challenging economic context. Within the contemporary chick flick, inequality is increasingly part of the recessionary social landscape in which the female characters must operate.</p>
<sec id="section1-1367549413481880">
<title>The recessionary ‘chick flick’</title>
<p>In many respects, the cinema of the recession can be seen to be redoubling its efforts to secure conservative ideological territory, with recent themes and tropes focusing on the reconstitution of the insecure midlife couple, the vigilantism of male patriarchs and female post-feminist crimes of ambition. In <italic>Hall Pass</italic> (dir. Bobby and Peter Farrelly, 2011), <italic>Date Night</italic> (dir. Shawn Levy, 2010) and <italic>Couples Retreat</italic> (dir. Peter Billingsley, 2009), middle-class couples whose lives are being incrementally impacted by recession undergo experiences of exoticism that confirm their preference for suburban domesticity. In one of the recession’s largest word-of-mouth hits, <italic>Taken</italic> (dir. Pierre Morel, 2008), and in films such as <italic>The Next Three Days</italic> (dir. Paul Haggis, 2010), avenging fathers and husbands track missing daughters and wronged wives while highlighting the economic travails and insecurities of their own position. Female-centred narratives in prestige categories such as <italic>Black Swan</italic> (dir. Darren Aronofsky, 2010) seek to make art out of the pathologisation of female ambition and rigor; more pedestrian productions such as <italic>How Do You Know?</italic> (dir. James L. Brooks, 2010) suggest that when work is no longer available, women face compulsory marriage. Perhaps the most striking element across the vast majority of these films is the way that they register a desire to get away, and the necessity of coming back (a narrative dynamic also at work in some of the most high-profile female-centred films of the post-boom, including <italic>Sex and the City 2</italic>, dir. Michael Patrick King, 2010, and <italic>Eat Pray Love</italic>, dir. Ryan Murphy, 2010).</p>
<p>The urban romance, the most recurrent form of the contemporary chick flick, is poorly suited on the whole to conceptualise new social and economic inequalities. Such concerns are out of sync with the typical commitments of a genre whose female protagonists teeter with alarming frequency between euphoria and melancholia. A category still heavily populated by variants of the ‘manic pixie dream girl’ type whose exuberance, vibrancy and light-hearted relation to life counterbalances a serious, burdened male protagonist, the chick flick typically generates an affective economy in which the achievement of romantic intimacy forecloses all other concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549413481880">1</xref></sup> In general, the chick flick has maintained an imperviousness to the recession, largely continuing to trade in hyper-consumerist spectacle, situating itself exclusively and unself-consciously in environments of urban affluence and privilege, and glorifying the elimination of feminism from the ‘life-scripts’ of its female protagonists. This all may seem unsurprising; indeed, it complies perfectly with conventional wisdom that in periods of economic duress, Hollywood renews its charge to gratify audiences through escapism. However, it should be noted that female unemployment and underemployment is on the rise in the chick flick.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549413481880">2</xref></sup> The most prominent example is <italic>Bridesmaids</italic> (dir. Paul Feig, 2011), whose protagonist Annie – as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367549413481880">Figure 1</xref> – stands disconsolately outside her failed Milwaukee bakery early in the film, contemplating her financial and emotional losses, and whose subsequent chronicle of misfortune proceeds in tandem with her loss of rewarding paid work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549413481880">3</xref></sup> More recently, <italic>What’s Your Number?</italic> (dir. Mark Mylod, 2011) opens with its protagonist Ally being let go from her job, a development about which the film is studiedly neutral. This event factors only insofar as it gives her opportunities to spend more time with the neighbour who will become her partner, and helps her to realise that her calling is to make small figurines staged into urban scenes. In both films we come to understand the female protagonist’s unemployment as effectively a manifestation of her relationship failures, and although neither Annie nor Ally find work, they are placed proximate to weddings in conclusions that suggest that they themselves will soon be economically and ideologically stabilised through marriage. Yet both conclusions are marked by an over-the-top performativity that renders them tenuous and unpersuasive. This performativity is also nostalgic, encompassing the surreal reassembly of 1990s pop act Wilson Philips in <italic>Bridesmaids</italic>, and in What’s Your Number? the performance of the Cars’ 1980s hit ‘Just What I Needed’ by the central couple. These films’ trite recourse to the imagery of earlier eras belies the social optimism that characterises functional romance. The chick flick’s strained efforts to resolve female downward mobility through bridal fantasy bear noticing, if we are to understand fully its current shape and structure.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367549413481880-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Strikingly, the recession is separating the contemporary chick flick from one of its most beloved tropes, the woman who gives up her job. For example, one of the most commercially successful chick flicks of the recession, <italic>The Proposal</italic> (dir. Anne Fletcher, 2009), culminates with a last-minute reversal in which the male protagonist declares his love for his female boss, clearing the way to a green card marriage that enables her to keep her position as a publishing executive. In a film such as <italic>I Don’t Know How She Does It</italic> (dir. Douglas McGrath, 2011), adaptational change is key, as great liberties are taken with the ending of the bestselling book on which the film is based, in order to allow the protagonist to keep her demanding banking job rather than resigning and moving to the country, as in the source text. Thus, one of the chick flick’s manifestations of awareness of a changed economic climate is that it can no longer blithely separate women from work in the fashion of numerous earlier films in the genre, from <italic>You’ve Got Mail</italic> (dir. Nora Ephron, 1998) to <italic>13 Going on 30</italic> (dir. Gary Winick, 2004).</p>
<p>It may be that the chick flick is beginning to relinquish the most obvious manifestations of the commitment to idealised retreatist domestic bliss which has anchored it ideologically for 20 years. However, its conclusions remain characteristically artificial and highly unconvincing. The strained romances of many recent chick flicks (where the couple manifest an obvious and sustained awkwardness with one another, or where a transparently ‘hollow’ ending is put across), show signs of an increasing desperation to codify heterosexual intimacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367549413481880">4</xref></sup> Customarily attributed to the deficient skills of creative personnel and/or the lack of discernment of their female audiences, the genre’s shortcomings might be understood more productively within a broader contemporary crisis of how to conceptualise intimacy. Lauren Berlant usefully observes that intimacy is ‘formed around threats to the image of the world it seeks to sustain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549413481880">2000</xref>: 7), and in this regard the genre’s creative limitations may be broadly linked to a new sense of precariousness. The chick flick’s typical isolation of its female protagonist and placement of her within a devaluing social world are gestures that amount to a kind of narrative privatisation: neoliberal manoeuvres that emphasise the social security of coupledom. In this respect, the recessionary chick flick strikingly substantiates Henry Giroux’s point that within discourses of privatisation, ‘there are no public or systemic problems, only individual troubles with no trace or connection to larger social forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549413481880">2011</xref>: 592–593).</p>
<p>That being said, there are signs that the chick flick might be losing a degree of confidence in the couple as a symbolic unit charged with the resolution of social problems. The industry’s inability to generate couples who are plausible and interesting enough to carry a film in recent years is hinted at in the recent trend toward compendium romances either pre-sold in every conceivable way, such as <italic>The Jane Austen Book Club</italic> (dir. Robin Swicord, 2007) and <italic>He’s Just Not That Into You</italic> (Ken Kwapis, 2009), urban branded, as in <italic>Paris, Je T’Aime</italic> (dir. Olivier Assayas et al., 2006) and <italic>New York, I Love You</italic> (dir. Fatih Akin, 2009), or based on holiday-timed marketing premises substituting for narrative concepts, as in <italic>Valentine’s Day</italic> (dir. Garry Marshall, 2010) and <italic>New Year’s Eve</italic> (dir. Garry Mars<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549413481880">hall, 2011</xref>). Such cinematic pan-romances hysterically assemble and reassemble numerous couples of various ages, ethnicities and social class positions in an apparent bid to cover all demographic bases.</p>
<p>We might go further and note that the chick flick of recent years manifests significant uncertainty about the broader social sphere out of which, historically, the romantic couple has emerged. The simulated and emotionally neutral nature of cinematic romance in the recession is typified by a film such as <italic>Friends With Benefits</italic> (dir. Will Gluck, 2011), in which the male and female members of the central couple summon a flash mob of strangers at different points, in a display of social capital that serves only to demonstrate the estrangement of the couple from any plausible notion of the public sphere. Through gestures such as these <italic>Friends With Benefits</italic> contrives a civic endorsement of the couple, but such gestures ring hollow, serving only to illustrate the couple’s utter disconnection from civic life. Here, the couple do not emanate from or transcend the crowd through their uniqueness, talent or any singular qualities; they are simply apart from it. Films such as this bespeak the hard edge of the chick flick in recent years, as the form moves away from the destiny clichés and scenes of enchantment that were ubiquitous in the 1990s and early 2000s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367549413481880">5</xref></sup> Standard denunciations of the chick flick as a bankrupt narrative form rest on obliviousness to a key fact: staging the egalitarianism of the couple and presenting it as representative of a broader unified public has become a more difficult narrative task in an era marked by the conspicuous proliferation of social inequalities.</p>

<title>The recessionary corporate melodrama</title>
<p>In contrast with the chick flick’s tentative engagement with recessionary conditions, the corporate melodrama, a sub-genre preoccupied with the power dynamics of the workplace, is a site which explicitly grapples with the inequalities of a recessionary context. While the boom years celebrated wealth, achievement and conspicuous consumption in sites from lifestyle television to celebrity culture, typically cinematic representations of corporate endeavour have been less ostentatious in character. Indeed, as we have suggested, the figure of the frustrated white-collar male worker already had become a recognisable type in Hollywood films of the 1990s. Films such as <italic>Fight Club</italic> (dir. David Fincher, 1997), <italic>In the Company of Men</italic> (dir. Neil Labute, 1997) and <italic>American Beauty</italic> (dir. Sam Mendes, 1999) have been extensively analysed by film and cultural studies scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549413481880">Giroux, 2001</xref>). Such scenarios exploit an evident mismatch between an alienating experience of white-collar work and the celebration of wealth and consumption which characterised boom culture. In these films, men’s jobs do not fuel opulent lifestyles or provide fulfilling work. Of 1990s office films, Latham Hunter writes:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e can be sure that while these films successfully recreate the dehumanizing conditions of office work, they offer no plausible way out of these conditions (aside from escaping the office altogether, which effectively silences the possibility of dissent in corporate culture). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549413481880">2003</xref>: 84)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367549413481880">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A decade later, the comic book adaptation <italic>Wanted</italic> (dir. Timur Bekmambetov, 2008) demonstrates the continued resonance of these conventions. The movie’s downtrodden male office worker, Wesley Gibson, is terrorised by a harridan female boss who is figured as overweight, drawing on a culturally familiar repertoire aligning excess consumption and physical disgust. Gibson is rendered simultaneously grotesque and pathetic – unmanly – before discovering an unsuspected and fantastical capacity for action and violence as an assassin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367549413481880">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Corporate melodrama represents Hollywood cinema’s most persuasive articulation of workplace frustration. It presents scenarios of victimised men, whether they are subjected to corporate corruption, conspiracy or the more mundane scenario of redundancy. Like the fantastic and equally melodramatic form of action cinema (as in the scenario of <italic>Wanted</italic>), corporate melodrama situates a hardworking male hero against forces which stand for a ruthlessly unyielding economic context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367549413481880">8</xref></sup> In corporate melodrama, anxieties about recession are displaced onto and articulated through contradictory gendered discourses which suggest that the corporate environment is both a site of power and authority, and fundamentally incompatible with American manhood. A short scene midway through the film in which two executives share a cramped elevator with a female cleaner evokes the uncomfortable class hierarchies of financial corporations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367549413481880">Figure 2</xref>). Significantly, while films such as <italic>The Social Network</italic> (dir. David Fincher, 2010) and <italic>Margin Call</italic> (dir. J.C. Chandor, 2011) suggest that the corporate world is unfulfilling or uninteresting to men, they remain unwilling to cede positions of authority to women. Thus in <italic>Margin Call</italic>, it is the female executive Sarah Robertson, rather than Jared Cohen, who is sacrificed in a reckoning with the markets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367549413481880">9</xref></sup> Such a dilemma plays out somewhat differently in <italic>The Social Network</italic>, where Mark Zuckerberg’s ambition is both tempered by a seeming indifference to the Harvard business model, and underpinned by casual misogyny.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1367549413481880">10</xref></sup> The film’s final scene conveys both vast personal wealth and personal isolation, as Zuckerberg is imagined obsessively refreshing his ex-girlfriend’s Facebook page, indecisively hovering over the decision to send her a friend request. Such a dual position, suggesting both a desire for material success and dissatisfaction with the terms of the corporate world, comes to define corporate melodrama with its evocation of, in Linda Williams’ phrase, ‘a hero who is also a victim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549413481880">Williams, 1998</xref>: 58). In this manner the corporate melodrama echoes some of the strategies evident in the recessionary chick flick, displacing economic anxieties onto emotional turmoil.</p>

</fig>
<p>When the financial collapse occurred, Hollywood had developed powerful tropes already by which white-collar work was figured as deeply alienating, indeed effectively feminising, for men. A film such as <italic>Michael Clayton</italic> (dir. Tony Gilroy, 2007), preceding the economic meltdown, mobilises many of the tropes through which subsequent corporate melodramas would operate. Clayton is a corporate fixer in financial trouble who finds himself enmeshed in company politics and personal danger. The film embodies corporate intrigue in the figure of Karen Crowder, dwelling on her ruthlessness and insecurity, and suggesting how firmly established an equation between female achievement and male disempowerment had become. The opposition of Clayton and neurotic company executive Crowder maps male disempowerment against the figure of (undeserved) female success in now-familiar ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1367549413481880">11</xref></sup> At the same time, Clayton’s gambling and family debts render him financially vulnerable, casting him as both corporate insider and sympathetic economic outsider.</p>
<p>Contemporary gender culture tends to assume that gender equality is achieved, that women face few or no social and institutional obstacles. Such an assumption is accompanied frequently by an implication that having achieved the right to equality in work and relationships, what women desire most often is something else: that professional success is not fulfilling in and of itself. Particularly relevant here is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549413481880">Diane Negra’s (2008)</xref> work on retreatism: a formulation which, as argued previously, has become increasingly unsustainable in the contemporary economic context. If, as Negra argues, retreatist scenarios in women’s films and romantic comedies suggest women’s choice to install themselves as subservient partners in couples – indeed, a suggestion that they discover their true selves in doing so – then are men correspondingly positioned as compelled to take up a place of authority? As these questions suggest, the coupling of male frustration in work to female achievement or even female presence takes on new resonance in the context of corporate downsizing. This is crucial, since so many recession-era films focus on middle-class men as the prime subjects of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Significantly, just as post-feminist media culture plays on middle-class women’s sense that professional success does not deliver, films and media culture betray a sense that for men, work is not a space that is particularly compatible with the sort of gender identity to which they aspire. Media invitations to ‘man up’ in the recessionary context seem ambiguous in their appeal. Male-centred comedies, as in <italic>The Hangover</italic> franchise (dir. Todd Phillips, 2009, 2011), frequently celebrate at least a temporary flight from the sort of responsibility which defined traditional breadwinner masculinity. Of course, flight is only a relief if the comic male characters are making a choice to avoid working life and domestic responsibilities. Anxieties regarding the consequences of male redundancy – not an escape, but a rejection – extend already existing discourses in contemporary gender culture by which representations of high-achieving female workers function as a sign of social crisis. However, they also chime with the theme of corporate environments as unmanly sites of subjection. Thus, if the recessionary chick flick typically avoids sustained commentary on female unemployment (often figuring financial problems as relationship problems for protagonists), within the corporate melodrama redundancy is portrayed frequently as a life-changing experience for male characters.</p>
<p><italic>The Company Men</italic> explicitly addresses a recessionary context via its focus on three male executives who are made redundant during the downsizing of the company for which they work; in the process each must manage the personal and financial consequences. Ultimately, redundancy is refigured as an opportunity for the male protagonist to reconsider his priorities and to reconnect with his family. Thus, choice and control are central themes. The film’s tagline is indicative of an emphasis on agency in times of austerity: ‘In America, we give our lives to our jobs. It’s time to take them back’, and as may be seen, its key promotional image thematises the precariousness of labour in decisively gendered terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367549413481880">Figure 3</xref>). Each of the three male protagonists are at different points in their careers and articulate different responses to redundancy. The youngest, Bobby Walker, is the film’s main character. A somewhat self-satisfied figure, Bobby is initially in denial on losing his job. Imagining that he will secure a new position immediately, he refuses his wife’s attempts to adopt thrifty practices of the kind associated with recession-era femininity. Subsequently Bobby must sell the family home, move in with his parents and accept a job offer from his brother-in-law, builder Jack Dolan, with whom he has a hostile relationship. In a somewhat hackneyed move, manual labour proves redemptive for Bobby, who comes to appreciate his wife and children and to understand the true value of home and family. Jack’s status as a good man in hard times is signalled by a quiet willingness to lose money on contracts rather than stop working or let his employees go. An ordinary American writ-large, Jack’s blue-collar labours support Bobby, effectively facilitating a melodramatic transformation narrative that culminates in a reinvigorated return to the (suitably downsized) corporate workplace.</p>

</fig>
<p>Bobby’s narrative of transformation through unemployment and manual labour is played out against the other stories explored by the film. In a pivotal scene, fellow executive Phil Woodward, unable to deal with unemployment or to find another position, takes his own life. This event in turn forces into action the third of the three men on whom we focus in the film, Gene McClary. For him, the crisis brought about by downsizing is less to do with financial uncertainty, and more about disappointment at his exclusion from the company that he had worked to build, as well as regret at the passing of heavy industry. Following Phil’s suicide, Gene tours Bobby around deserted shipyards, mournfully remarking: ‘We used to make something here, back before we got lost in the paperwork.’ Gene’s humanity is contrasted with the values of his erstwhile partner, James Salinger, a figure whose enslavement to the share price results in waves of job losses, even while money is poured into a new high-status headquarters building. In a nostalgic fantasy resolution, the film concludes with Bobby arriving to work at the small shipbuilding company established by Gene (ironically enough, using a credit card). Such a hopeful ending is far from the norm within corporate melodrama; yet the rather more cynical <italic>Margin Call</italic> similarly features an evocation of a more productive past, with redundant risk analyst Eric Dale’s reflective lament on his former life as an engineer.</p>
<p>As a corporate melodrama, <italic>The Company Men</italic> tellingly repositions the figure of the boy-man of Hollywood comedy as an innocent victim of the Great Recession. Its focus on middle-class, mid-life white men as the primary victims of the downturn is notable, as is its barely suppressed anger towards women in the workplace. Once again, these themes are variations on existing scenarios. George Clooney’s role as Ryan Bingham, a dismissal specialist in <italic>Up in the Air</italic> (dir. Jason Reitman, 2009), involves the performance of a now-familiar double-move that characterises Hollywood cinema’s construction of suffering or dysfunctional elite men. Bingham grows up, after a fashion, in the film. Initially cast as a tragic boy-man figure, with his relevance called into question by an upstart young female colleague, Natalie Keener, Bingham’s way of working is reinstated at the film’s conclusion, even though it is also called into question to some degree. The tension between Bingham and Keener stems from whether the work of firing people should be managed in person or via video link. It is clear that Bingham’s commitment to the former is in part a selfish desire to continue his life on the road, to avoid the office and the computer screen: his sideline as a motivational speaker extolling the virtues of travelling light emotionally is a clue to his questionable moral status. Yet it is telling that the film’s women are both ruthless and inconsistent. Alex Goran is first revered and then reviled for her role as a female version of Bingham, taking pleasure in sexual encounters during business travel; his impulsive desire for a romantic connection with her results in a shock discovery that she has a life and a family of her own, and that she exists beyond their hotel liaisons. Keener, by contrast, seems flawed in being inconsistent in her ruthlessness. Accompanying Bingham on a business trip to fire personnel, Keener is unsettled by the consequences of their actions (a woman commits suicide following redundancy) and by events in her personal life (her lover rejects her in a text message, an echo of her own advocacy of technology to enact redundancies). Thus she ultimately departs the business that she had been so keen to rationalise, paving the way for a conclusion that re-secures, albeit in melancholy fashion, Bingham’s corporate way of life.</p>
<p>The appropriate attitude of women towards the child-man across numerous films and several Hollywood genres is one of unstinting support coupled with moderate critique. <italic>The Company Men</italic>’s recessionary tale of downsizing enacts a scenario of transformation and redemption which depends on highly conventional gender performance. Bobby’s refusal of his new status as ‘just another asshole with a resumé’ is expressed in terms of refusal to accept offers of help and his wife’s attempts to cut family expenditure or to seek work. Significantly, this is allied to a deeply problematic attitude towards women: an attitude evident in other Hollywood films dealing with recession-era culture (such as <italic>Up in the Air</italic>). Bobby’s most vocal anger is reserved for women. Indeed, this has become conventional within the lexicon of commercial cinema, where female executives given any prominence are codified as cold and unfeminine. Bobby’s disdain is directed at two women in particular: Joyce Robertson, an African American recruiter who looks over his application for a position, and Sally Wilson, the GTX executive who oversees the downsizing programme. Bobby repeatedly leaves abusive phone messages for Sally, while his brief meeting with Joyce Robertson ends in him shouting, swearing and angrily walking out, after making an acerbic comment about her weight. Bobby clearly bridles at being considered for a position at half his previous salary; when it becomes clear that Joyce is not looking at him for the vice presidency that he considers to be his entitlement, Bobby protests (‘<italic>I’m</italic> a highly qualified applicant for that position’). Good women in corporate melodrama are those who nurture and support childish men; they make few demands in their own right and their professional advancement is not at issue. So <italic>The Company Men</italic> draws a clear contrast between high-flying Sally Wilson and supportive wife Maggie Walker. Phil Woodward’s wife, by contrast, insists that he conduct a pretence that he is still in work: her lack of support implicitly contributes to his suicide. The patient support and love offered by Maggie Walker seems to represent the film’s model of appropriate recessionary femininity. Similarly, in <italic>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</italic>, Winnie Gekko, troubled and angered by her fiancé’s fascination with her discredited and estranged financier father Gordon Gekko, is ultimately a supportive and nurturing rather than challenging figure.</p>
<p>Christine Gledhill writes that ‘melodrama’s challenge lies not in confronting how things are, but in asserting how they ought to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549413481880">1987</xref>: 21). In this context, corporate melodrama articulates if not a wholehearted critique of consumer culture, then at least an anxiety that financial success is an empty marker of status. Thus the primary problem for Bobby, Phil and Gene in <italic>The Company Men</italic> is that they have too much: their possessions and financial commitments oppress them, removing them from labour as an activity that is meaningful. The opening montage moves from exteriors of vast homes through shots of luxury cars to interiors filled with consumer goods. Bobby has borrowed heavily to pay for a lifestyle of lavish holidays, a large house, golf club membership and a Porsche; his melodramatic transformation involves being gradually stripped of these signs of status. However, the moral here is not to do with the dangers of a credit-driven economy, but the dangers of men’s dependence on consumption to define their sense of self. When Bobby tells Maggie, ‘I need to <italic>look</italic> successful’, we understand that his appearance-focused priorities are all wrong – hence the film’s nostalgic recourse to manual labour as a process that redeems the melodramatic protagonist. In a less upbeat ending, <italic>Margin Call</italic> portrays Sam Rogers bitterly agreeing to another two years of service because he ‘needs the money’, while executives who have been fired are paid to stay in a room while the company covers its tracks. Earlier in the film, Trading Desk Head Will Emerson casually explains to two awestruck junior analysts just how easy it was to spend the $2m he earned the previous year. Thus, while men seemingly take money for granted in the corporate melodrama, nonetheless its loss is a source of regret.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the years since the global financial crash, conservative cinematic institutions such as Hollywood have acknowledged persistent inequalities of necessity, at least to some degree. We have begun here the work of considering Hollywood genre filmmaking in this light, attending to its ability to articulate or disarticulate conundrums of class, downward mobility, economic uncertainty and the increasingly evident limitations of global capitalism in its current incarnation. Highlighting two recurrent generic formulations in recent Hollywood output, the female-centred urban romance and the male-centred corporate drama, we have sought to map some of the ways in which broadly-felt social experiences of contingency and states of uncertainty are being grafted onto established narrative formulae. While the recessionary chick flick broadly downplays the significance and consequences of female unemployment (sometimes sketching female work struggles as significant only insofar as they correlate with relationship problems), the corporate melodrama presents male redundancy in dramatic terms, both as a tragic scenario and as an opportunity for personal reinvention. In this way, economic citizenship is significantly gendered: financially-beset male characters in the corporate melodrama oppose female chick flick protagonists whose work is not sufficiently valued for economic concerns to carry real narrative weight. Yet for all their differences, these two sets of films are alike in the ways that they join together a muted, frequently tentative, but nevertheless distinct acknowledgement of the dissatisfaction, and even dissent, of citizens. They also share a habit of trying out fantasy resolutions to the structuring inequalities of a neoliberal society.</p>
