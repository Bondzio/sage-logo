<abstract>
<p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an increasingly common chronic medical condition that affects not only patients but also their families. Because family dynamics, particularly the family life cycle, can and does influence the disease process, those providing counseling to CFS patients and their families would do well to recognize these dynamics. CFS as a disease process is experienced differently throughout the family cycle. This process is described and illustrated with case material.</p>

<p>Although it has only recently been recognized as a medical condition, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an increasingly common chronic disease. It is a condition that affects not only patients but their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711429426">Sperry, 2006</xref>). Because there is no specific laboratory test or clinical signs for CFS, accurate prevalence data are not available. However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711429426">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2002)</xref> estimates that as many as 500,000 people in the United States have CFS or a CFS-like condition. It has also been observed that CFS is diagnosed two to four times more often in women than in men.</p>
<p>This article begins with a brief description of the medical aspects of CFS. It then describes various family dynamics associated with this condition. Chief among these is how this medical condition is experienced at different stages of the family life cycle. Also addressed is the value of couples and family counseling in the treatment of CFS. Case example illustrates these points.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711429426">
<title>Medical Aspects of CFS</title>
<p>CFS is a clinically defined condition characterized by severe disabling fatigue and a combination of symptoms that prominently features self-reported impairments in concentration and short-term memory, sleep disturbances, and musculoskeletal pain. CFS is a relatively recent condition and remains somewhat of a controversial medical condition. Because its diagnosis is typically made only after other medical and psychiatric causes of chronic fatiguing illness have been ruled out, it is referred to as a diagnosis by exclusion. Even though there are no pathognomonic, that is, characteristic and definitive, signs of this disorder, or diagnostic tests for are currently available, the following definition was developed by a national task force and published in the prestigious <italic>Annals of Internal Medicine</italic> and is accepted by many in the medical community. CFS is defined by the presence of the following: (a) clinically evaluated, unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue that is of new or definite onset (has not been lifelong); is not the result of ongoing exertion; is not substantially alleviated by rest; and results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities; and (b) the concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms, all of which must have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have predated the fatigue: self-reported impairment in short-term memory or concentration severe enough to cause substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities; sore throat; tender cervical or auxiliary lymph nodes; muscle pain; multijoint pain without joint swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; nonrefreshing sleep; and postexertional malaise lasting more than 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711429426">Fukuda et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>There is yet to be consensus on the risk factors for CFS. Although CFS was originally thought to be triggered by the Epstein–Barr virus, the cause of mononucleosis, and other viral conditions such as herpes and polio, CFS has been shown to be noncontiguous. There is a growing speculation that the actual cause is a combination of a weakened immune system and the presence of a virus and one or more of the following risk factors: chronic candidacies; a history of recurrent use of antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, that is, the class of drugs know as NSAIDS such as Tylenol, Motrin, and Celebrex; chronic infections such as sinusitis or prostatitis; chemical exposure or sensitivity to cigarette smoke, perfume or paint fumes, or other chemicals; leaky gut syndrome, a diet high in sugar and caffeine, and so on.</p>
<p>For many sufferers, CFS begins after a minor illness such as a cold, the flu, or during a period of high stress. Unlike flu symptoms, which usually go away in a few days or weeks, CFS symptoms continue on and off for more than 6 months. Reported symptoms include headache, tender lymph nodes, fatigue and weakness, muscle and joint aches, and inability to concentrate.</p>
<p>The clinical course of CFS varies from person to person. For most, CFS symptoms reach a certain level and become stable early in the course of illness and thereafter come and go. Some individuals get better completely, but it is not clear how frequently this happens. Emotional support and counseling can help the individual and significant others cope with the uncertain outlook and the waxing and waning of symptoms and energy level of this illness.</p>
<p>Medical treatment may include a trial of an antiviral drug such as Zovirax. Antidepressants sometimes help improve sleep and relieve mild, general pain. Some individuals benefit from other drugs for acute anxiety or for dizziness and extreme tenderness in the skin.</p>
<p>While self-management protocols are still being developed, several health behaviors appear to be useful in symptom reduction and even resolution of the condition. These include a balanced diet; adequate rest; regular exercise that does not cause more fatigue; limiting stress; pacing oneself-physically, emotionally, and intellectually; and emotional and spiritual health recommendations. A balanced, whole foods diet, that is, one emphasizing quality protein and complex carbohydrate such as organic vegetables, whole grains, beans, fish, eggs, and poultry. Sugar, caffeine, dairy product, alcohol, aspartame, and refined carbohydrates such as white flour and rice are to be avoided. Walking and mild aerobic exercise along with mild stretching is the preferred exercise regimen. Since psychological factors can be prominent, particularly depression, a number of mental and emotional health techniques may be indicated: stress reduction methods such as controlled breathing and biofeedback. Others include, massage and bodywork therapies, journaling, planned retreats and vacations, and creative activities such as art and music. Since CFS involves a depletion of life force energy, it can be thought of as a spiritual condition. Some spiritual disciplines or techniques as prayer, meditation, gratitude and acceptance, and forgiveness might serve to strengthen the individual’s immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711429426">Sperry, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1066480711429426">
<title>Family Systems Dynamics in CFS</title>
<p>Although cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in improving the symptoms of CFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711429426">Price, Mitchell, Tidy, &amp; Hunot, 2008</xref>), the family systems approach provides an integrated vision of various levels influencing the medical condition, both at its onset and during its development. The importance of the systemic approach becomes evident when considering various family dynamics. For example, an afflicted family member’s explanatory model (beliefs regarding one’s illness) and the social environment both contribute to the severity of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480711429426">Vercoulen et al., 1994</xref>). Of particular note is that unresolved relational issues and loss tend to remain dormant in a marriage and suddenly emerge when triggered by a medical condition in the current nuclear family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429426">Penn (1983)</xref> indicates that coalitions that emerge in the context of a chronic medical condition can be isomorphic of those existing in each partner’s family of origin.<disp-quote>
<p>If a mother has been the long-time rescuer of her mother from a tyrannical husband, and then in her own family bears a son with hemophilia, she will become his rescuer, often against his father. In this manner, she continues to rescue her mother but, oddly enough, now from her husband rather than from her own father … In this family with a hemophiliac son, the father’s father had been ill for a long period and had received all the mother’s attention. In his present family, this father, though outwardly objecting to the coalition between his wife and son, honored that relationship, as if he hoped it would make up for the one he had once forfeited with his own mother. The coalition in the nuclear family looks open and adaptational (mother and son), but is fueled by coalitions in the past (mother with her mother, and father with his mother) …. (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote>In this article, the family systems model is helpful in identifying the family dynamics associated with CFS. This theoretical model was first applied to CFS by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429426">Goodwin (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429426">2000</xref>). A central family dynamic for understanding chronic medical conditions, like CFS, is the family life cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480711429426">
<title>Impact of CFS on the Family Life Cycle</title>
<p>In family life cycle models, the family is viewed as developing in progressive stages that include periods of imbalance related to the persons involved and their environment. The resulting instability provokes a shift to a new state, in which the family will have to develop new tasks and aptitudes.</p>
<p>While there are various family life cycle models, the family systems-illness model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711429426">Rolland, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711429426">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711429426">1994</xref>) provides a clinically useful framework for assessment and intervention with families that are facing chronic medical and life-threatening conditions. This model is most useful in conceptualizing the psychosocial demands of a medical condition on patients and their families over time. The ability to recognize and differentiate between periods of greater and lesser psychosocial demand can lead to improved care for patients with chronic, disabling disease. In addition, the model is helpful in predicting a family’s response when facing medical conditions that have differing onsets and courses. For example, many families can more effectively respond to diseases with an acute onset and limited course and full recovery, such as a viral infection, than families faced with a chronic medical condition that has a gradual onset and a relapsing or episodic course that does not reach full recovery.</p>
<p>Because of the relapsing course or most chronic medical conditions, families need sufficient resources to reorganize itself constantly, since it will be necessary to alternate stable periods of variable duration with mild symptoms and periods of exacerbation, called flares. To accomplish this, two kinds of family organization are needed, one for periods of improvement and others for exacerbations. Although a number of chronic medical conditions have an episodic course but are not life threatening, such as CSF, they can be very demanding for families in psychosocial terms. The unpredictable nature of these diseases can lead to overprotection on the part of the family, as well as certain secondary benefits for the patient, particularly if they are childhood diseases.</p>
<p>When faced with these transitions, two types of family styles are seen in relation to the patients: centripetal and centrifugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429426">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429426">Beavers &amp; Voeller, 1983</xref>). Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429426">Combrinck-Graham (1985)</xref> proposed a family life model in a spiral, in which the entire family system in three generations fluctuates over time between periods of high family cohesion (centripetal) and periods of relatively low family cohesion (centrifugal). These periods coincide with variations between tasks of family development that require intense links and high cohesion, such as raising small children, and tasks that place emphasis on personal identity and autonomy, such as adolescence. The most important fluctuations in a complete life cycle include childhood and adolescence, that is, birth and adolescence of the children and birth and adolescence of the grandchildren.</p>
<p>Generally, the appearance of a disease such as CFS leads to a centripetal attraction, pushing the processes of individual and family development toward a transition with increased cohesion. However, if the onset of CSF coincides with a centrifugal period in the family, for example, in Stage 1: Leaving home, the disease can be disruptive. The inherently greater demands for cohesion in CFS will be in conflict with the naturally lower demands of a centripetal phase in the family life cycle. It may mean that a young adult with CFS returns to the family home to receive support and care related to their medical condition. Or, it may mean that an individuating young adult with CSF may not achieve a fuller level of independence because that individual assumes some or much responsibility for the care of a parent who is also experiencing a chronic medical condition.</p>
<sec id="section5-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>For Joy, CSF is a devastating and invisible medical condition. At the age of 30, she is attempting to cope with her father’s Parkinson disease as well as her own CFS. Because a stroke has left her mother, Ann, partially paralyzed, the mother is only able to provide limited care giving for Joy’s father. While Joy endeavors to be independent and live alone without outside help, increasingly she has borne the brunt of responsibility for her father’s care. While she can provides adequate care for him when she is less stressed and fatigued, other times she cannot and then feels guilty. During the counseling process, the focus was on what she could continue doing rather than what she was unable to do. She was also encouraged to ask for help and to step back from care giving and take care of herself when fatigued without feeling guilty. These were changes she could not previously allow herself.</p>
<p>The life cycle of a family with a chronic medical condition like CFS typically passes through the following stages: leaving home; commitment to a couple relationship; parenting the first child, living with an adolescent; launching the children; and retirement and old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429426">Haley, 1973</xref>). Needless to say, each of these stages provides unique challenges to family members, however, the challenge is heightened when a chronic medical conditions is present.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480711429426">
<title>Leaving Home</title>
<p>The challenge facing young adults in this stage is simultaneous involvement with both their parents and their peers. Adapting to family challenges may impede their normal development with persons their own age. Achieving a level of independence is not complete until the young adult begins to live away from home and establish intimate relationships outside the family. In the current economic downturn, difficulties in attaining economic independence often delays this process as young adults often continue living at home instead of preparing themselves for a separate life. Parents can let their offspring go or perpetually retain them within the family organization. A diagnosis of CFS in this phase could lead to several behavioral shifts. The young adult’s development and independence from the family might be delayed because of a lack of initiative with others, such as when a girlfriend or boyfriend leaves them because of the illness, parental overprotection, or because of difficulties finding a job.</p>
<sec id="section8-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Cynthia was 20 years old when she was diagnosed with CFS. Although she had worked as a waitress for several restaurants, she had difficulty maintaining a job due to periods of extreme fatigue. She was an only child and even though her parents insisted that she be employed, they also believed that they had to protect her because of her illness. Despite being unemployed because of her symptoms and fearing that she was not following the trajectory of a career and living on her own like her friends, she was able to achieve some personal independence by broadening her social network and initiating a special friendship with a young man.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1066480711429426">
<title>Forming a Stable Couple Relationship</title>
<p>In this phase in which a committed couple relationship is established, the partners must establish several pacts. These include defining boundaries with their respective families and other social systems, for example, friends and coworker, and clarifying rules including communications patterns. The diagnosis of CFS in this phase can be devastating for a couple that is not fully consolidated. Because CFS has an episodic course, the more the fluctuations, flares, or symptom changes, the greater the need for adaptation in the family system. By committing themselves to the relationship, partners accept the necessity to respond to the needs of the other when necessary. With a chronic medical condition like CFS, the normal roles can change, with one partner becoming the caregiver, and the other the patient. When the patient expresses vulnerable emotions such as fear, sadness, or anxiety, the caregivers are likely to interpret these as indicators of need and they feel compelled to offer help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711429426">Graham, Huang, Clark, &amp; Helgeson, 2008</xref>). When the roles become too rigid, they can trap the two partners: one strong-solicitous-healthy and the other weak-demanding-ill.</p>
<sec id="section11-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Some 2 years later Cynthia, who was introduced in the case example above, married Robert. The two had met over a year ago. Robert’s mother suffers from lupus, so he has some familiarity with what it is like to live in a family with a chronic medical condition. However, because his father and older sister were, and remain, the primary caretakers for his mother, he has no first-hand experience with that role. There first months together were increasingly stressful for the couple. While it was agreed that Cynthia would not work outside the home, Robert expected her to do housekeeping, prepare meals, and be available to him sexually. These expectations were experienced by her as “demands” which only increased her stress and exacerbated her symptoms. Three or more days a week she would be in bed when Robert arrived home from a demanding job. The house would not be cleaned, dinner was not ready and after they argued sexually intimacy was out of the question. Both agreed to couples counseling. In the first sessions, expectations, rules, and boundaries were discussed and revised. Robert also agreed to attend a support group for partners of CFS patients.</p>
<p>Effective couples counseling can foster the necessary adaptability needed by these couples. Efforts to keep both partners as active participants in the relationship so that one partner is viewed primarily as a caregiver and the other as a passive recipient of care is essential. Furthermore, effective couples counseling encourages reasonable involvement of the families of each partner. When one or both families become excessively involved, it becomes more difficult for the couple to achieve the independence required of the next stage, bearing children.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1066480711429426">
<title>Birth of Children</title>
<p>In this stage, when the committed couple bears children, they must find new ways to relate to each other. Not only do the rules change, a new family subsystem is formed, the parental subsystem. Childbirth necessitates more distancing of the couple from their families of origin, while at the same time involving proximity because the two families are joined by this event, as grandparents, aunts, and uncles are created.</p>
<sec id="section14-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Jenna was 22 when she was diagnosed with CFS. Now at the age of 27, she is considering having a baby with her partner. Her father’s three heart attacks and her CFS led her to delay this decision. Also, the birth of her sister’s second child rekindled her desire to become a mother herself. But she did not have sufficient strength to do it alone and she sometimes felt insecure with her partner and particularly, with her in-laws, who doubted both the validity of her medical condition and her level of impairment. When she became confident enough to better handle stress in her life and to ask for help from her partner, several changes occurred. First, her overprotective attitude toward her father decreased, she began to drive a car, her social network expanded, and she and her partner became more committed. As a result, she felt more confident in her quest to become pregnant.</p>
<p>The couple must take care that the members of their respective family systems of origin do not interfere with their functions as parents or undermine their family organization. For instance, it is not uncommon following childbirth that CSF symptoms intensify and the new mother becomes frustrated because she cannot care for her newborn child alone. She may feel increasingly tired and exasperated with the task of child rearing, which can be complicated by a father who is unavailable because of job demands or possibly, to escape from the tension at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429426">Kagel, White, &amp; Coyne, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>If the medical condition affecting a parent is particularly debilitating, its impact on the childrearing family is twofold. First, the ill parent becomes for the family like another child with “special needs,” and competes with the other children for scarce family resources. Second, a parent is “lost,” and for all practical purposes a single-parent family is created. While somewhat challenging for higher functioning families, this situation can have devastating consequences on less functional families wherein increased reliance on community services and separation and divorces are not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429426">Kagel et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Sometimes the child is the symptomatic family member, and in this case, there may be considerable alterations of the family activities. Family life may become focused exclusively on the needs of the ill child. These children can grow to be apprehensive and overly dependent on their parents, whereas the mothers become highly solicitous and emotionally implicated. In fact, high levels of family stress and exaggerated dedication can place undue attention on the physical symptoms and unintentionally prolong their duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711429426">Van de Putte et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Mental stress and excessive emotional implication of parents are predominant aspects in CFS and are more marked in this condition than in other chronic pediatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429426">Rangel, Garralda, Jeffs, &amp; Rose, 2005</xref>). There is increasingly greater consensus in modern pediatric practice that the child’s health is influenced by the family structure, dynamics, and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711429426">Van de Putte et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1066480711429426">
<title>Living With Adolescents</title>
<p>In the fourth stage, the children have become adolescents, the couple’s initial difficulties have resolved with time, their vision of life has matured, and stable relationships have been forged with their families of origin and with each other.</p>
<sec id="section17-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Jeff was 38 years and had spent his nearly 20 years working as a mechanic until he had to leave his job because of CFS and a back injury. Although he qualified for disability, he grieved the loss of gainful employment and because his wife, Laurie, now had to assume all family responsibilities. He was particularly concerned about their 16-year-old daughter who was living at home and was expecting a child with her boyfriend, Jack, who had recently had been deployed to Afghanistan with his marine battalion. Jason and Laurie had discouraged their daughter from dating Jack because he was 5 years older than their daughter. In her rebellion, she acted out sexually and become pregnant. The stress of anticipating an infant in the household only exacerbated Jeff’s condition. In family counseling, he learned to lower his expectations of himself and his daughter, avoid isolation by extending his social network, and relinquish the role of provider and head of the household to his wife. Not surprisingly, these circumstances and roles had previously exacerbated his fatigue.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a couple at this stage achieves some degree of the stability by adopting rigid, repetitive patterns of interaction to resolve or to avoid creating problems. However, when the children are grown and the family changes, these patterns may be inappropriate and are likely to create crises that oblige the couple to decide whether they will continue together or separate. Unfortunately, such rigid patterns of interaction established with the passing of time make it difficult to adapt the system to the new needs of this stage of the life cycle.</p>
<p>Growing children are increasingly less dependent on the parental subsystem, and parents with CFS must begin to seek other activities to fill their lives. Since many CFS patients cannot work or enjoy many leisure activities, the situation becomes complicated. In addition, “hierarchal” problems usually arise because the children are going through adolescence. The patient may not be able to cope with the burden of this stage and the boundaries of the parent–child subsystem may break down. As couples approach mid-life, the high levels of stress associated with multiple obligations related to the family roles and changes can have a negative impact on marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711429426">Gagnon, Hersen, Kabacoff, &amp; Van Hasselt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711429426">Kovacs, 1988</xref>). Couples who are able to successfully negotiate these transitions in the postparenting years are likely to experience increased marital satisfaction and remain together into old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429426">Christensen &amp; Jacobson, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1066480711429426">
<title>Launching Children</title>
<p>Families can experience a crisis when their children leave home. Couples can face a turbulent period that progressively abates after their children have gone and the couple creates a new relationship with corresponding new rules and boundaries. They can resolve remaining conflicts and allow their grown children to have partners and professions, while as a couple they prepare for the transition to the role of grandparents. This entails learning how to be good grandparents and create new rules so that they can participate in the life of their children and be able to function on their own at home. Typically, they will have to face the loss of their own parents in this period, and the sorrow this implies.</p>
<p>A common challenge in this stage is that the couple finds that they have little to share with each other. For years their conversation has been centered on the children. They may begin to argue about the same things that were issues before they had children. These issues were not resolved at that time, and were put aside with the arrival of the first baby. The presence of a chronic disease such as CFS only exacerbates these unresolved issues. Couples counseling is particularly useful as the couple can continue coping with the adaptations of daily life this syndrome requires.</p>
<sec id="section20-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Jerry, age 49, has been married to Jill for 27 years. Over the past 3 years, Jerry has become increasingly disabled by CFS and diabetes–type II. Their only child, Justin, had uneventfully left home when he graduated from a local college 5 years ago and soon afterward married. Since then Jerry and Jill have had a stable marriage in which both maintained many outside, independent interests. In short, they had moved smoothly through the transition to a more centrifugal phase of the family’s life cycle. However, as Jerry’s chronic medical conditions became worsened, he was forced to stop working and went on disability. This effectively reversed the normal process of family disengagement. Jill took a second job that necessitated her quitting her hobbies and civic involvements. Justin and his wife moved into the neighborhood to assist with the care of his father and the family home. Jerry felt himself to be a burden to everyone. The essential goal of family counseling centered on reversing some of the family system’s centripetal overreaction back to a more realistic balance. For Jerry, this meant a reworking of his life structure to accommodate his real limitations while maximizing a return to his basically independent style. For Jill and their son, this meant developing realistic expectations for Jerry and reestablishing key aspects of their autonomy within a family system dealing with a chronic medical condition.</p>

<title>Retirement and Old Age</title>
<p>Withdrawal from active life can mean that the couple is face-to-face, 24 hr a day, a fact that can create friction. One problem that may arise in this stage is excessive protection of one member over the other, thereby enhancing a debilitating somatic syndrome, such as CFS.</p>
<p>One positive alternative to somatization in retired couples is to increase the activities they carry out together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480711429426">Vinick &amp; Eckerdt, 1990</xref>). Solitude can be a risk factor for physical inactivity in persons of advanced age and predicts discontinuing physical activity over time, which will worsen the symptoms of CFS. Being married is associated with a higher probability of being linked to behavior patterns that enhance health, such as exercise, perhaps because partners exert a certain influence on this behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429426">Pettee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section23-1066480711429426">
<title>Case example</title>
<p>Some 12 years later Jerry, who was introduced in the case example above, continued on disability but now he and Jill were living in a retirement community. After 30 years, Jill retired with a full pension and the couple decided that it was too difficult to maintain their household by themselves. Some 6 months before their son was job transferred to another city. Up until he and his wife moved, Justin had taken care of bills and managed all repairs of his parents’ house. The decision to move to a retirement community with an assisted living unit was simple, Jerry’s health had continued to decline, especially diabetic complications including neuropathy and blindness in one eye. Jill’s retirement meant less stress on her and their marriage, more time for caregiving, and more quality time with Jerry. This included involvement in various activities available in their new community. No longer concerned about sufficient income and house repairs, both were able to enjoy their older years together. They now had two grandchildren and were able to visit them regularly since they were within 2 hr driving distance.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that this classification is only an approximation and cannot be applied to all the emergent family models, which are becoming increasingly more prevalent, such as reconstituted families, single-parent families (single women with children), couples without children, and couples of the same sex, in which CFS can also appear. Cultural and gender-related aspects should also be taken into account when the family as a group is being evaluated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From the family systems perspective, when a chronic medical condition is diagnosed, it is important to identify operative family dynamics. This article has emphasized how stage of the family life cycle can provide a useful lens to assess specific family dynamics and focus treatment. An important therapeutic objective of couples counseling and family counseling is to assist families in achieving a reasonable degree of adjustment to that stage without letting the appearance of CFS result in a sacrifice of personal development of some members, or of the family as a system.</p>
