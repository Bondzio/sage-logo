<abstract>
<p>A total of 31 siblings, aged between 5 and 16 years, of children with a life-limiting condition, participated in a longitudinal, mixed method study. Data collection included standardised psychometric measures and visual and participatory qualitative methods. Emotional functioning and perceptions of self-worth were normative on standardised measures. Qualitative data indicated distinct psychosocial strategies that appeared to underpin functioning, positioning themselves as adults within the family, adopting a role of ‘social glue’ in key relationships and thereby diminishing their own needs, and compartmentalising home and school life. Some strategies appeared adaptive in the short term but may be limiting in the longer term. The implications for professionals working to support families are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Life-limiting conditions in childhood are typically incurable, and sufferers are likely to die before adulthood or have limited expectation of life into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312456324">Association of Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions and their Families/Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 1997</xref>). Life-limiting conditions are characterised by progressive deterioration and increasing dependence on parents and carers. Families living with such conditions describe their experiences as ‘navigating uncharted territory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312456324">Steele, 2002</xref>) given unpredictable yet unrelenting deterioration in their child’s condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312456324">Menezes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Living in a family where a child has an illness or disability can detrimentally affect the social and psychological functioning of healthy siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312456324">Rossiter and Sharpe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312456324">Sharpe and Rossiter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312456324">Williams, 1997</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of psychological functioning in children whose siblings have a chronic health condition found a small but statistically significant negative effect suggesting siblings of children with chronic illnesses exhibit more internalising and externalising problems than siblings of healthy children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312456324">Vermaes et al., 2012</xref>). For individual studies, the nature, magnitude and basis of this effect appear variable; reported effects vary from high levels of prosocial behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312456324">Horwitz and Kazak, 1990</xref>), increased compassion, maturity and closer family relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312456324">Sloper, 2000</xref>), to conduct problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312456324">Fisman et al., 1996</xref>) and internalising disorders or emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312456324">Sahler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312456324">Taylor et al., 2001</xref>). While much research on the effects on siblings has been conducted in relation to chronic or life-threatening conditions, very few studies have focussed on life-limiting conditions such as muscular dystrophy or Batten’s disease. A recent study on psychosocial adjustment in siblings of young people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy reported that siblings have an increased risk for emotional problems, although the majority scored within the normative range on measures of emotional and behavioural functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312456324">Read et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests that some, but not all siblings, may be coping well in families where a child has a life-limiting condition, although it remains unclear what factors might be conferring risk or protection to siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312456324">Garmezy, 1985</xref>). Associations exist between emotional difficulties and burden of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312456324">Barlow and Ellard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312456324">Read et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312456324">Sharpe and Rossiter, 2002</xref>); yet involvement in care is also felt to be important in positive outcomes for healthy children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312456324">Sloper, 2000</xref>). Exploring how siblings manage their experiences, as well as understanding the longer term sequel to using particular coping strategies, could improve support for siblings and families with an ill child.</p>
<p>The research question underpinning this study was ‘what are the experiences of siblings of children with life-limiting conditions and how do they cope with those experiences?’ We examined the situated, day-to-day lives of siblings; how coping and adaptation may be enacted and how experiences may promote or inhibit well-being. A qualitatively driven, longitudinal, mixed method approach was utilised, whereby the quantitative measures established a context for interpreting and validating aspects of the qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312456324">Moran-Ellis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The guidelines for conducting ethical bereavement research were used to inform the design and conduct of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312456324">Parkes, 1995</xref>). Ethical approval was granted by Leeds (East) National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Recruitment was via a regional children’s hospice in the North of England that supports approximately 350 families with a variety of life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses. A total of 57 families with a child with a life-limiting condition and with at least one healthy child were identified through a hand search of hospice records. Parents of these 57 families were contacted by letter to seek consent to invite their healthy child(ren) to participate in the study; of these, 19 did not respond, 8 declined consent and 30 (52.6%) consented. Consenting families were visited in their home by the first author, and the well children were invited to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 44).</p>
<p>Of these, 31 children (70.5%) consented (<italic>M</italic> (mean age) = 9.9 years, standard deviation (SD) = 2.96) and 13 (29.5%) declined (<italic>M</italic> = 9.5 years, SD = 3.73). The final sample consisted of 31 healthy children from 21 families. The number of participants was considered suitable for a qualitatively driven analysis; it is suggested that 20–30 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312456324">Creswell, 1998</xref>) or 30–50 interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312456324">Morse, 1994</xref>) are sufficient to achieve data saturation. While the sample was not purposively selected, the final sample contained sufficient diversity across important variables to allow for an exploratory qualitative analysis using a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312456324">Starks and Brown Trinidad, 2007</xref>). Participant age at study start ranged from 5 to 15 years (<italic>M</italic> = 9.6 years). Thirteen (42%) of the 31 participants were female, and all were White British except for one who was of Pakistani origin. Fourteen participants (45%) were younger than their ill brother or sister. The time since referral to the hospice (which generally occurs once a diagnosis of a life-limiting condition has been established) ranged from 1 to 14 years (<italic>M</italic> = 4 years). During the course of the study, 13 (42%) siblings had a brother or sister who died.

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>This was a qualitatively driven, longitudinal, mixed method approach. Participants were visited once a year over 3 years. At the first visit, a brief demographic questionnaire and standardised measures (explained below) were completed. At the second and third visits, qualitative data were collected from the participant, and standardised measures were repeated.</p>
<sec id="section5-1359105312456324">
<title>Qualitative data collection</title>
<p>Participatory approaches, combined with semi-structured interviews, were used at visits 2 and 3.</p>
<p>At visit 2, photo-elicitation was used to facilitate a narrative discussion on sibling experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312456324">Harper, 2002</xref>). Participants were asked to take photographs of people, things and places that were important to them (a disposable camera was provided). They were invited to talk about each photograph, why they had taken it and what they wanted to tell us about it. A button selection task was then used to explore participants’ sense of self both individually and in relationships with others. This task was based on clinical techniques used to explore feelings about relationships with adaptations modelled on the concept of relational maps and reflective techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312456324">Bagnoli, 2009</xref>). From a large selection, participants were asked to choose buttons that represented themselves and other family members and to position them in a ‘family of buttons’. Participants were asked to talk about their button choices and its positioning. Following this, a semi-structured interview was administered. The interview schedule was informed by a pilot study with four bereaved siblings (<italic>M</italic> = 10 years) and 12 hospice staff, through which five topics of importance in living with a sibling with a life-limiting condition were identified: self-perception, fitting in, family relationships, feelings and emotions, and thoughts about the future. The interview explored these if they had not been discussed during the previous tasks. Questions included the following: What do you think your mum would say if I asked her to describe you? Can you tell me a little bit about your friends? I would like you to think of a recent situation where you felt upset, what did you do? However, in practice, the questions were generally interwoven into the previous tasks.</p>
<p>At visit 3, only a semi-structured interview was conducted. This explored experiences since the previous visit, which, for some, included bereavement or a significant deterioration in their sibling’s condition.</p>
<p>The discussions generated during the participatory methods and interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312456324">
<title>Standardised measures</title>
<p>Two measures, described in the following, were administered at each of the three visits with the third measure being administered only at the final visit. The measures were to be completed by the individuals alone; however, where needed, for younger participants, the items were read out by the researcher.</p>
<list id="list1-1359105312456324" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</italic> (SDQ; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312456324">Goodman, 1997</xref>)). The SDQ is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire assessing behaviours, emotions and relationships. The SDQ consists of 25 items that contribute to five scales: a prosocial scale, a hyperactivity scale, an emotional symptoms scale, a conduct problems scale and a peer problems scale. In addition, a total difficulties scale can be calculated by summing up all the scales except the prosocial. The score in each scale can range from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater difficulties, except on the prosocial scale where a higher score is indicative of greater strength. The self-report SDQ has been shown to discriminate between low-risk and high-risk samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312456324">Goodman et al., 1998</xref>), and the reliability of the scale is satisfactory, with reported internal consistency of .75 and retest stability after 4–6 months of .62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312456324">Goodman, 2001</xref>). When used as a screening tool in community samples, multi-informant SDQs have shown specificity of 94.8 per cent and sensitivity of 63.3 per cent when identifying individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312456324">Goodman et al., 2000</xref>).

This is a collection of age appropriate questionnaires and pictorial scales that tap a child’s perception of himself or herself across a number of different attributes and competencies. Responses are grouped into a number of subscales that include scholastic competence, social acceptance, athletic competence, physical appearance and behavioural conduct. A final subscale gives an assessment of global self-worth. Scales are scored from 1 to 4, where 4 represents the most adequate self-judgement. The SPP has acceptable internal consistency reliability with each subscale scoring over .75 across a number of community samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312456324">Harter, 1985a</xref>).

<list-item><p><italic>Kidcope</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312456324">Spirito et al., 1988</xref>). This is a brief coping checklist that identifies the coping strategies utilised by children and young people and gives an indication of how effective they felt that particular strategy to be in dealing with their problem. The measure is in two parts. First, the child is asked to identify a specific difficult situation and rate it in terms of the distress caused. The main part of the measure then asks the child to rate the frequency and efficacy of alternative coping strategies utilised in relation to the identified stressor. The main part of the scale contains 15 items that correspond to 10 possible coping categories: distraction, social withdrawal, cognitive restructuring, self-criticism, blaming others, problem-solving, emotional regulation, wishful thinking, social support and resignation. A frequency score of present or absent is given for each category and a corresponding efficacy score that ranges from 0 (‘not helped at all’) to 2 (‘helped a lot’). Kidcope was completed by siblings on the final visit only.</p></list-item>

<p>Transcripts were first examined individually, line-by-line, for meaning units (i.e. portions of text that appeared meaningful in the context of the research question), and codes were applied to capture that meaning. Codes with similar properties were then grouped into categories. Constant comparison and scrutiny of apparent negative cases assisted the analysis by demarcating the boundaries of codes and establishing theoretical links between categories. In this way, major themes within the data were identified.</p>
<p>Analysis was discussed iteratively between the three authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312456324">Madill et al., 2000</xref>). Coding checks for assessing code reliability were performed with two raters, blind to the purpose of the study. Raters assigned a code (from a list of 10) to a random sample of 30 meaning units. An option of not assigning a code was offered. Cohen’s kappa coefficients of .69 and .78 were obtained, suggesting substantial agreement between coders. Where discrepancies existed, meaning units had been assigned to codes that were linked conceptually to the actual code in the final theory.</p>

<title>Standardised measures</title>
<p>Responses to the three standardised measures (SDQ, SPP and Kidcope) were classified according to the manual procedures for each. The analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 14). Descriptive statistics explored the range of responses and were compared to normative or community-based data for each measure. Results were used to contextualise the interview data and were integrated into the qualitative analysis to inform the model of sibling adaptation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The outcomes of the standardised measures when combined suggested that siblings’ behaviour, emotional functioning and self-perceptions were normative. Results from the self-report SDQ indicated that the siblings’ emotional and/or behavioural symptoms were within the ‘normal’ range on all scales. The mean Total Difficulties Score for the group was 14.48 (SD = 6.899, range = 1–27), which just falls within the normative range of 0–15. Parental reports on the SDQ gave a mean Total Difficulties Score of 13.59 (SD = 6.74, range = 3–28), which placed the group at the upper limit of the normal range for this measure (0-–13). Participant-level SDQ Total Difficulties Scores are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312456324">Table 1</xref>.The results of the SPP indicated that siblings had high feelings of self-worth; 70 per cent scored above the norm (stratified by age and gender) on the global self-worth scale.</p>
<p>These findings are consistent with the outcomes of the grounded theory analysis in which an overarching theme of <italic>protection of sense of self</italic> was identified, which subsumed a range of strategies the siblings were deploying to adapt to, and cope with, their brother’s or sister’s illness. However, there were indications in both the standardised measures and qualitative data that, while these strategies appeared functional in the short term, they may become problematic in the long term. The following section details the themes developed from the grounded theory analysis with reference to data from the standardised measures where appropriate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312456324">Table 2</xref> gives an indication of the breadth and depth of the themes within the sibling transcripts.</p>

<title>Protection of sense of self</title>
<p>‘Protection of sense of self’ unified three key themes of <italic>compartmentalising life, positioning in the adult world</italic> and <italic>self as glue in relationships</italic>, which together embodied the different ways siblings worked to protect their self-perception. The three themes represent forms of coping and adaptation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1359105312456324">
<title>Compartmentalising life</title>
<p>A prominent feature of participants’ accounts was the feeling that their childhood was a substantive departure from normality, which engendered feelings of difference and of ‘standing out’. For example, Tracey’s choice of button in the button task was driven by feelings of difference:
<disp-quote>
<p>[The button] stood out from the rest of them. It was one of the biggest ones and a big bold colour and I think that’s like I am. I sometimes think that I am a bit different and I stand out from the other girls in the class. Really ‘cause of [sibling] and I go to a hospice, people don’t normally do that.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another participant, Will, contrasted himself to his friends in his photographs:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s just like that they are normal, they don’t, they don’t have a worry in the world about their brother or whatever.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To experience normality, siblings reported seeking and enjoying compartmentalisation between home and other aspects of their lives (usually school).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t like to mix the two together. I think it’s just a different time at home, you have school time and you have home time … I just keep the two separated. (Sally)</p>
<p>When I am at school I’m different. I don’t have to worry about things, you know. Well I do, but not as much. I can be myself and everything. (Paul)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Compartmentalising life</italic> was also prominent in siblings’ management of their concern for their ill-sibling’s future, as well as in their ways of coping with the loss of a sibling. Notably, compartmentalisation in this regard was temporal in that it involved determination to live in the present and avoid rumination on the past or anxious thoughts about the future:
<disp-quote>
<p>I blanked it out as soon as she died. (Jeff)</p>
<p>I tend not to think about it [sibling getting worse], I just wait for it to happen and then think. (Tom)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Compartmentalising could be considered a lack of engagement with, or avoidance of, the stressor. Results from Kidcope seem reflect a heavier reliance on avoidant strategies with distraction (95% of respondents), wishful thinking (90%), resignation (81%) and social withdrawal (62%), being the most commonly reported coping strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105312456324">
<title>Self as glue in relationships</title>
<p>All siblings characterised themselves as caring and loving and reported caring duties within the family (e.g. as a companion to their sibling, feeding, bathing, dressing or toileting). As one sibling explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I’m] very quiet, shy, but I care about people around me … I think it reflects what I see at home really. (Tracey)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While it may be argued that ‘self as caring’ is a likely self-characterisation for many people, these siblings had a very strong perception that looking after others was a significant part of their role. Indeed, Sally was called ‘mum’ by her friends. Siblings also reported actively avoiding arguments, ‘never really falling out with anyone’ (Samantha) and acting as peacemaker if disputes did arise, both at home and at school. In this way, siblings tended to see themselves as the glue in familial and peer relationships, a perception often coupled with a heightened sense of personal responsibility, even for events outside of their control. For example, Sally reported a disproportionate sense of responsibility for her mother’s partner leaving after an argument:
<disp-quote>
<p>It just makes me think if I had of, cause I was gonna pick [sibling’s] stuff up but I had to get dressed. It just makes me think if I had picked stuff up then none of it would have happened.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Scores on the SDQ reflected this; self and parent ratings on the prosocial scale both scored siblings towards the top end of the normative range of 6–10. In perceiving themselves to be social glue, siblings reported deprioritising their own needs to accommodate others and often silenced their own emotions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see [the rest of the family] as more important than me, like they would always come first. (Sally)</p>
<p>I try not to make them upset. I silence bits of my life. (Tracey)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There was a strong sense that siblings felt they had to be emotionally self-sufficient, as illustrated by Sally:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I am hurt or anything I tend to keep everything bottled up, I don’t tend to tell anyone. People like at school get scared if I am upset. If I am not loud or talkative they are like ‘right what’s wrong with Sally, why is she not talking or anything?’ So people get quite scared of it because they are used to seeing me as happy and I dunno, I think I put on a front, I dunno, like a happy front to keep everyone else happy.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Paul also reported keeping his feelings to himself and trying to sort his problems out alone rather than bother others:
<disp-quote>
<p>I bottle it up. I don’t, I just let myself deal with it, I don’t tell anyone else. It saves going to see my mum about it. I don’t, I just, I’ll have a sleep, keep it to myself and try and sort it out myself. I do things like that, I do it all the time. I don’t, I hardly ever speak to anyone, you know what I mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1359105312456324">
<title>Positioning in the adult world</title>
<p>Caring responsibilities for their brother or sister often meant that siblings had to forgo other activities and some indicated that these responsibilities were shouldered reluctantly:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to help out by trying to be here and do all sorts of stuff … there are things that I would rather do, I would rather do what I normally do; playing with the drum, watching television. (Allan)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, the majority of children viewed this responsibility positively; for example, Laura stated: ‘[Mum] does it [gets sibling up] every morning so it’s just nice for her to have someone to help her really’ and Tom remarked: ‘It’s nice to sit with him and feed him his dinner and get him a drink and put his telly on, watch him dance to his songs on telly and stuff like that’. Many siblings actively sought responsibilities in a way that suggested they were purposively aligning themselves with adults in the family, with even young participants feeling responsible for their older, ill sibling. For example, Laura talked of a partnership with her parents concerning caring duties for her brother (aged 18 years):
<disp-quote>
<p>Me and my mum and my dad made a deal that my mum would get him up, my dad would put him to bed and I would give him a wee or something if he wanted to go to the toilet or want a drink. So we decided to do that.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Allan, aged 7 years, when talking about his older sister and the options for her future care, talked of how he and his parents thought it best for her to attend a residential school. His articulation of this perceived joint responsibility, with his parents, for his sister’s welfare was also evident when discussing respite care:
<disp-quote>
<p>They just take care of everyone and let them stay overnight and I feel glad that my sister’s in [hospice care], otherwise we won’t be able to cope with her for all day loads of times.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Key theoretical links between themes and coping</title>
<p>Siblings were adopting a number of strategies that allowed them to manage their experiences. <italic>Compartmentalising life</italic> ensured that difficult feelings did not intrude in the siblings’ day-to-day life and allowed them to maintain relationships with their peers despite feelings of difference. In addition, it would seem that siblings were adopting a strategy of being more adult-like in response to the loss of, or lack of potential for, a more conventional role within the family; they reported often lacking parental attention and as being unable to forge a ‘normal’ sibling relationship with their brother or sister. <italic>Positioning in the adult world</italic> and <italic>being the glue in relationships</italic> enabled them to define an important role for themselves within the family, which in turn afforded a sense of purpose and value, and facilitated high self-worth. Such positioning by the siblings may explain why many appeared to have adjusted well to their sibling’s illness, as indicated by high scores on the SPP global self-worth scale and the absence of emotional or behavioural difficulties on SDQ.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-1359105312456324" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although a small number of siblings in this study reported emotional and behavioural difficulties, the majority compared favourably with normative data. In a number of domains, sibling scores exceeded those expected from normative data, which suggests there may be some positive effects from their experiences.</p>
<p>Siblings reported feeling different from their peers but had developed adaptive strategies to manage home and school life, which included compartmentalisation and the development of a defined role for themselves as self-as-carer. This appeared to contribute to a high sense of self-worth. However, heavy reliance upon these strategies provoke some concern for the long-term adaptation of siblings of children with life-limiting conditions.</p>
<p>Through <italic>compartmentalisation</italic>, siblings both managed their concern for their ill sibling and created some normality for themselves (principally at school). Although life-limiting conditions are terminal with progressive deterioration over a number of years, the timing and course of the prognosis are often uncertain. An observational study of families of children with cystic fibrosis suggested that families adopt strategies that allow them to live with a degree of normalcy and control despite the unpredictable life course of the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312456324">Bluebond-Langner, 1996</xref>). For example, treatment routines become normalised into the family schedule, and they actively avoid reminders of the child’s prognosis. It has been suggested that these strategies can be successful, at least until they become untenable due to deterioration in the child’s condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312456324">Waite-Jones and Madill, 2008</xref>). The present study also suggests that compartmentalising life by living in the ‘here and now’ is important for the adaptation of siblings of children with life-limiting illness; they avoid unsettling thoughts of the future by concentrating on life in the present and thereby control the intrusion of sadness or worry into their everyday existence.</p>
<p>Compartmentalisation may be considered an avoidant coping strategy, which may be adaptive in allowing siblings to maintain a sense of normalcy and to control intrusive thoughts. However, a reliance on avoidant coping strategies may be less effective for long-term coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312456324">Seiffge-Krenke and Klessinger, 2000</xref>). A preference for avoidant coping strategies is associated with high levels of distress in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312456324">O’Connor and O’Connor, 2003</xref>) and has been identified as a risk factor for anxiety and depression in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312456324">Gomez and McLaren, 2006</xref>). It may set a pattern of dealing with stress that is reliant on avoidant strategies as it has been suggested that the development of characteristic ways of coping in childhood are likely to be a precursor of patterns that endure into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312456324">Compas et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The second key theme that emerged from the study was that of <italic>self as social glue</italic>, whereby siblings presented their own needs as secondary to those of their family; siblings scored highly on the prosocial scale of the SDQ and the majority were above the norm on the social acceptance scale of the SPP, suggesting that the concept of themselves as social glue may be an important component to their self-identity.</p>
<p>Other studies report that the healthy child is overlooked as the family concentrates on the ill child or deals with bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312456324">Pennells and Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312456324">Strohm, 2004</xref>). The present study suggests that siblings may in part be instrumental in negating their own needs, preferring to be a caregiver rather than a caretaker. Siblings therefore may not seek support and may continue to cope alone even when such strategies are no longer effective.</p>
<p>The final theme of <italic>positioning in the adult world</italic> related to the siblings aligning with adults, rather than similar age members of their family. Studies involving siblings of children with illness or disability often report an increased sense of maturity when compared to their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312456324">Sloper, 2000</xref>). A recent study suggested that siblings of children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis were ‘out of time’ with their peers, as caring for their brother or sister had given them added responsibilities beyond their years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312456324">Waite-Jones and Madill, 2008</xref>). The present study suggests that siblings actively adopt adult roles and a mature outlook is not simply a consequence of increased caregiving responsibilities. Indeed, relieving siblings of caregiving responsibilities may be detrimental to their well-being as it is this which provides siblings with a valued role within the family. However, it has been suggested that chronic demands for caregiving may compromise child development as this becomes their identity as well as their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312456324">Lamorey, 1999</xref>). While siblings’ contribution to caregiving should be acknowledged and valued, they should be encouraged to broaden their personal development.</p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that although siblings and their families may need support to manage the challenges posed by illness, the experience of living with a brother or sister with a life-limiting condition should not be pathologised. Identifying siblings as an ‘at risk’ population devalues the resilience of siblings and families.</p>
<p>There a number of limitations to this study that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the included sample is unlikely to be representative of all siblings; it may be that only those families who were coping well agreed to participate, and the presented themes may have less resonance for those families who are experiencing difficulties. Second, the diversity within the sample across a number of variables, while appropriate for an initial exploratory analysis, also limits a wider interpretation of the themes. In particular, the wide age range spans a large developmental range encompassing a key transitional phase in adolescence. The themes have been developed through an analysis of the transcripts of all the siblings, and the illustrative quotations demonstrate that even the younger siblings have contributed to the presented analysis. However, it is likely that the process of coping and adaptation may differ across developmental stages, and these subtleties warrant further investigation. Other variables that may warrant consideration are the time since diagnosis and stage of illness. Finally, although the integration of quantitative data with the qualitative analysis is the strength of this study, the findings from the standardised measures serve only to situate the included cohort of siblings. Reference has been made to normative scores for the included measures but this study did not include a comparison group of siblings of children without illness. No normative scores were available for Kidcope.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the limitations, the findings of this study do introduce areas that warrant further investigation and highlight issues that should be of consideration for professionals working with such families. In particular, those working with families should help parents remain sensitised to the needs of siblings. Interventions that focus solely on lessening responsibility within the family or that encourage them to undertake less of a caregiving role may not be beneficial. However, there should be vigilance to ensure that responsibilities do not exceed abilities and opportunities for personal development not focussed on caring should be encouraged. Parents need to be aware that siblings have a tendency to silence themselves, repress their own feelings and place others’ needs ahead of their own. In particular, parents and professionals need to recognise that siblings may appear to be coping well when they are not; a reliance on self-sufficiency may mean that siblings do not seek support when it might be beneficial, and that they perhaps continue to try to cope alone even when they are struggling.</p>
