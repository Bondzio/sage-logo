<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The escalating epidemic of overweight and obesity worldwide compels an increase in efforts to prevent and manage obesity. Facing a market of weight-loss products increasingly dominated by unproven non-evidence-based agents and advertising campaigns promising effortless and miracle cures, it is essential that consumers be educated on healthy long-term weight management through lifestyle changes and evidence-based medication regimens. Accurate and responsible advertising should be ensured to allow consumers to make informed choices about available products for weight management. Collaborative efforts from multiple sectors are needed to disperse appropriate consumer education on the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in Asia.</p>
<sec id="section6-1010539511402189">
<title>Obesity in Asia: A Rising Epidemic</title>
<p>Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide and a major contributor to the global burden of chronic disease and disability. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 1 billion people worldwide are overweight and that more than 300 million are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511402189">1</xref></sup> It is predicted that if current trends continue, the number of overweight individuals will increase to 1.5 billion by 2015.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511402189">2</xref></sup> The rising trend in obesity is evident in both developed and developing countries, affecting virtually all ages and socioeconomic groups.</p>
<p>In line with this global trend, the rates of overweight and obesity in the Asian region have increased rapidly in recent decades, although the prevalence and extent of increase vary between countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539511402189">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511402189">2</xref></sup> For example, the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) showed that the prevalence of obese adults (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) rose from 5.8% in 1996 to 11.7% in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511402189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511402189">4</xref></sup> The third NHMS in Malaysia recently reported that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in men was 29.2% and 7.4%, respectively; whereas the prevalence in women was 30.3% and 13.8%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511402189">5</xref></sup> Mainland China has also experienced an alarming rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, from 14.6% of its adult population classified as overweight or obese in 1992 to 21.8% in 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511402189">6</xref></sup> The rapid rise in overweight and obesity is mainly a consequence of the sustained economic growth in many Asian countries, leading to dietary and lifestyle changes such as increased consumption of high-energy foods, reduced levels of physical activity, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>There is ongoing debate about whether the WHO definitions of overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) underestimate the true burden of the condition in the Asian population. The WHO definitions are derived from Caucasian data and hence may not be applicable to Asians, who have a higher percentage of body fat than Caucasians of the same age, gender, and BMI. In addition, there is increasing evidence of the emerging high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk factors in parts of Asia where the average BMI is &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511402189">7</xref></sup> Thus, in 2004, the WHO introduced additional trigger points for public health action: BMI ≥23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> representing increased health risk and ≥27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> representing high health risk of public health concerns, while the original BMI cut-off points were retained as international standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511402189">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Obesity and overweight pose a major risk for serious diet-related chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and certain forms of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511402189">1</xref></sup> The health consequences, ranging from increased risk of premature death to serious chronic conditions that reduce overall quality of life call for urgent action to address the obesity epidemic.</p>

<title>Weight-Loss Products and Services: Emerging Markets in Asia</title>
<p>The rise in overweight and obesity globally has facilitated the expansion of the weight-loss food, drinks, supplements, and services industry from a niche environment to the main market. Whereas the market for weight management products (food, beverages, and supplements) in the United States is estimated to be near saturation point, Asia, with rising obesity levels, is predicted to accommodate an increasing number of new products. In China alone, the sales of weight-loss products totaled 10 billion yuan (US$1.25 billion) in 2004 and are expected to grow to 60 billion yuan by 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511402189">8</xref></sup> Within this growing market, there is a plethora of unproven weight-loss agents, many of which claim to be “natural” but are tainted with prescription diuretics, anorectics, and weight-reducing agents. In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified more than 120 dietary supplements containing undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511402189">9</xref></sup> Unapproved anorectic ingredients found in some of these “supplements” have been linked to serious adverse events such as addiction, suicide, dehydration, and hypokalaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511402189">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Direct-to-Consumer Weight-Loss Advertising: Purpose and Trends</title>
<p>From the myriad of weight-loss products and services, consumers make their selections based, in part, on advertising. Feeding on consumers’ hunger for an easy fix to overweight and obesity, there are a growing number of advertisements promising effortless weight loss. In 2001, the US Federal Trade Commission sampled 300 weight-loss advertisements from a variety of sources, including television, infomercials, radio, magazines, newspapers, supermarket tabloids, direct mail, and Internet Web sites. The common marketing messages used in weight-loss advertisements include<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511402189">10</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list1-1010539511402189" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“clinically proven” claims/consumer testimonials; before-and-after photos,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>claims of rapid weight loss,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>claims that no diet or exercise is required,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>claims of long-term/permanent weight loss, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>claims of natural/safe weight loss</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Furthermore, the analysis revealed that nearly 40% of the sampled advertisements made at least one representation that “almost certainly is false” and 55% made at least one representation that is “very likely to be false or, at the very least, lacks adequate substantiation.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511402189">10</xref></sup> Advertising that presents false or misleading information can distort consumer decision making.</p>

<title>Consensus Statements</title>
<p>The following statements focus on the issues and recommendations related to consumer education and communication on weight-loss agents identified and developed by the panel members.</p>
<sec id="section11-1010539511402189">
<title>A Need to Raise Public Awareness of Obesity and Its Related Health Consequences</title>
<p>There is a lack of public awareness of overweight and obesity as a serious public health problem and a risk factor for other chronic diseases. The panel recommended that overweight and obesity must be viewed as a serious chronic health problem rather than a cosmetic issue. Obesity is known to increase mortality and morbidity and can lead to many other diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Achieving and maintaining even a modest amount of weight loss can reduce the severity of illnesses associated with obesity.</p>
<p>Obesity should be considered as a disease in its own right and is also a key risk factor for noncommunicable diseases and many other health problems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539511402189">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511402189">11</xref></sup> The WHO estimated that globally, approximately 58% of diabetes, 21% of ischemic heart disease, and 8% to 42% of certain cancers are attributable to BMI greater than 21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511402189">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies in adults suggest that the rising degree of overweight and obesity, as measured by BMI, is associated with increased death rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511402189">11</xref></sup> In many industrialized countries, obesity is also associated with various psychosocial problems.</p>

<p>Greater awareness is needed that obesity and overweight are serious, chronic health problems that lead to many other serious illnesses and increased mortality, rather than a cosmetic issue alone. Additionally, the benefits of weight loss should be emphasized. Weight loss can improve and/or prevent the risk of developing obesity-related conditions.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that modest weight loss (weight loss of up to 10%) improves glycemic control and reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511402189">11</xref></sup> A systematic review has also provided evidence that intentional weight loss has long-term benefits for all-cause mortality in women, an effect that is amplified in individuals with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511402189">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-1010539511402189">
<title>A Need to Promote Proper Understanding of Healthy Weight Management</title>
<p>There is widespread misconception about weight-loss agents and programs as consumers seek “miracle pills” for weight loss. The panel’s key recommendations identified the need to teach the public that there are no miracle approaches to weight loss and that advice for weight management should be sought from health care professionals rather than beauty companies. Effective weight management involves lifestyle, diet and physical activity modifications that are lifelong commitments. Evidence-based pharmacotherapy may be an option for some individuals and should be used in conjunction with a plan for a healthy diet and physical activity.</p>
<p>In response to the growing number of direct-to-consumer advertisements for weight-loss agents and services promising effortless immediate success, consumers tend to have unrealistic expectations of weight management as they seek miracle cures and quick solutions. Consumers taken in by attractive weight-loss claims lose both economically, by wasting resources on products that do not work as advertised, and medically, by foregoing or postponing other weight-loss methods and necessary lifestyle changes. Furthermore, excessive and/or recurrent dieting lead to repeated loss and regain of weight (known as weight cycling or yo-yo dieting), which is associated with negative health consequences, a decrease in lean muscle-to-fat tissue ratio and makes future weight loss more difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511402189">11</xref></sup> To avoid futile weight cycling and being misled by deceptive weight-loss claims, advice for weight management should be sought from health care professionals rather than unregulated beauty companies. As regional data on the rate of adiposity rebound in Asia are currently unavailable, further research investigating this area may be valuable.</p>
<p>Effective weight management should involve lifestyle modification with a long-term commitment and includes at least 2 components—dietary management and physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511402189">14</xref></sup> These components should be considered essential for any weight management program.

<title>Advertising Guidelines Should Ensure Accurate and Responsible Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Weight-Loss Agents</title>
<p>Consumers generally have easy access to a wide range of weight-loss supplements (not classified as medicines) and services. There is concern about the advertising and sale of unproven products and services in Asia. The panel members emphasized that consumers have a right to access reliable and nondeceptive information that allows them to make informed choices about available products and services for weight management. Advertising regulations/guidelines should ensure weight-loss claims are accurate and based on evidence obtained through properly conducted clinical trials. More comprehensive consumer education and communication should be permitted for evidence-based weight management products and services. Advertising and promotion of unproven weight-loss products and services should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Data in the published literature indicate that the evidence for most dietary supplements for weight loss and many weight-loss programs are unconvincing and many do not support the development of healthy eating habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511402189">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511402189"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511402189"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511402189">20</xref></sup> Some herbal preparations widely promoted by commercial organizations as traditional remedies have been shown to be of little medicinal value and, in some cases, to contain harmful substances.</p>
<p>Current advertising guidelines in some Asian countries restrict or prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceutical products, including scientific-based weight-loss agents such as orlistat and sibutramine. For example, the Malaysian Medicines (Advertisement and Sale) Act 1956 (Revised 1986), through the Medicines Advertisement Board, prohibits direct-to-consumer advertising of all pharmaceutical products containing controlled medicines and poisons except gums, lozenges, and patches indicated for nicotine replacement therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511402189">21</xref></sup> In Hong Kong, no direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceutical products is allowed on television and radio, but advertising on pamphlets, billboards and posters, and in pharmacy outlets is permitted unless restricted by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance. Taiwan has less restrictive regulations on advertising of pharmaceutical products directed at consumers, which is permitted subject to approval from the competent central or municipal health authority. Similarly, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration allows direct-to-consumer advertising of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Most countries do not enforce strict regulations on the accuracy and truthfulness of claims made in advertisements of weight-loss supplements and traditional remedies that do not fall into the category of Western or Chinese medicines. In Malaysia, advertisements for weight loss with herbal products may be approved by the Medicines Advertisement Board as long as the indication is qualified with “This is a traditional preparation. Should be taken with a balanced diet and regular exercise.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511402189">21</xref></sup> In the Philippines, the Advertising Standards Council (ASC), under the Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines (Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas), screens and approves billboards, television and radio advertisements; however, there is no technical panel to validate claims against strength of evidence. The regulations in Singapore are fairly more comprehensive. The advertisements for medicines sold in pharmacies only or over the counter, as well as for raw medicinal herbs that contain medicinal claims or therapeutic claims, require preapproval and an advertisement permit from the Health Sciences Authority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511402189">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511402189">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As proven evidence-based therapies are subject to advertising regulations/restrictions while health supplements that lack the same degree of evidence-based results are often not regulated, more comprehensive consumer education and advertising should be permitted for evidence-based weight-loss therapies to provide consumers with balanced, accurate, and nondeceptive information on weight management.</p>

<title>Public Education on Weight Management: A Shared Responsibility</title>
<p>Public education on healthy weight management requires collaborative efforts from health care professionals of various disciplines, governments, the pharmaceutical industry, the media, and other organizations involved in promoting public interests. An important panel recommendation recognized the ability to communicate with consumers as an important means to foster long-term and realistic weight control. Health care professionals, including primary care physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians, have a role in educating the public on healthy weight management. Furthermore, coordinated actions from the evidence-based pharmaceutical industry, media and governments are also required to enhance appropriate consumer education and communication.</p>
<p>Communication with consumers is an important means to foster long-term weight control in order to manage the rising trends in overweight and obesity. Public education on effective healthy weight management cannot be seen as the sole responsibility of any one sector and must involve collaborative efforts from health care professionals of various disciplines, the governments, the pharmaceutical industry, the media, and other organizations involved in promoting public interests.</p>
<p>Health care professionals, particularly those involved in primary care such as general practitioners/family physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians, should proactively educate patients on long-term weight management and the use of evidence-based weight-loss agents. Additionally, the shared responsibilities of governments, the pharmaceutical industry, and the media offer multiple opportunities for public education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539511402189">Table 3</xref>). Governments are responsible for ensuring that public health policies encompass goals and strategies recommended for obesity control, such as the monitoring of weight status and the promotion of healthy diets, active lifestyle, and appropriate use of weight-loss agents and services. The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the development and appropriate promotion of evidence-based products and in supporting health education, while the media are crucial for responsible advertising, advocating change, and exposing fraudulent health claims. Coordinated and collaborative action by all the sectors concerned can ensure adequate public awareness of healthy sustainable weight management and the appropriate use of evidence-based weight-loss agents to combat the rising trends in overweight and obesity. Having emphasized the need for appropriate education on obesity and weight-loss, future initiatives could develop specific education strategies that could potentially address this need.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Following thorough expert discussion and evaluation of relevant data, the <italic>need to raise public awareness of obesity and its related health consequences</italic> is duly recognized. More than a mere cosmetic issue, overweight and obesity must be viewed as a serious chronic health problem. Obesity increases mortality and morbidity and lead to other diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Achieving even a modest amount of weight loss and maintaining an individual’s ideal weight can reduce the severity of illnesses associated with obesity.</p>
<p>There is also <italic>a need to promote proper understanding of healthy weight management</italic>. The public should be taught that there are no miracle approaches to weight loss and advice for weight management should be sought from health care professionals. Effective weight management involves lifestyle, diet, and physical activity modifications that are lifelong commitments. Evidence-based pharmacotherapy may be an option for some individuals and should be used in conjunction with a plan for a healthy diet and physical activity.</p>
<p>Concern about the advertising and sale of unproven products and services in Asia may be addressed by appropriate advertising guidelines. Consumers generally have easy access to a wide range of weight-loss supplements (not classified as medicines) and services. Thus, <italic>advertising guidelines should ensure accurate and responsible direct-to-consumer advertising of weight-loss agents</italic>. Consumers have a right to access reliable and nondeceptive information that allows them to make informed choices about available products and services for weight management.</p>
<p>Finally, it is acknowledged that <italic>public education on weight management is a shared responsibility</italic>. Health care professionals who can play an active role in public education include primary care physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians. The ability to communicate with consumers is an important means to foster long-term and realistic weight control. Future initiatives should aim to develop specific education strategies to address the need for appropriate education.</p>
