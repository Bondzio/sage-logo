Each raises important questions, highlighting both gaps in my account and issues for further research. To begin with common ground, all four are sympathetic towards the basic premise of <italic>Challenging Governance Theory</italic> that the ideology of network governance, having ridden a wave of postmodernist hype, is now crashing on the rocks of crisis, austerity and authoritarianism. As Carlo Salone comments, there is a growing intellectual hangover as the key thinkers distance themselves from the network governance tradition. Indeed, Mike Raco suggests that elements of my critique are dated in the context of new conceptual developments in the governance field. Ismael Blanco’s candid and thoughtful portrait of how the <italic>Institute of Governance and Public Policy </italic>evolved from network optimism to network realism is also instructive. Networks matter, but we must put them in their place.</p><p>Each too agrees that a new Gramscian reading of governance is a way forward. Blanco and Salone suggest that the heuristic device I sketch out in chapter 6 might be a useful framing for further empirical research. At the same time, it remains underdeveloped and Maarten Loopmans points to one possible avenue for further elaboration in Gramsci’s theory of passive revolution – a theme to which I return below. The Marxist and Gramscian perspectives underpinning the heuristic will not appeal to all. However, it also has a larger purpose, which is to move away from frameworks that privilege particular modes of coordination/regulation and instead view hierarchies, markets and networks as the basic ingredients, the building blocks from which all governance institutions and practices are made. One insight I derive from Gramsci’s theory of the integral state is that ‘hierarchy’ and ‘network’ are ideal types and that institutions seeking to enrol citizen activists into formal or informal ‘partnerships’ with the state are unlikely to subsist without an element of command and/or contract (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612465391">Davies, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465391">Grote, 2012</xref>). The empirical question, then, is how and why particular configurations emerge, following what trajectories.</p><p>In the remainder of this rejoinder, I comment on four important points raised by the contributors: the ontology of networks as ‘social objects’ (Salone), the implications of applying Gramsci’s theory of passive revolution at the urban scale (Loopmans), the emergence and supra-national scaling of regulation and its Gramscian implications (Raco) and, finally, the question of intellectual optimism and pessimism and what constructive role, if any, governing networks might play in reviving democracy (Blanco).</p><p>In positing that networks are best understood as ‘social objects’ in which structure and agency synthesize, Salone poses an important question about the ontological framings of governance theory. <italic>Challenging Governance Theory</italic> applies a critical realist ontology and, in chapter 6, argues for ‘dialectical network analysis’. The basic premise is that the rise of network ideologies, institutions and practices is a specific historical moment in the development of the capitalist mode of production – the neoliberal fetish for knowledge economies. Accordingly, networks cannot be conflated with capitalism, but nor do they exist outside it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612465391">Callinicos (2006</xref>, p. 208) argued that ‘every level of determination, from the deepest structures to the most aleatory movements of subjectivities involves a particular blend of determinacy and indeterminacy, of closure and openness, each requiring analysis in its own terms’. The ontological ‘weight’ we accord networks is a somewhat esoteric question from the standpoint of governance, but equally it is part of the theoretical and empirical ground upon which their permanence or transience and transformative potentials can be debated. Post-structuralist theory generally treats them as fluid and weightless mechanisms, whereas other traditions depict them as relatively solid and inaccessible institutions that secure enduring power relationships. <italic>Challenging Governance Theory</italic> draws on dialectical traditions in organisation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465391">Benson, 1977</xref>) and political science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612465391">Evans, 2001</xref>), exploring how governing networks reflect and refract macrotensions and contradictions in the socioeconomic system as well as engendering new ones. It defines them as microconfigurations of the integral state – the dialectics of fixity and flow, hegemony and domination. Salone’s definition of networks as social objects is therefore apt, but poses the further question ‘social objects of what kind’?</p><p>Loopmans’ Gramscian perspective on the strategic deployment of networking as a medium of passive revolutionary integration complements mine. His analysis of how state actors use networks to deflect and recuperate opposition is deft and paints a rich picture. My discussion of passive revolution in <italic>Challenging Governance Theory </italic>was poorly elaborated, and (with the help of expert reviewers) I have enhanced it in a follow-up article strengthening and developing my Gramscian framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612465391">Davies, in press</xref>). My revised reading poses the question for Loopmans of whether he stretches the concept too far.</p><p>The recent debate in <italic>Capital &amp; Class</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465391">Callinicos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612465391">Morton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612465391">Simon, 2010</xref>) shows that the meaning and applicability of passive revolution generates as much controversy as Gramsci’s other concepts. He originally used it to describe the dialectics of ‘revolution–restoration’, the simultaneous fulfilment and displacement of revolutionary pressure during the Italian Risorgimento (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612465391">Gramsci, 1971</xref>, p. 109). In the <italic>Capital &amp; Class </italic>debate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612465391">Simon (2010</xref>) distinguished type 1 passive revolutionary moments involving transformation from noncapitalist to capitalist formations from type 2 – significant top-down changes within the capitalist order itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612465391">Morton (2010</xref>, p. 604) endorsed this application of passive revolution as a ‘portmanteau concept that reveals continuities and changes within the political rule of capital’. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465391">Callinicos (2010</xref>) argued that stretching it to encompass transformations within the capitalist order, as Gramsci himself did, is to risk breaking the fundamental concern with revolution–restoration.</p><p>My position is that the roll-out of global neoliberalism did involve passive-revolutionary processes in the ‘type 2’ sense; it displaced protorevolutionary pressures in parts of Europe in the 1960s and, after bitter struggles, restored a modicum of stability to capitalist rule in the West. The extent to which neoliberal passive revolutions then revitalized capital accumulation and cultivated secure hegemonies is a moot point discussed briefly below. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612465391">Gramsci (1971</xref>), at least, saw the Risorgimento as antithetical to hegemony (p. 106). However, if neoliberalism is seen as a kind of passive-revolutionary process, it is important not to commit the sin of ‘epochalism’, which is to exaggerate discontinuities within capitalism, a pronounced tendency among network governance theorists.</p><p>The question for Loopmans is whether the processes he described are most fruitfully analysed through the revolution–restoration prism. On one hand, they are quite subtle and redolent of fairly conventional and limited policy changes and social compromises; if so, using the concept risks over-dramatizing them. On the other hand, because Loopmans’ case studies entail neither revolutionary threat nor counter-revolutionary restoration, they risk extracting the historical, analytical and explanatory teeth from the concept of passive revolution. All good academic practice involves conceptual entrepreneurship and extrapolation of this kind, but where does the efficacy of Gramscian concepts begin and end? One way of addressing the problem might be to show how Loopmans’ urban struggles constitute a moment, or determination, of the multiscalar passive-revolutionary processes constituting neoliberalism as a whole.</p><p>Raco rightly takes me to task for overlooking the rise of the regulatory state and regulatory capitalism. He is surely correct in arguing that this trend marks a significant change in the role of states and the relationship between states, corporations and citizens. He is also right, by extension, to argue that regulatory regimes undermine democratic capacity and erode governmental responsiveness; although we might add that without the complicity of powerful states, this state of affairs could not have arisen and would not be sustained.</p><p>Raco’s regulatory state and supra-state systems can be read as part of the hegemonic apparatus of neoliberalism. Yet, they pose the same question at the national and international scales as governance networks pose at the local scale: do they mark a shift from coercive to consensual modes of governance and thus towards hegemonic integration? The regulatory system maybe a novel – or at least burgeoning – hegemonic device under neoliberalism, but does it dissolve the dialectical relationships between states and the global system or between states and citizens? The distinguished neo-Gramscian theorist, Robert Cox, discerned the rise of a global <italic>nébuleuse; a</italic> ‘transnational and international network of state elites, corporate representatives and intellectuals’ is forged into an informal bloc responsible for formulating a ‘policy consensus for global capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465391">Cox with Schechter, 2002</xref>, p. 33). Regulatory regimes could be seen as part of this integrative and, predominantly consensual, dynamic. Others, however, argue that Cox and allied thinkers overstate hegemonic integration and understate the inherent unevenness of capitalist development and its translation into geopolitical rivalries, to which more or less direct coercive power remains integral (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612465391">Budd, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612465391">Callinicos, 2009</xref>).</p><p>There is, arguably, an analogy between the supra- and subnational scales. For example, coercion is commonly treated as a reserve power in urban studies; thus, governance occurs in the ‘shadow of hierarchy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612465391">Jessop, 2004</xref>, p. 52). In my view, this perspective radically understates the ubiquity of state coercion today, from routine administrative domination to outright violence at all geopolitical scales. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612465391">Graham’s (2010)</xref> graphic account of the <italic>New Military Urbanism</italic> is a salutary reminder that alongside subtle and not-so-subtle hegemonic devices, the state and its proxies use violence against citizens, home and overseas, all the time.</p><p>My point, in restating Gramsci’s conception of the integral state as a dialectical relationship between hegemony, domination and resistance, is therefore not to underestimate the malign antidemocratic effects of restructuring. It is rather to resist over-exaggerating the integrative and consensual impact of phenomena such as networks, regulatory regimes and passive revolutions. The state retains and exercises coercive power, I argue, not for the sake of democracy (if it ever did) but to ensure that it is bounded and thwarted. Modern capitalist states are pitiful servants of democratic rule. In neoliberalism and its regulatory systems, they have cultivated formidable hegemonic power. Yet, the insight I draw from Gramsci is that the routine and everyday utilisation of coercion attests to the <italic>fragility</italic> of this system; the intractability of tacit resistance in every-day life as well as the burgeoning of organized protest and (potentially) counter-hegemonic politics. I therefore accept Raco’s critique, but disagree with his claim that the rise of regulation undermines my central point. This is that the power of states to coerce citizens and other states remains undiminished, is utilised routinely at every geopolitical scale and is (increasingly) integral to sustaining and extending capitalist rule. Bringing multiscalar regulation into the story is very important, but leaves us with the same analytical challenge of grasping the relationship between hegemony, domination and resistance and, for the left, exploiting the dialectical fissures, cracks and chasms.</p><p>I conclude with a comment on this normative question. Raco paints a depressing picture of the erosion of democratic (state) control over capital, and the increasing commodification of public spaces and institutions. He argues that states no longer have sufficient hierarchical power and, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612465391">Du Gay (2000</xref>), that competent state bureaucracies enhance democratic accountability and legitimacy. Blanco, on the other hand, wants to retain the network as a tool of empowered democratic governance. He sees the contrary position, writing networks off altogether, as intellectual pessimism. He thus poses in a new form, the old question of whether and when activists should work inside or outside, with or against the state.</p><p>While pointing towards different solutions – reclaiming networks or restoring accountable and responsive bureaucracies (perhaps both) – Blanco and Raco raise the same fundamental and enduring questions about the relationship between capitalism and the state, state and civil society and between government and democracy. In the book, I adopt an orthodox Marxist perspective on contemporary political economy. The kernel of classical Marxism is that as it ages, capitalism becomes increasingly crisis-prone, the compulsion to expand more urgent and the barriers to doing so more intractable. Economic integration only compounds the risk of increasingly contagious and catastrophic slumps. It is impossible to predict whether or how capitalism will eventually exit the present crisis. However, the essence of the Marxist position is that a new round of accumulation in the western heartlands will depend not only on continuous swingeing cuts to welfare and wages but also on the destruction of loss-making capital. While the neoliberal elite is enthusiastic about the former and wary of the potentially disastrous consequences of the latter, Marxists reject both and call for revolutionary transformation. The social democratic tradition has never considered this road either desirable or feasible, and sees it as even less so today.</p><p>It does not follow from the global and devastating nature of the present crisis that this Marxist perspective is true, but the response of mainstream parties and thinkers does beg the question from where any progressive social democratic politics might come. To offer a credible message of hope, social democracy must demonstrate the potential for states, or state-society networks, to contain the expansionary dynamics of capital and cultivate a sustainable growth dynamic, mitigating or steering around crisis-tendencies in capitalism. One way or another, it must chart a way out of the crisis that does not rest on austerity and capital destruction, but rather uses deficit financing to engender a surplus sufficient for sustainable investment in economically, politically and culturally redistributive policies. It must revive and radicalize counter-cyclical Keynesianism. Yet, it was the economic and political failures of Keynesianism that enabled the rise of neoliberalism in the first place. Moreover, it is the opposite of the trajectory pursued by social democratic regimes since the end of the post-war boom and during the present crisis.</p><p>The question for Blanco is whether the small gains he discerns in his fine-grain studies of governance networks are sufficient to compensate the destruction of public goods occurring in Spain and many other countries? Moreover, can governance networks be sustained at all in the face of austerity? To ask these questions is not intellectual pessimism, or to deny that local variations in the development and contestation of neoliberalism matter. It is rather to ask how much do they matter? When and how should progressives engage in collaborative institutions and when they should not? What should their minimum demands be? It is also to ask whether solutions can be sought beyond collaborative governance, such as in the insurgent networks of the anticapitalist movement and traditional adversarial struggles for economic rights in the workplace. What, ultimately, do we need to establish a world of affective trust-based networks? Is this something we can achieve within the confines of capitalist modernity, its chronic instabilities, industrial wastelands and brutal cleavages? Or, is it as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612465391">Wetherly (2000</xref>) suggested only the vague premonition of a possible post-capitalist world? I suspect the latter, but let the debate continue.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612465391"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
