<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the main and interactional effects of review valence and the presence of source identity on consumer perception of credibility of an online review and initial trust of travel services being reviewed. An experimental design is developed involving 639 travel consumers. Results indicate that a negative online review is deemed more credible than a positive online review, while a positive online review leads to a greater initial trust than a negative review. These findings apply when the identity of the reviewer is disclosed. However, when the reviewer’s identity is not disclosed, there is no significant difference between positive and negative reviews either in terms of perceived credibility or impact on consumer trust. Theoretical and managerial implications, limitations and future directions are also discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the hospitality and tourism industry, online review sites have gained significant popularity among travellers (Gretzel and Yoo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766712449365">2008</xref>; Gretzel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766712449365">2007</xref>). The names of TripAdvisor, Lonely Planet, IgoUgo and other similar travel-related review sites are now well known among travellers who seek objective and unbiased travel-related information. Tens of millions of travel consumers take advantage of the online travel forums and review sites to post and share their travel-related personal experiences, opinions and comments (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766712449365">2011</xref>), which then serve as information for others (Xiang and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356766712449365">2009</xref>). One of the most popular travel community sites, TripAdvisor, claims that there are more than 50 million monthly unique visitors, 20 million members and more than 60 million travel reviews on the website as of January 2012 (TripAdvisor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1356766712449365">2012</xref>). With the increasing popularity of online review sites and other forms of consumer-generated media (CGM), the Internet also mediates tourism experiences since tourists take advantage of these social media sites to portray, reconstruct and relive their trips and share them with other people (Crotts and Magnini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766712449365">2011</xref>; Pudliner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Tussyadiah and Fesenmaier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356766712449365">2010</xref>). This phenomenon revives word-of-mouth (WOM) practices because the WOM conducted on the online review sites not only acts as an information source but also as a recommender (Crotts et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766712449365">2009</xref>; Park et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766712449365">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their growing adoption as travel information source (Xiang and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356766712449365">2009</xref>), online review sites are often criticised for their credibility since the information posted on the online review sites does not typically go through any rigorous editorial process for factual verification (Johnson and Kaye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766712449365">2002</xref>). As such, travellers commonly use peripheral cues to assess the credibility of online information, such as the characteristics of the source and the message (Metzger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766712449365">2003</xref>). The problem with online review sites is that those peripheral cues are limited. Anonymity is a common issue: the only identity of the reviewer commonly shown on an online review is an online nickname, while the real name, self-picture or any other self-description are not available in many online review sites, through the review site’s infrastructure or by choice of the reviewer. This lack of identity generates questions regarding the credibility of the information posted on the online review sites since the sources of the information are not clear (Rains and Scott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356766712449365">2007</xref>). Despite the importance of understanding the influence of identity on the persuasiveness of online information, this issue is still underexplored. This current lack of empirical examination and literature justifies the importance of further investigation into the issue (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766712449365">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This study empirically examines how information of the reviewer’s identity and the valence of the review may affect travellers’ perception of the credibility of the review and the development of initial trust to the travel-service provider. Several research questions (RQs) are answered and an experiment is conducted to address the RQs. Research findings assist in fulfilling the existing gaps in the literature on how source identity and valence influence consumer perception of credibility of online reviews and formation of initial trust of the travel services being reviewed.</p>

<title>Credibility issues in online review sites</title>
<p>An online review site is one of several types of CGM that have gained significant popularity in online travellers’ use of the Internet (Gretzel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766712449365">2006</xref>; Pan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766712449365">2007</xref>). A travel-related online review site facilitates travellers in posting and sharing their travel-related personal experiences, opinions and comments, which then serve as information for others (Xiang and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356766712449365">2009</xref>). As discussed, this also impacts tourism as tourists use these social media sites to share their experiences and recommendations with others. Compared to other information sources, online review sites often provide a vast amount of travel-related information available with a high level of interactivity and customisation. They often contain first-hand information from experienced travellers about various aspects related to travelling, from hotels, airlines, local transportation, and destination, to information about travellers themselves, such as travellers’ information exchange sites, participation in online forums or review sites. Internet users tend to consider this type of information as more trustworthy and credible than information from more commercial sources, such as travel agents or travel-service providers (Crotts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766712449365">1999</xref>; Litvin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766712449365">2008</xref>). Senecal and Nantel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766712449365">2004</xref>) noted that information and recommendation from other customers are very important to potential customers for an experiential product. Given the very intangible and experiential nature of travel-related services to a prospective traveller who has never been to a travel destination previously, it is reasonable that travellers are absorbing the information provided by other travellers through the online review (Sparks and Browning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766712449365">2011</xref>; Vermeulen and Seegers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1356766712449365">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Irrespective of the growing importance of the online review in the online tourism domain for the information search process (Xiang and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356766712449365">2009</xref>), it is undeniable that people often still obtain incomplete, unauthentic or falsified information from the Internet (Fahey and Weinberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766712449365">2003</xref>; Stone and Jumper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766712449365">2001</xref>). It is difficult to distinguish the good and truthful from false and deceptive online information (Yoo and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1356766712449365">2009</xref>). With the emergence of CGM, which enables Internet users to post any information freely without any editing or fact-checking processes, travellers will proceed with more caution before putting their trust in the information and the media that they perceive as credible.</p>
<p>The earlier discussion brings forth the credibility element of the online review sites, which is still a relatively underexplored area of research. Research has examined the nature of usage of the online review sites as part of CGM in general for travel-related activities (Gretzel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766712449365">2008</xref>; Shao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766712449365">2009</xref>; Xiang and Gretzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356766712449365">2009</xref>). Moreover, some studies also investigated the behavioural impact of online information on the online review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766712449365">Duan et al., 2008</xref>; Vermeulen and Seegers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1356766712449365">2009</xref>; Ye et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1356766712449365">2009</xref>). However, there are a very limited number of studies that empirically examine how consumers develop their perception of information credibility towards information posted to online review sites and the consequences. Previous studies demonstrate disagreement among researchers regarding the credibility of online information and its impact on sales or consumer behaviour. Some proponents claim that online information is higher in credibility than information from other more traditional media (Park et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Senecal and Nantel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766712449365">2004</xref>) because the information is posted by experienced travellers who are considered as credible sources of information (Gretzel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Park et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Wilson and Sherrell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356766712449365">1993</xref>). On the other hand, others argue that the online information can be posted by any individual and therefore is less credible than other types of information sources (Gretzel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766712449365">2006</xref>; Litvin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766712449365">2008</xref>; Mack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766712449365">2008</xref>; Magnini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766712449365">2011</xref>). Further evidence that assists in understanding this area is required.</p>

<title>The role of message valence</title>
<p>Similar to traditional forms of WOM communication, the content of customer feedbacks posted on online review sites is often beyond control of the marketers. Some firms may receive all positive feedback from customers, while others may receive all negative feedback as a result of dissatisfaction (Folkes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766712449365">1987</xref>; Richins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766712449365">1983</xref>; Swan and Oliver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1356766712449365">1989</xref>). The positive or negative orientation of information about an object or situation is what Frijda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766712449365">1986</xref>) defines as valence.</p>
<p>Whether feedback is positive or negative has been found to have an effect on individual responses (Ilgen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766712449365">1979</xref>), as underpinned by framing theory (Levin and Gaeth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766712449365">1988</xref>). However, there are inconsistent findings about whether information with positive or negative valence has stronger impact on consumer responses. Snyder and Cowles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356766712449365">1979</xref>) and Snyder et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766712449365">1977</xref>) argue that individuals perceive and recall feedback more accurately when it is positive than when it is negative. Jones et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766712449365">2006</xref>) and Klayman and Ha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766712449365">1987</xref>) also state that positive product reviews are more likely to elicit strong consumer responses. On the other hand, Mizerski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766712449365">1982</xref>) suggests that, when consumers are in a neutral position, negative information is likely to be more salient than positive information. In the context of online review sites, the presence of a large number of positive reviews will cause consumers to seek negative reviews to provide them with information about specific problems that might occur in experiencing the products (Ba and Pavlou, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766712449365">2002</xref>; Pavlou and Dimoka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766712449365">2006</xref>). The studies found that negative reviews have greater impact on consumer responses than positive reviews. In a more recent study, positive and negative congruent reviews lead to consumer perception of online review usefulness (Zehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1356766712449365">2011</xref>). This study also suggests that a positive incongruent review, which is a positive review that counters a negative review, is considered to be more useful than a negative incongruent review (a negative review that counters a positive review). While findings from previous studies are quite contradictory regarding whether positive or negative messages have a stronger impact, they all have one suggestion in common: that message valence affects consumer responses. In light of the contradictions and deficiency of empirical research into this issue under the context of this study, the influence of valence is also examined in this study.</p>

<title>Social identity, information credibility and initial trust</title>
<p>Uncertainty reduction theory suggests that individuals who are exposed to uncertainty will try to implement uncertainty reduction strategies (Berger and Calabrese, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766712449365">1975</xref>). Individuals attempt to reduce uncertainty by finding credible information that can be used for decision making (Jacoby et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766712449365">1994</xref>). One of the aspects suggested to influence perceived credibility is message or information quality (Pornpitakpan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766712449365">2004</xref>; Slater and Rouner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766712449365">1996</xref>). A well-presented message or information is more persuasive and has a positive effect on consumer attitude and purchase intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766712449365">Pornpitakpan, 2004</xref>). Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766712449365">2000</xref>) suggest that comprehensive online information obtained by consumers prior to purchase has a significant influence on their intentions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, social identity theory posits that an individual may also reduce uncertainty by choosing to communicate with other people who share similar values and social identity (Tajfel and Turner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356766712449365">1979</xref>). Knowing the identity of the information source helps individuals find people who have much in common with themselves (Jensen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766712449365">2002</xref>). However, the role of source identity in the formation of consumer perception of online information credibility is still underexplored empirically (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766712449365">2011</xref>). Sussman and Seigal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356766712449365">2003</xref>) identify two reasons why source identity plays a crucial role in online communications. First, information exchange and acquisition will be more efficient when the identity of the information source is disclosed. Second, source identity enhances source credibility, which then leads to information credibility and usefulness. This argument is supported by Forman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449365">2008</xref>) who conclude that there is a positive impact on sales when online reviewers share their demographic information.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<sec id="section8-1356766712449365">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>A 2 × 2 (between-subject) experimental design was used to examine the RQs. For this study, a set of online hotel review prototypes was designed as stimulus materials to examine the relationships between perceived credibility of online review and travellers’ initial trust of the hotel being reviewed. The two variables manipulated in this study were message valence and reviewer’s identity. The message valence was manipulated at two levels by providing two types of content orientation of the reviews, namely, positive and negative orientation. In the positive valence condition, the review was entirely positive and favourable, whereas in the negative valence condition, the review was entirely negative and unfavourable. The source identity was manipulated at two levels by providing two types of personal information disclosure. Following Ma and Agarwal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766712449365">2007</xref>), in the disclosed identity condition, the identity of the individual who posted the information was described. The description revealed the individual’s name, location, age group, length of membership, self-picture and brief explanation about himself and herself. In the undisclosed identity condition, there was no information at all about the reviewer. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test for main and interactional effects of the message valence and reviewer identity.</p>
<p>There was one scenario developed for the study. The scenario explains a situation where the participant was asked to imagine planning a holiday in their desired destination with friends. The participants were responsible for making plans to book the accommodation for the entire trip of this long-awaited vacation, thus providing a higher level of involvement with the task. The holiday destination was not specified to avoid bias in the participants’ prior knowledge, attitude or preference.</p>
<p>A hotel setting was chosen for the experiment because, in the travel decision-making process, booking a hotel room will often be the first decision to consider once a destination is decided (Pan and Fesenmaier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766712449365">2006</xref>). As a consequence, comments or reviews about hotels are much greater in number compared to other travel-related offerings on online review sites.</p>
<p>The two sets of reviews were designed based on existing reviews on travel-related online review sites such as TripAdvisor. Four elements of the review were manipulated, namely, the home page of the online review website, the hotel, the reviewer and the reviews. The appearance of the website was designed to look similar to well-known online review sites. The name and description of the hotel was fictitious and generic in order to be unrelated to any particular hotel in any particular city to avoid bias. Information about the reviewer was also designated to be 25–34 group of age and have a unisex name.</p>
<p>As discussed, within the two sets of reviews, one contained an identified source and the other an unidentified reviewer. Each set was developed in two versions: positive and negative valence. Therefore, in total, there were four review stimuli used in this study. To decide what hotel attributes need to be featured in the review, 500 hotel reviews randomly selected from TripAdvisor were analysed to find the most discussed hotel attributes. Based on the finding of the analysis, seven hotel attributes were presented in the stimuli for the experiment: (a) general comments about the hotel’s value and reviewer’s recommendation statements; (b) the quality of the lobby, the bed, the bathroom and the balcony; (c) the speed of the check-in process; (d) the service quality, expertise and knowledge about localities and English proficiency of the hotel staff; (e) hotel’s accessibility and proximity to amenities and city centre; (f) the quality of meals experienced by the reviewer and (g) the hotel’s facilities. Following the personal information section presented by TripAdvisor, reviewer identity elements presented in the review and manipulated in this study are (a) online nickname, (b) age group, (c) location, (d) self-portrait, and (e) self-description.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the four reviews developed for this study were fairly equivalent and comparable in the non-manipulated factors, it was considered necessary to develop reviews that contained all seven hotel attributes explained prior with different yet comparable evaluation. This strategy was expected to control not only the balance of the content of the reviews used but also the balance in the length of the reviews. Therefore, the non-manipulated elements of the four reviews could be considered fairly comparable.</p>
<p>The realism and believability of the scenario and the online review manipulation were examined using three statements. All statements measuring scenario and stimulus believability received mean scores of higher than 5 on a 1–7 scale, indicating a modest agreement that the scenario and the online review stimulus were realistic. Moreover, the manipulations for the source identity (identified and unidentified) and the message valence (positive and negative) were checked using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test to compare scores between positive and negative reviews (message valence) and identified and unidentified sources (source identity). All manipulation checks suggest that there is significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) between the positive (<italic>M</italic> = 5.7) and negative reviews (<italic>M</italic> = 4.1) and between identified source (<italic>M </italic>= 5.2) and unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 2.5), indicating that the manipulations were successful.</p>

<title>Participants and data collection</title>
<p>Bali was chosen as the site where the survey was conducted based on consideration that Bali is a well-known tourist destination where international travellers, who were the target participants of the study, are easily found. This situation supported the aim of this study to involve international travellers from various demographic or psychographic backgrounds. As the locations of the participant recruitment were public places that were mostly not gated or ticketed, convenience sampling was implemented. The target participants were approached and asked whether they were willing to participate in this study.</p>
<p>Participants of the study were 639 young travellers aged 18–33 from 31 countries holidaying in Bali, Indonesia, when recruited as participants. Gender was almost evenly balanced with 51% of the participants being male. Questionnaire items used for this study were presented in English. The strategy of using real travellers in a popular holiday destination was based on the suggestion of previous studies that most of the criticism in experimental research deals with the use of participants who are considered as non-representative of the real population (Voracek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356766712449365">2001</xref>). By involving real travellers, it is expected that the adequate level of population representativeness in this study could be achieved.</p>

<title>Measurement scales</title>
<p>Online media–perceived credibility is measured using five dimensions, namely, accuracy, believability, bias, completeness and trustworthiness. The scale is adapted from Flanagin and Metzger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449365">2000</xref>) and originally developed by West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1356766712449365">1994</xref>). This scale is used to measure the construct of credibility in several previous studies (e.g. Flanagin and Metzger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766712449365">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Metzger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766712449365">2003</xref>; West, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1356766712449365">1994</xref>). For this study, subjects were asked to rate whether the online reviews provided were accurate, believable, unbiased, complete and trustworthy on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 representing ‘strongly disagree’ and 7 representing ‘strongly agree’. Initial trust measurement is adapted from Bart et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766712449365">2005</xref>). The participants are asked to answer five questions and rate the trustworthiness of the hotel being reviewed in five dimensions on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 representing ‘strongly disagree’ and 7 representing ‘strongly agree’. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for each construct to examine the internal consistency of the scales. The Cronbach’s alpha score of the scale used for the ‘credibility’ construct was 0.75, while the score for ‘initial trust’ was 0.87. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766712449365">Nunnally (1978</xref>), scales with reliability of 0.70 and above have relatively good internal consistency.</p>

<title>Data analysis and results</title>
<p>A 2 × 2 (between-subject) ANOVA was used to examine differences in perceived credibility and trust. The findings suggest that main effect of message valence for credibility was significant (<italic>F</italic> = 70.28, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.023). The main effect test result for initial trust was significant (<italic>F</italic> = 69.08, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.035). A negative online review was perceived as significantly more credible (<italic>M</italic> = 4.93, standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) = 0.49) than a positive review (<italic>M</italic> = 4.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.29); however, a positive review (<italic>M</italic> = 5.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.37) has greater effect on initial trust to travel services being reviewed than a negative review (<italic>M </italic>= 4.24, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.88). The findings answer the first RQ.</p>
<p>The main effect of identity on credibility was found to be significant (<italic>F</italic> = 71.22, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, <italic>ω</italic>

<sup>2</sup> = 0.033). Participants perceived that a review with disclosed personal identification was more credible (<italic>M </italic>= 5.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.46) than with those with an undisclosed identity (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.41). Initial trust in travel services discussed in the review is found to be significantly higher from an online review with identified source (<italic>M</italic> = 5.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.69) than with an unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 4.12, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00). This set of findings provides an explanation for the second RQ.</p>
<p>Significant interactional effect between information valence and information source was confirmed on credibility (<italic>F</italic>(1,635) = 25.77, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.01) and on trust (<italic>F</italic>(1,635) = 18.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.05). For a positive online review, credibility perceived by participants exposed to a review with an identified source (<italic>M</italic> = 5.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.401) was significantly higher than with an unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 4.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.309). Trust developed by participants exposed to a review with an identified source (<italic>M</italic> = 5.26, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.456) was significantly higher than with an unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.347). For a negative online review, credibility perceived by participants exposed to a review with an identified source (<italic>M</italic> = 5.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.401) was significantly higher than with an unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 4.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.309). In contrast, trust perceived by participants exposed to a review with an identified source (<italic>M</italic> = 5.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.194) was significantly higher than trust perceived by participants exposed to an unidentified source (<italic>M</italic> = 4.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.274). The third RQ is thus answered by this analysis.</p>
<p>Further analysis on the interaction of information valence and source identity suggests that, when the source identity was identified, there was a significant difference in credibility (<italic>F</italic>(1,318) = 17.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.019) and trust (<italic>F</italic>(1,318) = 13.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.025) between positive and negative information. Negative information was perceived as more credible (<italic>M</italic> = 5.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.194) than positive information (<italic>M</italic> = 5.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.401). Moreover, positive information leads to greater trust (<italic>M</italic> = 5.26, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.456) than negative information (<italic>M</italic> = 3.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.330). Interestingly, the result is different when the information source is unidentified. There was no significant difference in credibility (<italic>F</italic>(1,317) = 7.37, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.001, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.029) between positive and negative when the source was unidentified. Similarly, there was no significant difference in trust (<italic>F</italic>(1,317) = 9.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.001, <italic>ω</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.035) in travel services between positive and negative information. This set of findings reveals insight to the fourth RQ.</p>
<p>The findings should be interpreted in the context of the interaction between source identity and message valence since the interactional effect between the two independent variables was found to be significant. The result shows that there was a significant interaction between the source identity disclosure in the online review and the valence of the review. Therefore, negative reviews with disclosed personal identification of the reviewer are perceived to be significantly more credible (<italic>M</italic> = 5.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.42) compared to other types of reviews. A negative review with unidentified source was found to be less credible (<italic>M</italic> = 4.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.37) than any other review types. Moreover, initial trust of travel-related services being reviewed was stronger when participants read positive reviews with disclosed reviewer’s identity (<italic>M</italic> = 5.53, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.44) compared to other types of reviews. Reversely, when they read negative reviews with unidentified sources (<italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.38), the initial trust was weaker than when they read any other type of reviews. This group of findings answers the fifth RQ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-1356766712449365">
<title>Theoretical contribution</title>
<p>This article focused on the main and interactional effects of source identity and message valence on perceived credibility of online reviews and initial trust of travel-related services. Findings of this study indicate that a negative online review is deemed more credible than a positive review, especially when the reviewer’s identity is disclosed. A negative review with an identified source is also found to have a greater impact on consumer perception of review credibility than any other form of review tested. This result is consistent with findings from previous studies, which suggest that negative information has a stronger effect on consumers than positive information (Ba and Pavlou, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766712449365">2002</xref>; Pavlou and Dimoka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766712449365">2006</xref>). Another finding is that a positive review is considered to be more influential on consumers’ initial trust formation in travel services being reviewed. This finding is consistent with extensive prior studies on the effect of WOM on consumer trust (e.g. Belen del Rio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766712449365">2001</xref>; Fournier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766712449365">1998</xref>; Ha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766712449365">2004</xref>; Ward and Lee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356766712449365">2000</xref>; Xingyuan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1356766712449365">2010</xref>). This study also finds a more specific result in that a positive review with an identified source is found to have a greater impact on initial trust than any other form of reviews. This additional finding contributes to the existing understanding on how the valence works for identified online information.</p>
<p>While this research confirms that an online review with an identified source is considered to be more credible and leads to higher consumer initial trust than an online review with an unidentified source, as also suggested by Forman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449365">2008</xref>) and Xie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1356766712449365">2011</xref>), there is an interesting additional finding in this study in regards to the review with an unidentified source. When the reviewer identity is not revealed, there is no significant difference between positive and negative reviews either in terms of consumer perception of online review credibility or consumer initial trust of travel services being reviewed. This result is an important contribution to the existing literature since it has not been suggested by prior studies on source identity in computer-mediated communication. For example, Ma and Agarwal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766712449365">2007</xref>) suggest that the source identity of community members influences their own satisfaction and knowledge contribution. Forman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449365">2008</xref>) find that the source identity affects online review helpfulness and product sales moderated by geographical location and review equivocality. Meanwhile, Xie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1356766712449365">2011</xref>) examine the effect of source identity of online reviewer on review credibility and purchase intention under different pre-decisional disposition.</p>
<p>This research differs from prior research in two main aspects that contribute to marketing and tourism literature. First, although previous research on social media has examined the role of valence in information trustworthiness or trust (e.g. Papathanassis and Knolle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766712449365">2011</xref>; Park and Lee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766712449365">2009</xref>), few of them have considered the interactional effect of valence and source identity, which helps to further clarify the role of valence in credibility perception and trust formation. To our knowledge, this research is one of the few studies to simultaneously apply four types of appeal in an online review context to empirically examine their effects on perceived credibility and trust. Specifically, previous research applies two types of review presentation (positive or negative); however, this research examines four types of review presentation (positive/identified source, positive/unidentified source, negative/identified source, negative/unidentified source) and further investigates their interactional effects on credibility and trust. Through examining the interactional effects of valence and source identity, this research empirically addresses interesting theoretical implications by suggesting that valence and source identity play critical roles in the formation of consumer perception of review credibility and trust.</p>
<p>Second, this research examines the effect of source identity. Theoretical understanding of the effect of source identity on information credibility and consumer trust is promising, but the theory is empirically underdeveloped. Some empirical studies in the advertising and computer-mediated communication fields have examined the effect of source identity (e.g. Forman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766712449365">2008</xref>; Ma and Agarwal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766712449365">2007</xref>; Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1356766712449365">2011</xref>); however, findings from those studies are not entirely adequate in explaining the impact of source identity on consumer perception of information credibility and initial trust formation in travel services being reviewed. This research contributes to the literature by confirming that the absence of source identity leads to insignificant difference of influence of either positive or negative credibility perception and trust formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1356766712449365">
<title>Managerial contribution</title>
<p>The results of this study imply that the presence of source identity in an online review can enhance the perceived credibility of the review, which eventually will affect the persuasiveness of the online review and lead to consumer initial trust development in the travel services being reviewed. For that reason, it is desirable that the administrators of the travel-related review sites or online recommendation-type social media sites design their websites in such a way that makes the source identity of the information posted on the websites available for their visitors – or perhaps encouraged for reviewers. For example, although online nicknames may be used, the websites could require the review contributors register their original name and email address and mention their dates of stay in the hotel they discuss before posting a review. Other credibility cues of the reviewers may also be presented in the websites, such as the number of reviews posted by the reviewer of a hotel or a helpfulness rating of each review they have made previously as rated by other users. In addition, the source identity information and the credibility cues should be made easy for consumers to find on the websites. In this way, when consumers read an online review on the websites, they can obtain information about the trustworthiness level of the sources of information they consume. Although elements of these suggestions are already undertaken in some online sites, this research clarifies the importance and impact of such undertakings.</p>
<p>This study also indicates that a negative review with an identified source has a strong influence on consumer initial trust of the travel services being reviewed. This finding is relevant for hotel managers and the administrators of other types of travel-related services. There are several potential ways that may be employed in order to mitigate the undesirable effect of negative reviews. The first and most obvious strategy is that managers should try to minimise the presence of negative online reviews through maintaining a high level of service quality (e.g. Babin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766712449365">2005</xref>; Kassim and Abdullah, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766712449365">2010</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766712449365">2004</xref>) and providing well-managed recovery strategies (e.g. Kau and Loh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766712449365">2006</xref>; Maxham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766712449365">2001</xref>; Wong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1356766712449365">2004</xref>). Second, hotels and other travel services can minimise the impact of negative online reviews by providing prompt responses posted on the same online review site addressing the actions taken by the hotel in order to avoid the occurrence of similar disappointment in the future. Third, hotels and other travel services should develop creative ways to encourage their satisfied customers to share and post their stories on online review sites.</p>

<sec id="section15-1356766712449365">
<title>Limitations and future research direction</title>
<p>As stated earlier, this research contributes to the existing literature and proposes some managerial contributions for practitioners. However, some limitations in this empirical study need to be addressed in order to provide starting points for further research consideration. First, the nature of the experimental design implemented in this study has some weaknesses that may influence the results. Using participants who are on their holiday may generate data with limited levels of cognitive processing as intended in this study. The results may be different if using students in a classroom or travel consumers planning their holiday and seeking information. Future examination may replicate this study and use more homogeneous participants to ensure the internal validity of this study.</p>
<p>Another limitation relates to the fact that this research has clarified the relationships between source identity, message valence, online credibility and initial trust in the context of one type of travel-related social media, which is online review. Considering that online reviews and other types of travel-related social media, such as travel blogs, travel online forums or Facebook, have different characteristics, the impact of information valence and source identity on information credibility and consumer trust may be different as well. Future investigation should compare the impact of valence and identity on trustworthiness of online information and consumer trust between different types of social media sites. For example, will the valence and identity factors affect credibility and trust differently when the information is posted on personal blogs or Facebook? Is consumer perception of the credibility of a blog post influenced by the number of posts in the travel blog where the blog post is published? Does the time gap between the date a review is posted and the date a consumer reads the review affect consumer perception of the review credibility and consumer trust in the services being reviewed? Answers to these questions will provide insights to our efforts in understanding the impact of online reviews on consumers’ travel-related behaviour.</p>
<p>Finally, the experiment stimulus in this research is hotel services. Factors consumers consider in deciding to make a hotel reservation may be different from factors they use to make decision about other types of travel-related services, such as restaurants, attractions, flight services or tourist destinations. Future studies should investigate another travel-related service category to examine whether the conclusions of this research can be generalised.</p>
