<p>Locke’s (2011) <italic>Duels and Duets: Why Men and Women Talk So Differently</italic> explores the biological and evolutionary roots of men’s and women’s speech styles. The majority of work to date on gender-linked, or sex-linked in this case, differences in language use has been rooted in a sociocultural perspective (e.g., by Jennifer Coates, Deborah Tannen); however, Locke, a professor of linguistics who has held faculty appointments in anthropology, strikes out in a different direction in his text. Locke argues that sex differences in language are not the product of culture but rather expressions of male and female biology. Throughout <italic>Duels and Duets</italic>, Locke notably uses nonhuman primate studies, human history, and examples from non-Western culture to colorfully support his claim that the way men and women communicate is hardwired. Specifically, Locke focuses on men’s tendency to speak more competitively with other men (“duels”) and women’s tendency to engage in more collaborative speech with other women (“duets”).</p>
<p>Sex-linked differences in features and use of language are well established. For example, when surveying the results of over 30 studies, Mulac and Gibbons (1993) found that “Twenty-one linguistic features were found to distinguish gender in two or more investigations” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463006">Mulac, 1998</xref>, p. 133). Some of these features included men’s use of “I” references, judgmental adjectives, and directives and women’s use of hedges, references to emotions, and questions. In her investigation of 372 men’s and women’s recent conversations with members of their own sex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463006">Clark (1998)</xref> found that some of the conversational objectives reported significantly more by women were “helping the other feel good about [herself],” “avoid offending the other,” “comforting the other,” and “letting the other know you care about [her]” (p. 310). Men were significantly more likely to indicate that their objective was “influencing the other” and “being humorous,” and their propensity over women to report that their goal was to “tease the other in a good-humored way” approached significance (p. 310). The sex differences in conversational objectives discovered by Clark are consistent with the claims of other scholars whom Locke references (e.g., Coates, Robin Lakoff, Tannen). The present focus of analyses of sex differences in language concerns not what the differences are (as general consensus on this topic been reached) but instead <italic>why</italic> these differences exist and what their social and individual impact is; Locke devotes himself to tackling the “why” of this difference from a distinctive standpoint.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the text provides an overview of Locke’s position on the origin of male and female speaking practices. Chapters 2 to 4 focus on how men talk to one another; Chapters 5 to 7 address how women talk to one another; and Chapter 8 tenders that men’s language and women’s language are complementary. In Chapter 1, Locke begins by asserting that in focusing on the way the sexes talk to (or misunderstand) one another, researchers are overlooking the more important distinction of how men talk with <italic>men</italic> versus how women talk with <italic>women.</italic> Locke touches on sex differences in language features, conversation topics, and speech styles, reviewing the work of selected linguists and pop culture authors (i.e., Coates, John Gray, Lakoff, Tannen). Throughout the chapter, Locke refers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463006">Tannen’s (1990)</xref> <italic>You Just Don’t Understand: Men and Women in Conversation</italic> and her assertion that males and females are socialized in different speech communities, facilitating learned masculine and feminine dialects as part of an individual’s culturally assigned gender role. Locke counters that rather than attributing language differences to roles of “<italic>genders</italic> in <italic>social</italic> history,” modern language is the result of “the differing roles played by the <italic>sexes</italic> in <italic>evolutionary</italic> history, the effects of which were transmitted genetically to the modern human brain” (p. 13). The remaining portions of the chapter offer examples involving nonhuman primates (e.g., rhesus monkeys, vervets), infants, and young children to make the point that particular communication and behavioral orientations are innate rather than learned.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Locke explains that throughout history, males have engaged in physical and verbal duels, the adaptive benefit of verbal dueling being that males can generally engage in this mode of competition for status and mating opportunities without the threat of bodily harm. Locke establishes the core features of dueling and surveys forms of verbal duels throughout ancient and modern history, including flyting, ritual insults, urban “sounding,” and forensics. According to Locke, male dueling is cross-cultural, though in some regions insults may be sung or set to the rhythm of drumming; he provides examples to illustrate this phenomenon. It is surprising that Locke does not address American rap battles—he uses the term <italic>rap</italic> in Chapter 3 but clarifies,
<disp-quote>
<p>I refer not to rap music, of course, but a way of speaking that some men have created and used specifically to court women. Rap is a traditional African-American verbal ritual that is to be issued humorously, is not to be interpreted literally, and has one and only one social function—to induce a woman to have sex. (p. 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In reality, rap music in the form of battle rap is highly applicable to Locke’s assertions about male duels and originates, according to historian Ferene Szasz, in the practice of flyting (Itzkoff, 1998). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463006">Newman (2001)</xref> in his work on rap and identity construction, rap battles channel aggression into a verbal rather than physical form and feature participants “fulfilling traditional male roles of strength, competitiveness, and valor” (p. 396). Insults to others in this forum can be playful or serious but frame one’s opponent as weak, incompetent, and/or submissive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463006">Newman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Locke focuses on individual male public presentation or “solo performance,” arguing that this serves “diachronically” as an abstract duel separated across time and space, allowing for men to vie for position via their command of language and to be compared to others even when those others are not immediately present. Locke offers various types of men of words, including tribal rhetoric thumpers, bards, Romeos, and comics, to name a few. He ends the chapter by noting that men’s interactions seem to be characterized by “serial monologues” in which each man serves as the storyteller and hero of his own experience. This chapter contains a wide variety of examples, not all of which seem cohesive. For example, broaching the maleness of clowns felt out of context and could have either been omitted or explained in a way that better situated it within Locke’s larger argument.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 explores why men duel, touching on male competition in other species and nonverbal dominance and ritual aggression in nonhuman primates. Locke points out that verbal dueling reduces injury and homicide, and he offers that men’s vocal pitch, intelligence, vocabulary, and humor all play roles in their reproductive fitness. Testosterone is identified as hormonal fuel for aggression and competition and ideal for successful dueling. The hormone is associated with acting and extraversion and is noncoincidentally high among trial lawyers, according to Locke. After an interesting discussion about testosterone levels among trial lawyers, Locke delves into when human males begin to exhibit features of dueling behavior, addressing fetal, infant, and youth data on the topic. Some time is spent establishing that from a young age, boys begin to exhibit competitive speech, for example, in the form of “teasing, insulting, and bragging.”</p>
<p>Chapter 5 begins the section of the text devoted to women’s speech, though they have received brief mention in previous chapters. Locke characterizes duets as a female mode of talk that emphasizes intimacy, shared experience, and emotion. He describes the nonverbal immediacy behavior that often accompanies duets—postural and facial mimicry, touch, and close proximity. It would have added to Locke’s discussion of male duels had he also addressed the nonverbal behavior commonly exhibited in conjunction with that style of talk. He identifies women’s duets as a boon to psychological health in that duets serve as a source of empathy and comfort akin to the social grooming demonstrated among nonhuman primates. Throughout Chapter 5, there are references to the historical practice of “lying-in,” where females gather at the event of childbirth to support the mother and connect socially with one another. The attendees at these lying-ins were considered to play the role of “God’s siblings” at the birth, and the kind of talk that occurred came to be known as “god-sibbing,” which is said to be the root of the word <italic>gossiping</italic>. Locke then provides historical accounts of male prohibition of what was labeled female “gossip,” arguing that men perceived this veiled communication as threatening to hegemonic control, but they had difficulty regulating this mode of private talk among women. Males considered gossip a nuisance to the extent that the root of the Italian word for gossip, <italic>pettegolezzo</italic>, is derived from the phrase “to fart,” according to Locke.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 further visits the topic of nonverbal behaviors in duetting. Locke tells of “the throat game” practiced by Inuit women to illustrate the epitome of physical and paralingual connection inherent in duets. Locke also addresses the conversational overlap (e.g., supportive or collaborative interruptions) and coordination that make women’s duets so distinct from men’s verbal duels. Self-disclosure and identification with the experience of the other are also primary components of women’s talk, according to Locke, and he uses transcribed dialogue and women’s reflections on talk in their relationships to successfully apply his argument in concrete terms.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 addresses why women duet, beginning with well-made points about the challenges of studying the quieter and more intimate discourse of female humans and nonhuman primates. Locke’s discussion of nonhuman primates’ affiliative vocalizations is particularly interesting. Females’ “collective approach” to competition is mentioned briefly but deserves more attention than it receives. In particular, Locke asserts that one function of duetting is indirect aggression, but he provides only cursory treatment of gossip as intrasex (or female-on-female) competition. The brief nod to female (indirect) verbal aggression does not leave the reader with an accurate understanding of female discourse—females engage in less overt but equally or more damaging forms of social aggression compared with their male counterparts. Chapter 7 additionally covers the role of various hormones (i.e., oxytocin and testosterone) in facilitating or impeding duets, respectively. Toward the end of the chapter, the mother–infant relationship is used as an engaging instance of duetting.</p>
<p>Throughout his text, Locke makes reference to the complementary nature of men’s and women’s language but devotes only a small portion of the last chapter to this issue. In Chapter 8, when addressing the sexes’ relative contributions to language, he asserts that males of the species are primarily responsible for the complexity of language and females are responsible for social vocalizations and that males transmitted language across social boundaries and females transmitted it to the young. Considering the emphasis that Locke puts on the complementarity of male and female language, a much more in-depth discussion to support his claim would be desirable. References are made to early division of labor as necessary to optimal development of the species, and this point is well made. Locke proposes that a unisex way of communicating is unnecessary as males and females generally have same-sex friendships and “if they’re lucky, men and women in long-term relationships learn what they must do to communicate with one another in a satisfying way” (p. 169).</p>
<p>What must be acknowledged is the degree to which the sexes work together in modern society—males and females are no longer relegated to their respective roles of hunter or caregiver and gatherer. Males and females now occupy many of the same roles and collaborate in a way that necessitates language that is neither “duel” nor “duet.” Additionally, linguistic stereotypes can be damaging and are often inaccurate; for example, with the case of female management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463006">Holmes, Burns, Marra, Stubbe, and Vine (2003)</xref> studied the language of female managers in a variety of workplaces to investigate whether stereotypes about female incapacity to issue directives and use humor were accurate. More than 50 participants wore or taped microphones to their desks for 2 to 3 weeks and after a period of time began to ignore or forget that they were being monitored, as evidenced by candid comments captured on the recordings. The authors found that actual behavior was not consistent with stereotypes and that female managers used a “remarkably wide stylistic range” of discourse that combined traditionally male and female modes of talk; communication choices were tailored to the needs of the situation and coworker or employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463006">Holmes et al., 2003</xref>, p. 422). Furthermore, in Chapter 2, when discussing the lack of females who participate in debate, Locke quotes a forensic specialist who comments on the “double bind” for women in this arena: “If a female is passive, she perpetuates the attitude that females are poor debaters . . . if she is aggressive, she is apt to be labeled as ‘bitchy’” (p. 56). He briefly muses that the expert may be right but does little else throughout the text to address the significance and impact of the double bind, much of which involves language, making it a relevant concept to Locke’s discussion. In the modern era, women currently face and will continue to face difficulties surrounding the language they do or don’t use; this must be recognized. In the introduction, Locke tells the reader that
<disp-quote>
<p>by exploring inter-sexual differences we make it possible to see ways in which modern men and women complement one another in the conduct of everyday business, much as (according to my claim) ancestral men and women collaborated in the evolution of language. (p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Locke never achieves this particular objective.</p>
<p>Overall, Locke’s text presents a strong case that biology and evolution play important roles in male and female talk. He dismisses the role of socialization in sex-linked language use, a position that will undoubtedly be met with disagreement from those who adopt a sociocultural approach to sex and gender differences in communication. For those who either endorse a deterministic influence of biology on behavior <italic>or</italic> believe that both biology and culture affect the ways that men and women think and behave (I personally belong to this latter group), this text will serve as an informative and engaging read.</p>
