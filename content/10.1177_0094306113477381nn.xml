<p>At least since the Enlightenment, secular intellectuals and preachers have pondered how to turn children into virtuous and accomplished adults. More recently, parents, teachers, historians, and social scientists have debated the nature and meaning of childhood and the best modes of childrearing. A growing diversity of family forms in the United States, paired with—and to many, symbolic of—cultural fissures, has intensified these debates. Whatever experts and parents say publically about the right goals and methods for parenting, it has never been easy to find out what really goes on in homes.</p>
<p>Markella Rutherford set out to do just that: to discover how parents process advice, how they actually approach childrearing, and how parenting has changed over the last century. She argues that parents in some ways have greater freedom than ever to develop distinctive modes of childrearing, while the unprecedented fears about the dangers that lurk outside the home and threaten to invade it impose mounting demands on parental involvement and accountability. Rutherford asserts that society has fallen sway to an overly-psychologized view of children’s needs that exaggerates their fragility and potential for victimization at the cost of minimizing their freedom to explore the world around them or participate in it as autonomous agents.</p>
<p>Rutherford’s goals are ambitious, her means more modest. The research behind <italic>Adult Supervision Required</italic> is two-pronged. The first prong reflects her interest in changes over time. Adopting a method long used by social historians, she systematically samples parenting advice in two influential popular magazines: <italic>Parents</italic> (1926–present) and <italic>Good Housekeeping</italic> (1911–2006). She acknowledges, but never resolves, the methodological question of whether magazines primarily reflect general social trends, or help to shape those trends, or both, and to what extent we can infer actual behavior from these writings.</p>
<p>Parent interviews are the second building block of Rutherford’s research. Using a “snowball” technique, starting with three suburban schools in one area of the northeast United States, she identified 30 parents whom she interviewed for up to 90 minutes each; she also observed some of them in parent support groups. Rutherford freely admits the limitations of her sample: it is small, geographically restricted, and resulted in an “oversampling of white, middle-class women” (p. 168). To make matters worse, because she aimed for a range of voices—fathers, single parents, working parents, minorities, those with children of different ages—the sample for any particular group may be small indeed. That does not diminish our interest in what her respondents say, but it changes how much we can rely on them as representative. Many readers will wish Rutherford had ranged among a broader group of informants. Others may wish she had spent more time with each parent, observing whether their parenting behavior matched their self-reporting.</p>
<p>Rutherford mines the sociological and historical literature to good effect. While the boundaries Rutherford draws between historical periods are not always clear, the general trends she identifies are important. Resting on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477381">Bauman (1987)</xref>, for example, she identifies a significant shift in the relationship between experts and parents over the last century. Where early and mid-twentieth century magazines told parents that expert advice was “scientific” and should be followed rigorously, by the end of the century parents became “interpreters” who could choose among approaches offered by competing schools of experts.</p>
<p>Another consequential shift stemmed from the victory over high levels of infant mortality and childhood illness that freed experts to focus more on children’s emotional needs than on their survival. This led, she argues, to an exaggerated concern about children’s “emotional well-being” and “self-concept” (p. 146). Rutherford presses further, contending that parenting centered on feelings and talking ideally prepares children for the therapeutic style of contemporary corporate capitalism captured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477381">Illouz (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113477381">2008)</xref>. This leap is a bit less well-supported than some of Rutherford’s other arguments, in part because it seems to conflict with the portrait she draws of individuated parenting styles.</p>
<p>The rebalancing of authority from above (experts) to below (parents) in a society that acknowledges “no one size fits all” in the culture of family life (p. 150), is both liberating and burdensome for parents. Parents increasingly fear they will fall short if they do not anticipate the “pervasive risk” (p. 159) to their children that lurks outside and inside the home. Some risks stem from technology, which provides such an abundance of choice that parents no longer control what is available to their children, even as society appears to hold them accountable for determining what is appropriate and then “try[ing] to enforce their own boundaries”—one of many private responsibilities foisted on modern parents without public support (p. 85). Parents worry too that technology blurs the boundaries between home and world, leaving children to be “victimized in their own home” by cyber-bullies and others. Technology intervenes even when older children are allowed to venture from home—increasing independence is partly illusory when it comes at the price of being “tethered” to home by cell phones and trackers (p. 82).</p>
<p>As the discussion of technology and danger suggests, Rutherford is at her best in tantalizing us with a series of counterpoised pairings: freedom/constraint, agency/passivity, visibility at home/invisibility in civic space, and the blurring of boundaries between private and public despite withdrawal into the suburban home.</p>
<p>These dichotomies yield some gems of insight. Consider the “figurative image” of the “disappearing play pen” (pp. 56–57). Parents may view the disappearance of the play pen as a symbol of the lack of boundaries and discipline or as a symbol of freedom, but Rutherford correctly points out that the contemporary home is full of new barriers unknown three decades ago: safety gates on stairs and doors, locks on liquor cabinets, fenced-in yards and warnings to parents that young children should always be within view. Younger children cannot play in their own yards, and older children no longer meander around the neighborhood or participate in civic activities without their parents, in large part because parents believe that as many as half the people who pass by their house “have bad intentions” toward their children (p. 71).</p>
<p>
<italic>Adult Supervision Required</italic> makes an important contribution to the literature of family life and the construction of childhood. In addition to opening a window into contemporary families, Rutherford gives us much to think about in terms of what kind of society we are, and what kind of society we want to be.</p>
