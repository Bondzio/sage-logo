<abstract>
<p>Although styles of self-reliance theoretically arise from early attachments, other research suggests the influence of attachment operates indirectly through internalized but modifiable beliefs about the self and others. The present study examined the relative contribution of parental attachment, social support perceptions, control beliefs, and self-monitoring in understanding workplace counterdependence, a problematic style of self-reliance reflective of avoidant attachments. Participants were 184 undergraduate students (mean age = 23.2 years) who worked an average of 29.2 hours per week. As expected, the regression analysis identified perceptions about support, explanatory beliefs, and self-monitoring skills as significant predictors of counterdependence, whereas parental attachment factors were not; collectively these significant predictors explained 41.5% of the variance. The results suggest that difficulties with workplace counterdependence may be ameliorated by interventions that target workers' perceived deficiencies in the skill-linked predictors identified in this study.</p>

<p>As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845311415401">Kahn (2002)</xref>, the contemporary workplace increasingly demands that its employees “develop those capabilities to work in conditions that require self-reliance” (p. 240). Employees are expected to possess the appropriate interpersonal and self-regulation skills required for effective work group performance in addition to the specific knowledge and skills required of their positions, all under conditions of relatively minimal supervision and unpredictable outcomes. This constellation of abilities is synonymous with self-reliance, an attribute that encompasses self-governance of behavior, self-assurance in abilities, appropriate group behavior, and positive conceptualizations of both one’s work and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick, Joplin, Nelson, &amp; Quick, 1992</xref>). Theoretically based in attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845311415401">Ainsworth &amp; Bowlby, 1991</xref>), self-reliance is particularly important in helping workers effectively adjust to changes associated with emerging technologies, variable market conditions, and decentralized operations and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845311415401">Kahn, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Pioneering research in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894845311415401">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894845311415401">Nelson &amp; Quick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al., 1992</xref>) found that variations in worker self-reliance were associated with many of the behavioral and psychological sequelae predicted by attachment theory. Since that time, scant research on self-reliance and workplace behaviors has been conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845311415401">Boatwright, Lopez, Sauer, VanDerWege, &amp; Huber, 2010</xref>). In contrast, hundreds of studies on attachment theory and its implications for adult functioning have been published and most of these studies “treat attachment as a personality-like trait that extends across contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845311415401">Neustadt, Chamorro-Premuzic, &amp; Furnham, 2006</xref>, p. 208). Still other research finds the influence of attachment operates indirectly through internalized working models of self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311415401">Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006</xref>), the cognitive schemas that may be revised by significant interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts, Tyson, &amp; Mason, 2002</xref>). The present study explores the relative contribution of parental attachment factors, perceived quality of current support systems, locus of control beliefs, and self-monitoring behaviors in predicting one style of problematic self-reliance, that of counterdependence, in the workplace.</p>
<p>Attachment theory posits that early relationships with caregivers provide the scaffolding for developing particular styles of self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311415401">Allen, Stein, Fonagy, Fultz, &amp; Target, 2005</xref>). A child’s early experiences in seeking security and protection provide the foundation for internalized models of self and others, which in turn guide feelings of competence, affect regulation and social behavior in future interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845311415401">Ainsworth &amp; Bowlby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894845311415401">Bowlby, 1970</xref>). Although theorists have defined three distinctive attachment patterns, greater contrasts have been drawn between persons with secure attachments and those with avoidant or dismissive patterns, perhaps because these patterns theoretically constitute polar extremes and characterize the larger percentages of the populations studied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845311415401">Shalit, Popper, &amp; Zakay, 2010</xref>). A secure style, reflected in healthy self-reliance, is evidenced by strong self-regulation and confidence in the availability and dependability of support systems to provide reassurance; secure persons believe themselves and others to be trustworthy, likable, and competent. A dismissive style, linked with consistent rejection or an absence of the opportunity to establish affectional bonds, invokes a deactivating strategy of affect regulation characterized by voluntary isolation and a devaluation of social relationships to protect against expectations of being rebuffed. As reflected in compulsive self-sufficiency, such persons are indifferent to social feedback, experience difficulty appreciating the perspectives of others, minimize vulnerabilities, and perceive social support as disturbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311415401">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845311415401">Brown &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894845311415401">Seiffge-Krenke &amp; Beyers, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As work settings present significant challenges for mastering job-related tasks and social relationships, workers with secure attachments would be expected to exhibit greater resiliency and adaptation when faced with such challenges than would workers with dismissive attachments. Initial research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894845311415401">Hazan and Shaver (1990)</xref> found strong support for these theoretical premises, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al. (1992)</xref> also found that the dismissive style, termed counterdependence, was associated with somatic and psychological distress. Other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894845311415401">Gianakos, 2001</xref>) found strong significant and negative associations between counterdependence and each of the five factors comprising career decision-making self-efficacy. In a study of preferred leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845311415401">Shalit et al., 2010</xref>), persons with secure attachments preferred socialized charismatic leaders who are oriented to team involvement, modify their vision in consideration of subordinates' needs and goals, and maintain warm relations with their subordinates. In contrast, persons with avoidant attachments seemed to prefer personalized charismatic leaders who promote their own self-interests, are task-oriented and personally detached, and exhibit less individual consideration toward subordinates. Compatibility in styles between leaders and followers is, in turn, a significant predictor of workers' willingness to remain with an organization. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845311415401">Pines (2004)</xref> explained these linkages with reference to the working models pertaining to career roles that are formed during attachment experiences. Persons with secure attachments likely enter their careers with realistic expectations, appraise stressful work situations positively, and use internal and active coping resources constructively, whereas those with avoidant attachments hold unrealistic career expectations, appraise stressful situations negatively as if childhood issues were being repeated, and cope in nonconstructive ways, including withdrawal.</p>
<p>An unsettled question in this literature concerns the continuity of early attachment patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845311415401">Ainsworth &amp; Bowlby, 1991</xref>). Some studies cite evidence of moderate to high stability in attachment patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894845311415401">Scharfe &amp; Cole, 2006</xref>). A 7-year longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894845311415401">Seiffge-Krenke &amp; Beyers, 2005</xref>), begun when participants were aged 14, concluded that internal models of self and others seemed to be firmly established by the end of childhood. Other studies find that changes in internalized models may occur with life transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311415401">Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006</xref>). As provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al. (2002)</xref>, “attachment style may function as a conceptual bridge linking early relational experiences with the development of a cognitive style” (p. 344), and internalized models of self and others may be revised by significant experiences. Little research has explored the schemas associated with compulsive self-reliance or counterdependence, even though these beliefs about self and others are important for therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One such belief system important to perceptions of self-reliance is the availability and dependability of support from peers and significant others. Particularly during emerging adulthood, such support systems serve not only as buffers against stress but also as unique sources of self-validation since these relationships involve equality, mutual intimacy, and reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845311415401">De Goede, Branje, &amp; Meeus, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845311415401">Greenberger and McLaughlin (1998)</xref> found that relationships with parents and peers have independent effects on self-regulation among college students. As provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845311415401">Duffy (2010)</xref>, several studies have evidenced significant relationships between sources of social support and career adaptability. A social constructionist perspective of work psychology advocates greater attention to those relationships in which one’s identity is constructed and reconstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845311415401">Blustein, Schultheiss, &amp; Flum, 2004</xref>). As over 90% of employees in the United States have coworkers, work relationships seem especially important; the quality of coworker support is strongly related to persons' perceptions about their work roles, which in turn impact levels of job satisfaction and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845311415401">Chiaburu &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Locus of control beliefs constitute a second set of schemas impacting internalized models of self-reliance. Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845311415401">Dormann, Fay, Zapf, &amp; Frese, 2006</xref>) reports that locus of control is a prime component of one’s core self-evaluations (CSE), conclusions about the self derived from experiences across varied contexts that affect levels of self-worth and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845311415401">Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2002</xref>). Among workers, perceptions of internal control are strongly related to job satisfaction, involvement, and performance, whereas external control beliefs are significantly related to job dissatisfaction and somatic complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845311415401">Evers, Frese, &amp; Cooper, 2000</xref>). Control beliefs also influence ways of coping with job-related stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894845311415401">Gianakos, 2002</xref>); internality is associated with adaptive cognitive and support-seeking coping, whereas externality predicts the use of escape-related coping that is associated with poor health and maladaptive behavior.</p>
<p>As explicated in the preceding literature, support-seeking behavior promotes adaptation and psychological well-being, provided it is context-appropriate. A third set of schemas relevant to self-reliance, then, involves beliefs in one’s abilities to manage the impressions of others so that one is perceived as a valued employee worthy of support. Such impression management requires the capacity to self-monitor, or the “extent to which individuals strategically cultivate public appearances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311415401">Gangestad &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>, p. 530). High self-monitors are socially ambitious and motivated to make desirable impressions to gain status and acceptance. They are vigilant to cues that signal behavioral expectations, mold themselves to job roles, and modify self-presentations in response to feedback. Low self-monitors are less socially adept, less concerned with pleasing their audience, and tend to behave in ways reflective of their core attitudes; their work performance is unaffected by motives to favorably impress others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845311415401">Barrick, Parks, &amp; Mount, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311415401">Gangestad &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>). Self-monitoring is often considered a personality trait but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845311415401">Barrick and colleagues (2005)</xref> suggest it is a “hybrid” construct, citing its stronger relationship to learned skills in managing impressions than to a motive to impress others.</p>
<p>The present study examines the extent that workers' counterdependence is influenced by early parental attachment patterns, perceptions of current social support, locus of control beliefs, and self-monitoring skills. Although workplace self-reliance is conceptually based on the premises of early attachment theory, it is hypothesized that perceptions about social support, explanatory beliefs, and self-monitoring skills will better predict counterdependence, as these factors reflect internalized models about self and others that have been constructed and modified by experiences throughout life’s course.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 184 adult undergraduate students (133 women, 51 men) recruited from psychology classes at a Midwestern university’s regional campus; this sex ratio is representative of psychology course enrollment. All respondents were employed, averaging 29.2 work hours per week (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.6 hours, range = 10–65 hours). In terms of ethnic identification, 167 students (90.8%) were Caucasian, 12 (6.5%) were African American, 2 (1.1%) were Native American, 1 (0.5%) was biracial, and 2 (1.1%) did not respond. Mean age was 23.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.9 years, range = 18–49 years). In terms of year in college, 105 participants (57.1%) were first-year students, 48 (26.1%) were sophomores, 25 (13.6%) were juniors, and 6 (3.3%) were seniors. More frequently reported majors included: education (22.3%), undeclared (12.0%), psychology (10.9%), nursing (9.8%), and business (8.2%). A large variety of job types and levels was reported, with the majority in food service (22.8%), retail (21.7%), administrative support (12.3%), and factories (10.7%). In exchange for their participation, students received extra credit points counted toward their course grade.</p>

<title>Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ)</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845311415401">Kenny’s (1990)</xref> 49-item measure assesses perceptions of attachment security among emerging adults (ages 21–30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311415401">Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006</xref>). Principal components analyses identified three distinct factors: Quality of Parental Relationship, consisting of 23 items that measure perceptions of enduring affective closeness (e.g., “I had warm and positive feelings toward my parents.”); Parental Role in Fostering Autonomy, consisting of 14 items that assess the perceived degree to which parents encouraged functional independence (e.g., “My parents encouraged me to make my own decisions.”); and Parental Role in Providing Emotional Support, comprised of 12 items measuring perceptions about parents' availability to provide encouragement and guidance when these supports were sought or desired (e.g., “My parents were available to give me advice or guidance when I wanted it.”). Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much</italic>), to indicate the extent each item describes their parental attachments. Scale scores are obtained by summing item responses, some of which are first reverse-scored, with higher scores indicating more positive perceptions.</p>
<p>Psychometric data provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845311415401">Kenney (1990)</xref> included a test–retest (2-week) reliability estimate of .92 for the entire measure, and estimates ranging from .82 to .91 for the factor scales. Internal consistency estimates for the Quality of Parental Relationship, Fostering Autonomy, and Providing Emotional Support scales were .96, .88, and .88, respectively. Convergent and construct validity studies of the PAQ have revealed moderate correlations with conceptually similar scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311415401">Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006</xref>). In previous samples, coefficient alphas for the three scales have ranged from .74 to .87 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845311415401">Lease &amp; Dahlbeck, 2009</xref>).

<title>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</title>
<p>This 12-item scale assesses perceptions about the quality of social support available from three sources: family, friends, and significant other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894845311415401">Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, &amp; Farley, 1988</xref>). Examples of scale items include: “I get the emotional help and support I need from my family” (Family); “I can count on my friends when things go wrong” (Friends); and “There is a special person in my life who cares about my feelings” (Significant Other). Respondents use a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), to indicate the extent each item describes their perceptions of social support adequacy, with 4 items measuring each source. Scores are obtained by summing respective item responses, with higher scores indicating more positive perceptions.</p>
<p>Principal components analyses have been conducted by several authors to confirm that the measure assesses three distinct support dimensions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845311415401">Clara, Cox, Enns, Murray, &amp; Torgrudc, 2003</xref>). Psychometric data provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894845311415401">Zimet et al.

Respective reliability estimates for Family, Friends, and Significant Other were .87, .85, and .91. Construct and divergent validity studies found significant and negative correlations between scale scores and scores on both depression and anxiety measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845311415401">Clara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894845311415401">Hefner &amp; Eisenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894845311415401">Zimet et al., 1988</xref>).

<title>Internality, Powerful Others, and Chance Scales (IPC)</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845311415401">Levenson’s (1974)</xref> 24-item measure consists of three scales assessing control attributions. Each consisting of 8 items, the Internality (I) scale measures the extent of belief in personal control (e.g., “When I make plans, I am almost certain to make them work.”), the Powerful Others (P) scale assesses the belief that others control outcomes (e.g., “My life is chiefly controlled by powerful others.”), and the Chance (C) scale measures the belief that fate or luck controls outcomes (e.g., “I have often found that what is going to happen will happen.”). On the original measure, respondents used a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from −3 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to +3 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), to indicate the extent each item described their beliefs, and 24 points were added to each scale score to avoid negative numbers.</p>
<p>Original confirmatory factor analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845311415401">Levenson, 1974</xref>) supported the independence of the three scales. Test–retest (7-week) reliability estimates for the scales ranged from .66 to .73, and the respective internal reliability estimates for the I, P, and C scales were .64, .77, and .78. Convergent and divergent validity were demonstrated via expected correlations with conceptually similar and unrelated scales. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894845311415401">Wilkinson’s (2007)</xref> analysis of the scale’s structure found that a three-factor solution exhibited a predictive advantage over a two-factor (internal–external) structure; for example, a chance orientation better predicted depressive symptoms than did a powerful others orientation in a large sample of young adults.

Four convergent and discriminant validity studies were conducted; in each case, the behavior of high SM and low SM persons differed significantly in the expected directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894845311415401">Snyder, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The SM scale has generated numerous studies examining its construct validity and factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311415401">Gangestad &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>). Many researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845311415401">Briggs, Cheek, &amp; Buss, 1980</xref>) have reported on the multifactorial nature of this instrument, finding that factor scores have opposite patterns of correlations with relevant criterion variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311415401">Gangestad and Snyder (2000)</xref> agree the measure is multifactorial; although they contend the full scale is superior in predicting expressive control, they support researchers' use of factors to explore their relevance to particular phenomena. A 5-point Likert-type response format for the SM was first reported in research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845311415401">Briggs et al. (1980)</xref>; subsequently this format has been employed by other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845311415401">Barrick et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Factor analyses conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311415401">Ahmed, Garg, and Braimoh (1986)</xref> identified three independent and interpretable factors that explained 65.7% of the variance: 8 items reflected a skill to impress the group (group skill; e.g., “In a group of people I am rarely the center of attention.”); 9 items represented a skill to present oneself based on what one considers appropriate for the situation (chameleon; e.g., “I am not always the person I appear to be.”); and 7 items reflected a skill to modify self-presentation in response to others' expectations (ingratiation; e.g., “Even if I am not enjoying myself, I often pretend to be having a good time.”). One item (10) did not load on any factor. In the present study, these orthogonal factors were utilized for several reasons: they were generated on a sample of employed persons, explained a significant amount of the variance, and were conceptualized as distinctive skills, as opposed to personality traits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845311415401">Briggs et al., 1980</xref>). In the present sample, employing a Likert-type response format yielded coefficient alphas of .79, .79, and .71 for the group skill, chameleon, and ingratiation factors, respectively.</p>

<title>Counterdependence Scale (CS) of the Self-Reliance Inventory</title>
<p>A survey of the extant literature finds this instrument to be unique in assessing attachment-related behavior at work. Conceptually grounded in attachment theory premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al., 1992</xref>), this 10-item scale assesses the extent that persons achieve felt security in work-related situations by socially isolating themselves from potentially helpful others (e.g., “Developing close relationships at work will backfire on you”). Respondents indicate the extent each item describes their behavior by use of a 6-point Likert-type scale; response choices range from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Scale scores are obtained by summing item responses, some of which are first reverse-scored, with higher scores indicating greater counterdependence.</p>
<p>As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al. (1992)</xref>, this scale’s internal consistency estimate was .70 and its test–retest (3-week) reliability estimate was .80. Construct and convergent validity was established by correlating scale scores with scores on five measures of psychological and physical well-being; as expected, counterdependence was a significant predictor of various health complaints and distress symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al., 1992</xref>). Other research, employing modified scale items, found counterdependence was positively and significantly related to symptoms of distress, including psychological, physiological, insomnia/anxiety, somatic, and social dysfunction, providing further evidence of this construct’s grounding in attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894845311415401">Joplin, Nelson, &amp; Quick, 1999</xref>). In the present study, this scale’s internal consistency estimate was .70.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through announcements in their psychology classes. After reading and obtaining copies of an informed consent, they anonymously completed the research questionnaire. Of 210 questionnaires distributed, 184 (87.6%) forms from working students were returned. The questionnaire consisted of demographic items, the PAQ, MSPSS, IPC, SM, and CS. The 7-point Likert-type scale employed by the MSPSS and IPC was also utilized for the SM and the CS in order to provide participants with consistent response choices across measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894845311415401">Kenny, Walsh-Blair, Blustein, Bempechat, &amp; Seltzer, 2010</xref>) once they completed the PAQ. Recent studies of Likert-type rating scales have reported that increasing the number of response options, to a point, will increase internal reliability estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894845311415401">Lozano, García-Cueto, &amp; Muñiz, 2008</xref>) as well as yield higher test–retest reliability estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894845311415401">Weng, 2004</xref>); in both studies a 7-point response option provided optimal results. Further, research participants seem to prefer formats with a greater number of options to better represent their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845311415401">Muñiz, García-Cueto, &amp; Lozano, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>All analyses were performed using the 16th release of the <italic>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894845311415401">SPSS Inc., 2007</xref>). Correlational analyses examined the relationships among research variables; those variables significantly related to counterdependence were then included as predictors in a stepwise regression procedure. Stepwise regression is a widely used variable selection procedure when conducting exploratory analyses. A regression model is formed by iteratively adding or removing variables in accordance to statistical criteria; the procedure ends when no remaining predictor can be added or removed from the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894845311415401">Shanableh &amp; Assaleh, 2010</xref>). There are no a priori assumptions about the ordering or retention of one particular predictor.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A correlation matrix analyzed the interrelationships among research variables. To control for experiment-wise Type I errors, a Bonferroni correction stipulating alpha as .005 was utilized. Counterdependence was positively and significantly related to the locus of control scales of powerful others and chance, and to the self-monitoring chameleon scale. Counterdependence was inversely and significantly related to all three parental attachment scales, to all three perceived support system scales, to the internal locus of control scale, and to the self-monitoring group skill scale. This correlation matrix is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894845311415401">Table 1</xref>

<p>To clarify the relative contribution of each correlate in predicting counterdependence, a stepwise regression model was constructed; the 12 predictors consisted of the scale scores of the PA, MSPSS, LOC, and SM. In creating a reliable regression model, predictor variables should approximate a normal distribution, with skewedness and kurtosis values ideally between ±1.00; in the present study, 11 of the 12 variables met this criterion whereas the MSPSS Significant Other scale did not. A power analysis was performed using G*Power 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845311415401">Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009</xref>) to ensure adequacy of the current sample size for constructing a regression model with 12 predictors. Specifying an effect size of .15, α as .05, and power as .95, the present sample size of 184 persons yielded an actual power of .951 for this analysis.</p>
<p>The model was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), explaining 41.5% of the variance. Seven significant predictors were identified: perceived support from family (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), group skills (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), powerful others (<italic>p</italic> = .001), internality (<italic>p</italic> = .005), chameleon (<italic>p</italic> = .007), perceived support from friends (<italic>p</italic> = .012), and ingratiation (<italic>p</italic> = .034).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the relative influence of parental attachment factors and more proximally modified beliefs in predicting counterdependence in the workplace. As expected, the stepwise regression model identified perceptions about support systems, control beliefs, and self-monitoring skills as better predictive of compulsive self-reliance than were attachment factors.</p>
<p>Although counterdependence in the workplace is conceptually representative of a dismissive attachment pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845311415401">Quick et al., 1992</xref>), no parental attachment factor emerged as a significant predictor. Rather, schemas reflecting internalized models of self and others accounted for 41.5% of its variance, and the resulting characterizations of dismissive persons are consistent with descriptions of this attachment style (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311415401">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845311415401">Pines, 2004</xref>). Perception about the quality of current family support was significantly and inversely related to counterdependence. This perception may indeed reflect long experiences of inadequate parental support not captured in the retrospective attachment measure. As insecure persons may respond defensively to self-report items that evoke negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845311415401">Brown &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>), perhaps counterdependent persons limited their disclosure about their parental relationships to avoid acknowledging interpersonal vulnerabilities. Alternately, this finding may reflect a temporal perception unrelated to early attachment as the family support scale does not constrain responses to parents. As the literature reports significant relationships between counterdependence and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311415401">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al., 2002</xref>), perhaps distress states negatively impacted reports about these internalized models of others. Similarly, the significant link between counterdependence and perceived inadequate support from friends may reflect long-experienced difficulties with peer relationships or distorted perceptions arising from felt distress.</p>
<p>Whereas beliefs about the availability and dependability of others to offer support may be affected by felt distress, explanatory beliefs and impression management behaviors represent more stable internalized models of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845311415401">Barrick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845311415401">Dormann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311415401">Gangestad &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>). In the present study, lower beliefs in personal control and stronger beliefs in the control of powerful others significantly predicted counterdependence. Further, counterdependence was significantly related to persons' perceptions that they were less adept with group skills that create positive impressions, were less skillful in modifying self-presentations in response to social feedback but were more comfortable presenting themselves however they desired based on their beliefs about the situation. This constellation of self-schemas seems especially problematic; while these individuals believe it is powerful others and not themselves who control outcomes, they concurrently perceive that they lack the self-presentation skills that could potentially lead to favorable evaluations from powerful others. Perceived inadequacies to influence others would paradoxically reinforce the belief that powerful others are in control and may result in avoiding or devaluing situations that require adept interpersonal skills, including support-seeking behaviors.</p>
<p>Collectively, the present results find that counterdependence in the workplace is not directly reducible to disclosures about early parental attachments but are better explained by examining schemas reflective of internalized models developed and modified through significant experiences.</p>
<p>As recommended by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845311415401">Blustein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845311415401">Duffy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al., 2002</xref>), difficulties with self-reliance may be ameliorated if interventions focus on helping persons identify and modify their schemas, in the present case about support availability, control attributions, and self-presentation skills. However, the therapeutic relationship is also important; persons with self-reliance difficulties likely hold faulty scripts about the expected pattern of interactions between self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845311415401">Pines, 2004</xref>). As social support in help-providing relationships is transactional in nature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894845311415401">Drach-Zahavy, 2004</xref>), therapists and counselors will need to be mindful that they are not engaging with clients in ways that reinforce faulty scripts.</p>
<p>Counterdependent persons perceive little support from family and peers, have low beliefs in personal agency but strong beliefs that powerful others control events, and perceive themselves as unskilled in modifying their social behavior to gain approval from important others. Consequently, they would likely benefit from social skills training specifically designed to increase percepts of self-efficacy and personal control. However, it may be difficult to therapeutically engage them given their negative percepts about supportive relationships; as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845311415401">Declercq and Palmans (2006)</xref>, persons with dismissive attachments may perceive even low levels of support as intrusive. Therefore, a data-rich introduction that details the tangible and personal benefits to be derived from a skill-based program may counter potential resistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, career counselors may assist counterdependent persons by first helping them recognize how extreme degrees of independence are detrimental to future career successes, given that the display of appropriate interpersonal skills is a realistic expectation in the present workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894845311415401">Strauss, Ketz, &amp; Keim, 2002</xref>). Second, career counselors may then address clients' expectations about work-related relationships and challenge their faulty belief systems about the availability of others for career support and guidance. Third, counselors can help clients establish meaningful connections with career mentors who model those interpersonal behaviors related to successful career adjustment, reminding clients to pay particular attention to the social cues used by mentors as signals of behavioral expectations. Fourth, counselors should encourage the emulation of those behaviors so that clients may better realize their abilities to benefit from career instruction are under their personal control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845311415401">Duffy, 2010</xref>). Praising these social success efforts seems particularly vital in modifying the schemas associated with problematic attachments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894845311415401">Levy, Ellison, Scott, &amp; Bernecker, 2011</xref>). Further, by focusing interventions on interpersonal work competencies, a reciprocal effect may be noted in a client’s work personality (Strauss et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Future research is needed to address the limitations of the present study. First and foremost are instrument issues. Reliable and validated measures of worker self-reliance are lacking despite the importance of this construct in the contemporary workplace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845311415401">Kahn, 2002</xref>). Second, the correlational analyses were useful in identifying the relative influence of particular schemas on self-reliance styles. However, research on the genesis and maintenance of these belief systems relative to early attachment is necessary to explicate theoretical linkages. Third, the diverse employs held by participants was an advantage as questionnaire responses were not restricted by the normative demands of a specific job type or workplace. Yet, as jobs differ in the intensity of social requirements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845311415401">Chiaburu &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>), future research may examine how self-reliance is manifested under such different intensity levels. Fourth, participants' responses to the attachment measure may have been affected by memory reconstruction or perhaps reflect defensive responding to emotionally laden content. Although self-report measures are practical ways of assessing perceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845311415401">Brown &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845311415401">Platts et al., 2002</xref>), future researchers may consider utilizing narrative data to better understand the complex interconnections between relational issues and persons' working lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845311415401">Blustein et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
