        <p>In <italic>Domestic Violence: Legal Sanctions and Recidivism Rates among Male
                Perpetrators, </italic>Cosimo provides an in-depth analysis regarding the
            interrelated factors of legal measures, reoffending, and intimate violence.
            Specifically, the text examines:<list list-type="bullet">

                    <p>the comparative significance of research findings related to domestic
                        violence as well as its implications (i.e., legislative, research,
                        etc.).</p>
                </list-item>
            </list>In Chapter 1, Introduction, the perception of domestic violence as both a
            personal and a public issue is presented. The overall aim of the study is presented
            along with its prospective contextual significance within prior studies associated with
            domestic violence and recidivism. In general, this study considers a number of
            contemporary aspects that have not been considered in similar related prior research
            efforts. This includes various legal distinctions, diminished opportunities
            (i.e., incarceration, etc.), and the extent of time with regard to
            recidivism. The chapter concludes with a brief synopsis of the subsequent chapters
            within the text.</p>
        <p>In Chapter 2, Domestic Violence: Personal Trouble or Public Issue, Cosimo discusses the
            contextual legal perception of domestic violence using a specific dichotomous
            (i.e., personal and public issue) approach. This includes a historical
            analysis of how domestic violence is perceived and responded to by various institutions.
            Specifically, it was rarely considered a serious offense. From a legal standpoint, it
            was ultimately viewed as a social issue due to a number of major social issues
            (i.e., public fear of violent crime, etc.). Toward the end of the 19th
            century, domestic violence was considered a personal issue through a number of
            ideological views and societal developments (i.e., psychoanalytical views,
            rehabilitative efforts, etc.). The latter part of the 20th century witnessed a
            shift toward the existence of domestic violence as a public issue in which various
            community-based coordinated efforts were encouraged.</p>
        <p>In Chapter 3, Criminal Justice Response to Domestic Violence: Theoretical Frameworks, a
            number of sociological perspectives are offered in association with the occurrence and
            response to domestic violence. This includes the influences of one’s social
            environment, the perception of negative sanctions, and the contextual role of gender.
            From a legal standpoint, both civil and criminal justice responses are explored. Within
            the scope of rehabilitation, both preventive and intervention programs are considered as
            well as the prospective factors (i.e., causal, correlation, etc.)
            associated with the likelihood of domestic violence. The chapter concludes with a number
            of research-based questions along with their respective rationales.</p>
        <p>In Chapter 4, Research Methods and Data, the author emphasizes the aim of the study by
            discussing the various research design methods employed. Initially, this includes a
            brief description of the selected data source along with an explanation as to why the
            various subjects were selected. Through the use of tables and classification measures,
            an extensive amount of information related to the actual study characteristics was
            identified. This included both independent and dependent variables. With respect to
            methodology, a discussion regarding the use of frequency distributions, chi-square, and
                <italic>t</italic> tests was provided. Specifically, as a means to determine the
            element of time in terms of nonrecidivism status, the Cox proportional hazards model was
            used. The chapter concludes by discussing the numerous limitations of the study.</p>
        <p>In Chapter 5, Characteristics and Court Involvement of Men in the Study, the author
            provides the actual characteristics of the subjects that were selected for the study.
            This includes both independent and dependent variables. Through the use of frequency
            distribution charts, both individual and legal-based factors were presented. </p>
        <p>In Chapter 6, Comparisons Between Recidivists and Non-Recidivists, the statistical
            aspects of the study are presented. In an effort to draw a distinction between
            recidivists and nonrecidivists, Cosimo employs the use of a number of testing measures
            (i.e., <italic>t</italic> test, chi-square, etc.). Nearly 70% of
            the subjects failed to engage in any type of subsequent domestic violence. Based upon
            the remaining 30%, the chapter concludes with the actual findings regarding the
            extent of domestic violence and recidivism. Factors related to recidivism include prior
            criminal involvement for domestic related offenses as well as increased periods of
            incarceration.</p>
        <p>In Chapter 7, Discussion, the findings of the study are explored from a number of
            perspectives. This includes a comparison with previous studies along with the inclusion
            of certain factors. To that end, a number of prospective explanations are suggested in
            an attempt to explain such differences. Cosimo compares the recidivists with the
            nonrecidivists by pointing out a number of categorical distinctions related to
            demographics, prior court involvement, and legal sanctions. The chapter concludes with
            an overview of the research hypotheses and their respective findings from the study. </p>
        <p>In Chapter 8, Summary and Conclusion, the author provides a review of the findings. This
            includes the exploration of certain factors that were not previously considered in
            previous studies. This is followed by a number of contextual explanations and inquiries
            regarding the significance of the research characteristics. Future research
            opportunities were associated with the use of specialized intervention measures, the use
            of civil protective orders as a risk factor, and the role victim experiences. The
            chapter concludes with an emphasis on addressing the issue of domestic violence through
            the existence of cultural and ideological transformation. </p>

            perspectives that is well written and concise. <italic>Domestic Violence: Legal
                Sanctions and Recidivism Rates among Male Perpetrators,</italic> is ideal for
            graduate and postgraduate students as well as policy makers. The text offers a
            substantial contribution within the discipline of criminal justice and criminology.</p>
