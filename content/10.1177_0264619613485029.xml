<abstract>
<p>This article describes and discusses a qualitative, descriptive, and exploratory study of how 12 visually impaired teachers in Uganda experienced audio-described educational video material for teachers and student teachers. The study is based upon interviews with these teachers and observations while they were using the material either individually, in pairs, or in small groups along with sighted teachers. The findings demonstrate that audio-described material was highly appreciated by the teachers, contributing to their involvement and emotional engagement with the situation for learners with disabilities. The teachers also benefited from the opportunity of participating in the discussion sessions that followed the viewing. In this article, questions regarding what and how to audio describe are discussed in the light of educational objectives and cultural relevance. The overall aim of the study is to make a contribution to knowledge about how audio-described educational videos may assist inclusive and reflective learning processes among blind teachers and student teachers in an East African context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Employing teachers with disabilities is one of the recommended measures to help ensure the realization of the right to education for children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264619613485029">United Nations, 2006</xref>). Blind teachers are especially valuable as role models for blind learners due to their experience and sensitivity regarding the challenges that these students face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264619613485029">Brandsborg, Vik, &amp; Andersen, 2001</xref>). Blind teachers are also valuable for sighted learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264619613485029">Kendrick, 1998</xref>), as they can contribute to creating positive (and reducing negative) attitudes towards blind teachers as being able instead of unable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264619613485029">Sentumbwe, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Educational videos that are used in pre- or in-service teacher education programmes should be accessible in an appropriate format for student teachers with visual impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264619613485029">Adams &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>). This can be done by adding verbal descriptions of relevant visual information to the soundtrack. This is called audio description. This article is based on a descriptive, exploratory, and qualitative study of how 12 Ugandan teachers with visual impairments experienced audio-described video sequences about inclusive education. The video sequences were taken from the training material, <italic>Teachers for All</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0264619613485029">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0264619613485029">
<title>Empirical and conceptual background</title>
<p>Studies have shown that people with visual impairments have gained and retained more information, found the viewing more ‘enjoyable, interesting and informative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619613485029">Ely et al., 2006</xref>, p. 197), and felt more connected to, and more comfortable, when talking to sighted people about theatre, films, or videos when these had been audio described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264619613485029">Schmeidler &amp; Kirchner, 2001</xref>). Since ‘different cultures tell events in different ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264619613485029">Orero, 2008</xref>, p. 180), the reception of an audio-described video may also vary according to culture. Studies from developing countries are scarce, although the prevalence of visual impairments in some developing countries is relatively high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264619613485029">Resnikoff et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Reception of visual information differs from information received through language. Visual information is perceived by a sighted person as ‘a dynamic whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264619613485029">Piety, 2003</xref>, p. 30), while an oral description, such as an audio description, must be sequential and selective.</p>
<p>The audio-described material described in this study focuses on the issue of inclusive education, which is a policy and practice that has required many classroom teachers to go through a process of re-orienting their previously held beliefs, attitudes, and emotions with regard to students with special needs.</p>
<p>A re-orientation may be facilitated through reflections about what is going on in a classroom, and when preconceptions and perspectives about schools and teachers’ practical work are connected with theoretical knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264619613485029">Adler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264619613485029">Day, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264619613485029">Edwards &amp; Protheroe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264619613485029">Ersözlü &amp; Arslan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264619613485029">Hatton &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264619613485029">Rio &amp; Alvarez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264619613485029">Schön, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264619613485029">1987</xref>). An audio description of educational material may possibly assist people with visual impairments with ‘the same freedom of interpretation that sighted people enjoy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613485029">Braun, 2007</xref>, p. 8), leaving them to reflect upon what they hear and to ‘assign their own meanings to the texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264619613485029">Piety, 2003</xref>, p. 19).</p>
<p>Two small-scale studies of an international group of sighted students in a special needs education programme have previously shown that the video material <italic>Teachers for All</italic> facilitated the viewers’ reflections upon inclusive education with a focus on learners with disabilities or special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264619613485029">Lyster &amp; Wormnæs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264619613485029">Randem, 2007</xref>). A study of five blind Norwegian individuals showed that <italic>Teachers for All</italic> engaged the viewers and motivated their reflective thinking and discussion activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264619613485029">Sellæg, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0264619613485029">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 18 teachers from Uganda were involved in this study: 12 visually impaired and 6 sighted. The visually impaired participants, four females and eight males, described as blind, were unable to watch videos due to their visual impairment. From this group, three were blind at birth, three became blind between the ages of 3 and 6, three around the age of 9, and three between the ages of 16 and 24. Every participant had extensive and positive experiences of listening to the radio, including radio theatre, although few had their own personal radio. Five of the teachers did not have private television sets. Two listened to television programmes with sighted family members who could explain the content to them. The participants were quite unused to going to the cinema, and none of them had previous experience of listening to audio description.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0264619613485029">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>A sample of audio-described video sequences extracted from the material <italic>Teachers for All</italic> was used by the participants. The video sequences show situations from schools and classrooms in Uganda and Kenya, followed by questions for discussion and reflection. In the audio-described version, verbal descriptions have been added, attempting to describe the scenes, including their settings, people, and actions.</p>
<p>The participants were video recorded while using <italic>Teachers for All</italic>. Three blind participants worked individually, while others worked in pairs or groups. In two of the pairs, both participants were blind. In another two pairs, one participant was blind and one was sighted. There were also three groups consisting of one blind participant and two sighted. Each individual, pair, or group first listened to, or watched, the sampled video sequence, some with and some without audio description. Afterwards, they discussed the topics raised for discussion, an example of which is the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this video sequence you saw a girl who is taller than her classmates. Why do you think she is taller?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants were also asked to retell a short video sequence to demonstrate their degree of understanding. They were interviewed about their feelings regarding what they had learned about inclusive education from both the material and the ensuing discussions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0264619613485029">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The video recordings of the interviews and of the participants’ work with the material were imported into NVivo 8 (QSR International) for transcription and analysis. In this article, results about how the material was received and used, and about the participants’ opinions about the material, are exemplified and analysed. The results are thereafter discussed in relation to the attention, engagement, and participation among the blind participants, whether the educational material facilitated reflections; and issues about cultural relevance.</p>

<title>Receptions of the audio-described educational material</title>
<p>Listening to audio-described videos was a new experience for the teachers included in this study. Evidence from the interviews and from the observations indicates that the participants enjoyed and highly valued the experience. Participants presented themselves to be sitting quietly, concentrated, and yet relaxed, while listening to the audio descriptions of the videos. Several participants specifically mentioned that they appreciated ‘seeing’ other schools than their own. Several participants appeared to become emotionally involved when discussing teacher behaviours and approaches as well as when reflecting upon the situation for learners with disabilities.</p>
<p>After data collection had been completed, several of the participants wanted to listen to the described video sequences that had not been selected for the study. They expressed a need and desire to gain access to more audio-described material, and in addition, they expressed feelings of being disadvantaged by not having access to the necessary equipment, stable electrical current, or Internet that could provide them with audio-described educational video material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0264619613485029">
<title>Issues raised for reflection and discussion</title>
<p>The discussions among the participants were lively. The material triggered reflection and discussion related to what the participants had heard or seen in the video sequences. For example, they attempted to understand the thoughts and feelings of the teachers and children appearing in the video sequences. They also associated and reflected upon their own classroom experiences and knowledge as former pupils and teachers. The discussion topics included children’s emotions, their learning outcomes, classroom situations, teachers’ work, peer interaction, and questions related to parenting and society. Participants’ perceptions of common prejudices and misconceptions regarding impairments and their causes frequently emerged in the discussions. For example, one comment about a sequence showing a classroom that included a girl with Down’s syndrome is as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>the so-called able-bodied … may feel that if I move near to a person with a disability, that disability may transfer from me to that person without a disability … But … these children seeing that the teacher is moving towards Anna, [and] pats her, and [that when] the teacher leaves Anna [she is still acting] normally, without getting Anna’s disability.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another sequence relating to Activities in Daily Living (ADL) triggered comments and discussion about skills they assumed children could learn in similar lessons. A video sequence in which a child was described as being taller than her classmates led to many reflections being expressed. One participant suggested that lack of knowledge may cause parents not to bring their child with an intellectual impairment to school at an early age. Others touched upon the possible lack of qualified teachers as a reason for non-enrolment of children with disabilities. Some wondered whether her disability may have caused her increased growth. One group focused on the distinction between inclusion and integration, the discussion being initiated by one participant saying, ‘Because the fact that the child is in the classroom, and seated among others, and also is asked questions like others, does not tell me that that is inclusion. It is just in an integrated class’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0264619613485029">
<title>Opinions about the audio description</title>
<p>Most of the participants preferred the audio describer to provide an overview of a situation before going further and describing its details. Descriptions of actions were regarded as important, for example, ‘the teacher moved to the pupil, touched on her to pull her attention’, ‘the teacher is pointing at the blackboard, the children are standing up’, and ‘oil is being poured in the cooking pot’. Descriptions of the setting, such as what the school uniforms looked like, whether they were barefoot or wearing shoes, their sizes, the classroom furniture and decorations, and so on, were appreciated, as they gave the participants relevant information about the socio-economic situation in the area. Occasionally, participants felt that they could not quite grasp the content in a video sequence due to a lack of description. However, as one participant remarked ‘I don’t know how much I missed’. Through the participants’ re-narration of a video sequence, the need for more or improved descriptions was identified. One participant liked the evaluative description that ‘the classroom was nicely decorated’, even though the decorations were not described. He said that ‘it shows me that it is a good class’. However, others were not in favour of hearing the audio describer’s evaluations.</p>
<p>While a teacher in a video sequence was perceived by sighted group members as being energetic, enthusiastic, and friendly, some of the blind members perceived her as harsh. Her speech was loud and sharp, and her body language and facial expressions were not audio described.</p>
<p>The participants appreciated the fact that the audio describer’s voice was clear, that the describer had good articulation and a proper African-English pronunciation, that the sound level of the describer was louder than the background sounds in the video, and that both the describer and people acting in the video had voices that could easily be distinguished from one another.</p>
<p>Natural sounds in the video were regarded as important, providing the listeners and viewers with an overall impression of a given situation. However, they were found to be distracting, when they were difficult to interpret. One participant thought natural sounds should be reduced to a minimum ‘so that the describer is in control of the scene’, but another participant claimed that noise should <italic>not</italic> be avoided, because ‘that is what a school is like’. The sound of an echo informed one person that the scene was taking place in a classroom (not outdoors), and the sound of children’s steps on gravel indicated that they were moving out of the classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0264619613485029">
<title>Dynamics in the discussion groups</title>
<p>In the groups of three, with two teachers who were sighted and one who was blind, it often took some time before the blind person became active in the discussions. Moreover, the sighted participants had a tendency to interrupt others and thereby dominate the conversation. They either spoke while facing the video screen or they looked at each other. The participant with visual impairment occasionally turned slightly away from the sighted group member(s) while talking. Although it was observed that the blind group member often brought up new issues, and contributed with reflections that were valued by the others, it was also observed that the blind group member had to be persistent to get a chance to speak and be listened to without being interrupted.</p>

<sec id="section12-0264619613485029" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Attention is a precondition for learning, in addition to involvement and emotional engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264619613485029">Rio &amp; Alvarez, 2007</xref>). The audio-described material in this study caught and held the interest of the participants and subsequently contributed to their becoming involved in educationally relevant discussions. Engagement was also evident through the participants’ wish to listen to additional video sequences when the data collection process was over.</p>
<p>Findings from this study indicate that audio-described video experiences may enable student teachers to participate and contribute in an informed and confident manner in discussions with sighted participants. This finding is in accordance with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264619613485029">Ely et al. (2006)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264619613485029">Schmeidler and Kirchner (2001)</xref>, where adults felt comfortable when talking with sighted people about audio-described science programmes on television. These findings make a strong argument for encouraging the production of more audio-described educational material for teacher education.</p>
<p>Interestingly, having a limited (or non-existent) familiarity with audiovisual material was no obstacle for anyone’s participation. However, since the novelty of the media may have contributed to their positive reception, sustainability of attention, engagement, and participation requires further research.</p>
<p>The results suggest that when a group consists of one blind individual among a majority of sighted participants, the latter group may dominate the discussion, especially at the beginning of a session. This situation may be due to the difference between the sighted and the blind with respect to the cognitive workload, including to first process the message from the video and then process the reflection and discussion issues. Having sufficient time for thinking and reflecting, as well as patience and emotional support from their sighted counterparts in the learning situation, may therefore be critical factors for visually impaired participants when one is using audio-described video sequences.</p>
<p>In this study, findings indicate that audio-described triggers may introduce and encourage reflective thinking among the visually impaired, even when it is a novel learning resource. The results suggest that when audio-described sequences facilitate diverse interpretations, they may encourage reflection, trigger discussions of alternative content interpretations, and contribute to increased understanding when used in pairs or groups of teachers – with or without sight. However, the more a describer has interpreted a scene, the less opportunity the listeners have for their own interpretation, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264619613485029">Edwards and Protheroe (2003)</xref>. Some audio descriptions may deliberately be left out if the intention is to create constructive uncertainty and thereby contribute to discussions, reflection, and skills in interpretation of a classroom. However, if crucial audio descriptions are left out, listener distraction and unconstructive confusion may be a consequence. It is therefore essential to take into consideration both the workload and the difference between fruitful uncertainty and confusing uncertainty when making decisions about what to audio describe.</p>
<p>Several comments from participants illustrate the importance of considering cultural relevance when making decisions about what to audio describe. For example, in this study, the description of a teacher patting a disabled child on her head communicated to the participants an important message about acceptance, indicating that the disability is not contagious. The description of a pupil being taller than her classmates triggered reflections and questions about reasons why pupils in the same class can be of different height. Descriptions of the children’s clothing and the classroom furniture and equipment provided important information about the setting. Background sounds in a video – exemplified by the sound of an echo, various noises, and steps on gravel – provided significant audible cues to those people who could not see. Descriptions and sounds are interpreted in relation to the listener’s cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264619613485029">Orero, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Audio-described video sequences are interpreted and assigned meaning in a specific context, in interaction with its listeners or viewers. Aspects of what and how to audio describe should be determined in view of the intended purpose of a learning resource. The findings of this study indicate that audio-described educational material for teacher education is a resource that may contribute to the experience of learning and provide opportunities for reflection for teachers and student teachers who are blind or visually impaired. When video sequences are audio described, and sufficient time is allocated, student teachers both with and without vision, may be afforded the opportunity to collaborate and discuss various points on equal terms. The provision of more audio-described educational material may contribute to breaking down barriers and empowering future teachers who are blind, and contribute to an increase in their numbers. Recruiting blind teachers is of importance worldwide, not least in East Africa and other developing areas where there is a high incidence of blindness. Further studies are required to provide more insight into the use of audio description across settings, cultures, and time, with due consideration to the educational relevance of context characteristics that are to be audio described.</p>
