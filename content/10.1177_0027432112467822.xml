<p>This article explores and contextualizes improvisation in music from an educational perspective. First, recent brain research that sees improvisation as a distinct cognitive activity is examined and used to illustrate the importance and uniqueness of this often ignored area of music learning. Next, the implications for the music classroom are explored in light of the brain research findings as well as the common misconceptions associated with improvisation in music classrooms. Finally, some overarching principles to help guide the teaching of improvisation in any music classroom are offered.</p>

<p>How can improvising help your students become more alert and better prepared to learn?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If you ask a group of high school music students (as I have many times) to say the first word that pops into their minds when you mention improvisation, their most common response will likely be “jazz,” and if one could somehow measure this, their most common emotion may well be fear. So how can it be that an essential element of musical expression and performance, one practiced by musicians in countless cultures and idioms for thousands of years, has been relegated to a single genre of music and associated with such anxiety? In this article, I attempt to explore and contextualize improvisation as a distinctive and creative cognitive activity, speculate as to why we seem to have narrowed our associations so much where improvisation is concerned, and finally, explore some overarching principles to help guide the teaching of improvisation in any music classroom.</p>
<p>While the title of this article might, as guitarist Derek Bailey pointed out, “seem unkind to the non-improviser,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112467822">1</xref></sup> it is not meant as a challenge. Indeed, it is worth noting that the title phrase did not come from an adept improviser, but none other than <italic>The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</italic> (1954), which stated that improvisation is “the art of thinking and performing music simultaneously.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112467822">2</xref></sup> As a starting point, let me contrast these two processes—improvising versus performing from a traditional notated score—so that we can discover to what extent the <italic>thinking</italic> processes are different. In deference to the vast number of competent musicians who read and do not improvise, I make the assumption that there is some thinking going on regardless of whether one is improvising, reading from a score, or performing memorized music.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432112467822">
<title>The Cognitive Realm</title>
<p>While the study of music perception and cognition is one of the oldest areas of experimental psychology, the past twenty years have seen a huge increase in the use of technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, a procedure that measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow) and scans using positron emission tomography (PET, a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional picture of functional body processes) for research in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112467822">3</xref></sup> A recent study by neurologists Charles Limb and Allen Braun probed the neural substrates that underlie spontaneous musical performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112467822">4</xref></sup> The study used fMRI imaging to explore and quantify the cognitive processes involved when a group of test subjects (professional jazz musicians) engaged in four main activities: playing a scale, performing a quarter-note improvisation within that scale, playing a previously memorized jazz passage, and playing a spontaneously improvised solo over the same chord structure as the passage. In other words, the investigators compared brain processing during memorized versus spontaneous musical processes (they called these <italic>overlearned</italic> and <italic>improvised</italic>, respectively) on two different levels: a simple scalar level and a more complex harmonic progression. The results are fascinating on two fronts. First, there seemed to be no difference in terms of cognitive processing between a simple, quarter-note, scalar improvisation and the more rhythmically complex harmonic improvisation. Second, and on a much deeper level, it appears, despite the similarity of scalar and harmonic association in the tasks, that improvised or spontaneous playing seems to involve an entirely different area of the prefrontal cortex than does performing memorized or read passages. Furthermore, such spontaneous playing actually deactivates the areas associated with overlearned playing (lateral portions of the prefrontal cortex) and activates portions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). To put it in context, the MPFC (although poorly understood) seems to be associated with “multiple cognitive functions in the pursuit of behavioral goals” and “maintaining an overriding set of intentions while executing a series of diverse behavioral subroutines.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112467822">5</xref></sup> Could this be neuroscientist-speak for complex multitasking? As well, the portions of the prefrontal cortex activated during overlearned playing (and deactivated during improvisation) are associated with more typical, school-like cognitive processing such as planning, stepwise implementation of tasks, and effortful problem solving.</p>
<p>In short, it appears that we access the region of the brain associated with sequence, planning, and problem solving when we play memorized or read passages. During improvisation, we deactivate this region and switch to cognitive processing associated with meditation, daydreaming, and complex, long-term multitasking. In a cruder context, one might see this as right- and left-brain processing with the creative, right side being associated with improvisational tasks and the logical, sequencing left side associated with learned-passage playing and sight-reading.</p>
<p>In extrapolating the results of such a study into the educational realm, one must proceed cautiously due to both the dearth of this kind of research in the area of improvisation and cognitive processing, as well as the small and narrow sample of subjects (six professional jazz pianists). Certainly many questions can be raised about whether such processing can be generalized to our student population or even learned, for that matter. However, Limb and Braun do point out that the processing uncovered during improvisation is not necessarily specific to high-level musicality alone and may well be a “defining characteristic of spontaneous musical creativity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112467822">6</xref></sup> Still, it would be interesting to see a similar study with Orff/pentatonic percussion instruments done on student populations or on people with little musical training and/or ability. Furthermore, Limb and Braun’s study focused on a kind of genre-specific improvisation idiom (jazz) that is considered by some to be highly structured and creatively deficient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112467822">7</xref></sup> How would a more free improvisational task (e.g., “Go to that piano and play ‘a windy day in the fall.’”) cognitively stack up? It is interesting that the researchers fell into the same trap as my high school students—that of associating improvisation with the genre of jazz exclusively.</p>

<sec id="section2-0027432112467822">
<title>Into the Music Classroom</title>
<p>If we ignore such concerns for now and accept the results at face value, what can we take from the work of Limb and Braun?</p>
<p>The results seem to make a clear, cognitive distinction between playing learned music and improvising. As music educators, we have often associated improvisation and composition as the more creative aspects of our discipline. While some may feel that more traditional performance settings offer much in the way of creativity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112467822">8</xref></sup> from a cognitive standpoint, it may well be that improvisation is a much more creative endeavor, at least insofar as the parts of the brain being accessed. Considering the surprising finding that there seems to be little difference, cognitively, between complex and simple improvisation, we need not be reluctant to provide our students, even the older ones, with uncomplicated improvisational activities. If the goal is to engage students in activities that access and exercise the “creative” parts of the brain, then one need not come up with a complex task or worry about students’ level of improvisational ability. Indeed, simplifying the tasks, at least initially, might well address what I think is perhaps the most common impediment to the exploration of improvisation in the classroom: the fear factor.</p>
<p>I must admit that in my experience, the fear factor pertains more often to high school students attempting improvisational activities within structured environments than anything I have seen or experienced with elementary or middle school students. Perhaps this is a good place to start: Why does fear of improvising seem to increase with age? Is this a developmental issue or a cognitive one—or a little of both? Or, more pointedly, is it the fear of the kind of task itself? I have come to believe that the task, to a large degree, governs the degree of fear, and this fear increases with age because the tasks are becoming more (and unnecessarily) complex. Furthermore, it seems that when we ask students to improvise in high school and college settings, it is almost exclusively within a structured (and at times complex) jazz context. Research settings with elementary students almost always involve simpler, pentatonic style improvisations on Orff instruments. When one moves to high school– and college-level students, the research points to jazz performance as the only suitable setting to study improvisation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112467822">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that we should have our high school and college students hunker down around some xylophones with the “tricky” notes removed and make some noise, but is it possible to move outside the jazz realm when we think about improvisational activities in the classroom? The brain research just discussed suggests that we still get full cognitive benefits from engaging in simpler activities, but simple does not have to mean elementary. Music educator and researcher Maud Hickey has recently called for a simplification in the teaching of improvisation, espousing a view that it should not be “a product taught in a strict methodological or pedagogical manner, but as a process to be encouraged on the way to learning freedom and self-actualization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112467822">10</xref></sup> Improvisation pedagogy can be complicated by methodologies, especially those relating to jazz. A freer and simpler approach may well “enable our students to be lifelong, creative improvisers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112467822">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>An Expanded Definition of Improvisation</title>
<p>A review of the literature seems to suggest that improvisation is a core part of the elementary music classroom, becomes an exclusive domain of general music (for those teachers that choose to explore it) in the middle school, and finally gets relegated to jazz ensembles in high school and college. Yet if we look at the various historical and cultural aspects of improvisation, it is clear that our educational funneling of improvisation into the jazz realm is in serious error. Consider areas other than jazz in which improvisation is important though often overlooked.</p>
<p>Improvisation has been closely associated with Western classical music since the time when Gregorian chant flourished. As Canadian music educator Jeannie Lee explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>These chants used additional melodies above the Cantus Firmus (fixed melody in Latin), which were improvised by Medieval musicians to glorify God. In the later periods, improvisation was used in performances outside of churches. J. S. Bach, Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, and Liszt all excelled in improvisation, which was then referred to as extemporization. Bartok’s <italic>Mikrokosmos</italic> were originally improvised, as were Beethoven’s famous sketch books (which he later used in formal works). Near the beginning of the 20th Century, improvisation disappeared in the Romantic Period as performers began mastering composers’ works note for note; the art of improvisation was eventually lost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112467822">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recently, a number of educational initiatives have appeared with the purpose of elevating improvisation back to the prominent position it once held in classical music performance. Perhaps the one most relevant to music classrooms is by Jeff Agrell, “one of the few classical music professors in the country who actively improvises, who passionately advocates for improvisation, who encourages and nurtures the improvisational spirit in his students, and who has succeeded at the often challenging task of obtaining institutional support for a non-jazz improvisation course.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112467822">13</xref></sup> Agrell has written a book titled <italic>Improvisation Games for Classical Musicians: 500+ Non-Jazz Games for Performers, Educators and Everyone Else</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112467822">14</xref></sup> The subtitle is telling in itself, speaking to the idea that most people looking at a book on improvisation will assume it was written for jazz musicians. University music faculties are also turning to the idea of making improvisation part of the classical music curriculum, such as the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, which created the Centre for Classical Improvisation and Creative Performance in 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112467822">15</xref></sup> or DePauw University School of Music in Greencastle, Indiana, which now offers a course called Improvisation and Western Art Music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112467822">16</xref></sup> Finally, building on the notion that improvisation is an important aspect of twentieth-century classical or art music, Christopher Keyes, associate professor of composition at Hong Kong Baptist University in Kowloon, has discovered that “teaching contemporary pieces that are largely improvised provides an ideal learning opportunity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112467822">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, he posits that the improvisational aspects of this often-difficult genre are mediated by the fact that improvisation “can engage students at whatever level of playing they are currently capable.”</p>
<p>Moving beyond the classical and jazz realm, improvisation figures into a number of genres of music. Rock (think “jam” bands such as Phish or the Grateful Dead), blues, hip-hop, various African and Asian musics, flamenco, and Inuit music all rely heavily on the art of improvisation. Furthermore, any sort of compositional activity will usually start with some aspect of improvisation, regardless of the genre or compositional task.</p>

<title>Back to the Music Classroom</title>
<p>By expanding our definition of improvisation well beyond the jazz genre, a wealth of possibilities opens up for the music classroom. Because a number of articles have already been published on this topic,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0027432112467822">18</xref></sup> I would instead like to suggest a set of more overarching principles that can govern the exploration of improvisation based on both the brain research and the idea that improvisation is an important part of many genres of music:</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112467822" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Avoid complexity:</italic></bold> As our brain research tells us, the activity does not have to be complex to gain full cognitive/creative benefits. This might also lessen students’ fear. Bring in complexity gradually when students are comfortable with simpler tasks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Structure the task:</italic></bold> While too much structure can often hinder or remove creative benefits from certain activities, enough structure is required to make students comfortable and keep them focused on the task at hand.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Dispel the fear:</italic></bold> The older students are, the more likely they are to both fear improvisation and think it the domain of highly skilled jazz players. It is important to open their ears to the diversity of improvisation and, if necessary, its inherent simplicity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Compose:</italic></bold> Improvisation is almost always a starting point for composition, so when doing composing activities, include improvisational aspects, especially as starting points.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Educate:</italic></bold> Convince students of importance/ubiquity of improvisation in so many genres of music including Western classical and popular music.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus far, I have avoided discussing the specifics of lesson ideas in favor of exploring larger and more general aspects of improvisation and providing some references to excellent lesson ideas elsewhere. When I read the previous bullet-pointed list, I realize that one activity I have used repeatedly in the past tends to address all of these and yet remains somewhat elusive in the literature. This activity can be used to great effectiveness in a high school performance setting—traditionally an area that finds few outlets for improvisation aside from jazz ensembles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0027432112467822">
<title>The Soundscape</title>
<p>The term <italic>soundscape</italic> was coined by composer and music educator R. Murray Schafer and refers to a kind of musical work that attempts to recreate the sensation of being in a particular acoustic environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0027432112467822">19</xref></sup> Like any great work of art, good soundscapes do not just mimic; they also convey emotional meaning and invite interpretation, in short, sensations that might come from the experience of an event or environment. The advantages of using soundscapes as creative activities in performing ensembles are manifold. The choice of soundscape activity can have immediate and deep relevance to a student’s personal experience (e.g., a creating a soundscape of their bus ride to school). Students’ experimentations and improvisations are, by nature, within their own playing capabilities, so the focus remains on creative improvisation and experimentation rather than trying to master difficult passages (as in a more traditional performance setting). Soundscapes are more open-ended and less rule-bound, so students are more likely to find more self-direction and less fear. Improvisation plays a key role throughout the process and could be an integral part of the final product. Finally, a well-managed but open-ended soundscape activity can find success in large, performance-oriented ensembles.</p>
<p>In this past year, our school has created two large-scale soundscape compositions that were performed at final concerts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0027432112467822">20</xref></sup> The high school concert band, consisting of more than fifty students, began the process by responding to pictures/photographs in small groups of five or six. Students created musical responses to the pictures by improvising themes, exchanging ideas, and adding textures with other instruments. It was important to encourage the students to explore the complete sonic possibilities of their instruments, such as the sound of the keys being pressed, droning with the voice into the bell of the instrument, using very long tones, partial fingerings, and so on. Once the short compositions/improvisations were complete on each picture, groups presented them to the class, where they were discussed in terms of suitability for a final, full-band piece. At this point in the process, the visual aspects of the soundscape were discarded in favor of using a series of musical themes. The themes were chosen by the students and further refined, then stitched together as a complete composition—all without the use of any written notations (graphic, notes, or otherwise). In this respect, the character of the work would change with each presentation due to the improvisational nature of many of the passages.</p>
<p>The high school string orchestra began, as did the concert band, by creating musical responses to pictures as an introductory activity. Next, the students discussed focusing on an event that had a number of different stages that could be conveyed by pictures. They came up with the idea of creating a musical work based on the 2011 earthquake/tsunami in Japan. A story line as a series of events was created, key photographs chosen, and the students went to work in small ensembles to create a section of music. Once complete, the sections were presented in class and students decided which would remain within the sections and which would be performed by the entire ensemble (more than sixty students). For the final concert, each small group (five to ten students) spread out in the theatre and played through the segments sequentially, while the corresponding photos were projected on a screen at the front. As in the concert band experience, no music was written or used at any time during the process, and hence, much of the performance was improvisational in nature. Both examples show how an open-ended and creative activity based largely on improvisation can flourish in a large ensemble format. It has been noted that overly structured, short, teacher-prompted improvisational activities lack such “student-centered” and “creative dispositions” that “move away from teaching improvisation to facilitating improvisation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0027432112467822">21</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0027432112467822">
<title>Teaching Is Showing How</title>
<p>In closing, perhaps it is appropriate to return to the source that, many years ago, got me thinking deeply about improvisation beyond the confines of my own notions as a jazz musician and educator. Derek Bailey’s outstanding book <italic>Improvisation: Its Nature and Practice in Music</italic>, in addition to giving some deep insights into the nature of improvisation, also illustrates, with numerous examples, just how prevalent improvisation is, and has been, in music. In a final chapter titled “Classroom Improvisation,” he interviews John Stevens, “the first musician to run an improvising class” in England. Bailey sums up Stevens’s ideas with the statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>The aim of teaching is usually to show people how to do something. What Stevens aims at, it seems to me, is to instill in the people he works with enough confidence to try and attempt what they want to do before they know how to do it. Encouraging them to work empirically, and trusting that they will learn, with some guidance, from the attempted playing experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0027432112467822">22</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This idea could well be the key point to a successful improvisation experience. Gain the trust of your students and give them the confidence to explore their own creativity in improvisational activities while you, in the words attributed to Thomas Carruthers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0027432112467822">23</xref></sup> make yourself progressively unnecessary.</p>
