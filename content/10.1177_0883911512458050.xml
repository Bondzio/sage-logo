<p>Recently, the use of recombinant full-length amelogenin protein in combination with fluoride has shown promising results in the formation of densely packed enamel-like structures. In this study, amelogenin (rP172)-releasing hydrogels containing calcium, phosphate, and fluoride were investigated for remineralization efficacy using in vitro early enamel caries models. The hydrogels were applied to artificial caries lesions on extracted human third molars, and the remineralization efficacy was tested in different models: static gel remineralization in the presence of artificial saliva, pH cyclic treatment at pH 5.4 acetic buffer and pH 7.3 gel remineralization, and treatment with multispecies oral biofilms grown in a continuous flowing constant-depth film fermenter. The surface microhardness of remineralized enamel increased significantly when amelogenin was released from hydrogel. No cytotoxicity was observed when periodontal ligament cells were cultured with the mineralized hydrogels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental caries (tooth decay) is a result of chemical dissolution of tooth enamel minerals (demineralization) caused by acids of bacterial origin. Remineralization of enamel with materials containing calcium, phosphate, and fluoride has been extensively studied with limited success. Enamel, the hardest biosynthetic tissue in vertebrates, has an amazing ordered hierarchical structure from the nanoscopic to macroscopic scale. Biomimetic synthesis of enamel-like material is of great interest to dental clinicians because it may provide an alternative, noninvasive treatment for early carious lesions. Amelogenin, the most abundant enamel extracellular matrix protein, is believed to play a vital role in controlling the formation of hierarchically organized enamel crystals. Using recombinant amelogenin, the mechanism of amelogenin-assisted organized mineralization has been extensively studied with regards to self-assembly and mineral complex formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512458050">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512458050">2</xref></sup> crystal morphology control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512458050">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512458050">4</xref></sup> and crystal nucleation kinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512458050">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512458050">6</xref></sup> Although different models have been proposed for amelogenin–calcium phosphate interaction, it is accepted that amelogenin is a crucial promoter of enamel biomineralization and a modulator of calcium phosphate nanocrystal structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512458050">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512458050">8</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that the self-assembly of amelogenin protein into nanospheres is the key factor in controlling elongated and oriented growth of carbonated apatite crystals, while the organized assembly of nanospheres into collinear arrays (chains and supramolecules) is critical at the initial stage of mineral deposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512458050">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512458050">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512458050">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The natural dynamic demineralization–remineralization process of enamel in the oral cavity maintains the integrity of tooth structure. The acids produced from fermentation of carbohydrates (sugars) by cariogenic bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> will enhance demineralization, leading to dissolution of enamel crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512458050">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512458050">12</xref></sup> and development of carious lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512458050">13</xref></sup> By proper enamel remineralization, the dominant demineralization process at early caries could be halted and even reversed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512458050">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512458050">15</xref></sup> The most commonly used approaches for remineralization include supplementing mineral ions (i.e. calcium, phosphate, and fluoride) from dental varnishes; filling composites, glass ionomers, tooth pastes, dentifrice, or mouth rinse solutions; and depositing fluoroapatite (FAP)-like phases within the enamel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512458050">16</xref></sup> Enamel remineralization has been well accepted for controlling coronal caries since the 1980s. However, strategies to effectively manipulate remineralized crystals to achieve desired mechanical properties and to form enamel-like nanocrystal have not yet been realized.</p>
<p>Previous studies have evaluated the unique properties of recombinant full-length amelogenin (rP172) in enamel remineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512458050">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512458050">18</xref></sup> The application of amelogenin combined with fluoride in remineralization solutions has proven to be effective in modulating the formation of densely packed enamel-like crystals in an in vitro etched enamel model. Within specific ranges of fluoride ion concentration and supersaturation degree of hydroxyapatite (HAP), enamel remineralization with densely packed nanorods is observed. Therefore, it is possible to formulate a biomaterial system that can locally deliver amelogenin and ions for enamel remineralization in a novel strategy to rebuild enamel-like crystals and treat early carious lesions.</p>
<p>Hydrogels have been reported as a mineralization template for synthesizing needle-shaped HAP nanoparticles. Self-assembled nanogels of cholesterol-bearing mannan act as templates for hierarchical hybrid nanostructures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512458050">19</xref></sup> Here, we developed a hydrogel system that can release amelogenin, calcium, phosphate, and fluoride in a controlled manner, and tested its efficacy in modulating enamel remineralization. In the oral cavity, hundreds of different bacterial species exist in highly complex communities, better known as plaque biofilms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512458050">20</xref></sup> <italic>S. mutans</italic> biofilms have often been used to study enamel erosion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911512458050">21</xref></sup> To better mimic the oral environment, we also tested this system using an in vitro mixed-species biofilm model, termed “constant-depth film fermenter” (CDFF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911512458050">22</xref></sup> The surface hardness of enamel caries before and after treatment was measured by a microhardness tester and evaluated statistically.

<p>All reagents and buffers were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO) or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Supersaturated calcium phosphate solutions, Tris (<italic>tris</italic>(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane), buffered at pH 7.3 were prepared by dissolving CaCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, NaCl, and Tris-HCl in distilled deionized water (DDW) to achieve an ionic strength (IS) of 190 mM. The standard procedures of bacterial culture and biofilm formation were followed according to previous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512458050">23</xref></sup> Brain heart infusion (BHI) and a mucin-based medium (basal medium mucin (BMM)) were used for planktonic and biofilm cultures, respectively. Recombinant full-length porcine amelogenin (rP172) was prepared as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911512458050">24</xref></sup> The purity of rP172 (molecular weight (MW) = 19572.7 Da) was analyzed using the Agilent HP 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Bruker Esquire 3000 ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA).</p>

<title>Preparation of remineralization hydrogel and assessing release of protein and ions</title>
<p>In the remineralization buffer solutions, the initial molar ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> ions was 1.67, the same as in HAP, with a supersaturation degree of σ(HAP) = 14.2, σ(FAP) = 51.6. Supersaturated hydrogel for the remineralization assay was prepared by adding agar powder (Cat# A1296; Sigma–Aldrich) to the remineralization solution, which was kept at 60°C after complete dissolution. The viscosity and gelation point of the agar gel were determined by ARES rheometer (TA Instruments-Waters LLC, New Castle, DE). The recombinant amelogenin was added to achieve a final concentration of 100 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> in the hydrogel.</p>
<p>After the hydrogel (2 mL) was set at room temperature in a plastic vial, ultrapure water or buffer was added to the 15-mL plastic vial. The concentrations of rP172, calcium, and fluoride ions in the equilibrated aqueous solution were analyzed in triplicate samples. At the desired time interval, 2 mL of solution was removed, and the same amount of fresh solution was added. The amelogenin concentration was assayed using a QuantiPro BCA Assay Kit (Sigma–Aldrich). The mixture of 20 µL of sample solution with an equal-volume bicinchoninic acid (BCA) working solution was incubated at 65°C for 1 h, and a 3 µL droplet of the mixture was taken for measurement by a preset BCA method in the Nanodrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Madison, WI). Calcium ion concentration was measured by the Orion 960 Titrator System (Thermo Scientific) with a calcium ion–selective microelectrode (MI-600; Microelectrode Inc., Bedford, NH) in a 2.0 mL solution. The fluoride concentration was measured by a 720 pH/ISE meter (Thermo-Orion) with a fluoride ion–selective electrode (Thermo-Orion 96-09) in 2.0 mL of release solution with an additional 10% total ionic strength adjustment buffer III solution (TISAB III; Thermo Scientific). The release solution from hydrogel was also desalted using a centrifugal desalting column (exclusion MW = 7000 Da; Zeba Spin Column; Thermo Scientific) and lyophilized. Then the dry powder was dissolved and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to determine the purity and integrity of the amelogenin.</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity evaluations</title>
<p>The cytotoxicity of the remineralization hydrogels was tested by coculturing with human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts. Human PDL fibroblasts were obtained from extracted molars from patients with healthy gingiva following informed written consent as prescribed in an approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC)-NO IRB #4826). PDL fibroblasts were maintained in minimum essential medium α (MEMα) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 200 units mL<sup>−1</sup> penicillin and 200 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin. The cells were grown in 48-well plates for 24 h prior to exposure to hydrogel or hydrogel extracts. Remineralization hydrogels (8 g) were extracted with 40 mL growth medium for 24 h at 37°C. The hydrogel extractions (400 µL) were then added onto the cells. In direct contact tests, 200 µL remineralization hydrogel at 60°C was cast onto a monolayer of cells. After hydrogel gelation, 200 µL growth medium was added on top. Medium containing 10<sup>−4</sup> M bisphenol-A-glycidyldimethacrylate (BisGMA) monomer (known to be cytotoxic to fibroblasts) served as a positive control. Untreated cells grown on tissue culture treated with polystyrene served as the negative control. After 24 h, cell survival was visualized using a fluorescent esterase substrate (acetomethoxy derivate of calcein (calcein-AM)) and a Nikon TE2000 (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA) inverted fluorescent microscope. The live cells were stained with the fluorescent dye, whereas the dead cells were not. Cell survival was quantified using a BioTek Synergy 2 fluorescent multiwell plate reader. A mid-term cytotoxicity test was performed on five plates of PDL fibroblast cultured with casting hydrogels. The survival rate for each plate was analyzed at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test for post hoc tests. SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2008) was used for all statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Preparation of artificial enamel caries</title>
<p>Extracted human third molars with no detectable caries or fillings (from a tooth bank from unidentified donors at the School of Dentistry, LSUHSC) were randomly selected and cleaned. For remineralization tests, the teeth were embedded in epoxy and sectioned to expose the occlusal surfaces using a water-cooled diamond blade cutter (Accutom 50; Struers, Ballerup, Denmark). For testing in the CDFF biofilm model, teeth slabs were cut longitudinally to slices with 0.7–1.0 mm thickness. Tooth slabs were gently polished with 600 and 2000 grits SiC paper and 0.05 µm Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> paste on a canvas cloth. The teeth were then demineralized in lactic acid solution (0.1 M, pH 4.5) containing 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.2% guar gum (Spectrum Chemical Co.) for 3 days at 37°C.

<title>Multispecies oral biofilm model in CDFF</title>
<p>Tooth slabs were treated with one of three remineralization hydrogels in the presence of multispecies oral biofilms grown in a CDFF. Three groups were created by slabs with hydrogel containing amelogenin and fluoride (AM group), hydrogel containing no amelogenin but fluoride (F group), and blank hydrogel containing neither amelogenin nor fluoride (control group). Tooth slabs were sterilized by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation for 10 min on each side. The tooth was then transferred to the top of the plug in a CDFF flange, where the remineralization gel at 55°C was applied. After gelation at 37°C for 30 min, BMM of pH 7.2 was introduced continuously at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>−1</sup> and the flange with 15 sample plugs was rotated at a constant 3 r min<sup>−1</sup>. A proportional mixture of different bacterial species was infused in the presence of an anaerobic gas phase containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% N<sub>2</sub> for the first 48 h after inoculation to facilitate formation of mixed-species biofilms.</p>

After treatment for 2, 4, 6, and 8 days, the tooth slabs were taken out, cleaned, and the surface Knoop hardness number (KHN) was measured. Following UV sterilization, the tooth slabs were reinserted back into the rotary flange in CDFF, and freshly prepared hydrogel was applied atop. Multispecies biofilms that formed in the blank plugs were spread by the scraper to other plugs on the surface of the hydrogel embedded tooth samples.</p>

<title>Remineralized enamel characterization</title>
<p>Enamel microhardness is an essential indicator of tooth structural integrity and function. The KHN on the enamel surface before and after remineralization was measured using a Microhardness Tester (MicroMet 5400; Buhler, Lake Bluff, IL) under 25g force and 15 s dwell time. For each sample, 5–7 indentation measurements were randomly taken 100 µm away from dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) or enamel edge.

The agar gel with a concentration of 0.4–0.5 wt%, which was flowable above 55°C but solidified below 38°C–40°C, was chosen as the hydrogel for the release of remineralization agents and was the focus of all subsequent remineralization tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">Figure 1(b)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">(c)</xref>, the release profiles from a 0.5% agar hydrogel (pH 7.3) can reach 4.7 µmol of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], 0.8 µg of [F<sup>−</sup>], and 60 µg of amelogenin from 1 g of hydrogel in 14 h. The release of rP172 from hydrogel lasted more than 24 h with a concentration between 40 and 100 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>. This shows that the release rate is dependent on the pH of the hydrogel within the pH range of 5.5–8.9. Amelogenin has an isoelectric point around pH 6.8. So its release rate was much higher at pH 8.0 than at pH 7.0–7.2 and was maintained at a similar level at pH 5.5. As for temperature effects, the release rate of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] decreased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">Figure 1(e)</xref>) at 25°C, but the release rate of [F<sup>−</sup>] from hydrogel remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">Figure 1(f)</xref>). Amelogenin has a relatively higher solubility at 25°C than at 37°C, therefore the release slightly increased at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To develop a hydrogel system for controlled release of amelogenin and other remineralization ions to promote enamel surface remineralization, several obstacles need to be overcome. First, the full-length amelogenin can be easily trapped in many traditional dental materials systems and lose its ability to modulate HAP crystal growth. The amelogenin molecule has an intrinsic bipolar characteristic, a proline-rich hydrophobic core, and a hydrophilic C-terminus tail, which behaves similar to amphiphilic molecules that easily bind to a charged matrix surface, such as chitosan and alginate. Second, the self-assembly of amelogenin appears to be strongly dependent on the pH of the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512458050">30</xref></sup> Considering that the pH in the oral cavity fluctuates dramatically, plus potential degradation by proteinases and peptidases of bacterial biofilms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911512458050">31</xref></sup> both the release efficiency and functionality of amelogenin can be significantly altered.</p>
<p>Amelogenin self-assembly is also critical for its function in calcium phosphate mineralization. Recently, the self-assembled supermolecular particles have been determined by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911512458050">32</xref></sup> and those results suggest that amelogenin self-assembly is more complex and dynamic than previously expected. Although the chemical environment of in vivo enamel mineralization is not completely understood, amelogenin will inevitably interact with the charged biomacromolecular surface of proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides, as well as minerals. After investigating several candidates, we have found that agar, a nonionic polysaccharide, shows low retention of amelogenin, and can be used as a feasible loading–releasing system for both protein and ion release. Therefore, only the physical hydrogel was used in this study since the cross-linkers in chemically cross-linked hydrogels could cause damage of the protein and impede sufficient release.</p>
<p>To treat the early stages of caries in the clinic, topical fluoride varnishes (2.26% NaF), fluoride dentifrices (0.11% F), and a casein phosphopeptide–ACP (CPP-ACP) complex have been developed and used as tooth remineralizing agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911512458050">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911512458050">34</xref></sup> However, none of these products are capable of promoting organized calcium phosphate remineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512458050">25</xref></sup> In mineralization from a simulated body fluid, synthetic HAP in a coating is usually observed as plate-like crystals associated with an OCP precursor. The degree of supersaturation, IS, additive concentration, and temperature are important factors affecting crystal growth and crystal morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883911512458050">35</xref></sup> Unfortunately, in most cases, calcium, phosphate and/or fluoride-releasing dental materials only induce the formation of loosely structured HAP plates or granular calcium fluoride.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883911512458050">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883911512458050">37</xref></sup> Incorporation of 1–2 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of fluoride in remineralization solutions may facilitate the formation of needle-like HAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883911512458050">38</xref></sup> The formation of hyperbranched FAP crystals was observed using higher concentrations of F (&gt;50 mg L<sup>−1</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883911512458050">39</xref></sup> However, neither plate-like OCP nor hyperbranched FAP can restore the function (e.g. hardness) of the enamel or protect the underlying tooth structure from further demineralization. In this study, we have again demonstrated the possibility of improving surface hardness by growing organized enamel-like nanocrystals on demineralized enamel using amelogenin.</p>
<p>Simultaneous release of amelogenin, calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions is feasible in an agar-based hydrogel system. However, the released ions may not be free ions but instead may be a complex of amorphous fluoridated calcium phosphate with amelogenin as suggested by previous researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512458050">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883911512458050">40</xref></sup> The release profiles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">Figure 1(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512458050">(d)</xref>) demonstrate that the addition of amelogenin can result in a higher release content, indicating that the protein may prevent crystallization inside hydrogel and stabilize the ACP complex.

<p>Multispecies biofilms grown in CDFF are regarded as an artificial mouth model commonly used to simulate the oral environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0883911512458050">42</xref></sup> In this CDFF model, it is evident that the balance of enamel remineralization and demineralization is from bacteria generated acid. As shown, when samples were analyzed after 3 and 6 days of remineralization in the presence of hydrogels without replacing the hydrogel, the KHN after 3 days was significantly improved compared to demineralized enamel, but the KHN was reduced after additional 3 days without replacing the hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512458050">Figure 8(a)</xref>). This is presumably caused by amelogenin and F depletion from the hydrogel, which makes the enamel surface prone to acidic attack and demineralization. The repetitive application of remineralization hydrogel containing amelogenin can significantly increase enamel hardness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512458050">Figure 8(b)</xref>). This also has a major clinical implication as patients should apply the remineralization gel every night for several days. The thermoresponsive hydrogel with a sol/gel transition point of 32°C–45°C can prevent the amelogenin from being released into saliva, but it will be permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>, and F<sup>−</sup> ions to facilitate ion exchange between saliva and the enamel surface, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512458050">Figure 7(a)</xref>. Such a gel-forming material will last up to 16 h on enamel surfaces and then could be removed by brushing and rinsing. In practice, repetitive use of such a gel would be required to attain adequate remineralization.</p>
<p>Although the final hardness of amelogenin hydrogel–induced remineralized enamel was lower than that of native enamel, the remineralized enamel treated with amelogenin-containing hydrogel showed significantly greater hardness than controls. The amelogenin residue in the remineralized crystals as detected by ATR FT-IR may limit its hardness. The application of enzymes such as enamelysin and KLK4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0883911512458050">43</xref></sup> to remove excess intercrystalline amelogenin could improve the crystal packing density. Future studies will focus on increasing the hardness by optimizing the hydrogel composition and investigating mechanisms of the protein–ACP complex release. The controlled release of mineralization-promoting protein and ions from a polymer matrix can modulate biomineral formation and provide a new biomimetic approach for preparing artificial biomineralized structures and regenerating mineralized tissue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this exploratory study, biocompatible amelogenin–containing remineralization hydrogels were prepared to release Ca<sup>2+</sup>, F<sup>−</sup>, and amelogenin. This remineralization hydrogel applied to artificial enamel caries lesions, displayed remineralization activity on early artificial caries in a cyclic treatment model and multispecies oral biofilm model. Repetitive application of the hydrogel significantly improved enamel hardness continuously over time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing new amelogenin-containing remineralization dental materials for applications in caries management.</p>
