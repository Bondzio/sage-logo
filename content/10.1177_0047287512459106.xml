<abstract>
<p>This research examines how destination perceptions are socially constructed in the context of international tourism. Building on social identity theory, this research proposes that the process of international stereotyping might be triggered when two countries have conflicts, resulting in the formation of negatively biased country and destination images. The results show that individuals who have higher identification with their own country (guest country) might possess poorer evaluations of the host country. The results further indicate that biased perceptions are fairly solid in that they might not be dispelled after actual visitation. The results of this research provide evidence that destination image might be a collective construction and that biased destination perceptions might be determinant factors influencing destination choice decisions.</p>

<p>Tourism, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512459106">Pearce and Stringer (1991)</xref>, is essentially a social psychological phenomenon. For example, the interactions between tourists and residents of tourist destinations can be viewed as the interactions between two groups of people who share similar values and cultures in their own groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512459106">Pearce 2005</xref>). On the other hand, it is well documented in the social psychology literature that members of a group are often exposed to similar patterns of social information, which might result in collective perceptions of outgroup people (people we see as different from us) or foreign nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512459106">Alexander, Brewer, and Herrmann 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512459106">Rubin and Hewstone 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287512459106">Stangor and Lange 1993</xref>). Therefore, the formation of destination image might also be a social psychological process and influenced by social factors, such as the national or racial/ethnic origins of potential tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512459106">Mackay and Fesenmaier 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512459106">Prentice 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512459106">Tasci and Gartner 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This research examines the concept of destination image from a social psychological perspective. Even though destination image has been a pivotal issue in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512459106">Tasci and Gartner 2007</xref>), previous work on destination image has tended to regard it as a subjective construction without considering the importance of sociocultural factors in the process of destination-image formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512459106">Tasci 2009</xref>). It is thus arguably important to examine destination image from a social psychological perspective as social perceptions might be biased against reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512459106">Alexander, Brewer, and Herrmann 1999</xref>). For example, when the cultural distance between guests’ cultures and those of their hosts is not great, destination images might be positively biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512459106">Prentice 2006</xref>). Destination images might also be negatively biased if guests have an overall negative image of the host country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512459106">Chen, Lin, and Petrick 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is therefore proposed that tourism researchers and practitioners should pay attention to social biases of destination perceptions. In fact, it has been argued to be a goal of destination marketers to create positively biased perceptions of their destinations by investing in promotional campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512459106">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil 2007</xref>). However, creating positive destination images is expensive and time-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>), especially when preexisting negative images of a destination are widely perceived as real in a tourist-generating area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512459106">Chen, Lin, and Petrick 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512459106">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil 2007</xref>). Given that negative biases of destination perceptions might become formidable barriers for destination marketing, this research attempts to investigate how biased perceptions are socially constructed in the context of international tourism.</p>
<p>Specifically, marketing researchers have long been interested in the effect of country stereotyping, which suggests that customer evaluations of products made in a certain country (product image) might be influenced by their overall evaluations of the country (country image) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512459106">Knight and Calantone 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512459106">Laroche et al. 2005</xref>). The effect of country stereotyping has also been tested and confirmed in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512459106">Elliot, Papadopoulos, and Kim 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, negative country images might result in negatively biased destination perceptions. However, examining country image as an antecedent of destination image seems to be merely explanatory in that this country-destination image model fails to explain when and why negative biases would form.</p>
<p>Social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512459106">Tajfel and Turner 1979</xref>) might shed light on the formation of biased destination perceptions in the context of international tourism. According to the theory, the contexts of intergroup (or inter-nation) conflicts might trigger individuals to think or act based on group identities (such as ethnic identity or national identity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287512459106">Turner et al. 1994</xref>). The presence of group identities, as predicted by social identity theory, will result in collectively biased perceptions of outgroup members or foreign countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512459106">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512459106">Rubin and Hewstone 2004</xref>). Based on social identity theory, it is therefore proposed that national identities in a guest country might be the source of biased country images and destination images of a host country when two countries are involved in conflict(s).</p>
<p>Therefore, this research has the following purposes: (1) to examine the effects of national identity on country images in the context of inter-nation conflicts and (2) to examine the effects of national identity on destination images in the context of inter-nation conflicts. Since previous research has demonstrated that destination images are influenced by previous destination experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512459106">Hu and Ritchie 1993</xref>), the proposed effects will be tested with and without controlling for the variable of actual visitation. Furthermore, as destination images are likely to be influenced by national identity and previous destination experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>), this research also attempts (3) to examine the interaction effects of national identity and previous destination experience on country images and destination images.</p>

<title>Destination and Country Image</title>
<p>Since destinations are intangible products, customers heavily rely on their images of alternative destinations when making their destination-choice decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287512459106">Um and Crompton 1990</xref>). Therefore, tourism scholars have frequently examined how to conceptualize destination image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512459106">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil 2007</xref>) and how to measure this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512459106">Govers, Go, and Kumar 2007</xref>). More recent studies have frequently investigated the antecedents of destination image, intending to understand how favorable destination images can be built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512459106">Baloglu and McCleary 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512459106">Beerli and Martin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512459106">Prentice 2006</xref>). However, it is articulated that tourism scholars tend to assume that the formation of destination image is an individual process in that the investigations have been mostly made to identify several personal factors influencing destination images, such as travel motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512459106">Baloglu and McCleary 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512459106">Beerli and Martín 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512459106">Hsu, Cai, and Li 2010</xref>), destination familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512459106">Baloglu and McCleary 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512459106">Lee, Scott, and Kim 2008</xref>), and previous visitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512459106">Beerli and Martín 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512459106">Hyun and Perdue 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is still a lack of consensus on whether or not the concept of destination image can be a collective construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512459106">Chen, Lin, and Petrick 2012</xref>), a number of tourism studies have shown that people from different countries have different images of a foreign country as a tourist destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512459106">Kim and Morrison 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512459106">Lee, Lee, and Lee 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512459106">Prebensen 2007</xref>). These studies have provided evidence that destination images can be a collective construction at least in the context of international tourism, while they have failed to further explain why people of different national origins have different destination images of a foreign country.</p>
<p>It is possible that the relationship between national origin and destination image can be explained by the country-of-origin (COI) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>). The COI effect postulates that customers heavily rely on their overall impressions of a country to evaluate the quality of products made in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512459106">Laroche et al. 2005</xref>). Therefore, negative country images might become barriers to selling products (made in this country) in the global market. This process of country stereotyping has been well documented in the marketing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287512459106">Roth and Diamantopoulos 2009</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that the COI effect is relevant to the destination-choice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>). In other words, destination images of a country, as perceived by future tourists, might be influenced by their overall impressions of the country.</p>
<p>Yet, the concept of country image has rarely been addressed in the tourism literature in that this concept is beyond the traditional destination image perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>). However, country image is related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn’s (1972)</xref> concept of organic image. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn (1972)</xref>, in the early stages of destination-image formation, organic images are formed based on noncommercial information sources, while the images are further induced by commercial information sources and modified by actual visitations in the later stages. As organic images are formed based on the knowledge that people gain from textbooks, magazines, and news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn 1972</xref>), they should include more general perceptions of a destination, while induced images should include more tourism-experience perceptions. Therefore, when the destination is a country, the concepts of organic and induced images are supposedly analogous to those of country and destination images.</p>
<p>Moreover, as noncommercial information sources have been found to be more credible than commercial information sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512459106">Fodness and Murray 1997</xref>), organic images seem to be persistent throughout the process of image formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512459106">Gartner 1993</xref>). Even though marketers can induce an image by investment in destination promotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn 1972</xref>), the task of changing image can be time-consuming and costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>). Therefore, destination marketing does not start from a zero base but depends on presently held images or organic images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512459106">Chen and Lin 2012</xref>). As induced images might be influenced by organic images, this association might support the structural model of country and destination images.</p>

<title>Country and Destination Images as Collective Biases</title>
<p>Even though the effect of country image on destination image has been empirically and theoretically supported, these effects do not explain when and why negative country images might be formed. It is proposed that social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512459106">Tajfel and Turner 1979</xref>) can provide insights into this topic. According to social identity theory, when two groups are involved in conflicts, group identities in each group might be activated, which means that group members might act and think based on their group identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512459106">Tajfel and Turner 1979</xref>). Subsequently, members in each group might behave as a part of their social groups and adopt shared attitudes toward outgroup members, which tend to be mostly negative when two groups have conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287512459106">Turner et al. 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has also revealed that the concepts of social identity and social perception could be further applied to an inter-nation context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512459106">Huddy 2001</xref>), especially in the context of international conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512459106">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>). Specifically, the conflicts between two nations might activate national identities in each nation, resulting in collective perceptions of a foreign nation as hostile, which might influence how people from two nations see and interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been witnessed that political elites often attempt to portray negative images of a rival country through mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512459106">Lee 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512459106">Manheim and Albritton 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512459106">Wei 2000</xref>) and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512459106">Bar-gal 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512459106">Coman 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512459106">Hart 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512459106">Hughes and Stone 1999</xref>). Since information receivers tend to regard news and education as credible information sources, they might be unconsciously influenced by the value-laden pieces of information from news and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512459106">Croteau and Hoynes 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512459106">Manheim and Albritton 1984</xref>). Moreover, even though education and mass media are less likely to be deliberately controlled in democratic societies, power is still wielded in the domain of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512459106">Gramsci 1971</xref>). In other words, the contents of mass media and education might not be deliberately represented, but the contents might reflect what we believe to be true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512459106">Chen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512459106">Gamson et al. 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter whether the knowledge conveyed through mass media and education is purposefully represented by political elites or simply reflects shared viewpoints, the perceived hostility of a foreign country might be socially constructed. Furthermore, since education and mass media are important organic sources in the process of destination-image formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512459106">Gartner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn 1972</xref>), it is articulated that the social construction of hostile images might contribute to negative country and destination images. Given that individuals who have higher identification with their own country are more likely to regard themselves as a part of their country, and at the same time are more likely to perceive a foreign country that has conflicts with their country as hostile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>), this research was guided by the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0047287512459106" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: When two countries are involved in conflicts, individuals who have higher identification with their own country will have more negative overall images of the foreign country (country image).</p></list-item>

<title>The Effects of Previous Destination Experience</title>
<p>The effects of previous destination experience on destination images have been frequently examined in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512459106">Hu and Ritchie 1993</xref>). One of the early works is the aforementioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn’s (1972)</xref> stage theory of destination image that suggested that destination images might be modified after actual visitations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton (1991)</xref> suggested that destination images might become more complicated after actual visitations. A number of subsequent studies have investigated the effects of previous destination experience on destination image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512459106">Beerli and Martín 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512459106">Hu and Ritchie 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512459106">Milman and Pizam 1995</xref>), while the results have been varied.</p>
<p>Some studies have indicated that destination experience positively affects destination image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512459106">Milman and Pizam 1995</xref>). One of the ways to explain these positive effects is with destination familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512459106">Prentice 2006</xref>), which can be defined as the number of destination-related experiences accumulated by a customer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512459106">Baloglu 2001</xref>, p. 128). As tourists gain more knowledge about destinations during their trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512459106">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>), they might become more familiar with the destinations that they have visited. Since most customers would likely feel safer to visit a familiar destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512459106">Lehto, O’Leary, and Morrison 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512459106">Wong and Yeh 2009</xref>), familiar customers arguably have more positive destination images.</p>
<p>Another explanation of the positive effects is with the argument that tourism can reduce tension between countries and ultimately promote peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512459106">D’Amore 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512459106">Hobson and Ko 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512459106">Jafari 1989</xref>). Specifically, with the increase of bilateral tourism flows between two countries, people from both countries might know more about each other, which might subsequently improve the relationships between two countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512459106">Butler and Mao 1996</xref>). As the argument of tourism as a peacemaker suggests mutual understanding could lead to mutual appreciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512459106">D’Amore 1988</xref>), it also supports that destination experiences can positively affect destination image.</p>
<p>However, the positive effects of destination experiences on destination images have not been supported by all empirical studies. A number of studies have investigated the effects of destination experience in a context where guest and host countries are involved in political disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512459106">Anastasopoulous 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512459106">Milman, Reichel, and Pizam 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512459106">Pizam, Milman, and Jafari 1991</xref>). The results have revealed that direct destination experiences can result in negative evaluations of host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512459106">Anastasopoulous 1992</xref>) or only marginally improve evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512459106">Milman, Reichel, and Pizam 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512459106">Pizam, Milman, and Jafari 1991</xref>). Negative effects of destination experience might be explained by stereotypes, which are simple and exaggerated images of foreign people and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512459106">Andsager and Drzewiecka 2002</xref>). Preexisting stereotypes might not be dispelled, but only modified or even strengthened by destination experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512459106">Andsager and Drzewiecka 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512459106">Laxson 1991</xref>), which suggests that tourists might only see what they want to see. As mentioned before, individuals who have higher identification with their own country are more likely to think and act as a part of their own country, so this research hypothesized,</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of national identity on country and destination images in the context of inter-nation conflicts. The proposed hypotheses were tested in the context of Taiwan and China, particularly focusing on how destination images of China are formed in Taiwan. The context of Taiwan and China might not be exactly analogous to an international context in that the legal status of Taiwan has remained unsettled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512459106">Yu and Chung 2001</xref>). Since this research examined the psychological process underlying the formation of destination image, the validity of hypothesis testing lies in how Taiwanese residents perceive Mainland China as a country and a tourist destination rather than the political status of Taiwan.</p>
<p>In fact, since the Chinese Civil War in 1945, Taiwan and China have been politically divided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512459106">Yu and Chung 2001</xref>). After the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo ruled Taiwan for four decades. In this authoritarian period, given that the Chiangs’ regime continued to legitimate itself as the only Chinese regime in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512459106">Uhalley 1967</xref>), this regime endeavored to construct Chinese identity in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512459106">Rawnsley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512459106">Scott and Tiun 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287512459106">Su 2007</xref>). Subsequently, with the democratization of politics in Taiwan since the late 1980s, the Democratic Progressive Party (DDP) has emerged as a potent force against the ruling party (Kuomintang or KMT) and its Chinese ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512459106">Chu and Lin 2001</xref>), resulting in division of political identity in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512459106">Jacobs and Liu 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Political elites in Taiwan had used education to disseminate their ideologies, including the Chinese ideology disseminated by the KMT during Chiang’s regime and the anti-Chinese or Taiwanese ideology disseminated by the DPP during Chen’s presidency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512459106">Chen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512459106">Law 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512459106">Scott and Tiun 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287512459106">Su 2007</xref>). The situation regarding mass media is similar in that major newspapers and TV channels in Taiwan have catered to audiences with different ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512459106">Rawnsley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512459106">Wei 2000</xref>), which is partially influenced by politics and partially driven by market mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512459106">Rawnsley 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, it has been demonstrated that Taiwanese residents who possess different identities are exposed to different patterns of social information about China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512459106">Rawnsley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512459106">Wei 2000</xref>) and supposedly have different perceptions of China. Furthermore, the collective perceptions of China that can be reinforced by national identities might not be limited to general perceptions (country image). As education and mass media are important organic sources in the process of destination-image formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512459106">Gartner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512459106">Gunn 1972</xref>), destination images of China as perceived by Taiwanese residents are also proposed to be collective and influenced by their national identities.</p>

<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>The main variables in this research included destination image, country image, previous destination experience, national identity, and the perceived relationship between Taiwan and China. The items measuring these variables were generated from a thorough literature review. The items measuring destination image and the perceived relationship between Taiwan and China were additionally generated with the use of in-depth interviews. Since determinant attributes measuring destination image might vary from destination to destination (Pike 2003), the authors interviewed 25 Taiwanese residents and asked them to list salient attributes of China as a tourist destination. In the process of sampling, the authors purposefully selected interviewees with different backgrounds to help get rich information. Sampling was discontinued once the data appeared to be saturated.</p>
<p>As a result, the concept of destination image was measured with a 19-item, 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = low evaluation to 7 = high evaluation), which consisted of 10 items generated from previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512459106">Beerli and Martín 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512459106">Chen and Lin 2012</xref>) and 9 items elicited from the results of the in-depth interviews. The concepts of country image and travel intention were also measured with 7-point Likert-type scales. Items measuring the concept of country image were adopted from Nadeau et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">2008</xref>) scale, which consisted of 20 items (1 = totally disagree to 7 = totally agree). Respondents’ intentions to visit China were measured by a single question asking their likelihood to visit China in the next year (1= unlikely to visit China to 7 very likely to visit China).</p>
<p>Regarding previous destination experience, respondents were asked to answer how many times they had visited China. For national identity, respondents were asked if they were Taiwanese, Chinese, or both. This measurement of Taiwanese national identity has been frequently used in previous political science literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512459106">Hsieh and Niou 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512459106">Law 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>). Respondents’ political generations were measured with two questions asking their ethnicities (Hoklo, Hakka, Mainlander, Aborigine, or others) and their birth years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Since items measuring destination image and country image were initially written in English, the authors used the technique of back-translation to identify and reduce translation errors. In the process, the survey questions were first translated from Chinese to English by a group of translators, and another group of translators translated them back to English. By comparing the two versions of English questions, the authors were able to make minor modifications to questions to make them more accurate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as mentioned before, the conflicts between two countries might activate national identities in both countries, resulting in collectively biased perceptions of the rival country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512459106">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>). In order to test the premise of social identity theory, the perceived relationship between Taiwan and China was also measured in this research. In fact, international relations scholars have identified three critical components of perceived international relationship: goal compatibility, relative power, and relative cultural status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512459106">Alexander, Brewer, and Herrmann 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512459106">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>). They have also defined the “enemy” stereotype as the perceptions of goal incompatibility, equal power, and equal cultural status, and the “ally” stereotype as the combination of goal compatibility, equal power, and equal cultural status. Arguably, the premise of international conflicts is met when a foreign country is perceived as an enemy.</p>
<p>The perceived relationship between Taiwan and China were measured with five questions based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512459106">Alexander, Brewer, and Herrmann 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>) and the results of in-depth interviews. Goal compatibility was measured with two questions, asking respondents which of the following categories best captured their feeling toward the economic and political integration between China and Taiwan, including the integration is beneficial for China but harmful for Taiwan, the integration is harmful to both sides, the integration is beneficial for China without hurting Taiwan, or the integration is beneficial for both Taiwan and China. Relative power was measured with two questions asking respondents which of the following categories best captured the relative military and economic powers between Taiwan and China, including China is much stronger, China is stronger, Taiwan and China are equal, Taiwan is stronger, or Taiwan is much stronger. Finally, relative cultural status was measured by asking respondents which of the following responses best captured the relative cultural status between Taiwan and China, including China is far superior, China is superior, Taiwan and China are equal, Taiwan is superior, or Taiwan is far superior.</p>
<p>Individuals who were 18 to 71 years old and living in Taiwan at the time of data collection were considered to be the target population. Since this research intended to examine the relationships between Taiwanese nationality identities and their destination images of China, a quota sampling technique was used in order to reach Taiwanese residents who had different national identities, including those who were prone to be Chinese and those who were prone to be Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Since Taiwanese national identities have been arguably best predicted by their political generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512459106">Hsieh and Niou 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512459106">Law 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512459106">Yu and Hsiao 2007</xref>), political generation was identified as the background variable of quota allocation. Political generation is the combination of ethnicity and birth year. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512459106">Hsieh and Niou 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512459106">Law 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512459106">Yu and Hsiao 2007</xref>) has shown that Hoklo people are more likely to self-identify as Taiwanese, while the other ethnic groups—including Hakka people, Mainlanders, and Aborigines—are more likely to self-identify as Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, previous studies have defined Taiwanese residents as three generations in accordance with their birth years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>). The first generation (those who were born before 1945) arguably has stronger national identities because they had grown up either in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period or in China before the Chinese Civil War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>). The second generation (those who were born before 1966 but after 1946) is also likely to have strong national identities because they might be deeply influenced by their parents (the first generation) in political attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>). However, the third generation or those who were born after 1967 arguably have more neutral national identities because they had grown up in the democratic transformation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512459106">Liu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512459106">Sheng 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it was planned to obtain an equal number of samples in each of the following cells: (1) the first- and second-generation Hoklo (born before 1966); (2) the third-generation Hoklo (born after 1967); (3) the first- and second-generation Hakka, Mainlander, and Aborigines (born before 1966); and (4) third-generation Hakka, Mainlander, and Aborigines (born after 1967).</p>
<p>Considering available resources, this research intended to reach a minimum of 600 respondents, with 150 targeted respondents in each of the four geographic areas in Taiwan (the North, South, Central, and East). It was also planned to obtain an equal number of respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 35) in each of the aforementioned cells. The survey data were collected from August to November 2009. The research questionnaire was administered personally to the respondents in the streets of four main cities in Taiwan, including Taipei (North), Taichung (Central), Kaohsiung (South), and Hualien (East). In the process of data collection, interviewers in each city were asked to purposively select an equal number of respondents who were born either before 1966 or after 1967. In each of two age groups, interviewers were also asked to purposively select an equal number of respondents belong to Hoklo or the other ethnic groups in Taiwan (including Hakka, Mainlander, and Aborigine). As a result, 722 questionnaires were obtained, while seven questionnaires were eliminated because the respondents lived in foreign areas.</p>
<p>The sample profile displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512459106">Table 1</xref> indicates that the authors successfully obtained nearly equal samples in the four geographical areas (North = 29.5%; Central = 24.2%; South = 23.8%; East = 21.8%) and in the four political generation cells (cell 1 = 22.5%; cell 2 = 33.7%; cell 3 = 21.1%; cell 4 = 22.7%). As a result, Taiwanese residents holding different national identities were likely reached. Among study respondents, 419 (58.6% of the respondents) identified themselves as Taiwanese, 261 (36.5% of the respondents) as both Taiwanese and Chinese, while 35 (4.9% of the respondents) as Chinese. Even though more respondents were prone to be Taiwanese, the proportion obtained in this research is close to the latest statistics released by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512459106">Election Study Center of the National Cheng-Chi University (2010)</xref>: 52.4% Taiwanese residents regarded themselves as Taiwanese, 40.4% regarded themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese, 3.8% regarded themselves as Chinese, and 3.4% had no opinion.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512459106">Table 2</xref>, Hoklo people tended to identify themselves as Taiwanese (69.6%), followed by Aborigines (60.4%), Hakka people (57.7%), and Mainlanders (36.4%). On the contrary, Mainlanders tended to identify themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese (63.6%), while nearly 40% of Hakka people (42.3%) and Aborigines (39.6%) were dual identity holders, and only 30% of Hoklo people (30.4%) identified themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese. Regarding political generation, Hoklo people across the generations tended to identify themselves as Taiwanese (the first and second generations = 69.2%; the third generation = 69.8%), while the first- and second-generation Hakka people, Mainlanders, and aborigines tended to regarded themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese (54.5%).</p>

<p>Data analysis in this study consisted of five steps. The first step involved assessing whether China is perceived as hostile by Taiwanese residents. In the second step, factor analysis was conducted on the destination image and country image scales to assist in data reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512459106">Hair et al. 1998</xref>). The third step involved assessing the effects of national identity on country image, destination image, and travel intention with multiple analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and <italic>t</italic>-tests. In the fourth step, in order to block the effects of previous destination experience, the study respondents were further separated as visitors (those who had been to China) and nonvisitors (those who had not been to China), and the effects of national identity were tested separately among visitors and nonvisitors. In the final step, in order to assess the interaction effects of national identity and previous destination experience, MANOVA tests and <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare how destination experience affects destination image separately between two different identity holders.</p>

<title>The Perceived Relationship between Taiwan and China</title>
<p>As mentioned before, the perceived relationship between Taiwan and China was assessed with five questions related to political power, economic power, cultural status, political compatibility, and economic compatibility. The results indicated that respondents perceived China as having stronger political (mean = 4.46) and economic power (mean = 3.73), while the cultural status between Taiwan and China was perceived as equal (mean = 3.15).</p>
<p>Regarding political compatibility, only a small proportion of the respondents (23.1%) believed that political integration is beneficial for both sides, while most respondents believed that political integration is either beneficial for China but harmful for Taiwan (46.3%) or more beneficial for China (21.8%). On the other hand, nearly half of the respondents believed that economic integration is either beneficial for China but harmful for Taiwan (26%) or more beneficial for China (23.7%), while slightly fewer respondents believed that political integration is beneficial for both sides (46.2%).</p>
<p>In summary, most respondents perceived Taiwan and China as having incompatible goals, equal cultural status, and unequal relative powers (China is stronger). Based on the definitions of the enemy and ally stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512459106">Alexander, Brewer, and Herrmann 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512459106">Herrmann et al. 1997</xref>), respondents tended to regard China as an enemy to Taiwan.</p>

<title>Data Reduction by Factor Analysis</title>
<p>In order to reduce the number of variables to be, a series of principal components analyses with VARIMAX rotation was conducted on 20 country image items and 19 destination image items. Based on Hair et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512459106">1998</xref>) suggestion, the latent root criterion of 1.0 was used for factor extraction, and factor loadings of .50 and communalities of .50 were used for item inclusion.</p>
<p>The principal components analysis of the country image scale produced two factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287512459106">Table 3</xref>). The first factor explained 62.2% of the variance and included seven items related to beliefs about the characteristics of people living in the country, so the first factor was labeled “people belief.” The second factor explained 11.8% of the variance and included five items related to beliefs about the characteristics of the country, so the second factor was labeled “country belief.” The assumptions in factor analysis were met as the KMO value for the analysis was higher than .80 and the Bartlett test of sphericity was significant at the .001 level. The results of reliability analysis indicated high internal consistency for the entire country image scale (all 12 items) (Cronbach’s alpha = .94) as well as the People factor (Cronbach’s alpha = .94) and the Country factor (Cronbach’s alpha = .91).</p>

<title>The Effects of National Identity without Blocking the Effects of Previous Experience</title>
<p>In the second step of the data analysis, the effects of national identity on country image, destination image, and travel intentions were assessed. As a result of factor analyses in the first step, two factors of country image (people belief and country belief) and two of destination image (quality and uniqueness) were produced. These four factors as well as the variable measuring travel intention were identified as dependent variables in the second step of analysis, while national identity was identified as the independent variable. The effects of national identity across the two factors of country image were first assessed by MANOVAs. Results indicated that Taiwanese identity holders possessed significantly poorer country images of China (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.947, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 677</sub> = 18.818, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The results of <italic>t</italic>-tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0047287512459106">Table 5</xref>) also showed that Taiwanese identity holders had significantly poorer country beliefs of China (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and poorer people beliefs of Mainland Chinese (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>The Effects of National Identity with Blocking the Effects of Previous Experience</title>
<p>To block the effects of previous experience, respondents were further separated as visitors and nonvisitors. Subsequently, the effects of national identity were assessed separately among visitors and nonvisitors. Among visitors, the effects of national identity were also significant across the two factors of country image (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.912, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 385</sub> = 18.488, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and the two factors of destination image (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.929, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 385</sub> = 14.621, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, among visitors, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0047287512459106">Table 5</xref>, Taiwanese identity holders had significantly lower people beliefs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), lower country beliefs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), lower perceptions of travel quality (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), lower perceptions of destination uniqueness (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and lower likelihood of visiting within one year (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>On the other hand, among nonvisitors, the results of MANOVA tests indicated that effects of national identity were only significant across the two factors of country image (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.976, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 289</sub> = 3.509, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), while its effects across the three factors of destination image were not significant (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.991, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 289</sub> = 1.251, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). As displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0047287512459106">Table 5</xref>, the results of <italic>t</italic>-tests indicated lower people beliefs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005) and lower likelihood of visiting within one year (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>In summary, since Taiwanese identity holders had poorer country images of China than dual identity holders regardless of whether they had visited China before, the first hypothesis was supported. Regarding the second hypothesis, among those who had visited China before, Taiwanese identity holders had poorer destination images of China; however, among those who had never visited China before, China was equally evaluated by Taiwanese identity holders and dual identity holders. Therefore, the second hypothesis was partially supported. Moreover, since Taiwanese identity holders had lower likelihood to visit China within one year than dual identity holders regardless of whether they had visited China before, the third hypothesis was also supported.</p>

<sec id="section12-0047287512459106">
<title>The Effects of Previous Experience</title>
<p>In the final step, the effects of previous experience on country image, destination image, and travel intention were examined separately among Taiwanese identity holders and among dual identity holders. The results of MANOVA indicated that, among Taiwanese identity holders, visitors had significantly lower country images (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.972, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 416</sub> = 6.021, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and lower destination images (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.961, <italic>F</italic><sub>2, 416</sub> = 8.424, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, as displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512459106">Table 6</xref>, the results of <italic>t</italic>-tests showed that among Taiwanese identity holders, visitors had significantly lower country beliefs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), lower perceptions of destination uniqueness (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and lower likelihood of visiting within one year (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This research examined how destination images could be a part of social biases in the context of international tourism. As suggested by social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512459106">Alexander, Levin, and Henry 2005</xref>), when two countries are involved in conflicts, national identities might be triggered, which might subsequently result in negatively biased perceptions of a foreign country. This research found that in the context of international conflicts, individuals who had higher identification with their own country (guest country) had more negative country and destination images of the host country. This research also found that biased perceptions might not be disintegrated after actual visitations. Therefore, this research has both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this research provides evidence that destination image might be a collective construction. As mentioned before, previous tourism studies have shown that people from different countries have different images of a destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512459106">Kim and Morrison 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512459106">Lee, Lee, and Lee 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512459106">Prebensen 2007</xref>). As the relationship between national origin and destination image can be explained by country stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512459106">Nadeau et al. 2008</xref>), this research further specified when and why negative country images might form. This research found that negative country images might result from the construction of social biases between countries involved in political conflicts.</p>
<p>Second, this research also found that destination images might be socially biased. In fact, previous studies have frequently examined the concept of destination image in order to understand how to build positive destination images by investing in promotion campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512459106">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil 2007</xref>). However, this research demonstrated that negative biases of destination perceptions might become formidable barriers for destination marketing. At least in the context of international conflicts, the images of a rival country might be constructed through education and mass media on a daily basis. Therefore, the resulting negative country images might be perceived as organic destination images, which are difficult to change via marketing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512459106">Gartner 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, this research found that biased destination perceptions were not positively changed after actual visitation. Specifically, it was found that previous destination experience had negative effects on the country and destination images of the host country among individuals had higher identification with their own country (host country), which was consistent with the findings in previous studies that direct destination experiences resulted in negative evaluations of host countries or only marginally improvement in the evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512459106">Anastasopoulous 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512459106">Milman, Reichel, and Pizam 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512459106">Pizam, Milman, and Jafari 1991</xref>). In fact, social psychology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512459106">Brown and Hewstone 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512459106">Pettigrew and Tropp 2006</xref>) have shown that intergroup contacts do not always result in positive changes in intergroup stereotypes, while one of the most important conditions for positive changes is that members in each group have intimate contacts. Since group tourists generally have lower levels of social contacts with local residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287512459106">Pizam, Uriely, and Reichel 2000</xref>), it is articulated that negative perceptions are very difficult to be changed through package tours, which might explain the negative effects of previous destination experience in this study.</p>
<p>This research also has practical implications. First, the study results revealed that among Taiwanese identity holders, previous visitors had poorer evaluations of China and lower intentions to visit China than nonvisitors had, which indicates that negative stereotypes of China among Taiwanese identity holders were actually strengthened after actual visitations. Although previous research has addressed the potential of cross-strait tourism development to reduce tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512459106">Chen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512459106">Guo et al. 2006</xref>), the results of this research indicated that the ideological distance between China and Taiwan might still remain, and it might serve as an inhibitor of the tourism flow from Taiwan to China.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study results also indicated that China was an attractive destination for dual identity holders. As this research found that dual identity holders had more positive evaluations of China as a tourist destination and higher intentions to visit China in the foreseeable future, China’s tourism industry should regard dual identity holders as a target market for marketing China to Taiwan. Results further revealed that among dual identity holders, previous visitors had higher evaluations of China and higher intentions to visit China than nonvisitors, which indicates that overall destination evaluations of China among dual identity holders might be improved after actual visitation. Therefore, since direct flights across the Taiwan Strait can considerably reduce time and costs of traveling from Taiwan to China, it is suggested that China’s tourism management should build dual identity holders’ loyalty, which might subsequently result in repeat visitations.</p>
<p>This research examined how destination perceptions are socially constructed, especially focusing on the process of international stereotyping and its effects on the formation of negative country and destination images in the context of international conflicts. Since hypotheses in this research were tested with only two countries, future research is recommended to further examine other contexts of international conflicts, such as China and Japan. Furthermore, even though intergroup or inter-nation stereotypes might be socially constructed, individuals also differ in their willingness to internalize group beliefs and discriminate against outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512459106">Huddy 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate individual difference variables in the research model, such as social dominance orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512459106">Rubin and Hewstone 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This research also examined the effects of previous destination experience in the process of international stereotyping. However, the effects were examined by simply comparing the differences between visitors and nonvisitors, which is a limitation of this research. Therefore, future research is recommended to further examine how negative destination perceptions are changed before and after destination experience. Furthermore, this research examined the effects of international stereotyping on destination image and travel intention, while future research is also recommended to examine the effects of international stereotyping on other dependent variables, such as host–guest interaction and trip satisfaction.</p>
