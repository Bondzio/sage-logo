<abstract>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Since April 2009, indicators for the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework pilot have been developed and piloted across a nationally representative sample of practices. In October 2009 a single palliative care indicator was piloted for 6 months that looked at, ‘<italic>the percentage of patients on the palliative care register who have a preferred place to receive end-of-life care documented in the records</italic>’.</p>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> The aim of this study was to gain the views and experiences of general practice staff on whether the inclusion of a single incentivized indicator to record the preferred place to receive end-of-life care would improve the quality of palliative care. Any issues arising from its implementation in a pay-for-performance scheme were also explored.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Interviews took place with 57 members of staff in 24 practices: 21 GPs, 16 practice managers, 12 nurses and eight others (mostly information technology experts).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The indicator was not deemed appropriate for incentivization due to concerns about incentivizing an isolated, single issue within a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary and complex topic. Palliative care was seen to be too sensitive and patient specific to be amenable to population-level quality measurement. In implementation, the indicator would pose potential harm to patients who may be asked about their end-of-life care at an inappropriate time and by a member of staff who may not be best placed to address this sensitive topic.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The most appropriate time to ask a patient about end-of-life care is subjective and patient specific and therefore does not lend itself to an inflexible single indicator. Focusing on one isolated question simplifies and distracts from a multi-faceted and complex issue and may lead to patient harm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Palliative care is the active care of patients with a life-limiting disease, and their families, by a multi-professional team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311406990">1</xref></sup> An individual is placed on the palliative care register when their general practitioner (GP) believes that they have a life expectancy of 12 months or less. General practice staff are often well placed to take a central role in palliative care due to the ongoing relationship they can have with a patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311406990">2</xref></sup> Community palliative care nurse specialists, who are frequently involved in caring for patients in the community, are also vital in providing support and advice for general practice staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311406990">2</xref></sup> In each case, end-of-life care, which is provided for those with an advanced, incurable illness, should allow an individual to live as well as possible until they die.</p>
<p>There are currently variations in the quality of end-of-life care at an international, national and regional level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311406990">3</xref></sup> For example, in the United Kingdom, a postcode lottery exists for whether patients approaching the end of their life are able to die in hospital or at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311406990">3</xref></sup> Between 2005 and 2007, 18% of people died at home in London compared with 21% in the North East. People in more deprived areas are also more likely to die in hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311406990">3</xref></sup> Choosing a preferred location of death is an important factor in achieving satisfying end-of-life care and a good death, with poor levels of support resulting in increased discomfort and anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311406990">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311406990">5</xref></sup> However, general practice staff have reported that eliciting preferred place of death from palliative care patients is a complex issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup> For example, preferences frequently change and are often ill defined or poorly formed in patients’ minds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, guidelines have been developed to address inequalities by supporting general practice staff in the provision of consistent, evidence-based palliative care. For example, the Gold Standards Framework (GSF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311406990">7</xref></sup> is a quality tool that addresses the complex issues in palliative care, encouraging health professionals to ensure effective communication with the patient, coordinate their care, control symptoms and support carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311406990">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311406990">8</xref></sup> The GSF also advocates advanced care planning for the patient and general practice staff.</p>
<p>At an international level, the World Health Organization recommends that all countries implement comprehensive palliative care programs with the purpose of improving the quality of life by addressing the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of patients and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311406990">9</xref></sup> In response to this, guidelines for best practice have been developed in a number of countries. For example, Palliative Care Australia has developed a strategic plan for 2008–2011 that aims to influence and promote quality care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311406990">10</xref></sup> The Swiss Confederation has also developed a National Strategy for Palliative Care 2010–2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311406990">4</xref></sup> In both cases the multi-faceted nature of palliative care is at the core of the strategy. However, the level of resources, traditions and cultural attitudes to palliative care vary between countries, resulting in inconsistencies in policy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311406990">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Quality indicators are used in many countries to measure the standard of clinical care in both community and hospital settings. In the United Kingdom, theQuality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), which is a pay-for-performance scheme, includes an indicator that financially rewards GPs for having a register of patients in need of palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311406990">11</xref></sup> Over 90% of practices have achieved this target, successfully identifying those in need of end-of-life care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311406990">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311406990">13</xref></sup> The QOF has led to improvements in patient outcomes in a number of long-term conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311406990">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311406990">15</xref></sup> but has also been criticized as inflexible and damaging to holistic doctor–patient relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311406990">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since April 2009, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has led a process that uses NICE or Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines to identify potential new QOF areas. These are then developed into indicators and piloted by an external contractor, led by the authors. A palliative care indicator was developed for the first QOF pilot, which asked practices to record ‘<italic>the percentage of patients on the palliative care register who have a preferred place to receive end-of-life care documented in the records</italic>’ over a 6-month period.</p>
<p>This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the views of general practice staff on a potential new QOF palliative care indicator and their views more generally of the role of the general practice team in end-of-life care.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="sectiontion3-0269216311406990">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Interviewees were recruited from a nationally representative sample of 28 general practices in 12 Primary Care Trust (PCT) areas in England. The practices were representative in terms of practice list size, level of deprivation and performance on QOF in the preceding year. The PCTs were also selected to be representative of PCTs in England in terms of geographical area, population density and deprivation. Two practices each from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were also recruited. These practices were sampled from a list of interested practices supplied by the NICE. Practices took part in a 6-month pilot of new QOF indicators from October 2009 to March 2010.</p>
<p>Practice staff who had played a leading role in the pilot in each practice were invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. This included GP(s), practice managers, nurses and other staff (mostly information technology (IT) leads). Participants were then nominated from within participating practices. All interviews took place in the participants’ own general practice and lasted between 30 and 60 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion4-0269216311406990">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Face-to-face interviews were conducted by KH, SC and HL in each practice to explore the views and experiences of general practice staff in piloting the proposed palliative care indicator. Interviews were conducted from April to June 2010, after the pilot had ended. The topic guide is shown in Appendix 1. This guidewas also sent to the participants prior to the interview to allow them to fully consider their responses. The interviews were digitally recorded and fully transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion5-0269216311406990">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis proceeded in parallel with the interviews and was inductive, using components of thematic analysis. This methodological approach was chosen to allow transcripts to be coded inductively in line with modified grounded theory. Thematic categories were identified in initial interviews and then explored in subsequent interviews where disconfirming evidence was actively sought. Where disconfirming evidence was identified, emerging ideas and themes were modified in response. The main categories were then compared across interviews and reintegrated into common themes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311406990">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311406990">18</xref></sup> Interview transcripts were read, annotated and categorized independently by KH, SC and HL to increase reliability. As this study was explorative, not theoretical, open coding was used rather than axial or selective coding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311406990">19</xref></sup> Theoretical saturation was achieved in that no new ideas emerged during the final few interviews.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="sectiontion8-0269216311406990">
<title>Practice staff demographics</title>
<p>Fifty-seven practice staff were interviewed: 21 GPs, 12 nurses, 16 practice managers and eight others (including an IT manager, assistant manager, care assistant, clinical data manager, administrator, finance manager and a clerk). Six of the physicians were female and 15 were male and all were profit-sharing ‘principal’ partners. Two-thirds of the physicians worked full time. All nurses were female with two-thirds working part time.</p>
<p>Five key themes relevant to the aims and objectives of this paper were identified: the over simplification of a complex issue; the need to provide individualized care; roles and responsibilities of health care staff; the value of incentivization; and training needs.</p>
<sec id="sectiontion9-0269216311406990">
<title>1. The over simplification of a complex issue</title>
<p>The incentivization of one single aspect of palliative care was thought by most interviewees to prevent practice staff from considering the wider context of the patient’s illness or illnesses. In the absence of recognizing issues such as social context and multi-morbidity, there was a risk of the GP engaging in inappropriate actions that may have resulted in harm to the patient:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘… this one size fits all is difficult … you are focussing all your practice resources in a particular way because there’s this money attached to it (practice manager, practice 14).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One practice manager was specifically concerned that the need to involve carers in discussions around end-of-life care would be ignored when using this incentivized indicator. This was seen to be important as the level of support had an impact on the likelihood of a patient being able to remain at home:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘… the only person that Doctor is supposed to be asking is the patient, you know, and I think the carers should come into this … (practice manager, practice 9).’</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion10-0269216311406990">
<title>2. The need to provide individualized care</title>
<p>The majority of interviewees highlighted the timing of this sensitive question as a potential problem. It was recognized that asking the question at an inappropriate time could be damaging to the patient, especially for patients who had not yet fully accepted their prognosis. The unpredictable nature of prognosis and the need to build a relationship with the patient before end-of-life care was discussed meant that prescriptive rules were seen as unhelpful:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘I think if this is going to become a tick box exercise it might be that the question will be pushed at an inappropriate time, the wrong moment for the sake of obtaining some points (GP, practice 6).’</p>
<p>‘Very very difficult situation for many patients, they are able to deal with things at different stages of their illness … So it’s got to be very delicately handled (practice nurse, practice 6).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One GP also highlighted that even when a patient is put on the palliative care register, their health may improve, deeming a question around end-of-life care inappropriate:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘To make sense of this you’d have to ask this at a standard time before death, and that’s unpredictable. I can understand why this is very attractive to healthcare planners, but actually in the real world I think it’s a very difficult one (GP, practice 13).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Additional uncertainty was expressed around whether there was a need to record any change in the preferred location for end-of-life care. If patients change their mind, the recorded preference would attract payment whilst becoming obsolete:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘I don’t think it’s necessary because they can change their preferred place anyway … and we have to respect that choice … if you don’t change it what’s the point of recording it (GP, practice 7).’</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion11-0269216311406990">
<title>3. Roles and responsibilities of health care staff</title>
<p>The majority of practice staff in this study believed that discussing end-of-life care was not always the responsibility of the general practice team. It was believed that the individual who worked most closely with the patient and their family was best placed to discuss this issue. This was often a community palliative care nurse specialist. This might then lead to problems recording data as part of the QOF, as GPs might feel pressured into asking the question themselves:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘It depends on the relationships that have been developed and who has that relationship. It’s often the GP, but I don’t see a reason why it shouldn’t be a palliative care nurse, the district nurse, it depends who’s in the right position and the right time (GP, practice 31).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A lack of cooperation between community palliative care nurse specialists and primary care was also seen as a barrier to effective palliative care by one practice manager. This reflects the complexity of coordinating a multi-disciplinary issue. This may lead to problems recording data as part of QOF as GPs may not always be aware when a community palliative care nurse specialist has broached the subject:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘… there isn’t a lot of cooperation between primary care and nursing at the moment … (practice manager, practice 22).’</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion12-0269216311406990">
<title>4. The value of incentivization</title>
<p>The majority of practice staff in this study were already using the GSF as a tool to engage with evidence-based practice. This tool prompted discussions around preferred place for end-of-life care with patients as part of their wider care:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘it was something that we were collecting as part of a lot of other information, not necessarily coded but certainly recorded in the patient’s record (practice manager, practice 11).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, a minority of staff stated that their practice did not have the resources to engage with best practice in palliative care:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘… it’s all very well asking what the best option for that patient is, but we can’t always deliver it because we haven’t got the community services in place to provide end-of-life care at home for everyone (GP, practice 30).’</p>
<p>‘… the gold standards framework’s a colossal thing; it’s just not practical in GP palliative care (GP, practice 13).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A small number of practice staff offered disconfirming evidence by highlighting how patients on the palliative care register can receive poor-quality care. Staff described how initiating a conversation around preferred location of end-of-life care can be difficult and is sometimes overlooked by practice staff. In opposition to the majority of staff, these individuals therefore believed that incentivization might prompt the delivery of more consistent care:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘I think palliative care patients do get a pretty raw deal and I think there’s lots of evidence that shows that GP’s could be and should be more involved (GP, practice 24).’</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion13-0269216311406990">
<title>5. Training needs</title>
<p>A minority of interviewees described how they did not feel adequately trained to judge an appropriate time to discuss end-of-life care and engage fully with best practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘The question of discussing where someone would like to receive their end of life care is not something that you want to take with any patient lightly, or without a reasonable amount of training and knowledge behind it. So I think there are moral concerns there as to it being a target (practice manager, practice 8).’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In-house training was suggested as a way to improve skills, with practice staff learning from the experiences of more experienced individuals with a special interest in palliative care:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘… I think training would help. I was at the palliative care meeting … and in-house training was how they were seeing the way forward (GP, practice 34).’</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study adds to our knowledge of palliative care by reporting the views of UK general practice staff on this issue. It suggests that a single incentivized quality indicator, which records the preferred place to receive end-of-life care, is not an appropriate tool to improve the quality of end-of-life care. A number of negative unintended consequences were attached to this pilot indicator. For example, the incentivization of one aspect of palliative care was thought to risk preventing practice staff from considering the wider context of the patient’s illness. The prescriptive, tick box nature of the QOF was also seen as incompatible with the complex patient-specific nature of end-of-life care, which could lead to potential harm to patients who may be asked about their end-of-life care at aninappropriate time. Practice staff also stated that they were not always best placed to discuss end-of-life care with their patients. The individual with the best relationship with the patient, which could be the GP, practice nurse, community palliative care nurse specialist or district nurses, should address this issue.</p>
<sec id="sectiontion15-0269216311406990">
<title>Comparison with previous literature</title>
<p>Munday et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup> highlighted the concern held by general practice staff over the appropriate time to ask a patient about their end-of-life care. This uncertainty was also a common theme in this study. These staff are therefore at risk of taking an indirect approach, which may lead to inaccurate assumptions about a patient’s preference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup> This highlights a need to balance the advice given in guidelines to elicit preferred place of end-of-life care with assessment of the appropriateness of discussing the issue with patients using cues and general leanings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311406990">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practice staff in this study also emphasized the need for a community-based holistic approach, with the best-placed professional, who has a good relationship with the patient, approaching the topic of end-of-life care. This may be a community palliative care nurse specialist or practice nurse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311406990">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311406990">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion16-0269216311406990">
<title>Implications for policy and practice</title>
<p>Palliative care is a multi-faceted issue and each decision can be influenced by a number of factors, including uncertainty of prognosis, multi-morbidity and constraints arising from social support networks and service limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup> Such uncertainty has raised the need for further support for primary care professionals in achieving quality care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311406990">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practice staff identified the GSF and the protocol for advanced care planning as effective tools that guide current best practice. These initiatives address palliative care as a whole, recognizing that a number of complex issues, such as prognosis and level of support, will impact on the patient’s palliative care needs. However, these tools are not used by all, and a minority of staff suggested that an incentivized indicator could provide the consistency and guidance that they felt was lacking around palliative care. This suggests that there is still some work to do to support all practices in providing high-quality palliative care.</p>
<p>In-house training in palliative care may increase the confidence of practice staff in communicating with all patients and carers; however, we already know that the quality and level of training currently varies across the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311406990">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311406990">23</xref></sup> Further research is needed to evaluate current training programmes to reveal the most appropriate and cost-effective method for transferring this vital information to all practice staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion17-0269216311406990">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Previous research has examined how preferences for the location of end-of-life care are currently elicited by general practice staff. However, there have been no qualitative studies to our knowledge on the experiences and views of general practice staff on the introduction of an incentivized quality indicator in palliative care.</p>
<p>This study incorporates the views of general practice staff in a nationally representative sample of general practices. However, in order to gain a complete picture of palliative care in the UK, the views of community palliative care nurse specialists and of patients receiving palliative care are needed to further contextualize the findings of this study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion18-0269216311406990" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>General practice staff in this study state that an incentivized quality indicator that records the preferred place to receive end-of-life care should not be included as a quality indicator in the QOF. This inflexible indicator does not consider the complex, multi-disciplinary issues within palliative care and could lead to potential harm to the patient. In-house training on how to broach the subject of end-of-life care and more effective consultation with carers were identified as ways to improve existing end-of-life care.</p>
