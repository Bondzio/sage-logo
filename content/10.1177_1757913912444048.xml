<p><bold>Professor Michael P Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health Excellence at NICE, looks at the work that NICE is doing for local government along with its return on investment activity in this changing landscape</bold></p>
<sec id="section1-1757913912444048">
<title>Programmes and interventions</title>
<p>In 2005 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) acquired a role to produce public health guidance in addition to its clinical portfolio. The idea was twofold: to use the platform of evidence based medicine to develop public health guidance; and, to produce guidance for a range of different audiences in the NHS and in other arenas where public health guidance might be helpful.</p>
<p>Originally, two rather different types of guidance were planned - Programmes and Interventions. Public Health Programme guidance was modelled on clinical guidelines and tended to take a broad look at a public health problem and perhaps consider details of strategy, policy and delivery. The guidance produced on cardiovascular disease prevention; alcohol misuse prevention; promoting the health of looked after children; physical activity; the environment; and behaviour change were of this type.</p>
<p>Public health intervention guidance was based on NICE’s technology appraisals. The idea was to focus on a well-defined public health activity and to identify the most cost effective interventions. The guidance on promoting physical activity in primary care and those on interventions in primary care to prevent smoking or assist people quitting were of this type.</p>
<p>In practice the distinction between Programmes and Interventions turned out to be difficult to work with. There were few interventions which were conveniently structured and delivered like technologies and still fewer where there was readily available comparative cost effective evidence to draw upon. Inevitably discussions expanded to include a policy, strategic or systematic context. In 2011 NICE published its thirty-sixth piece of public health guidance and has begun to develop new ways of defining problems and the sharp distinction between the two types of guidance is now less pronounced. New methods and processes will be coming on stream in 2012.</p>

<sec id="section2-1757913912444048">
<title>Methodological challenges</title>
<p>A number of interesting methodological challenges have had to be confronted by the NICE technical team and NICE’s public health advisory committees. The public health evidence base is very broad and diverse methodologically. There are of course randomised controlled trials in some areas where NICE has been asked to take a look. But in many of the topic areas where NICE has sought out evidence, it has been found to be patchy in terms both of quality and of coverage. This has meant that new ways of thinking about the quality of evidence beyond a simple application of the hierarchy of evidence have had to be developed. This has been informative, not just as new forms of evidence synthesis have emerged, but the whole conception of the hierarchy of evidence has been put under the spotlight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912444048">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hierarchy of evidence is designed with one very simple and powerful idea in mind. It helps to identify evidence which is least likely to be biased. In evidence based medicine and health technology assessment where the need to calibrate the most effective sizes of drug interventions is imperative, the hierarchy as a measure of quality is very useful. This is because the hierarchy is about identifying those studies where the bias can be minimised. RCTs and syntheses of RCTs do well because they have been developed to control certain types of bias which distort the relationship between the independent and the dependent variable. The goal is to maximise internal validity.</p>
<p>However, in the world of public health several differences apply which call into question the focus on internal validity alone. Public health actions frequently consist of long causal chains from the intervention and outcome, involving individual human behaviour in complex social settings. In these long causal chains multi-factorial processes are at work with many intervening variables exercising a moderating and mediating effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912444048">2</xref></sup> Consequently identifying in some quick and simple way the nature of the precise relationship between the dependent and the independent variable is tricky.</p>
<p>Another important issue is external validity. NICE public health evidence reviews consider the world evidence as far as possible. The problem facing NICE public health advisory committees is determining whether something found in the United States or in Australia, or Belarus is applicable in an English setting. The answer is determined on a case by case basis by considering, not just social and cultural contexts, but the travelability of whatever the public health action is that is being considered. To help us understand the causal relationships and the complexities involved NICE has, with academic colleagues, developed techniques for building logic models to assist the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912444048">3</xref></sup> We have learned a lot about causal relations or a lot more than we knew when we started, and have tried to develop ways of searching for literature to reflect the complexities involved and to understand the processes in action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757913912444048">
<title>Economic analyses</title>
<p>The economics has also been very important. As with NICE’s technology appraisals and clinical guidelines, public health has consistently examined the cost effectiveness of public health activity. When NICE began its public health programme of work, the evidence base about the economic analysis of public health activities was not as extensive as that for clinical interventions. There was also some debate about the most appropriate forms of economic analysis which should be undertaken with complex programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912444048">4</xref></sup> It was decided in 2005 that the most appropriate approach would be cost utility analysis, the same approach as used across the whole of NICE. The Quality Adjusted Life Year (the QALY) would be used to compare public health interventions with each other and public health activities with clinical interventions.</p>
<p>NICE had in 2005 a notional threshold for judging the cost effectiveness of clinical interventions of £20,000 per QALY. When the first pieces of public health guidance were produced it came as a matter of some considerable surprise to the advisory committees and to the nice team that the QALY values for public health interventions were so low. In the first two pieces of guidance measured in hundreds of pounds not in terms of tens of thousands. This has been an enduring finding across the large number of economic analyses which NICE has undertaken. Using cost utility analysis, public health activity turns out to be very good value for money and in some cases cost saving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912444048">5</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-1757913912444048">
<title>Local government</title>
<p>In November 2011 NICE was asked by ministers to develop public health briefings specifically for local government in anticipation of Local Authorities taking on responsibility for much public health activity from April 2013. These briefings will be based on existing NICE public health guidance but designed with the needs of elected members and officers in mind. Each of these groups will need access to the best available evidence based information about effective and cost effective public health activity. NICE is uniquely equipped to provide independent action-focused and evidence based public health advice to local government.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Local Government Public Health Briefings will be to raise awareness and provide information about the existence of available evidence based solutions which local government may apply in order to meet its new public health responsibilities. The briefings will focus on a broad array of topics, populations and services across the range of arenas where local government will play a public health role and where NICE has already developed evidence based guidance and reviewed the best available evidence. The briefings will be short, concise, designed for audiences in local government. They will be written in a style and language which recognises the local government perspective. They will link, in the electronic versions, back to the original evidence which readers would be able to access should they want to. The first will be published in the lead up to April 2013. The Directors of Public Health who will lead the function in local authorities will also use the new products, although that constituency is already very familiar with NICE’s public health guidance. The new outputs are to be developed specifically with the new audiences in mind.</p>
<p>The Public Health Briefings will not be in the form of “must dos” for local authorities but rather consist of a helpful array (or menu) of cost effective and evidence based actions which local providers could choose to use depending on the local priorities and on the needs of local communities. The advice products will be capable of local interpretation. They will be toolkits offering a menu of evidence based advice so that activities and services can be tailored in response to different local circumstances, communities and individual needs. The approach will not be about providing prescriptive guidance but about providing clear and concise information about ‘what good looks like’, in other words, what works, how it can be achieved and how to demonstrate progress.</p>

<title>Return on investment</title>
<p>The other important new development in NICE’s portfolio is its work on return on investment for public health activity. Although as noted above NICE’s public health interventions and programmes are deemed to be good value for money at national level according to the cost per QALY calculations, there has been a growing realisation that local decision makers require something more concrete and specific.</p>
<p>In 2010, NICE set up the return on investment project to further develop its approaches to assessing the cost effectiveness and cost impact of public health interventions. The project was referred to in the white paper ‘Healthy lives, healthy people: our strategy for public health in England’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912444048">6</xref></sup> and more recently in the Government’s Tobacco Control Plan for England.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912444048">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>On July 5<sup>th</sup> 2011 NICE received from the Department of Health a referral to develop a prototype model for local authority commissioners showing the potential return on investment (ROI) for health improvement interventions. The referral noted that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“this work was described in the proof of concept report entitled “Supporting investment in public health: Review of methods for assessing cost effectiveness, cost impact and return on investment. Ministers have confirmed that they are content for NICE to carry out this work which will initially focus on tobacco control, and could potentially support the development of quality standards. relating to health improvement, adding a helpful level of granularity about potential economic return.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This work will be done in the context of an overarching goal which is to better enable local decision-makers and commissioners to consider the short, medium and long-term financial consequences (including likely savings) of investments, alongside a range of other criteria that reflect national and local priorities. An approach to assessing the returns on investment generated by public health interventions will involve in certain circumstances moving beyond cost utility analysis and undertaking cost consequence analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912444048">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-1757913912444048">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Moving forward there are important new challenges facing NICE and its public health team. Much has been achieved since 2005 but the new world from 2013 is one in which the largest changes to public health since 1974 are planned. NICE will have an important role in this new world. The work that NICE is doing for local government along with its return on investment activity, mark important new departures to reflect the changing landscape. Evidence will continue to be central and the task of finding the best ways to appraise and synthesise a complex public health evidence base will remain the cornerstone of NICE’s activities.</p>
