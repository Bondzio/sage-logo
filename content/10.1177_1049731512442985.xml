<p>Objectives: This qualitative synthesis explores the voices of children in the context of child custody disputes over the last 20 years. The purpose was to (1) systematically retrieve qualitative studies to explore children’s views and preferences in the context of decision making postseparation and divorce and (2) explore how children’s voices are being heard or not. Method: Qualitative studies were identified through a systematic retrieval process using an inclusion and exclusion criteria. A meta-ethnographic approach was used for the qualitative synthesis of included studies. Results: Thirty-five qualitative studies were included in the final analysis, involving 1,325 children from 11 countries. Conclusions: Findings reveal that children generally want to be engaged in the decision-making process regarding custody and access, even if they are not making the final decisions. Implications for social work practice and policy are discussed, including providing space for children’s voices within the context of this work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much has been written about the importance of the voice of the child and consulting children and youth about issues that affect them particularly during times of separation and divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512442985">Andreychuk &amp; Fraser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum, Bala, &amp; Cyr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512442985">Cashmore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512442985">Emery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512442985">Graham &amp; Fitzgerald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731512442985">O’Quigley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512442985">Morag, Rivkin, &amp; Sorek, 2012</xref>). Typically, children’s views and wishes are most often heard through social work assessments, psychological evaluations, child legal representation, <italic>guardian-ad-litem</italic>, audio/video or letters written by the child, through their parents, and judicial interviews of children during parental breakdown.</p>
<p>The continuing high numbers of children experiencing parental separation and divorce have generated an interest in helping children voice their needs and wishes. The <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512442985">Article 12</xref> (1) (2) places an obligation on decision makers to take into account the views and preferences of children. The <italic>Convention</italic> has been a significant underlying factor in the growing concern for and commitment to allowing children more say in decisions that affect their future well-being (Birnbaum &amp; Bala, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512442985">Cashmore, 2011</xref>). Increasingly, children are being understood as rights-bearing individuals, as opposed to objects of concern or subjects of a decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512442985">Eekelaar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512442985">Lansdown, 2001</xref>). Yet, tensions remain with respect to allowing children to participate in separation and divorce-related matters. These tensions are created by attempts to balance the vulnerability of children and their need for protection given their age and development level, on the one hand, with their rights as individuals on the other.</p>
<p>In keeping with the objectives of the <italic>Convention,</italic> the purpose of this review is to explore whether children are being heard, how, and what they have to say about their experiences postseparation. A systematic qualitative synthesis of qualitative studies of children’s participation within the context of separation and divorce was undertaken to include all potential qualitative studies conducted in the last 20 years. This methodology was chosen because research on children’s voices has not been systematically explored in the social work literature, and qualitative studies provide a contextually rich design for exploring the views of participants. Therefore, it was important to fill this gap in the research literature, given the importance of the voice of the child during times of separation and divorce.</p>
<p>A systematic qualitative synthesis was conducted to retrieve all potential qualitative studies that have been conducted in the past two decades that included children’s voices as part of the data collection procedures (e.g., interviews and focus groups). Compared to a nonsystematic literature review, a qualitative synthesis provides a systematic, comprehensive, and transparent method for searching, screening, appraising, and establishing the comparability and incomparability of different qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512442985">Saini &amp; Shlonsky, 2012</xref>). The qualitative synthesis focused on identifying the nature and extent of the qualitative evidence to address the following questions: (1) what do children say about their feelings and perceptions about their involvement in decision making process? and (2) whether children’s voices are heard during times of parental separation and how (i.e., by their parents, mental health professionals, lawyers and judges).</p>

<sec id="section2-1049731512442985" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To determine the scope and depth of the literature regarding children’s experiences postseparation and divorce, the authors initially conducted a systematic information retrieval process to locate all potential qualitative studies. Once all qualitative studies were included in data extraction tables, we then conducted a qualitative synthesis of the data by integrating themes across studies and reporting the results. There remain no agreement or set guidelines for choosing methods to synthesize qualitative studies and there are a number of methods that have been developed to aggregate, integrate, and/or interpret data from qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512442985">Saini &amp; Shlonsky, 2012</xref>). Common to all methods, the purpose of qualitative synthesis is “to achieve greater understanding and attain a level of conceptual or theoretical development beyond that achieved in any individual empirical study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512442985">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>, p. 672). Therefore, qualitative synthesis often includes the reinterpretation of data based on published findings rather than on the original data found within the primary sources.</p>
<p>The method chosen for this qualitative synthesis was on meta-ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512442985">Noblit &amp; Hare 1988</xref>), as it is the most developed and frequently used method of synthesizing qualitative research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512442985">Beck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512442985">Britten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512442985">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512442985">Paterson, Thorne, &amp; Dewis, 1998</xref>). Meta-ethnography was chosen because the method best preserves the interpretative properties of primary data while providing explicating guidelines for interpreting data across studies. The meta-ethnographic method involves selecting relevant qualitative studies to be synthesized based on a common selected sample (e.g., only studies involving children) to better understand a sample’s unique experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512442985">Noblit &amp; Hare 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The meta-ethnographic synthesis includes three approaches: (1) reciprocal translation, which entails exploring key concepts from each study and then translating these concepts across studies to explore the cogency and scope of key themes; (2) refutational synthesis, which entails identifying contradictions and dissimilar concepts across studies. The “refutations’ are explored to explain these contradictions; and (3) line of arguments, which entails interpreting the concepts across studies to build a general interpretation and theory across studies grounded in the concepts that emerge across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512442985">Dixon-Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512442985">Pope, Mays, &amp; Popay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512442985">Sandelowski, Docherty, &amp; Emden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731512442985">Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, &amp; Sandelowski, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1049731512442985">
<title>The Search for Relevant Studies</title>
<p>Several electronic databases were searched, including: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, ERIC, EMBASE, ASSIA, Social Work Abstracts, Social Sciences Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts. In addition, the authors completed reference checks of included studies and completed gray literature searches (e.g., government websites). For maximum sensitivity and specificity, both subject headings and word texts were searched in a systematic process. Search term combinations in PsycInfo for example included (<italic>divorce or divorced persons or marital separation or relationship termination)</italic> and <italic>(child* or youth or teen* or adolescent*)</italic> and <italic>(view* or preference* or decision or consequence* or participation or interview* or focus group*). </italic>Search term combinations were modified for each electronic database to match the Booleans and controlled vocabulary specific to each database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731512442985">
<title>Inclusion of Studies</title>
<p>Qualitative studies were screened based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) included an abstract written in the English language; (2) described a qualitative study focused on children’s experiences within the context of separation and divorce: (3) described children’s participation, and/or children’s experiences after separation or divorce; and (4) published within the last 20 years. The time frame was chosen based on the shift in thinking about the importance of including children in decisions post separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731512442985">Smart, Wade, &amp; Neale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731512442985">Smith, Taylor, &amp; Tapp, 2003</xref>). We did not exclude studies for low methodological quality; rather, the differences in quality were integrated into the overall findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731512442985">
<title>Data Extraction and Analysis</title>
<p>Based on the meta-ethnographic approach, we conducted the data extraction and analysis in seven iterative steps that both overlapped and repeated during the synthesis process. The process included (1) deciding which study would be included in the analysis; (2) exploring the relevancy and interest in the included studies; (3) repeat reading of the included studies; (4) exploring the connections among studies; (5) translating connections of concepts within studies; (6) synthesizing concepts across studies to create a new whole of the parts; and (7) expressing the synthesis in written or other form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512442985">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512442985">Saini &amp; Shlonsky, 2012</xref>). Rather than focus on the individual studies, the meta-ethnographic report includes new interpretations generated from the collection of included studies. In other words, the concepts of individual studies are compared to examine the similarities and differences between cases to generate a new interpretation context or a “second-level inference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512442985">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>, p. 64).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Based on the comprehensive search of electronic databases, reference checking, and peer consultation, 2,763 titles were initially screened for study inclusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731512442985">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the inclusion criteria, titles and abstracts were screened by two independent raters which resulted in 160 titles passing to the second screening (98% interrater agreement). One hundred and twenty-five (125) studies were excluded at the second screen (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512442985">Table 1</xref>) as the majority of these studies either included adult children’s retrospective views of the separation or about children’s experiences about the separation process (e.g., postrelationships with parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends).</p>

<p>Thirty-five (35) qualitative studies were included in the final analysis. The included qualitative studies were located from 11 different countries and involved over 1,325 children who were involved in custody and access disputes across the globe. The quality of included studies was generally low with little attention to the qualitative methods and procedures used for data collection. Data collection methods ranged from in-person interviews, telephone interviews, and focus groups. A nonspecified thematic analysis of the themes was the most common data analysis process included across studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512442985">Table 2</xref>). Many of the studies did not include sufficient details of the qualitative methods used to demonstrate quality. The studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore and Parkinson (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512442985">Cashmore (2011)</xref> involved the same 47 children and therefore were only counted once. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale and Smart (1998)</xref> study did not report any sample size.</p>

<title>Reasons for Including Children as Participants in Studies</title>
<p>There was a range of reasons for including children as participants within these qualitative studies. Although there was substantial overlap across studies, several key reasons for including children as participants emerged. Several studies focused on children’s views about their experiences of the separation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512442985">Bagshaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512442985">Butler, Scanlon, Robinson, Douglas, &amp; Murch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512442985">Highet &amp; Jamieson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Flowerdew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512442985">Neale, Wade, &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512442985">Pruett &amp; Pruett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731512442985">Sutton-Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731512442985">Sviggum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731512442985">Taylor, 2001</xref>). These studies primarily focused on children reflecting on the impact and consequences of their parents’ divorce.</p>
<p>Studies also explored the perspectives of children involved in family law disputes regarding their participation in decision making about residence and contact arrangements with their parents, including their views about joint custody, overnight visits, and their relationships with both parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512442985">Graham &amp; Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham, Fitzgerald, &amp; Phelps, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512442985">Graham, Shipway, Fitzgerald, &amp; Whelan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512442985">Haugen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512442985">Kaltenborn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512442985">Neale, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512442985">Parkinson, Cashmore, &amp; Single, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512442985">Reeves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731512442985">Taylor, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Children’s experiences of professionals in helping to facilitate their views and preferences were also explored, including children’s views about their involvement in mediation, their experiences with legal representation and judicial interviews, and their views about the ways that their views are brought into the family court context (Birnbaum et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512442985">Douglas, Murch, Miles, &amp; Scanlan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512442985">Hill, Lockyer, Morton, Batchelor, &amp; Scott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512442985">Morag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512442985">Parkinson, Cashmore, &amp; Single, 2007</xref>). The involvement of multiple systems included an overall influence of outside professionals on the family system.</p>

<title>Framework for Children’s Participation Within the Context of Child Custody Disputes</title>
<p>Children indicated that they want to be included in the decision-making process regarding parenting plans postseparation and/or divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512442985">Bagshaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512442985">Butler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512442985">Neale et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512442985">Parkinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049731512442985">Figure 2</xref> provides a conceptual map for considering children’s participation based on the reciprocal translation of themes across studies. Several key themes emerged including democratic process, rights, protection, capacity, authentic involvement, timing and methods for including children’s voices. Each of these key themes distill key considerations when considering the complexity of children’s involvement in the decision-making process.

<title>Democratic Process (Space for Voice, Representation of Voice, and Equal Weight to Voice)</title>
<p>Children discussed wanting the opportunity to have equal voice within custody disputes and that their views and preferences would be equally represented in discussions about their living arrangements and relationships with both parents. The children expressed the desire for personal autonomy, while citing the importance of democratic decision making and everyone in the family “having a say” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512442985">Neale, 2002</xref>). Reasons for wanting to be involved included the importance of being acknowledged and to be better informed about the decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2008</xref>). Children want to be consulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512442985">Campbell, 2008</xref>) and they emphasized the importance of fairness and equal opportunity to be part of the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512442985">Bagshaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512442985">Maundeni, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham, Fitzgerald, and Phelps (2009)</xref> found three key themes that emerged: change, choice, and relationships. The concept of change reflected the children’s desire to be involved in decision making to potentially reveal new possibilities and altered outcomes in parenting plans. Choice reflected children’s expressions of achieving a positive outcome for their relationships with their parents and being afforded flexibility in the choices made regarding their parenting arrangements. Relationships referred to children not wanting to choose between their parents but wanting input on the day-to-day arrangements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049731512442985">
<title>Right (Empowerment, Allowance, and Respect for Autonomy)</title>
<p>Children were not always clear about their rights within the separation process (Birnbaum et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512442985">Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512442985">Reeves, 2008</xref>), but nonetheless, wanted to be afforded the basic right to be part of the decision-making process. Some of the benefits of exercising these rights included the importance of being acknowledged within the dispute and their belief that their involvement would lead to more informed decision making and better outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512442985">Butler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2009</xref>). Despite wanting to be part of the decision making, several children across studies indicated that that they had “no say” in where they would live following parental separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512442985">Parkinson et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">Cashmore and Parkinson (2008)</xref> found that most children expressed that they should be consulted in decision making, but not necessarily in making the decision.</p>

<sec id="section11-1049731512442985">
<title>Protection (Vulnerability, Loyalty Conflicts, and Protecting Relationships)</title>
<p>Children expressed that the ideal situation would be to be acknowledged and listened to. However, they wavered between wanting to be involved and feeling hurt by the processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512442985">Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512442985">Graham &amp; Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512442985">Halpenny, Greene, &amp; Hogan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512442985">Hogan, Halpenny, &amp; Greene, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512442985">Haugen, 2010</xref>). Some children expressed being unwittingly made to assume a decisional role in a situation already fraught with stress, confusion, and conflicting loyalties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512442985">Friedly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512442985">Graham &amp; Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>). While children described wanting to be treated with respect and capable of being involved in the process, they also described feelings of vulnerability, change, and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512442985">Halpenny et al., 2008</xref>). Being involved in the decision-making role can put them in a “difficult position” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512442985">Cashmore &amp; Parkinson, 2009</xref>, p. 18). Children reported that making the decisions about parenting plans could put extra strain on them by having them choose between parents with the possibility of upsetting one of their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>). The presence of domestic violence and high conflict were both reasons for children not wanting to take on the decision-making role, although they still wanted to be consulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049731512442985">
<title>Capacity (and Maturity, Competency, Independence, and Character and Personality)</title>

How children reacted when told about the impending divorce reportedly influenced their perceptions of outcomes following divorce (positive, negative, or mixed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512442985">Hogan et al., 2003</xref>). Children indicated that they wished that parents had been more united, mature, and sensitive to the child’s needs upon disclosure.</p>

<title>Methods (Representation, Interview, and Independent Expert)</title>
<p>Children want to be heard and are generally content with sharing their views and experiences through a lawyer, mental health professional or in a judicial interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512442985">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512442985">Hill et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512442985">Morag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512442985">Reeves, 2008</xref>). There are many assumptions about who is best to speak to children during custody and access disputes. Research to date demonstrates that one size does not fit all; but rather children need to be heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512442985">Morag et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum, Bala, and Cyr (2011)</xref> found that children remembered the angst over their parents’ separation and not the family justice professional who interviewed them. They also found that children who did not have a judicial interview would have liked to have known they had that option to talk to the decision maker irrespective of the outcome of the court decision. This was especially apparent in contested cases (e.g., the involvement of violence) where children expressed that the judge would be the best person to talk to if the parents were in severe conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512442985">Parkinson et al., 2007</xref>). Reasons for wanting to talk with the judge included ensuring that their views be heard by the individual who is responsible for decision making; to ensure better decision making; to benefit from sharing their views in private and in confidence; to ensure the judge does not misinterpret their wishes; and the importance of providing input and being acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512442985">Parkinson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512442985">Birnbaum, Bala, &amp; Cyr (2011)</xref> found that most children were satisfied with their legal representation as they believed their lawyer was neutral, objective, and trustworthy. Children were also relieved that they would not have to go to court and that the lawyer would represent their views and wishes. Some of the benefits for children’s consultation included improving their parents’ relationship following separation, giving children the opportunity to speak with someone, allowing for children to share their views and potentially influence parenting arrangements, and providing children with information regarding residence and contact arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale and Smart (1998)</xref> found that children did not feel they benefited from talking to professionals and felt that family issues were best kept within the family. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512442985">Parkinson, Cashmore, and Single (2007)</xref> found that most children and youth indicated that one or both parents would be the best person to speak with regarding contact and residence issues. Children felt that professional support was more like intervention and discussions felt like interrogations. In the court system, children described feeling disempowered and struggled with the lack of confidentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale &amp; Smart, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512442985">Pruett and Pruett (1999)</xref> found that children’s drawings of lawyers consisted of pirates, vampires, or wolves.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512442985">Reeves (2008)</xref> found that children were split regarding their perspectives on having an interview with the judge—some felt that it should be a last resort. Reasons for not wanting to speak with the judge included feeling that it was inappropriate or unnecessary, children’s preference to deal with family matters within the family, and children’s feelings that being interviewed by a judge would be too scary or too formal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512442985">Parkinson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Children cited the following as challenges of not being consulted: they felt they were not prepared and did not know about the process, would have liked to be given more information about the consult, disappointed that there was no feedback, felt that they were not asked about important things such as school, felt that things did not change after the consult, preferred to have been consulted without their sibling present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512442985">Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512442985">Graham et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section16-1049731512442985">
<title>Reputational Metaphors of the Voice of the Child</title>
<p>A common theme expressed by the children in these studies is that they want to have a voice and input into decision making regarding parenting plans postseparation and/or divorce. Since the majority of children want to be heard in family law matters, the findings move away from the dichotomous argument about whether or not their voices should be included. Instead, the findings demonstrate that the focus should be on the key ingredients for ensuring that their views are authentically included in family law matters. The results also point to a dual task of professionals needing to balance the rights of children to be heard while supporting them so they are not in the middle of their parents’ disputes. They report a range of strategies to include children’s voices while still protecting their relationships with both parents and without fear of retaliation from either parent.</p>
<p>Discussions about the “voice of the child” in custody disputes cases across studies stood in relative opposition to each other and these discussions were essentially “refutational.” Opposite metaphors for the voices of the child included protecting children from the adult conflict versus children having the right to be involved in the dispute and be able to provide input; children as the decision maker versus children providing views and preferences; children’s maladjustment to the separation process versus children as resilient and adaptable to new family dynamics; and children needing the consistency of a home-base versus children needing relationships with both parents.</p>
<p>There was a mix of views about how children’s views should be included when there was violence in the home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512442985">Neale and Smart (1998)</xref> found that children in their sample did not want to have a say if there was violence and interparental conflict. In contrast, Cashmore and Parkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512442985">2008</xref>) found that children in contested disputes (i.e., cases of violence, abuse) were more likely to express that children alone should make the decisions around contact and residence. Another major contradiction was found regarding children’s views of judicial interviewing. However, the results demonstrate that these contradictions are more related to whether or not children are involved in contested custody disputes and less related to whether or not children see the benefit of speaking with a judge.</p>

<sec id="section17-1049731512442985">
<title>Children as Advocates for Children’s Participation</title>
<p>Children generally had limited understanding of the court process, the role of lawyers and judges, issues of confidentiality, and their rights to be heard in these proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512442985">Hill et al., 2002</xref>). Findings suggest that children need more information about the court process, especially older children, so that they are better equipped to provide informed views and preferences during separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512442985">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Children expressed that other children going through the process of their parents’ separation should be informed about their rights to participate and the ability for them to talk to others about the separation process (e.g., parents, friends, counselor, a judge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512442985">Bagshaw, 2007</xref>). Children in Parkinson, Cashmore, &amp; Single’s study (2005) suggest that children should be more involved in the negotiation process about parenting arrangements post separation to allow them to share their views and feelings with their parents.</p>

<title>Discussion and Future Directions</title>
<p>Our qualitative synthesis was designed to help fill the gap of children’s voices in the context of child custody disputes by providing the first systematic review of qualitative studies of children’s experiences in the context of separation and/or divorce. The review included 35 qualitative studies published in the last two decades, which were identified through a comprehensive and systematic search strategy. The findings of the studies were synthesized using meta-ethnographic methods that identified a broader underlying set of experiences, within and across the studies. As a result, the methods generated a “second-level inference’ and deeper level of understanding about children’s experiences.</p>
<p>The synthesis suggests that children’s experiences are shaped by constraining adult factors that can either facilitate or hinder the voices of children. With respect to constraining factors, our review highlighted how protectionists’ frameworks can suppress the views of children by attempting to shelter them from the parental conflict. The findings further highlighted that children are positioned by adults in public and policy debates regarding their involvement in decision making postseparation. Yet, children are eager to provide their input in matters that concern them despite the constraints placed on them by adults. The synthesis also suggests children are eager to draw on informal (i.e., family, friends) and formal supports (i.e., professionals, advocates) in promoting their views and preferences during child custody disputes. The issue is not who is best to listen to children and provide them with support (i.e., parents, lawyers, mental health professionals, judges); but rather, children want their voices heard without the constraints of the social and legal obstacles. Having a voice is not the same as making a choice and children understand that difference.</p>
<p>Qualitative synthesis is still in its infancy and qualitative review methods are still under development, but qualitative research can open doors into the voices of children and into their hopes and fears. In the case of our qualitative synthesis, the results offer a unique access into the lives of children postseparation and/or divorce. They also provide an important source of information for those implementing strategies for including the voice of the child preseparation and postseparation.</p>
<p>From a social work practice perspective, professionals involved with children must be more respectful and engaging with children so that the child’s voice is being heard by the decision makers and not just what the professionals believe is in a child’s best interest. From a social work research perspective, there needs to be more long term follow-up with children to better understand what works, what does not work, and what is helpful to them. Not all children want to be included in the process and that must be considered as well. Finally, from a policy perspective, consultation with children about their needs and wishes must be made a priority in any legal reform. </p>
