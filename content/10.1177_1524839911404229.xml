<p><underline>Introduction</underline>. Black women in the United States experience disproportionate breast cancer mortality. Culturally appropriate community education on the importance of breast health coupled with the availability of free or low-cost mammography screening services may help improve the use of mammography screening services among Black women. The Avon Foundation Community Patient Navigation Program seeks to fill this need. The current study presents a process and outcome evaluation of this program. <underline>Method</underline>. Trained and uniformed community patient navigators (PNs) host breast health education events where they recruit community members to complete a mammography interest form. Participants are referred to a nurse practitioner who determines eligibility for a free or low-cost mammogram. The community PN delivers telephone follow-up to encourage participants to make and keep their mammogram appointments. <underline>Results</underline>. Over a 15-month period, 22 community PNs hosted 207 breast health events, which included 9,601 attendees. Three hundred and four participants completed a mammography interest form, and 21% of these individuals received mammograms at the collaborating health facility. Participants who reported breast symptoms were twice as likely to get a mammogram as those who did not report symptoms. <underline>Discussion</underline>. Community patient navigation may be a useful resource for encouraging mammography screening among underserved women.</p>

<body>
<p>African American (AA) women in the United States continue to experience disproportionate breast cancer mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911404229">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2007</xref>). This phenomenon may be in part because of delays in diagnosis and in the initiation of treatment. Between 1998 and 2004, the incidence of breast cancer among AA women was 119.4 per 100,000, whereas the mortality rate was 34.7 per 100,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911404229">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2007</xref>). In contrast, the incidence among White women was 141.1 per 100,000, whereas the mortality rate was 25.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911404229">CDC, 2007</xref>). This indicates that although White women are diagnosed with breast cancer at a higher rate than AA women, AA women are more likely to die from breast cancer. During this same time period, the mortality rate for breast cancer declined more among White women (2.4%) than among Latinas (1.8%) or AA women (1.0%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911404229">CDC, 2007</xref>). Early detection plays an important role in reducing breast cancer morbidity and mortality among all women; thus, the ACS encourages breast self-exams, clinical breast exams, and mammograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911404229">ACS, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911404229">Berry et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent decades, advances in screening and treatment have resulted in improved cancer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911404229">Brenner, Gondos, &amp; Arndt, 2007</xref>). However, disparities in cancer outcomes according to race and income continue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911404229">Shavers, Fagan, &amp; McDonald, 2007</xref>). In an effort to combat these disparities, patient navigation has been proposed as one way to reduce barriers to care among disadvantaged populations. Patient navigation is a model of care that is expanding rapidly in underserved communities and medical institutions across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911404229">Wells et al., 2008</xref>). The concept of patient navigation was developed to help address the barriers that poor people faced in trying to obtain clinical follow-up services from an abnormal finding or cancer diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911404229">Freeman, 2006</xref>). Patient navigation includes a range of activities that may span the continuum from education and advocacy to encourage mammography screening, to linkage to care among those with abnormal results, to support and guidance for those undergoing cancer treatment. The goal is to overcome barriers to care, thereby facilitating timely, quality care provided in a culturally sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911404229">Battaglia, Roloff, Posner, &amp; Freund, 2007</xref>). Patient navigation is intended to target those who are most at risk for delays in care, including racial and ethnic minorities and those from low-income populations.</p>
<p>Several uncontrolled studies and small single-site trials have suggested that patient navigation may improve cancer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911404229">Battaglia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911404229">Dohan &amp; Schrag, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404229">Ell, Vourlekis, Lee, &amp; Xie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911404229">Gabram et al., 2008</xref>). In one study, structured telephone education, appointment reminders, and communication bridging navigators with patients and clinicians resulted in better abnormal mammogram and Pap test follow-up adherence compared with women who did not have the navigation support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404229">Ell et al., 2007</xref>). Another study found that patients with the assistance of patient navigation in a Boston, Massachusetts, area hospital demonstrated improved rates of timely diagnostic follow-up for abnormal breast cancer screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911404229">Battaglia et al., 2007</xref>). It has been argued that patient navigation contributes to improved rates of screening and follow-up, earlier diagnosis staging, and greater patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911404229">Dohan &amp; Schrag, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of patient navigation aligns with existing theories of social support and other studies that have used lay health advisors to help increase mammography screening rates among women of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911404229">Earp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911404229">Eng &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911404229">Eng &amp; Young, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911404229">Nguyen, Tanjasiri, Kagawa-Singer, &amp; Foo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911404229">Paskett et al., 2006</xref>). Social support theories emphasize the importance of the social context within which individuals live and work and specifically focus on the effect that an individualâs social relationships has on her or his health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911404229">Cohen &amp; Syme, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911404229">Gottlieb, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911404229">Israel, 1982</xref>). One theory argues that social support is the functional context of relationships that can be categorized according to four types of supportive behaviors: (a) informational support includes advice, suggestions, and information that can be used to solve a problem; (b) instrumental support includes the provision of tangible aid and services; (c) emotional support includes expressions of empathy, love, trust, and caring; and (d) appraisal support includes information that is used for self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911404229">House, 1981</xref>). It has been argued that lay health advisors (or âpatient navigatorsâ (PNs) in the current study) may be used to provide informational, instrumental, and emotional support relevant to mammography screening for AA women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404229">Eng, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing from these findings, the Avon Foundation Community Education and Outreach Initiative (CEOI) is a community-based patient navigation program attempting to address breast cancerârelated disparities by delivering community education to underserved women and helping individuals overcome financial barriers to mammography screening through the use of trained, lay PNs. Specifically, the CEOI community patient navigation program focuses on removing income-related barriers to mammography screening; however, since income and racial disparities are so closely linked in the United States, the program also emphasizes reducing screening barriers for underserved AA women. The CEOIâs primary goals are to (a) increase awareness about breast cancer, (b) increase mammography screening among age-eligible women residing in medically underserved communities, and (c) enhance the process of receiving prevention and treatment services at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>As one component of the CEOI, the community patient navigation program uses trained and uniformed volunteers, called community PNs, to educate community members about breast health, breast cancer, and the benefits of early detection. The community PNs host breast health events such as presentations/seminars, exhibits, lunch and learns, and health fairs. Additionally, the community PNs serve as speakers on breast health and breast cancer at workplace venues, faith-based organizations, and civic group meetings. In addition to hosting events, community PNs encourage mammography screening for those community members who desire and need it. Community members are referred to a nurse practitioner (NP) who determines eligibility for a free or low-cost mammogram. The community PNs deliver telephone follow-up to encourage community members to make and keep their mammogram appointments.</p>
<p>Within the social support theoretical framework, the community PNs provide the aforementioned four types of social support relevant to community member mammography screening. The community PNs provide informational support through their outreach and education activities and by referring community members to low-cost screening services. Instrumental support is provided by assisting community members with scheduling mammogram appointments and reminding them of the appointments. Emotional support occurs through building a sense of trust and rapport with the community members. Appraisal support occurs when community PNs affirm that mammography screening is a preventive and healthy behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911404229">Nguyen, Tran, Kagawa-Singer, &amp; Foo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The community patient navigation program works closely with an NP, who is federally funded through the Georgia Cancer Screening Program. The Georgia Cancer Screening Program was established in 1992 with funding from the CDC and the State of Georgia; it is a statewide breast and cervical cancer early-detection program that is offered by more than 150 public health clinics and selected nonprofit agencies to low-income, uninsured women between the ages of 40 and 64 years. Diagnostic services and case management may be provided at no or low cost to eligible women. The goal of the program is that every community member who has an abnormal screening result be referred for and receive needed follow-up services. If treatment is necessary, eligible low-income women may receive treatment services through the Womenâs Health Medicaid Program.</p>
<p>The two components described above, community patient navigation coupled with the Georgia Cancer Screening Program NP, encourage breast health, follow-up, and completion of any treatment required of underserved, uninsured, and underinsured patients in the Atlanta area. The purpose of this study is to present findings from both a process and outcome evaluation of the Avon Foundation CEOI community patient navigation program. This study provides additional evidence to support the growing body of literature that demonstrates the effectiveness of patient navigation programs. Additionally, this article keeps with <italic>Health Promotion Practice</italic>âs mission of focusing on the application of health promotion, intervention programs, and best practice strategies by describing a process and outcome evaluation of a culturally appropriate community patient navigation program. Specifically, we examine (a) the number of events hosted and the number of participants reached over a 15-month study period, (b) the proportion of those who express interest in mammography screening who actually receive mammograms at the collaborating health facility, and (c) the extent to which those women who self-report breast symptoms are more likely to receive a mammogram than those who do not report such symptoms.</p>

<title>The Community Patient Navigation Program</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, the community patient navigation program is one component of the initiative; the other CEOI component focuses on the delivery of patient navigation services to patients at the Avon Foundation Comprehensive Breast Center (AFCBC) of the collaborating health facility. This article will focus on the initiativeâs community patient navigation aspect, which includes the delivery of community education to encourage mammography screening for age-appropriate individuals and promotes general breast health for women. The CEOI, which is the AFCBCâs community education component, has been funded by the Avon Foundation since 2002, and of the nine Avon breast care centers that were funded in 2009, it is the only patient navigation program in Georgia.</p>
<p>The community patient navigation program uses volunteers from the community (community PNs) to raise awareness of breast cancer among the underserved population. The community PNs participate in an annual 1-day training to serve as volunteers with the program; training topics include a breast cancer facts and statistics update and how to deliver support and follow-up with community members while encouraging them to make and attend mammogram appointments. Faculty, staff, and personnel from Emory University School of Medicine, the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University, and the ACS have conducted presentations during the training session.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, community PNs host events to educate community members about breast health, breast cancer, and the benefits of early detection. To host and participate in an event, community PNs complete a request form, which documents the event details including the date, time, location, and age range and number of participants who will be served. Additionally, community organizations may request the services of the community PNs. At the events, community PNs recruit community members to complete mammography interest/screening forms. The mammography interest/screening form gathers the community memberâs contact and demographic information and information on breast symptomatology (to triage the individual to a screening or diagnostic mammography appointment at the collaborating health facility). Community PNs use this form to stay in contact with community members in order to ensure that they schedule and attend their mammogram appointments. Community PNs are expected to help people brainstorm solutions to barriers to receipt of a mammogram and stay in telephone contact until the mammogram results are received and/or the community member requests that their relationship be terminated. A detailed follow-up protocol was implemented to ensure that all community PNs contact community members 48 hours after hosting an event. The protocol also instructs community PNs to contact community members up to 5 times during a 2-week time frame. If community PNs are unable to get in touch with a community member during that 2-week time frame, then project staff mails an appointment reminder postcard to the community member.</p>
<p>All community members who complete a mammography interest/screening form are given a voucher to contact an NP at the collaborating health facility to schedule their mammogram appointment. If the community member indicates that she does not have any breast symptoms on her interest/screening form, then she is given a screening mammogram referral voucher to schedule an appointment through the Georgia Cancer Screening Program. The NP determines the community memberâs eligibility for the Georgia Cancer Screening Program, which includes a clinical breast exam, screening mammogram and Pap test, and 1-year reminder for follow-up. If the community member is not eligible for the Georgia Cancer Screening Program, she is scheduled or encouraged to walk in for a screening mammogram. These community members are classified as new patient visits; however, they have to receive their cervical cancer screening (Pap test) through another health care provider.</p>
<p>Those community members who report at least one breast symptom when completing the interest/screening form receive a diagnostic mammogram referral voucher. If the community member meets the eligibility criteria for the Georgia Cancer Screening Program, then she is scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram within the collaborating health facilityâs cancer center. If the community member is not eligible for the Georgia Cancer Screening Program, then she is scheduled for a financial appointment within the cancer center to receive a hospital identification card that will allow the community member to receive low-cost services (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911404229">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839911404229-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>During the diagnostic mammogram appointment, community members are examined to determine if a diagnostic mammogram is needed. If the clinical exam indicates that a diagnostic mammogram is not needed, then a requisition for a screening mammogram is given to the community member, and she walks in for her screening mammogram the same day. If the clinical exam does indicate that a diagnostic mammogram is needed, then the community member proceeds to her appointment.</p>
<p>After the community member attends her mammogram appointment, the cancer center staff is responsible for communicating the results to her and her physician (if applicable) within 30 days of the appointment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839911404229">
<title>Data Collection Instruments</title>
<p>There are two primary data collection instruments associated with the community patient navigation program: mammography interest/screening forms and programmatic tracking forms. As previously mentioned, community members complete the mammography interest/screening forms to indicate interest in pursuing a mammogram. The purpose of the form is to gather contact information so the community PNs can follow up with community members, to document demographic information, and to triage community members to either a screening or diagnostic mammogram.</p>
<p>The programmatic tracking forms are submitted by community PNs on a monthly basis and document the health education activities conducted including the number of breast health presentations and exhibits hosted, the number of community members in attendance, and the number of community members that completed mammography interest/screening forms at the events. Finally, the programmatic tracking forms also include information on community membersâ mammogram appointment status, including whether an appointment has been scheduled and attended. The current study reports on events hosted from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2010. Descriptive statistics were performed in addition to logistic regression analysis, which was used to explore whether reporting breast symptoms was associated with an increased likelihood of undergoing a mammogram.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section5-1524839911404229">
<title>Community Education</title>
<p>A total of 22 community PNs hosted 207 total breast health events during the 15-month study period. This includes 183 exhibits (88%) and 24 presentations (12%). The exhibits were largely conducted at health centers and churches/community centers; the presentations were largely conducted at churches/community centers and shelters/residential facilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911404229">Table 1</xref>). The community PNs report 9,601 attendees at the events, although this number may include duplicate counts if the same individual attended multiple events. There was an average of 46 attendees at each event (range = 7 to 1,000). At the events, community PNs distributed literature about the importance of breast health, talked to participants about breast cancer risk and the benefits of early detection, demonstrated how to conduct breast self-examinations, and shared personal stories of breast cancer detection and survival. Community PNs used breast models, displays, videos, and brochures to impart the information described above.</p>

<title>Mammography Screening</title>
<p>During the period of reference, 304 participants completed a mammography interest/screening form. Participants tended to be Black/AA, not have health insurance or a primary care physician, and make less than $10,000 per year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839911404229">Table 2</xref>). Participants ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (<italic>M</italic> = 50.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.42). Sixty-four participants received mammograms at the collaborating health facility (21%). Of these, 70% were screening and 30% were diagnostic mammograms. Next, excluding those younger than 40 years, we explored whether having symptoms/abnormalities was associated with an increased likelihood of having a mammogram. Results indicate that those who reported symptoms/abnormalities were 2.01 times more likely to have a mammogram than those who were asymptomatic (<italic>p</italic> = .05), when controlling for race, highest level of education, and whether the participant had ever undergone lifetime mammography screening.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Avon CEOI community patient navigation program plays a crucial role in connecting community members to receiving mammograms at a collaborating health facility in the Atlanta area. As stated earlier, this is done through trained volunteersâcommunity PNsâwho educate the community by conducting presentations and displaying information at health fairs, which encourages community members to be aware of breast health and breast cancer and to receive screening or diagnostic mammography services. As noted, the critical piece is the follow-up with community members who attend an event to remind, support, and assist them in scheduling and receiving mammograms. The success of this program stems from the coordinated effort of the various departments at the collaborating health facility that supports patients in receiving mammography services.</p>
<p>This study addresses the community outreach, early detection, and prevention aspect of the patient navigation continuum by focusing on education and follow-up services to community members. This study aimed to explore the number of community members who attend community PN events and receive screening or diagnostic mammograms at a collaborating health facility. In addition, the study sought to determine if follow-up by a community PN regarding making an appointment and receiving a mammogram made an impact in empowering community members to schedule an appointment and follow up with their primary care physician. Community PNs provided a variety of community events to 304 participants who completed a mammography interest/screening form (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839911404229">Table 2</xref>). In total, 64 participants received mammograms (21%). Of these, 70% were screening and 30% were diagnostic mammograms. These data demonstrate the need for follow-up with community members who attend events and who need the extra encouragement to make an appointment.</p>
<p>Patient navigation was developed to expand access to cancer screening and clinical follow-up among the medically underserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911404229">Freeman, 2006</xref>). It promotes timely diagnosis and treatment and aims to ensure seamless, coordinated care and services. PNs provide assistance to patients and families to ânegotiateâ the health care delivery system. Freemanâs Patient Navigation Model spans the entire process of community outreach, diagnosis, and treatment to rehabilitation and survivorship. Patient navigation represents a community-based support program designed to eliminate barriers to early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It is based on the concept that community members trained as PNs can be effective in reducing and eliminating barriers to the timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer in their own communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911404229">Freeman, 2006</xref>). The community patient navigation program captures the prevention portion of the Freeman model in engaging community members to receive screening services, which has the potential of reducing disparities in breast cancer.</p>
<p>In addressing disparities in breast cancer, it is important for women who have symptoms to get mammograms because of better prognosis at early stages of the disease, AA womenâs tendency to present at later stages, increased chances of survivorship, and reduced morbidity and mortality associated with later stage diagnosis of breast cancer. In this effort, the authors are hesitant to merely acknowledge the efforts of this programâs volunteers, as they are aware that it might be that women with symptoms are more likely to follow through with receiving a mammogram, the community PNs might be more aggressive with them, or a combination of both increases the numbers of those who make mammogram appointments. Through these various efforts, it is beneficial that awareness can be heightened so that more women are knowledgeable about their breast health to make the decision to be proactive in the prevention and/or early intervention of breast cancer.</p>
<p>This program has the potential to immediately address barriers to care through the use of community PNs. The two components of the community patient navigation program address the instruction and engagement of the community member in understanding breast health and breast cancer, whereas the second component consists of targeted follow-up with the community member to encourage the importance of receiving a mammogram. Over the CEOIâs duration, the community patient navigation program has evolved into a more accountable system for specific community member follow-up by the community PN than the mere event driven program, therefore, community events and follow-up with a community PN have the potential to get more women in to receive mammograms. This program continues to monitor the progress of follow-up and women receiving mammograms on an aggregate and individual level.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study. The small sample size contributed to limited power and inability to engage in multivariate analyses. Moreover, the study design prevented us from making causal statements so there may be other factors that contribute to mammography screening among those approached by the community PNs. However, even with the limitations, this study has demonstrated the potential to make a difference within a collaborating health facility through the CEOI in bridging the gap between a community that is underserved and a health care system.</p>
