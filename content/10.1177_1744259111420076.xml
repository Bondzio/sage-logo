<p>This study explores the complex and interacting physical mechanisms that lead to building energy use implications of green roof design decisions. The EnergyPlus building energy simulation program, complete with an integrated green roof simulation module, was used to analyze the effects of roof surface design on building energy consumption. Simulations were conducted for both black and white membrane control roofs and nine variations of green roofs. The investigation included a total of eight buildings – new office and new multi-family lodging buildings, each in four cities representing diverse climatic conditions: Houston, Texas; New York City, New York; Phoenix, Arizona; and Portland, Oregon. Building energy performance of green roofs was generally found to improve with increasing soil depth and vegetative density. Heating (natural gas) energy savings were greatest for the lodging buildings in the colder climates. Cooling energy (electricity) savings varied for the different building types and cities. In all cases, a baseline green roof resulted in a heating energy cost savings compared to the conventional black membrane roof. In six of the eight buildings, the white roof resulted in lower annual energy cost than the baseline green roof. However, a high vegetative cover green roof was found to outperform the white roof in six of the eight buildings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increased awareness of global and local environmental impacts of energy use as well as a growing concern about future availability of high-quality energy supplies. To address these concerns, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has set a nationwide goal of increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and achieving economically viable ‘net zero’ buildings by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259111420076">DOE, 2008</xref>). A significant part of the success of that goal will rely on making effective decisions about building characteristics, including roof type. Yet, there is relatively little quantitative information and a growing debate regarding the relative building energy merits of green (vegetated) versus highly reflective ‘cool’ roofs. Consequently, a detailed energy consumption analysis of the effect of roof type – from highly reflective white roofs, to conventional dark roofs, to various types of vegetated green roofs – is needed to evaluate the impact of roof specifications on building energy use. Furthermore, independent of the DOE’s goals, the green building and sustainable development communities are actively promoting the adoption of green roof systems with relatively little guidance with respect to how green roof design decisions impact building energy performance. In fact, there are a wide range of claims of the potential energy savings of green roofs ranging from virtually no impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259111420076">DeNardo, 2003</xref>) to 15% annual electricity savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259111420076">Wong et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259111420076">2003</xref>). In some cases, a single author reports a spectrum of savings. For example, the modeling study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259111420076">Niachou et al. (2001)</xref> found HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) savings ranging from less than 2% up to about 48%. While Niachou et al. clearly notes that the 48% savings was achieved from simplified simulations involving completely uninsulated roofing, there is a temptation among advocates of technology to take the 48% number out of context. It is also not uncommon for researchers to report large reductions in roof heat flux associated with green roofing. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744259111420076">Theodosiou (2003)</xref> found that doubling the canopy leaf area index (LAI; from 3 to 6) could accomplish a 50% reduction in roof heat flux. These results can be misinterpreted as suggesting a comparable magnitude of HVAC energy savings (e.g., ignoring other contributors to HVAC load such as windows, walls, and internal gains). In fact, HVAC energy savings of up to 50% are commonly referenced in the soft literature and industry web sites and presentations. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259111420076">Niachou et al.’s (2001)</xref> work, ultimately, the energy savings of a green roof depends very much on the baseline used for comparison. For example, climate and roof insulation are both key parameters affecting the role of the roof in impacting building HVAC loads. Once the baseline for comparison is defined and articulated, one can then explore how variations in green roof design impact building energy performance. Ultimately, the evaluation of any system requires quantitative estimates of a range of potential benefits. This is particularly true for green roofing where benefits may include reduction in storm water runoff, reduction of urban heat island magnitude, promotion of habitat, improvement of urban air quality, reduction of noise transmission into buildings, and reduction of building energy use. As a caveat, then, this article is only concerned with the building energy use implications of roof design.</p>
<p>This study examines the whole building energy impact of green roof design decisions, varying growing media depth and plant canopy density. To explore the role of climate, simulations were conducted for four US cities in distinctly different climate zones. To explore the role of different building use categories (e.g., different thermal control schedules), a prototype office and a prototype multi-unit residential building were modeled. As described below, all building energy simulations were for relatively new construction and two distinctly different conventional roofs (one dark and one white) were used as baselines for comparison.</p>

<title>Previous work</title>
<p>Green roofs are thought to have many potential benefits. Some of these benefits, such as the aesthetic and recreational value, are difficult to quantify. Other green roof impacts lend themselves quite readily to quantitative evaluation. Many studies, for example, have explored the impact of green roofs on storm water runoff. In such studies, green roofs have been shown to decrease annual storm water runoff by up to 50%, while having a lesser impact on peak storm events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259111420076">DeNardo et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259111420076">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744259111420076">VanWoert et al., 2005</xref>). There is also a growing body of literature investigating the impact of green roofs on the quality of runoff from roofs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259111420076">Sherman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259111420076">Czemiel Berndtsson, 2010</xref>). The impact of green roofs on building energy consumption is one benefit that is commonly claimed, but generally with little verifiable backing. Measurements of how a green roof impacts rooftop surface temperatures, or even heat fluxes, are relatively easy to conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744259111420076">Kumar and Kaushik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744259111420076">Sonne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744259111420076">Tabares-Velasco and Srebric, 2009</xref>) and such measurements can be used to provide insight into the surface energy balance and potential impacts on the urban climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259111420076">Luk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259111420076">Alexandri and Jones, 2008</xref>). Surface measurements, however, do not translate into direct knowledge of the impact of a green roof on the energy use in the building. This is because the HVAC load of a building is significantly impacted by internal loads and environmental loads through windows, walls, and the roof. So, reducing rooftop heat flux by 50% may, in fact, have a much smaller impact on HVAC load than one might anticipate. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that HVAC load is typically less than half of the total energy use of the building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744259111420076">EIA, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, several researchers have used limited surface measurement data to estimate impacts on building energy use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744259111420076">Theodosiou (2003)</xref>, for example, used an analytical model and 3 months of summer roof surface temperature and flux data collected in Thessaloniki, Greece, to examine the effects of passive cooling by green roofs. That study concluded that LAI is the most important parameter in determining the cooling effects of a green roof, while soil depth is the least. He also concluded that climatic conditions play an ‘important role’ in the cooling effects of the roof. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744259111420076">Lazzarin et al. (2005)</xref> analyzed a sedum green roof with a 20 cm soil depth on a 1000 m<sup>2</sup> hospital roof in Vicenza, Italy. For the summer season, they found heat flux through a conventional roof with a solar reflectivity (albedo) of 0.1 to be 4.4% of incident solar radiation, compared to 1.8% through a green roof (e.g., a heat flux reduction of 60% for the green roof). However, no analysis of other contributors to HVAC load is included in that study, and hence specific claims regarding building energy consumption cannot be made. One early study that did incorporate a comprehensive building model was that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259111420076">Niachou et al. (2001)</xref>. In their study, Niachou et al. used a building energy model (TRNSYS – Transient System Simulation Program) to explore the impacts of a green roof on HVAC energy consumption for three levels of roof insulation – uninsulated, moderately insulated, and well-insulated buildings. The green roof was simply represented by an increase in roof thermal resistance (<italic>R</italic>-value in IP units or RSI in SI units), roughly equivalent to several centimeters of foam insulation, and thus did not capture the seasonally and diurnally varying radiative shading or transpiration effects of the plants or the thermal storage and evaporative flux associated with the growing media. With respect to HVAC energy use, the results from the Niachou et al.’s study indicates less than 2% savings for the well-insulated (<italic>R</italic>-value of 22 h ft<sup>2</sup>F/Btu or RSI of 3.9 m<sup>2</sup> K/W) building, 7% for a moderately insulated (<italic>R</italic>-value of 7.5 h ft<sup>2</sup>F/Btu or RSI of 1.3 m<sup>2</sup> K/W) building, and up to 48% energy savings for the uninsulated building. Subsequent analyses have assumed green roof energy performance on both the upper end of this range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259111420076">Castleton et al., 2010</xref>) as well as the lower end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259111420076">Blackhurst et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore important to note that the potential energy savings for green roofs is a strong function of actual insulation levels and climate conditions in the particular building application. For example, as of 2004, the ASHRAE 90.1 energy standard for buildings (roughly equivalent to the 2006 version of the International Energy Conservation Code) specified minimum commercial roof insulation RSI values greater than 2.6 m<sup>2</sup> K/W (<italic>R</italic>-value 15 h ft<sup>2</sup>F/Btu) in all but one of the eight defined climate zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259111420076">ASHRAE, 2004</xref>). This was increased by 33% in the more recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111420076">ASHRAE 90.1-2007</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111420076">ASHRAE, 2007</xref>). A cursory review of the status of the US state energy codes reveals that as of January 2011, at least 36 of the 50 states either have or are in the process of finalizing statewide energy codes that meet/exceed the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259111420076">ASHRAE 90.1-2004</xref> standard. In fact, for many states, the roof insulation requirements are already at or better than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111420076">ASHRAE 90.1-2007</xref> levels. The story is quite different for retrofit applications. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744259111420076">Phelan et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that for recent reroofing projects in the USA, the average insulation levels prior to the reroofing were RSI of 2.2 m<sup>2</sup> K/W (<italic>R</italic>-value of 12.4 h ft<sup>2</sup>F/Btu). Thus, there is a substantially greater potential for green roofs to have a significant energy benefit on retrofit applications than for new construction.</p>
<p>While further work is clearly still needed to quantify the magnitude and value of various green roof benefits, some researchers are already creating a framework for evaluating the economic value and payback of green roofs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259111420076">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259111420076">Saiz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111420076">Kosareo and Ries, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259111420076">Carter and Keeler, 2008</xref>). In a net present value analysis of a green roof installation, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259111420076">Clark et al. (2008)</xref> found that over a 40-year period, the cost of a green roof can be 25–40% less than a conventional roof when storm water mitigation, energy savings, and improved air quality is taken into consideration. Of course, these life-cycle cost analyses depend upon the wide array of assumptions made, including for the energy savings. By presenting a detailed analysis of the whole building energy performance for green roofs in a variety of climates and for several building types, this study addresses one aspect of this problem.</p>

<title>Simulation program</title>
<p>The US DOE’s EnergyPlus software is a widely accepted simulation engine for modeling annual building energy consumption. Released in April 2001, EnergyPlus replaced its predecessors, BLAST and DOE-2, which had some technical and structural limitations. Specifically, BLAST and DOE-2 simulated building load response separately from HVAC system operation. As such, they were unable to account properly for feedback of HVAC calculations into the overall energy balance analysis, which led to inaccurate space temperature estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744259111420076">Crawley et al., 2004</xref>). EnergyPlus, in contrast, uses simultaneous simulation, allowing HVAC calculations to be represented in each time step of building load calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259111420076">DOE, 2007</xref>). A typical EnergyPlus simulation uses time steps of 5–15 min to represent building operation subject to the weather of a typical meteorological year. EnergyPlus’ modular architecture also facilitates third-party additions and improvements.</p>
<p>This study uses the green roof module developed by Portland State University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744259111420076">Sailor, 2008</xref>) and introduced in the standard releases of EnergyPlus beginning in April 2007. This module functions as an integral component of the simulation software, performing an energy balance on a vegetated rooftop within each time step. The green roof simulation module allows for control of various green roof related parameters such as LAI, which is essentially the projected area of all leaves divided by the soil surface area. The module inputs also include plant height, soil depth, soil thermal properties, and stomatal resistance (a measure of the resistance of the plant stomata to moisture transport from the plant to the atmosphere). The green roof module accounts for long-wave and short-wave radiation incident on both soil and vegetative surfaces, evapotranspiration effects, one-dimensional conduction through and storage in the soil, and convection in the canopy–soil surface zone. It also allows for input of precipitation and irrigation schedules, tracking the resulting diurnal and seasonal variations in soil moisture. While the focus of this study is on the thermal effects of the green roof on the building, the green roof module implemented in EnergyPlus is capable of tracking storm water runoff and sensible and latent heat fluxes from the roof (soil and plants) into the urban atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744259111420076">Scherba et al. 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1744259111420076">
<title>Methodology: Building description</title>
<p>The DOE has published 15 ‘benchmark building’ input files for public use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744259111420076">Torcellini et al., 2008</xref>) within the EnergyPlus simulation environment. Three vintages of benchmarks – new, pre-1980, and post-1980 – are available. For the purposes of this study, the new benchmark buildings, which are based largely on the 2004 version of the ASHRAE 90.1 energy standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259111420076">ASHRAE, 2004</xref>) were used to represent green roof energy implications for new construction.</p>
<p>Two of the building types from the DOE study were used in this analysis: the medium office building and the midrise apartment (lodging) building. According to the US DOE, these two building types combined account for approximately 16% of building energy consumption in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259111420076">EIA, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744259111420076">2003</xref>). The office building consists of three floors, 4982 m<sup>2</sup> of conditioned space, 1660 m<sup>2</sup> of roof area, and a total of 15 thermal zones (four perimeter and one core zone per floor). The lodging building consists of four floors, 31 apartments, and an office space – totaling 2824 m<sup>2</sup> of conditioned area with a roof area of 744 m<sup>2</sup>. Both building types have electric direct expansion cooling and natural gas heating. The office building is modeled with heating and cooling thermostat set points that are set back at night when occupancy levels are low. The lodging building has constant (24 h per day, 7 days a week) thermostat set points for both heating (21°C) and cooling (24°C). The different building types and corresponding thermostat schedules were chosen intentionally, in order to analyze the effect of the additional thermal mass of the green roof for the cases of full nighttime conditioning (lodging) and limited nighttime conditioning (office). The thermostat schedules are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111420076">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The office and lodging buildings have different internal load schedules and energy use intensities, as well as different HVAC system types. A complete description of the DOE benchmark buildings can be found in the DOE report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744259111420076">Torcellini et al., 2008</xref>). In each case, the roof construction included metal decking, rigid insulation (0.125 m thick, with conductivity of 0.049 W/m-K), and a conventional roofing membrane with a default albedo of 0.30.</p>
<p>EnergyPlus input definition files for each of the 15 benchmark building types have been created by the DOE for each of the 16 US climate zones. For this study, simulations were conducted for the office and lodging prototypes for representative cities in four of these climate zones: Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon, and New York City. The cities were chosen to represent a range of climatic conditions, while also being of some specific significance – due to their large populations, or in the case of Portland, a city with significant current and planned implementation of green roofs. Energy simulation input files were created for each city by modifying the benchmark file for that city’s climate zone with city-specific information, including: site geographical information, current (2008) utility rate schedules, and annual precipitation profiles. Simulations were carried out for each city using typical meteorological year (TMY3) weather files that provide representative hourly weather for each geographic location (based on historical local airport weather data). Climatic information for the four cities is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111420076">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For each office and lodging building, simulation input definition files (idf) for each city were created for each of the 11 roof-type variants. For the first case – referred to as the ‘conventional roof’ – the outer roof layer of the benchmark building was left unchanged – a roofing membrane with a default solar reflectivity (albedo) of 0.3. For the second case, – referred to as the ‘white roof’ – the reflectivity of the roof membrane was changed to 0.65. A matrix of green roof cases was created for each building by changing the outer roofing layer to a green roof and then varying the LAI and the soil depth of that green roof. In all cases, the green roof construction (consisting of soil and plants, but no drainage layer) was added directly above the conventional roofing membrane. A ‘baseline’ green roof was defined to have a soil depth of 15 cm and an LAI 2. In all cases, the green roof growing media was assigned the following thermal properties: conductivity of 0.4 W/m-K, specific heat 1000 J/kg-K, and density 500 kG/m<sup>3</sup>. Green roof models were subjected to typical precipitation schedules representative of each location, but were not irrigated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259111420076">Table 2</xref> presents the nine green roof combinations simulated.</p>

<p>Twenty-two simulations (two building types each with 11 different roof constructions) were conducted for each city.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are divided into subsections for ease of comparison. First, the role of building location, and hence, local climate is evaluated with respect to annual energy consumption for the buildings with the conventional roof. Second, the performance of the baseline green roof is compared to the conventional roof for each building in each city. The third subsection contains an analysis of the impacts of varying green roof parameters. Finally, a comparison is made between the green roofs and another common energy efficient roofing choice – highly reflective ‘white’ roofs. Unless otherwise specified, all energy comparisons are presented on a per unit roof area basis.</p>

<title>Role of building location</title>
<p>Location is a key factor affecting building energy use, and hence, the potential energy impacts of any change in roofing. While underlying climate – HDDs in winter and CDDs in summer – helps to determine environmental loads on buildings, it is also important to note that construction and insulation requirements differ from one climate region to another. These climate zone specific differences in the ASHRAE standard are reflected in the DOE Benchmark buildings that formed the basis of this analysis.</p>
<p>The annual gas and electricity consumption for each baseline building – lodging (L) and office (O) – in each of the four modeled cities is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259111420076">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The corresponding annual gas and electricity cost for each building, based on the local utility rate schedules is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259111420076">Figure 2(b)</xref>. All values are given on a per square meter of roof area basis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Both the office and lodging buildings use the least energy in the mild climate of Portland. The electricity use is especially low in Portland, as would be expected of a building in a climate with a relatively low mechanical cooling requirement (i.e., few CDDs). As would also be expected, the city with the most HDDs (New York) shows the highest gas consumption. The gas consumption of the other cities follows in order of HDDs. The low cost of electricity in Portland results in a particularly low annual energy cost for Portland.</p>
<p>The breakdown of energy consumption by end use for the lodging and office buildings in Phoenix and Portland is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744259111420076">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111420076">4</xref>, respectively. In Phoenix, the lodging building is dominated by cooling demand, whereas the office building is divided more evenly between cooling, plug loads, fans, and lighting.</p>

<p>In contrast, the lodging building in Portland is dominated by energy use for domestic hot water (DHW) and plug loads. As was the case for Phoenix, plug loads, fans, and lighting are all important end uses for the office building in Portland; however, the relative importance of heating and cooling loads is reversed, reflecting the switch from a cooling-dominated climate in Phoenix to a heating-dominated climate in Portland.</p>

<title>Energy savings of the baseline green roof compared to the conventional roof</title>
<p>In order to establish a starting point for evaluating the building energy performance of a green roof, the baseline green roof (case 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259111420076">Table 2</xref>) is compared here with the conventional (albedo = 0.3) membrane roof. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259111420076">Figure 5</xref> shows the gas and electricity energy and cost savings per unit roof area for the baseline green roof compared to the conventional membrane roof.</p>

</fig>
<p>The baseline green roof is shown to reduce gas (heating) energy use for all buildings. The heating savings is a result of the increased insulation value and the thermal mass of the soil layer. The gas energy savings per unit roof area ranges from 10,500 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> for the Phoenix office building to 48,000 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> for the New York lodging building. As would be expected, the gas savings are highest in New York and Portland – the cities with the most HDDs. The gas savings are higher for the lodging buildings, despite the fact that more heating energy is used in the office building. Several building differences could be responsible for this effect. First, the lodging building has a constant heating thermostat set point, while the office building is allowed to cool off somewhat at night. The thermal mass of the green roof stores heat, allowing heat from the day to reduce the heating requirement of the lodging building at night and into the next morning. A second reason for the higher gas savings in the lodging building is that the heat load through the roof is relatively more important for the lodging building. The heat load of the office building is more heavily dependent on ventilation air heating requirements and window heat loss (the office building also has a higher window to wall area ratio: office = 33%, lodging = 15%).</p>
<p>The baseline green roof saves electricity compared to the conventional roof in all cases, except for in Phoenix. The annual electricity savings of the green roof varies from a negative savings (increase in electricity consumption) of 4016 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> for the Phoenix office building to a savings of 5293 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> for the Houston lodging building. Even though the green roof has an electric energy penalty in Phoenix, it still produces an electricity cost savings. This is due to the reduced peak electricity use due to the green roof. The cost of electricity per kWh in the Phoenix rate schedule is dependent on peak demand as well as total consumption. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259111420076">Figure 6</xref> shows the monthly reduction in peak demand of the Phoenix lodging building with a green roof. This figure also shows the monthly cost per kWh of electricity (cost includes monthly fees and energy and demand charges; this is commonly referred to as the ‘virtual electricity rate’). In May, September, and October, when the reduction in peak demand is high, the virtual electricity rate with the green roof is noticeably lower than with the conventional roof.</p>

</fig>
<p>The electricity cost savings for all buildings is high relative to the gas cost savings when compared to the corresponding energy savings. This is due both to the higher cost of electricity per unit of energy and the reduction of peak electricity use, which is typically billed at a higher rate. As reflected by the utility rate schedules, reducing peak demand is a top priority in many parts of the country and should be considered in the valuation of performance of any energy conservation measure. This underscores the importance of using the applicable utility rate schedules in building energy simulation. Had a ‘virtual rate’ (flat cost per kWh) been used, the green roof would show an electricity cost penalty instead of an electricity cost savings in Phoenix.</p>
<p>To explore the hourly variation in green roof impact, consider a snapshot of hourly energy use during the few days when the peak summer electricity loads occur for the Phoenix lodging building (July 15–17) and for the Portland lodging building (July 20–22). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111420076">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the hourly electricity consumption for the peak summer load for the Phoenix lodging building with the conventional roof and the baseline green roof. This figure also shows the hourly electricity savings of the green roof. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111420076">Figure 8(b)</xref> shows the same information for the lodging building in Portland over several days around its peak summer energy use (peak occurs on July 21st).</p>

<p>The hourly electricity use for the Phoenix lodging building peaks on July 16th at 6 pm. The lodging building with the green roof consumes more electricity at night due to the heat storing mass of the green roof. However, the green roof leads to less electricity use in the morning and evening – when building electricity use is high. In the middle of the day on both July 15th and 16th, the electricity savings is zero. At these times, the building is at maximum cooling with either roof. Since the building is at maximum cooling in either case, but the cooling load is higher for the building with the conventional roof, it follows that the internal space temperatures are slightly lower for the building with the green roof. For the annual simulation, the building with the conventional roof is unable to meet the cooling set point of every zone for a total of 196 h. The number of hours for which the set point is not met drops by 16% to 164 h per year for the building with the green roof.</p>
<p>The diurnal profile for the lodging electricity use and savings in Portland is similar to that of Phoenix; however, the savings remains positive throughout the day. With both the conventional roof and the green roof, the lodging building is able to meet the cooling set point for every hour of the simulation.</p>
<p>The winter time natural gas use for the Phoenix lodging building peaks on February 10th. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111420076">Figure 8(a)</xref> shows the hourly gas consumption for several days centered on this peak for both the Phoenix lodging building with the conventional roof and the baseline green roof. This figure also shows the gas savings associated with the green roof. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111420076">Figure 8(b)</xref> shows the same information for the lodging building in Portland, with a focus on the days around its peak gas use (December 31).</p>
<p>For the coldest days in the Phoenix weather file (February 9–11), the lodging building gas use peaks at around 7 am and hits a minimum at around 4 pm. Gas savings follows the same diurnal profile as consumption – peaking when usage peaks. There is actually a slight gas cost associated with the green roof during the day. The overnight savings, however, more than make up for the daytime penalty. The diurnal profile of gas use and savings follows the same pattern for the lodging building in Portland. Gas is not billed by time-of-day pricing, and peak demand is much less of a billing concern than it is for electricity.</p>

<title>Energy saving impact of varying green roof parameters</title>
<p>It should be noted that the energy analysis presented thus far focuses on one particular implementation of a green roof (LAI of 2 and a growing media soil depth of 15 cm). As these parameters vary, so too does the energy performance of the green roof. As noted earlier and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259111420076">Table 2</xref>, a total of nine variations of green roofs were modeled for each building and city. In all cases, only LAI and/or soil depth were varied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1744259111420076">Figure 9</xref> shows the gas and electricity savings associated with varying green roof soil depth for each of the buildings.</p>

</fig>
<p>Increasing the soil depth of the green roof resulted in increased gas savings for all lodging buildings. Increasing the soil depth generally increases the gas savings of the office building; however, the increase is much less pronounced than it is for the lodging building. The gas savings are due to the added insulation value and thermal mass of the deeper soil. Increasing the soil depth also generally increases the electric energy savings of the green roof. In Phoenix, increasing the depth of the soil leads to an annual electric energy savings instead of cost. The added mass serves to even out the diurnal fluctuation of heat flux through the roof by smoothing out the night- and daytime peak temperatures of the surface adjacent to the conditioned space (i.e., the roof).</p>

</fig>
<p>Increasing the LAI generally decreases gas energy savings. The decreased savings is due to two factors. Increasing the LAI increases the shading on the roof, thereby reducing the solar heat gain to the space. Increasing the LAI also increases the transpiration cooling effect. It then follows that increasing the LAI increases the cooling energy savings in all cases for the same two reasons that it decreases the heating savings. The overall energy savings generally increases with increased LAI. The overall cost savings increases with LAI in all cases. On some buildings (e.g., Houston lodging), the savings increase associated with high levels of LAI is dramatic. The cost savings is again high relative to the energy savings due to the high cost of electricity and the reduction of peak load.</p>

<title>Green roof and white roof comparison</title>
<p>Highly reflective roofs – commonly referred to as ‘white roofs’ or ‘cool roofs’ – are frequently installed as an energy saving alternative to conventional dark roofs. Roof reflectivity is regulated both by California energy code and by the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification program. In fact, through the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G modeling guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111420076">ASHRAE, 2007</xref>), LEED allows the modeling of white roofs as a means to demonstrate energy savings for one LEED credit point. For this study, simulations were carried out in which the reflectivity of the roofing membrane of the conventional roof was adjusted to 0.65 (the value allowed under ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G modeling guidelines for white roofs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1744259111420076">Figure 11</xref> shows the annual energy and energy cost savings of the baseline green roof as compared to a white roof for each building. Negative values represent a higher consumption/cost for the green roof than for the white one.</p>

</fig>
<p>In all cases, the baseline green roof leads to more electricity consumption (cooling energy) than the white roof and less gas consumption (heating energy). For the New York and Portland lodging buildings, the net result is cost savings for the green roof over the white roof; however, in all other cases, the white roof leads to a lower total energy cost. The lodging buildings in New York and Portland show net savings because of the colder climates. For these cases, the heating cost savings outweighs the cooling cost penalty of the green roof. The green roof performs better on the lodging buildings than on the office buildings in both Portland and New York, due to the reasons discussed previously.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the white roof over the green roof is the decreased solar gain absorbed by the roof. The green roof which absorbs the least solar gain is the high LAI roof. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1744259111420076">Figure 12(a)</xref> shows the annual energy savings of the high LAI green roof over the white roof for each building. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1744259111420076">Figure 12(b)</xref> shows the annual energy cost savings of the high LAI green roof over the white roof for each building.</p>

</fig>
<p>The high LAI green roof shows a gas savings and electricity penalty in comparison to the white roof for every building. The electricity penalty is however less than it was for the base green roof. The net energy cost savings is positive for all buildings except the Phoenix lodging and New York office buildings. The net cost savings is negative for the New York office building predominantly because of the particularly high utility rate for electricity (approximately 20 cents per kWh).</p>

<sec id="section11-1744259111420076" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>For all modeled climates, the baseline green roof showed an overall energy cost savings for both building types in comparison to the conventional roof. While it must be noted that electricity cost data used in this study will quickly become out of date, the results presented here will likely remain qualitatively useful unless structural changes in electricity pricing are implemented in the regions studied. Green roof cost savings generally increase with increased soil depth and increased LAI. Heating savings is greatest for the lodging buildings in the colder climates. Electricity savings varied for the different building types and cities. In a few cases, the baseline green roof even shows an increase in electricity consumption compared to the conventional roof. However, in all cases, the baseline green roof leads to electricity cost savings. The discrepancy between increased electricity consumption and reduced electricity cost is a result of the reduced demand during more expensive peak hours with the green roof. The baseline green roof shows the highest savings for the New York lodging building. The annual cost savings is $0.26/m<sup>2</sup> of conditioned building area and $0.95/m<sup>2</sup> of roof area. In most cases, the white roof leads to a lower annual energy cost than the baseline green roof. However, the high LAI green roof outperforms the white roof in most cases.</p>
<p>In summary, the impact of green roofs on building energy consumption can be thought of as having three facets – total energy use, peak electric loads, and total energy cost. From the standpoint of total energy use, green roofs perform best in colder climates in buildings which require nighttime heating. Increasing soil depth will further increase the heating savings in these circumstances. For cooling-dominated buildings, LAI is a more important parameter, as more dense vegetative cover helps to reduce cooling need. For buildings subject to high electricity cost, especially high peak electricity pricing, or demand pricing, the ability of the green roof to mitigate daytime peaks is especially valuable – both LAI (by reducing solar load) and soil depth (by increasing the insulation and thermal mass of the roof) contribute positively to the mitigation of peak electricity use.</p>
<p>The results presented in this article are for relatively new construction with high levels of roof insulation. As illustrated in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111420076">Kashiwagi and Moor (1993)</xref>, the relative costs and benefits of energy conservation measures are quite sensitive to underlying building insulation characteristics. Thus, the relatively modest energy savings of the green or white roof systems relative to the control roof are not surprising. For retrofit applications of existing buildings, the roof is generally less insulated and hence a more important contributor to HVAC loads. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744259111420076">Phelan et al. (2010)</xref>, for example, the typical roof replacement starts from a baseline of approximately <italic>R</italic>-12.4 (RSI of 2.1 m<sup>2</sup>K/W). While beyond the scope of this study, it is clear that future studies should explore energy implications of green roofs for retrofit applications. Furthermore, this study was limited to the situation of the non-irrigated roof. While this is generally the preferred implementation from a sustainability standpoint, there is no question that irrigation (perhaps using gray water) can greatly enhance the evaporative cooling aspects of green roofs.</p>
<p>Finally, it must also be noted that the energy performance of green roofs is only one aspect of their potential environmental benefits. Ultimately, this information must be integrated with estimates of other benefits to provide for a more comprehensive assessment of the life-cycle performance of green roof systems.</p>
