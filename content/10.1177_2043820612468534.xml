The apparent tendency of geographers to disparage particular periods of the discipline’s history, at the same time as exalting others, is characteristic of the way in which progress has been measured, relevance defined, and novelty identified. Yet, whilst other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences actively engage with their textual canons and founding figures, geographers have notoriously avoided doing so. In this paper, we consider why this has been the case and how different conceptions of canonicity have mattered to the ways in which the history of geography and its intellectual foundations have been narrated. In thinking through the significance of geography’s texts to the ways we imagine the discipline – its past, present, and future – we consider how processes of remembering and forgetting have been employed to serve certain intellectual and ideological agendas. We conclude by advocating a more serious engagement with geography’s textual legacy: one which might benefit not only disciplinary historiography but also disciplinary consciousness, and thus the future of geography itself.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anglo-American geography</kwd><kwd>canon</kwd><kwd>canonicity</kwd><kwd>classics</kwd><kwd>historiography</kwd><kwd>history of geography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2043820612468534"><title>On roses and manure</title><p><disp-quote><p>There was a sense of discovery and forging, of breaking out of the banal, factual boxes erected by the old men, and a sense of reaching out to scholars in fields to which we had never been properly introduced, but which seemed friendly enough if you were prepared to learn.

It is a paper which, for several reasons, is an interesting point of departure from which to reflect on ‘canonicity’ in geography – that is, how the nature of the discipline is imagined and contested in respect to its intellectual continuities and disruptions (and the texts around which these bifurcations cluster). First, Gould’s philippic is telling and characteristic for the way in which it divides the history of the discipline into pre- and post-revolutionary phases, marking out as significant the intellectual realignments of the 1960s and 1970s, which Gould christened the Augean period – a tongue-in-cheek reference to Hercules’s fifth labour which necessitated him cleaning a 30-year accumulation of dung from the stables of Augeas. Second, Gould’s paper is significant for the way in which it draws the discipline’s battle lines: distinguishing between the ‘old men’ (and their textual legacy) and an emergent vanguard, eagerly making connections and gaining respect outside a reified discipline; writing geography anew. Third, Gould’s vitriolic criticism of geography’s then-recent past must also be read in the light of his personal animosities; Carl Sauer and Richard Hartshorne emerging as his narrative’s ‘baddies’. As Trevor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612468534">Barnes (2012</xref>: 256) has recently recalled, ‘I did interview Peter Gould before he died. He demonised particularly Hartshorne – as an evil person, not just … [as] wrongheaded intellectually’. Such generational rifts and acrimonies are, of course, not uncommon and should not be summarily dismissed when seeking to understand shifts in intellectual fashions, especially so in the relatively small discipline that was human geography in the 1960s.</p><p>It can, of course, be argued that Gould’s rhetorical stance – humorous as it was – was deliberately unsubtle and un-conciliatory, and that his views on the then-recent past of geography are unrepresentative of any broader discourse; in other words, his essay sheds light on nothing other than his own apparent contempt for the ‘old men’ and their ‘factual boxes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2043820612468534">Hannah and Strohmayer, 2001</xref>). It is possible, however, to detect echoes (conscious or otherwise) of Gould’s vitriolic dismissal of pre-1950s geography in a range of more recent attempts to assemble and assess the discipline’s key texts and central thinkers. Much work in what might be called the mainstream of geographical historiography seems to attribute little significance (as least as it relates to contemporary geographical scholarship) to what took place before the Second World War and thus serves to reproduce Gould’s binary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468534">Powell, 2011</xref>). As one scholar has recently argued, for example, ‘If I were seeking to proselytize for geography … I would focus my narrative firmly on the recent past (forty years) rather than the longer history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820612468534">Castree, 2011</xref>: 229). Reinforcing the notion of such a watershed – differentiating between periods of relevant and irrelevant geography – and should prompt us to consider the mechanisms and ideologies by which certain phases of the discipline’s history are left smelling of roses, whilst others are assumed to reek of manure. Furthermore, if we are to take Gould seriously, we need to adhere to his own dismissal of the term ‘quantitative revolution’ and instead focus on the substantial shift in geographical inquiry he claims his generation ushered in – that is, a transition towards theoretical and philosophical inquiry. We must, therefore, acknowledge that the changes Gould identifies as having occurred during the 1950s and 1960s have a much more complicated genealogy than he portrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612468534">Barnes and Abrahamsson, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2043820612468534">Gould, 1979</xref>: 140).</p><p>The tendency of geographers (our focus in this paper is on human geographers specifically) to disparage particular periods of the discipline’s history, at the same time as exalting others, is characteristic of the way in which progress has been measured – intellectual development coming not so much from constructing upon extant foundations, but from razing them and beginning again. Whilst neighbouring disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, and political science actively (at times incessantly) engage with their textual canons and founding figures, geography rarely, if ever, has anything but scorn or bemused eye-rolling for the Ritters, Ratzels, Semples, or Sauers of its past. It would be wrong to assume, of course, that academics in any other discipline are able straightforwardly to define ‘the core of their field’, but the tendency of human geographers so routinely and enthusiastically to exclude and reject texts, ideas, and individuals from earlier phases of the discipline’s history as irrelevant or beyond the pale is notable and worthy of consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2043820612468534">Hollinger, 2012</xref>: 185).</p><p>This paper emerges from a sense of uneasiness shared by its authors regarding this state of affairs – a disquiet that, at least in part, can be explained by our different trajectories, in terms of our research interests but also, and perhaps more importantly, our pedagogical formations. Demographically, we all belong to the generation who completed doctoral studies in the first decade of the 21st century. Yet, we were raised in different national geographical traditions: the British, the Swedish and the Italian (and then North American). To different extents, our early careers have been shaped by movements between and beyond the discipline’s Anglo-American core, as well as by interactions with other disciplines which partly reflect the historical periods upon which our own research interests focus: from 18th-century book history and the history of 19th-century science, through 20th-century history, anthropology, philosophy, and sociology, to art history and Byzantine studies. In their diversity, these interdisciplinary interactions have largely contributed to define and re-define our disciplinary consciousness through a sort of self-othering process. Such interactions have also led us to the inevitable as much as obvious question: why do our colleagues in other disciplines choose to remember whilst we, geographers, choose to forget? On another level, our uneasiness grows from a sense that it is dishonest, in a scholarly sense, to dismiss as reified or unimportant texts which one has not read. Where pejorative assessments of texts derive from second-hand rumour rather than first-hand reading, there is a significant risk that potential affinities between past and contemporary geographical scholarship are overlooked in research and in teaching. There are, we suggest, both intellectual and pedagogical benefits to engaging with geography’s older texts.</p><p>In this paper, we make the claim that the history of geographical thought should not be the sole preserve of historians of geography. This is so because the presentism which has characterized the various intellectual turns to which geography has been subject during the last three decades has generally offered little opportunity to acknowledge the previous work done by geographers on similar topics or themes, drawing instead on work outside of the discipline. At times, this presentism has often had unintended and ironic consequences, both in terms of the cherry-picking necessary to transpose or translate ideas into the discipline but also in terms of the inability to recognize the influence geographical scholarship has had on contemporary theorists. This is not, of course, to call for internalism – interdisciplinarity is geography’s lifeblood, after all – but rather it is to suggest that an engagement with their own discipline’s textual legacy can serve only to profit geographers.</p><p>Our decision, here, to examine canonicity as a textual phenomenon does not assume a straightforward privileging of texts over geography’s practical and nontextual practices. Much of what geography is – in both its human and physical guises – is a question of methodology, of work done in the field, of techniques learned and passed on in the laboratory or tutorial room, and (often) of the production of visual outputs: maps, photographs, diagrams. To attend to the textual alone is to risk obscuring geography’s practical, quotidian, and bodily practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2043820612468534">Lorimer, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2043820612468534">2003b</xref>). Important work thus remains to be done on the codification and canonization of geography’s non-textual practices, particularly so in relation to their pedagogical role (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2043820612468534">Phillips and Johns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2043820612468534">Ploszajska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2043820612468534">Schwartz, 1996</xref>). Our focus on geography’s print culture reflects, however, the significance of the textual canon – and debates about it – to understanding disciplinary historiography and the circulation of geographical thought. Critical reflection on canonicity is, then, simply one element in a broader set of debates about how we choose to think through and narrate progress, development, and change in human geography.</p><p>One of the reasons why canonicity matters – why it is important to understand the mechanisms by which certain texts achieve currency and are incorporated into a corpus – is that it exposes the ‘politics of exclusion’ by which a particular culture (in this case, human geography) endorses specific texts as ‘worthy of preservation through reading and study’ at the expense of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468534">Alter, 2000</xref>: 2, 1). As Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468534">Alter (2004</xref>: 3) has pointed out, the canon thus carries with it the suspicion of being ‘a potential vehicle of coercion, exclusion, and covertly ideological manipulation’. This is true, particularly, when we view the canon as a device which, in its turn, is constitutive of the community which created it: communities designate canons; canons reproduce communities. Alongside the overtly political elements to canon formation, certain scholars have pointed to the importance of more subjective, stochastic, and aesthetic components of canon formation. Frank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2043820612468534">Kermode (2004</xref>) has, for example, argued that pleasure and chance are as significant to the constitution of canons (whether literary or scriptural) as ideology. David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820612468534">Fishelov (2010</xref>: ix), meanwhile, sees the cultural capital of a text – its perceived value in the view of a specific community – to be a function of ‘the dialogues it generates with readers, authors, translators, adaptors, artists and critics’. Such a dialogic understanding of canon formation places emphasis not on the intrinsic qualities of a text, and its passive reception by an audience, but on its potential to generate interaction, debate, proposition, and opposition. We might, therefore, understand canonicity as an inherently complicated and messy process and the canon as something which is multiple and varied (temporally as well as geographically) and subject to resistance and contestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2043820612468534">Guillory, 1993</xref>).</p><p>This paper, and the ensuing commentaries, originated at a panel session – ‘Classics in Human Geography’ – organized by the authors at the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers. Panellists were posed a series of questions designed to provoke debate: Is there a canon in human geography? If not, why? If yes, what role do canonical texts play (and how are they defined) in geographical teaching (particularly curriculum design)? What are the implications of the notion of ‘canon’ when thinking about the history of the discipline? Do the changing notions of what counts as canonical tell us something about the state of the discipline at any particular time? By what processes is canonical status achieved and appropriated? To what extent has the canon (if any) been shaped by the linguistic competences of the discipline’s Anglo-American community? Have particular voices been silenced or distorted for reasons of politics, fashion, or ideology?</p><p>Without seeking, here, to offer any definite answers to these questions, but rather to generate further discussion, we approach these issues in three ways. First, we consider what makes a book a ‘classic’ or a ‘canonical text’ and how these categories differ. Second, we consider how different conceptions of canonicity have mattered to the ways in which the history of geography and its intellectual foundations have been narrated. Third, we reflect on the ways in which a revaluation of, and more serious engagement with, canonical texts might be a benefit not only to disciplinary historiography but to disciplinary consciousness and thus to the future of geography itself.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612468534"><title>On classic and canonical</title><p>There are – as the responses to this paper shall make clear – several definitions of ‘classic’. Here, we take classic texts to be those that have exerted a distinctive role in shaping geography’s discipline and that remain today intellectually or pedagogically important; texts that speak to their time, but that also look forward; texts whose message transcends shifting intellectual fashions and trends. In other words, these are the ‘foundational’ texts to which we continue to turn in our research and teaching, regardless of when and where they were written – texts which, consciously or not, we have chosen to <italic>remember</italic>. Although the adjective ‘classic’ is often used interchangeably with ‘canonical’, an important distinction might be understood to exit. A quick glance at the works selected for appraisal in <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic>’s ‘Classics in Human Geography Revisited’ series, exposes the false tautology of classic and canonical. Most of the almost-40 texts which contributors to <italic>Progress</italic> have defined as classic, date from after 1970 and only one from before 1960. Few of these texts were the work of the discipline’s ‘founding figures’ or are ‘canonical’ in the institutional sense of that word. We might argue, therefore, that the discipline has chosen to make a distinction: canonical texts are those that have been central in shaping the discipline, but, unlike classics, do not necessarily continue to speak meaningfully to the present – they are texts that, to borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820612468534">Fishelov (2010</xref>), have lost their dialogic function or capacity. A classic is, in this respect, ascribed an aura of immortality; a canonical text is deemed to be a memento from a bygone era to which one might not necessarily wish to return. We risk missing much, however, if we choose to neglect or ignore the canonical in favour of the classic.</p><p>Although much contemporary geographical scholarship routinely acknowledges the work of the discipline’s founders (however problematic that term might be), much of their textual legacy – often understood to be central to the discipline’s discursive and intellectual development – remains difficult to access, either because certain texts have never been reprinted or because they were never translated into English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468534">Barnes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2043820612468534">Keighren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2043820612468534">Mayhew, 1998</xref>). As a consequence, misapprehensions abound, nuances have been lost, and significant and complicated ideas have been reduced to clichés and truisms. For geographers unfamiliar with German, for example, the significant works of Carl Ritter and Friedrich Ratzel are available only through imprecise and necessarily mediated secondary sources. The work of Ellen Semple, Paul Vidal de la Blache, and Halford Mackinder, among other important geographers, is available only in hard-to-come-by, early 20th-century editions; the work of others, such as the Swedish geographer Torsten Hägerstrand, is, for individual scholars, simply prohibitively expensive.</p><p>At the same time, however, the past several years have also witnessed the emergence of a considerable body of work on geography’s ‘key thinkers’ and ‘key ideas’, whether in the form of textbooks, edited collections, or more ambitious encyclopaedias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468534">Baigent, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468534">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2043820612468534">Johnston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820612468534">Kitchin and Thrift, 2009</xref>). <italic>Key Thinkers on Space and Place</italic> (Hubbard, 2004), for example, profiles more than 50 individuals who have, in recent decades, contributed in important ways to the development of spatial theory. Necessarily reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this intellectual work, the majority of those thinkers profiled would not, the editors acknowledge, ‘necessarily consider themselves to be ‘geographers’, even though their work is inherently geographical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2004</xref>: 2). Such collections can, in this sense, serve as guides to geography’s discursive development – to the shaping of geographical thought – quite apart from its disciplinary history or geographers’ thought per se. Whether deliberately, or accidentally, these textbook endeavours inevitably reproduce certain sub-disciplinary narratives; the editors of <italic>Key Thinkers on Space and Place</italic> acknowledge, for example, the fact that ‘our choice of key thinkers in the geographical tradition is entirely biased towards human geographers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2004</xref>: 2).</p><p>Much more explicit attempts have been made to chart the nature and expression of human geography, as a specific sub-discipline, through its printed texts. <italic>Human Geography: An Essential Anthology</italic> (1996), for example, offers its intended readers – ‘the student of human geography and the interested general reader’ – what it sees as ‘a representative collection of significant writings critical to understanding the central concepts in the field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468534">Agnew et al., 1996</xref>: 1). Although careful to avoid labelling their selection as canonical, the editors nevertheless identify their chosen texts (a combination of scholarly articles and extracts from monographs) as ‘“significant” for the field’ – those writings which have been ‘particularly important in the development of human geography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468534">Agnew et al., 1996</xref>: 2). In similar terms, the editors of <italic>Key Texts in Human Geography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>) see geography’s print culture as an indispensible guide to and through geography’s thought: ‘particular texts can be read and interpreted as symptomatic (and perhaps totemic) of key transitions in the ways we think, practice and write geography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>: xiii). Their focus on monographs, rather than on geography’s other textual and nontextual practices, is justified on the basis that monographs are not simply representative of geographical thought at particular times and places, but actively ‘seek to transform geographical thought and praxis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>: xiii). Authored books, the editors suggest, ‘often become <italic>the</italic> key milestones in disciplinary histories in ways that articles rarely do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>: xiv).</p><p>Whilst targeted at undergraduate students frustrated by the tendency of libraries ‘to dispose of older books to make way for new tomes’, textbook collections have a more-than-pedagogical significance when it comes to thinking about the narration of geography’s history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>: xiv). An ironic and unintended consequence of anthologies of this type is, of course, that they help to justify the very process they are designed to counter: by providing an accessible summary of geography’s older texts, they necessarily decrease the circulation of original volumes and make it easier for libraries to justify their deaccession of such titles or their relocation to off-site storage facilities. Quite apart from the inadvertent practical consequences of anthologisation, the requirement to select from among the ‘massive collection of books and articles’, which comprises geography’s textual output, is one which necessitates judgements as to the historical significance, contemporary relevance, and intellectual trajectory of texts, and consideration of the demands made of, and by, the undergraduate geography curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468534">Agnew et al., 1996</xref>: 2). In an era when the implications of uncritical historiography in geography are well understood – and interventions in that area subject to critical appraisal on suspicion of hagiography, presentism, or internalism – the task of making selections based upon perceived influence, impact, or importance is complicated.</p><p>It is precisely because textbooks of this kind serve as a first draft of geography’s discursive and disciplinary history, contribute to the process by which canonicity is achieved or challenged, and are often (although not always) compiled by ‘white, male, heterosexual, middle-class academics’, that they attract and deserve considered reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2043820612468534">Lindón and Hiernaux, 2010</xref>). This is true particularly given the fact that many of these collections have tended to be somewhat narrow in their spatial and temporal horizons and have largely focussed on classic, rather than canonical texts. Geographers writing outside the Anglo-American context, or who worked prior to 1970, are frequently excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612468534">Boyle, 2005</xref>). <italic>Key Texts in Human Geography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820612468534">Hubbard et al., 2008</xref>), for example, draws its sample of 26 texts (all originally published in English) exclusively from the post-Second World War period, with the majority post-dating 1970. Whilst the multi-volume <italic>International Encyclopedia of Human Geography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820612468534">Kitchin and Thrift, 2009</xref>) offers 60 biographies (many relating to non-Anglophone individuals working prior to the Second World War), it is the annual <italic>Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies</italic> series that remains the most important (albeit expensive) exception to this rule, having profiled more than 400 geographers and geographical practitioners/theorists since 1977 without regard to nationality or historical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468534">Armstrong and Martin, 2000</xref>). Regardless of their composition, pedagogical anthologies are an important tool designed to reveal to undergraduate students (and others) the embodied messiness of geographical concepts – to demonstrate that geography’s ideologies and doctrines are not immaculate conceptions, but are produced by real people, and often so in debate and contestation.</p><p>That textual anthologies designed for undergraduate students reflect, in microcosm, wider debates about the nature, composition, and future direction of disciplines has been shown to be true of geography as well as of other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612468534">Barnett, 2002</xref>). David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2043820612468534">Hollinger (2012</xref>), for example, has traced the six-volume history of one such publication – <italic>The American Intellectual Tradition: A Sourcebook</italic> – and how its changes in focus and content have echoed wider shifts within American intellectual history. From his perspective as the <italic>Sourcebook</italic>’s co-editor, Hollinger has detailed the often strident debate which has accompanied the decisions made with each revised edition of the book as to those authors and concepts that would make the cut and those that would not. Where the <italic>Sourcebook</italic> differs from similar geographical undertakings is, we should like to suggest, in the relative privileging it gives to earlier texts and authors over more recent contributions. Indeed, the problem faced by Hollinger and his co-editor with each revision of the book was ‘getting collegial support for dropping anything that has been “canonized”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2043820612468534">Hollinger, 2012</xref>: 190). Whilst, in that respect, human geography and American intellectual history clearly differ, the processes of canon formation in each discipline – partly defined by the disputed production of such pedagogical anthologies – reflects and represents particular moments of disciplinary making and self-imagining.</p><p>Recent efforts to recover geography’s hidden or unfashionable histories – particularly the contribution made to the discipline by women – have gone some way to challenge predominantly masculine histories of the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820612468534">Keighren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2043820612468534">Maddrell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2043820612468534">Rossi, 2005</xref>). Other initiatives, such as the country reports in <italic>Social and Cultural Geography</italic> – published as the collection <italic>Mapping Worlds: International Perspectives on Social and Cultural Geographies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2043820612468534">Kitchin, 2007</xref>) – can be read as geographical correctives to the unbalanced geopolitics of the production of geographical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820612468534">Garcia-Ramon, 2003</xref>). Yet, precious as these reports are, particularly for the insights they offer into disciplinary history, they remain anchored in the territorial imagination of the ‘national school’. Whilst such interventions help counter spatial and linguistic constraints, they do not provide a simple remedy to geographers’ historical amnesia. Before we consider how a reappraisal of canonicity in geography might usefully challenge our spatial, temporal, and intellectual limitations, it is useful to examine how the geographical canon has figured in the ways in which geography has come to know itself, to define its remit, and to assert its authority.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2043820612468534"><title>On roots and routes</title><p>In recent years, geography’s historiographical endeavours have been subject to considerable scholarly debate and have witnessed an urgent distancing from any form of historical narration that might pejoratively be defined as internalist or hagiographic. Contemporary engagements with geography in historical context – attentive at turns to feminist and postcolonial theory and to constructivist understandings of knowledge – have tended, therefore, to identify and celebrate the diverse forms that geography has taken, both as a discipline and as a set of contested discursive practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820612468534">Driver, 1995</xref>: 403). As has been pointed out, the history of geography is thus no longer seen as the preserve of a ‘dying breed [trying] to find historical roots for their profession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820612468534">Driver, 1995</xref>: 403).</p><p>That genealogy, lineage, and foundational narratives have mattered to geographers is, however, clear. Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2043820612468534">Mayhew (2011</xref>) has recently described the efforts made separately by Carl Sauer and Richard Hartshorne to construct particular intellectual and methodological agendas for geography by seeking to describe unbroken narratives between their visions for the discipline and their supposed origins: for Sauer in Classical antiquity; for Hartshorne in 18th-century German geographical thought. Geography’s textual canon was used by Sauer and Hartshorne to validate particular and personal understandings of geography’s work, scope, and purpose, and to provide evidence that it had ‘always been practised thus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2043820612468534">Mayhew, 2011</xref>: 21). Although much the same was true superficially of Fred Schaefer – whose posthumous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2043820612468534">1953</xref> paper ‘Exceptionalism in geography’ was a call for a nomothetic turn in the discipline – he, unlike Sauer and Hartshorne, used geography’s canon, particularly the work of Immanuel Kant, to show the persistence not of methodological correctitude but rather of, as he saw it, an erroneous idea (namely that geography could only ever be idiographic). Whether employed with veneration to demonstrate the genealogical roots of an idea or method, or used pejoratively to show the persistence of error and the route to a new and better form of understanding, geography’s textual canon has mattered importantly to the ways in which geography’s future has been debated and defined – it has served as a metric by which geographers have gauged their progress and plotted their future.</p><p>The desire of Sauer, Hartshorne, and others to secure authority through the citation of textual pedigree is part of the larger process by which geography’s disciplinary identity has been forged and its methodological agenda defined. If disciplinary geography can be defined by anything, however, it is arguably its century-and-a-half-long struggle to clarify and defend what it actually represents. Writing in 1887, Franz Boas remarked on an already-venerable rhetorical tradition that saw (and, indeed, virtually necessitated) ‘every distinguished geographer … expressing his views on its aims and scope, and defending it from being disintegrated and swallowed up by geology, botany, history, and other sciences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612468534">Boas, 1887</xref>: 137). In an era now when departments of geography as independent academic entities are becoming increasingly less common – amalgamated into larger organizational units whose scientific credentials and disciplinary remits are more obvious to university administrators, especially at times of financial pressure – it is worth reflecting on how far we have been successful in that Boasian quest to explain geography’s purpose, make clear its value, and preserve its independence within the academy. Does it matter, for example, that ‘few would-be geographers can concisely and concretely articulate the identity of their chosen field of study’ when those who are already part of that discipline struggle equally with that task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820612468534">Turner, 2002</xref>: 52)?</p><p>It would be wrong to suggest, of course, that opinion on what counts as geography has ever been unanimous, even within shared national, linguistic, and temporal contexts. Ellen Semple’s <italic>Influences of Geographic Environment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2043820612468534">1911</xref>) – which turned to the Classical canon to demonstrate its scholarly authority – encouraged many American and British geographers to take seriously the explanatory potential of environmentalism, hoping that it would afford geography a scientifically-legitimate methodology at a time when it was struggling to mark out its academic territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820612468534">Keighren, 2010</xref>). We know, of course, that the enthusiasm for Semple’s environmentalism was only ever partial and that it concealed wider doubts as to whether geography should be an idiographic or nomothetic enterprise. For some of those geographers who were dissatisfied with the strictures of environmentalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2043820612468534">Sauer’s (1925)</xref> ‘The morphology of landscape’ later provided an alternative focus. Again, enthusiasm for this approach to the study of cultural landscape was varied (both within and beyond the United States) and ultimately limited in its duration. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820612468534">Hartshorne’s (1939)</xref> <italic>The Nature of Geography</italic> is seen to have been discipline-defining – elevating regional geography to an intellectual and methodological default throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s – it too was so only within particular contexts, such as the major Midwestern universities in the United States. Much the same was true of the spatial science which came to replace regional geography (at certain institutions and at specific times) during the so-called quantitative revolution, and of the humanistic and behavioural geographies which would come ultimately to replace the quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468534">Barnes, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Narrated thus, disciplinary geography is defined, at least superficially, by a cycle of nomothetic revolutions and idiographic counter-revolutions – a pattern which, of course, conceals the discipline’s heterogeneous ‘messiness’ and gainsays any efforts to see these shifts as paradigmatic in a Kuhnian sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2043820612468534">Livingstone, 1992</xref>). The ebb and flow of Anglo-American geography’s 20th-century history is familiar enough – a story of repeated efforts to blow away the cobwebs of seemingly unsatisfactory theory and practice and to define geography’s field of study in a once-and-for-all methodological metastatement. Measured thus, progress in geography is not unlike that of any other academic discipline. What stands apart, however, is quite how vociferous geographers have been in rejecting the work of previous generations – often tearing down, rather than building upon, that which has gone before – and how fast, as compared to other disciplines, this process has been and continues to be. This, perhaps, is the true nature of geography’s exceptionalism. One of the striking aspects of human geography particularly, it has been noted, is the rapidity with which its practitioners and their works are elevated as ‘classics’ and the equal rapidity with which they can lose this status:<disp-quote><p>As approaches fall out of favour, so too does the reputational power of the geographer. It is geography, peculiarly among the serious social sciences, that seems to be cursed by the culture of celebrity. This means that many central figures from geography’s past are purposefully forgotten. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468534">Powell, 2011</xref>: 519)</p></disp-quote>It took only a single generation, for example, for Ellen Semple to transmogrify in the view of contemporaries in the profession from being ‘the greatest woman geographer’ to becoming ‘the bogey-lady of a slightly silly concept that has now happily been abandoned and forgotten’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820612468534">Keighren, 2010</xref>: 170, 174). For many, her <italic>Influences of Geographic Environment</italic> thus remains ‘a book … [one] would prefer to forget rather than remember’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820612468534">Castree, 2011</xref>: 229). Although the reaction to Semple’s environmentalism has been particularly voluble, there has been a quieter – though no less profound – forgetting of much pre-Second World War geographical work. <italic>Influences</italic> is, then, simply one of many texts which, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2043820612468534">Ron Johnston’s (2011</xref>: 244) neat phrasing, are ‘cited much more often than . . . sighted’. There is value in debating whether this silencing of geography’s textual history matters. We would like to suggest that – for various practical, pedagogical, and ideological reasons – it does, and that it is, therefore, worth thinking critically about the ways in which geography’s textual canon functions, how it is contested, and the purposes to which it is put.</p><p>The multiple and contested nature of geography’s disciplinary enthusiasms means that achieving consensus on the question of what constitutes its textual canon is fraught and intractable – a seemingly pointless exercise. A natural consequence of this complexity is that geography’s canon is differently imagined by different audiences residing in different institutional, national, and linguistic contexts. One area in which the possibility (and promise) of canonicity is still entertained, however, is in university-level pedagogy, particularly in graduate-level seminars on the history of geographical thought – classes that typically constitute ‘phase one of the education of a professional geographer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820612468534">Turner, 2002</xref>: 52). Whilst such seminars have a superficially disciplining role in seeking to define the emerging professional identity of geographers-in-training by tracing connections between geography’s intellectual past and its present, the reading lists which define such seminars are intrinsically so varied that ‘any previously held identity blurs in short order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820612468534">Turner, 2002</xref>: 52). As Billie Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820612468534">Turner (2002</xref>: 52) has pointed out, the pejorative effect of such seminars can be to invert their identity-forming role by inculcating a suspicion that ‘geography is not so much a discipline … but a way of knowing’.</p><p>The argument in favour of introducing students to geography’s canon – however much it might constitute the highly individual product of the seminar organiser’s own pedagogical genealogy – is that it offers a cohort of students, often coming from the most disparate educational and disciplinary backgrounds, a common intellectual vocabulary, a shared understanding of what geographers have in the past concerned themselves with, and an indication of how contemporary trends in the discipline follow (or react against) those which have gone before. In this respect, the texts that constitute human geography’s canon – from a pedagogical perspective – might equally include those whose assertions have (from a contemporary perspective) been vindicated and those whose arguments have been gainsaid. Texts considered canonical should be those made noteworthy not by their relative ‘prescience or superannuation’ but by the significance of the role they served in their contemporary context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612468534">Bird, 1983</xref>: 55). As we said, there is a subtle and important difference between a text that can be understood to form part of geography’s canon and one to which the label ‘classic’ can be applied. It is for this reason that the passive tendency (if not outright active desire) to forget geographical texts which are assumed to have been discredited, or whose content is believed not to exhibit a contemporary relevance, is potentially problematic. This difficulty is exacerbated when judgements are made on the basis of <italic>not</italic> reading texts – either because of pejorative assumptions made by the reader regarding the book’s content or simply because the book in question is written in a language that differs from the reader’s own.</p><p>The first issue – that of prejudicial evaluation – made Carl Sauer reluctant to engage with the work of Friedrich Ratzel: he had, as he put it, ‘been prejudiced by Miss [Ellen] Semple’s enthusiasm for her great master environmentalist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820612468534">Keighren, 2010</xref>: 146). Sauer’s own later reading of Ratzel – prompted by the Boasian anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie at Berkeley who encouraged him to reappraise Ratzel’s <italic>Anthropogeographie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2043820612468534">1882</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2043820612468534">1891</xref>), particularly its second volume – was sufficiently different from Semple’s own that the ideas Ratzel’s work contained became an important influence in Sauer’s own study of cultural landscape. Richard Hartshorne chose to overcome the second issue – that of language comprehension – by undertaking to study the German language. Hartshorne ‘hired a German tutor and studied the language not less than three hours a day for two years’ and thus brought a significant body of German geographical literature into his sphere of comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2043820612468534">Martin, 1994</xref>: 483). Hartshorne’s dedication aside, there is a longstanding concern that Anglophone geographers have a tendency to be linguistically insular – ignoring not only important aspects of geography’s history but its currents concerns too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2043820612468534">Gade, 1983</xref>). This is not, of course, a problem only in geography – Don DeLillo famously satirized this situation in his novel <italic>White Noise</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820612468534">1985</xref>) by making his protagonist, a Professor of Hitler Studies, unable to read German (an issue that does not necessarily present an obstacle to his career).</p></sec><sec id="section4-2043820612468534"><title>On boundaries and networks</title><p>The pejorative influence of the Anglo-American hegemony in contemporary human geographical publishing – driven, in part, by the emerging significance of Anglophone-biased bibliometrics in assessing geographers’ research output – has been the subject of much recent debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468534">Aalbers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468534">Bajerski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820612468534">Garcia-Ramon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2043820612468534">Schuermans et al., 2010</xref>). Somewhat less attention has been paid to geography’s non-Anglophone historical canon and to the question of how (and whether) it should be brought to contemporary attention. Recent translation projects, such as the University of Chicago Press’s ‘Alexander von Humboldt in English’ series, and critical historical reflections, such as <italic>Reading Kant’s Geography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820612468534">Elden and Medieta, 2011</xref>), go a considerable way in making accessible to Anglophone readers ideas previously beyond their linguistic reach. It is perhaps telling, however, that <italic>Reading Kant’s Geography</italic> is issued as part of a book series in ‘Contemporary Continental Philosophy’.</p><p>Continental philosophy is a branch of scholarship with which (despite its largely non-Anglophone linguistic traditions) human geographers have willingly and enthusiastically engaged. This is due partly to its widespread availability in translation and to the kudos and intellectual capital which Continental philosophy is understood to confer on certain stripes of human geographical scholarship. For these reasons combined, Continental <italic>geographers</italic> are often less familiar to Anglo-American human geographers than are their <italic>philosophical</italic> counterparts. We would like to suggest that the fact that the work of Augustin Berque, Horacio Capel, Franco Farinelli, Yves Lacoste, Jacques Lévy, Claude Raffestin and Milton Santos (working in a Brazilian context), among many others, is routinely beyond the purview of Anglo-American geography represents not only a regrettable situation but also an obstacle to effective and critical geographical thought. A recent themed issue of <italic>Environment and Planning D: Society and Space</italic> devoted to Raffestin has shown Anglophone scholars what they have missed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2043820612468534">Klauser, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Continental geographers seem more engaged with each other’s ‘canonical geographies’ in spite of linguistic differences and this is partly reflected in various historiographical accounts and specialized studies. Whilst often ignored or downplayed in Anglophone disciplinary histories, or even in landscape histories (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2043820612468534">Wylie, 2007</xref>), Vidal de la Blache, for example, remains a key figure not only in French historiographical accounts but also in Spanish and Italian ones, as do Ritter and von Humboldt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612468534">Capel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820612468534">Farinelli, 1992</xref>). Likewise, some of Élisée Reclus’s writings have been recently made available in Italian and have been the subject of symposia attended by scholars from different nationalities and geographical traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2043820612468534">Reclus, 2005 [1869]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2043820612468534">Schmidt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2043820612468534">Université Jean Moulin Lyon 3, 2006</xref>). A recent anthology of essays on geographical education, edited by the Italian geographer Marcella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2043820612468534">Schmidt (2010</xref>), offers a commendable example of ‘alternative’ historiography. The collection brings together canonical and non-canonical texts by authors belonging to different academic (and non-academic) traditions and nationalities, spanning the 19th and early 20th century, the period which marked geography’s disciplinary institutionalization. One of the striking aspects of the collection is the way in which the writings and biographies of these authors speak (and are often directly connected) to each other. Collectively, the essays show a shared concern for geographical education geared towards critical ‘deep learning’ as opposed to mnemonic passive assimilation, but they are also a testament to the power of geography in shaping collective imaginations and networks able to transcend regional and national boundaries.</p><p>As Schmidt observes, while disciplinary institutionalisation went hand in hand with the self-affirmation of European nation-states, and indeed much of the credit of geography is tied to its ability to shape and educate in national discourse, geography also offered the language to think ‘globally’ – something traditional histories of 19th-century geography often make us forget. For American pacifist and feminist geographer Zonia Baber, for example, the geography instructor, more than anybody else, could dispel racial prejudice, ‘because geography is the only subject which puts us in contact with humans from all over the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468534">Baber, 2010 [1916]</xref>: 295; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2043820612468534">Monk and Schmidt di Friedberg, 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2043820612468534">Peter Kropotkin (2010 [1895]</xref>: 144) argued that ‘the task of geography is to teach us that we are all brothers’. Starting from this presupposition, the Russian anarchist proposed an international school network as an antidote to nationalist hatred and a fundamental step towards pacifism. The project would put Russian and English pupils in correspondence through letters and exchanges of small collectibles from their respective countries, thus casting the basis for dialogue for the future generations, a belief shared by Halford Mackinder, a geographer of diametrically opposed political credos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2043820612468534">Schmidt, 2010</xref>: 17). Proposals like Kropotkin’s can be envisaged as reflections (or small-scale versions) of larger international projects aimed at boosting personal learning and international cooperation through a ‘universal’ language – whether that of science, or of the arts – between the late 19th century and the First World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820612468534">della Dora, 2010</xref>). This was a period characterized by profound geopolitical instability, or, in Grace Brockington’s (2009: 9) words, by ‘battles and treaties’, as well as by an unprecedented proliferation of international organizations and initiatives (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2043820612468534">Sheet-Pyenson, 1985</xref>). In this context, geographers felt charged with a major moral responsibility, not least in shaping and educating the public to the new global imagination. Reclus thus hoped that globally attuned collaborators from every corner of the world would come together ‘to write the great book of human knowledge’ (<italic>pour rédiger le grand livre des connaissances humaines</italic>), and thus contribute to a truly universal geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2043820612468534">Reclus, 1875</xref>: 5). In the same vein, in 1891, Albrecht Penck proposed a ‘truly international world map’ at the 1:1 million scale based on international cartographic conventions and symbols, but ‘with place names expressed in the official languages spoken by the populations represented on each sheet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2043820612468534">Heffernan, 2002</xref>: 209). Reclus’s grandiose Paris globe project and Patrick Geddes’ Edinburgh Outlook Tower were quick to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468534">Alavoine-Muller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2043820612468534">Matless, 1992</xref>).</p><p>These and other projects were, in part, motivated by the anxieties amidst which they had been conceived. The close of the 19th century was not just a time of nationalisms and aggressive imperialisms, but an interlude between two devastating conflicts (the Franco-Prussian War and the First World War) in which the prospect of European fragmentation stimulated a counter-movement toward international cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612468534">Brockington, 2009</xref>: 10). Geographers like Reclus, Kropotkin, or Penck as well as Geddes and the Italian scholar Arcangelo Ghisleri were not only visionary preachers of internationalism and responsible for grand utopian projects; they were also the first to personally embrace transnational and multilingual scholarly networks through which their ideas and works came into being – networks that transcended the ‘national school’ or ‘centre-periphery’ models; networks which, to a certain extent, we have lost in an increasingly centralised and monolingual textual culture.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2043820612468534"><title>On possibilities and futures</title><p>The above examples illustrate how engagement with multilingual canonical texts can lead to the rediscovery of forgotten networks, alternative historiographies, and thus new ways of recounting geography’s past. Yet, it can also lead, we argue, to new ways of engaging with the present and, more significantly, imagining and shaping possible futures. We would like to conclude, therefore, with a brief reflection on how these possible futures might look and take shape.</p><p>As with any discipline, geography is, after all, an ‘imagined community’ with its own foundational myths and progenitors, its own heroes and martyrs. As with any imagined community, these stories and personifications change over time. Yet, as we mentioned earlier, in moving away from ‘hagiographic accounts’ and increasingly reappraising geography’s role as a space for interdisciplinary exchange, we seem curiously to have defaulted towards the other extreme: a sort of ‘culture of celebrity’ in which the status of ‘classic’ is gained and lost at an unparalleled speed. This culture, we have seen, leaves scarce incentive for engaging seriously with canonical texts. One might wonder to what extent this is a phenomenon specific to human geography as a sub-discipline, and to what extent it is peculiar to an Anglophone geography often trapped in presentisms, parochialisms, and its obsession with ‘newness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468534">Powell, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In a forum published on the occasion of the Association of American Geographer’s centenary, Mei-Po <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2043820612468534">Kwan (2004</xref>) observed how geographical consciousness has been guided by a purification process through which existing perspectives are deemed to be incompatible with, and a hindrance to, new visions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2043820612468534">Kwan (2004</xref>: 759) ascribed this state of affairs partly to the influence of the Kuhnian model on disciplinary historiography, whereby succeeding paradigms eclipse one another and seem to necessitate a ‘clean break with existing practices and the dominance of a singular vision’. As a complex, multi-vocal, contested enterprise, geography eludes paradigmatic narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2043820612468534">Livingstone, 1992</xref>). Hence, while Kuhn’s model can be helpful in mapping, and making sense of, periods of crisis and transformation (e.g. the quantitative revolution dictated by post-war imperatives, or today’s new funding imperatives dictated by the financial crisis, and their impact on current and future research agendas), it leaves little space for internal diversification. Instead, Kwan suggests, it ‘tends to intensify antagonism within geography because it suggests that the normal state of human geography involves one perspective being victorious over another and that there is something wrong with the persistence of an incompatible viewpoint’ (2004: 759). Kwan thus proposes an alternative historiographical model based on thematic networks, notions of hybridity, and ‘cosmopolitan tolerance’ within the discipline. These ideas echo with the genealogical model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2043820612468534">Mayhew (2011</xref>), or, in the field of map history, with Matthew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820612468534">Edney’s (1993)</xref> ‘Cartography without progress’, as a strategy to counter traditional monolithic ‘heroic’ narratives.</p><p>These models have the potential to offer a more nuanced understanding of geography’s complex past and thus a better appreciation of its continuing role as a space for interdisciplinary dialogue, and as the meeting point of two different cultures and ways of looking at the world: scientism and humanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2043820612468534">Lowenthal, 2011</xref>). Yet, we argue, it is important that the development of these as of any other model is paralleled (and supported) by increased accessibility to, and a more serious engagement with, canonical texts and that this engagement is both spatial (overcoming national traditions and linguistic barriers) and temporal (overcoming historical prejudices). It is true that battles are no longer fought at the core, but rather at the fringes of the discipline, and they have been so for at least over two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2043820612468534">Entrikin, 1991</xref>). Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820612468534">Powell (2011</xref>: 519–520) argues, without a sense of these core texts, we risk becoming ‘increasingly divorced from any sense of a community of practice or, indeed, of a shared, contested enterprise’. At stake is geography’s raison d’être – that is, being familiar with the world beyond, a curiosity that harnesses ideals of education, of citizenship, ideals of dealing with difference, and thus with one’s place in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2043820612468534">Soovali-Sepping, 2010</xref>).</p><p>What can we, what should we, do about this state of affairs? We should like to suggest that there are a number of possible courses of action – both short- and long-term – which might fruitfully be pursued. The first is to call for pedagogical innovation in the ways in which geography’s disciplinary and discursive history is taught at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Partly, this is to take advantage of new digital technologies, such as Google Books, which make available, at zero cost, many of geography’s key 19th- and early 20th-century texts. In much the same way that commercial digitization projects such as Early English Books Online and Eighteenth-Century Collection Online have prompted novel types of scholarship and pedagogical innovation, improved access to geography’s print culture might be facilitative of new forms of understanding, and of teaching, geographical thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612468534">Berland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820612468534">Gadd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2043820612468534">Spedding, 2011</xref>). The Historical Geography Research Group together with the History and Philosophy of Geography Research Group of the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) are, for example, currently drafting plans for an electronic bibliography to provide centralized access to freely available digital copies of 19th- and 20th-century geography texts. Encouraging undergraduate students to engage critically with geographers’ ideas in their original published format – alongside supporting lectures – offers a valuable alternative to necessarily short and selective textbook interpretations of those ideas. Where canonical texts can be used to contextualise and illustrate themes encountered by students elsewhere in the curriculum – geopolitics, environmental theory, population dynamics – the value is further enhanced.</p><p>Whilst doctoral programmes in geography in North American institutions have an established tradition of disciplinary identity building through the reading of both canonical and contemporary geographical texts, that tradition is less apparent in the British context (a consequence, in part, of its shorter programme structure). Whilst significant attention is paid – in the British system – to research training and the development of transferrable skills, comparatively little is devoted (outside of taught master’s programmes) to the shaping of a disciplinary identity or perspective. It can, thus, be difficult, particularly given the often interdisciplinary background and international origin of doctoral students, to develop a common understanding of what it means to think geographically. An attention to geography’s textual canon is one way in which this can be achieved. Our argument is not, let us be clear, for essentialism – for a unified curriculum, or a single vision of geography’s history. Rather, it is to suggest that there is a value – pedagogical and intellectual – in engaging with geography’s past texts. The arguments which hold true of this pedagogical value apply equally in the context of research. Not only might reading geography’s canon prevent a scholar from inadvertently reinventing the wheel, it might show her or him new investigative routes to follow.</p><p>Audrey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2043820612468534">Kobayashi (2012</xref>: 3) has recently noted the challenges associated with teaching the history of the discipline at both undergraduate and graduate levels: ‘Departments struggle to enliven our history in such a ways that students will not rebel if required to take a course, or part of a course, on the topic. Even graduate students object … to spending time learning about their intellectual heritage’. Critical and informed scholarship in geography depends, however, upon a sound understanding of what has gone before. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2043820612468534">Kobayashi (2012</xref>: 3) further notes, in the absence of a sufficient grounding in the history of geographical thought, contemporary scholarship risks exposing its weaknesses and lack of nuance: ‘Lately I have seen a significant amount of creeping environmentalism in conference presentations, for example, that could do with some critical interpretation based on the debates that took place early in the 20th century’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468534">Abrahamsson, 2011</xref>). When we choose to ignore our discipline’s historical trajectory, we risk undermining its future research directions. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to enumerate all the ways in which the teaching of disciplinary history might be enlivened, we feel that encouraging students to engage critically with the <italic>words</italic> of past geographers, and the debates that these provoked – to understand them in the dialogical context – is one way in which geographical ideas can be shown not to be merely abstract concepts, but things situated in time and space; things fought over and championed; things produced by passion and chance. This is much more than about making students aware of geography’s textual legacy and intellectual antecedents – it is about making them critical and informed consumers and producers of knowledge.</p><p>In addition to such short-term actions, we should like to suggest that, in the longer-term, there is value in considering ways in which geography’s older texts can be made more accessible, and non-English-language geographical writing made more available, to Anglophone geographers. Whilst scholars in neighbouring disciplines can purchase scholarly editions of both canonical and classic texts, these are rare in geography. The recent reissue by the University of Georgia Press of William Bunge’s <italic>Fitzgerald: Geography of a Revolution</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612468534">2011</xref>) – with a scholarly introduction by Nik Heynen and Trevor Barnes – is a wonderful exception to this rule. Might we not benefit, as scholars and as a discipline, from similar critical editions of, for example, Ratzel’s <italic>Anthropogeographie</italic> (1882, 1891), Mackinder’s <italic>The Nations of the Modern World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2043820612468534">1911</xref>), and Hägerstrand’s <italic>Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial Process</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2043820612468534">1967</xref>)? Alongside such a long-term commitment to the critical reengagement with such texts must sit a desire to encourage the translation into English of non-Anglophone geographical writing. Whilst we might not all share the linguistic tenacity of Hartshorne, and the facility to acquire new language skills, we can certainly support and encourage endeavours that seek to challenge linguistic barriers to the circulation of geographical thought. The linguistic relocation of ideas does not, of course, straightforwardly guarantee their intellectual circulation, but it clearly has the potential to do so.</p><p>Prizing novelty does not necessarily mean denigrating that which has gone before. Likewise, engaging with geography’s past texts does not necessarily mean celebrating or vindicating them. We cannot expect scholars in other disciplines to take geography seriously unless we are willing to do the same. We should not, therefore, be embarrassed by our disciplinary predecessors, nor should we assume that their work is irrelevant to our own. It is only by looking back that we can see from where we have come and to where we might now go. Our purpose here, let us be clear, is not to call for the codification of a canon in geography, but, rather, it is to suggest that by examining canonicity as a process we can learn much about the making (and breaking) of human geography as a discipline. Furthermore, by identifying new ways in which to promote an engagement with geography’s past texts (particularly those published prior to the Second World War), we can facilitate critical geographical scholarship, avoid duplicating existing work, and illuminate new directions for the discipline.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1-2043820612468534"><label>Funding</label><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468534"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aalbers</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2004</year>) <article-title>Creative destruction through the Anglo-American hegemony: a non-Anglo-American view on publications, referees and language</article-title>. <source>Area</source> <volume>36</volume>(<issue>3</issue>): <fpage>319</fpage>–<lpage>322</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612468534"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abrahamsson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <article-title>Review of ‘Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things’, by Jane Bennett</article-title>. <source>Dialogues in Human Geography</source> <volume>1</volume>(<issue>3</issue>): <fpage>399</fpage>–<lpage>402</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612468534"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnew</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Livingstone</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group> (eds) (<year>1996</year>) <source>Human Geography: An Essential Anthology</source>. <publisher-loc>Oxford, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Blackwell</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-2043820612468534"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alavoine-Muller</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2003</year>) <article-title>Un globe terrestre pour l’Exposition universelle de 1900.
