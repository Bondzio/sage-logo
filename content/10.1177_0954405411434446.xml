<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing interest in the development of alternative energy sources; partially driven by global-warming concerns. Fuel cells are one such energy source and they are receiving particular attention since they are highly efficient, pollution-free energy sources and have the advantages of low noise and relatively free site selection. In addition, their feed fuels such as hydrogen, natural gas and methanol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954405411434446">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405411434446">2</xref></sup> are readily available. The proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is attracting attention for use as an eco-friendly alternative power supply for vehicles that would result in reduced exhaust fume emissions. However, present PEMFCs have problems in terms of their weight and cost, which are preventing their commercialization. The bipolar plate, which is one of the core components of the PEMFC, accounts for 60–80% and 30–45% of the total weight and cost of the fuel cell, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954405411434446">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954405411434446">4</xref></sup> Plates with functional channels to move the hydrogen and oxygen are assembled at both sides of the membrane electrode assembly. The bipolar plate also plays significant roles in collecting the current, removing heat in the stack and preventing the leakage of reactants. Therefore, the important characteristics of the bipolar plate are its heat conductivity, its anti-corrosion specific heat, and the cost and processing cost of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954405411434446">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the most widely used material for bipolar plates is graphite; it displays excellent anti-corrosion and conductivity properties. The graphite plate is processed by conventional methods such as lathing and milling, which are high-cost processes with low productivity levels that are a result of the material being brittle and having poor gas permeability that make it difficult to machine.</p>
<p>Various studies have been performed to find a substitute material for the bipolar plate: carbon composites, titanium, stainless steel and aluminum have been widely considered. Stainless steel has the advantages of good machining characteristics, a low cost, excellent mechanical properties and high current conductivity; however, the degradation of the electrolyte membrane and the creation of an oxide film on the surface of the bipolar plate due to corrosion rapidly reduce the current conductivity levels. Therefore, aluminum alloys are of particular interest due to their high anti-corrosion properties, low weight (one-third that of stainless steel and one-half that of titanium), low electrical resistivity (1/25th that of stainless steel) and high heat conductivity (14 times that of stainless steel). In this paper we carry out studies on bipolar plates made of aluminum 1050 (Al 1050), the characteristics of which are better than any other aluminum alloys for such plates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954405411434446">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954405411434446">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>CNC milling, stamping/embossing, hydroforming, extrusion, etching and LIGA-electroforming have all been used to manufacture bipolar plates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954405411434446">8</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954405411434446">15</xref></sup> While rubber pad forming of stainless steel to fabricate the bipolar plates has been reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954405411434446">16</xref></sup> that study was confined to the geometric dimensions of the stamping die, and did not consider the effects of process variables. Thus, the evaluation of the formability in terms of pressure, velocity and specifications of the rubber pad was not performed in that study. Rubber pad forming is a process that creates an improved dimensional accuracy through the use of a homogeneous load distribution that is obtained by wrapping the convex part of the punch in a rubber pad on the die during the forming process.</p>
<p>Browne and Battikha<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954405411434446">17</xref></sup> studied the rubber pad forming process as a potential manufacturing process for aircraft wings. The performance of the product fabricated by this process was reported and processing parameters were optimized to reduce defects. Sala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954405411434446">18</xref></sup> conducted a study on the optimization of rubber pad forming on the basis of both simulations and experiments and Ramezani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954405411434446">19</xref></sup> predicted the behavior of friction during rubber pad forming.</p>
<p>Despite its many advantages this forming process has only found limited application in the manufacture of large products such as aircraft wings. In this study, we investigate the effects of the processing parameters of rubber pad forming on the formability of bipolar plates.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954405411434446">Table 4</xref> lists the experimental conditions used in the rubber pad forming process. The experimental variables used to evaluate the formability were the punch velocity and pressure, rubber hardness and thickness, and material thickness. The velocity was 5, 15, 25, 30 or 330 mm/s. The value of 30 mm/s is the maximum velocity in the low-speed section of the utilized press machine, and 330 mm/s is the maximum velocity in the high-speed section of the machine. However, it is very difficult to control the velocity in the high-speed section due to load inertia effects. Therefore, experiments were performed at velocities between 5 and 30 mm/s and at 330 mm/s. The pressure was 32, 37, 42, 47 and 53 MPa. The value of 53 MPa was the maximum pressure obtained in a preliminary experiment to find the critical value that could be used without causing forming defects. The hardness of the rubber pads were Shore A harness values of 20, 25, 30 and 35 and the thickness values were 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mm; tensile tests were performed using an Autograph AG-X Universal Testing Machine to obtain the stress–strain curves of rubber pads with different hardness values. The obtained stress–strain curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954405411434446">Figure 3</xref>. After the experiments, the microchannels of the bipolar plates were analyzed using an optical microscope to investigate their deformation and defects, and the results were quantified in terms of the depth and thinning values.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">Figure 5</xref> shows the forming depths for the 0.2 and 0.3 mm thick aluminum sheets as a function of the depth of the rubber pad. A punch pressure of 53 MPa and a punch speed of 330 mm/s were used in these experiments. The thickness values of the pad were 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mm and the Shore A harness value was varied. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">Figure 5</xref>, the maximum horizontal and vertical forming depths of the 0.2 mm thick bipolar plate were 0.477 and 0.483 mm, respectively, for rubber with a Shore A hardness value of 20 and a thickness of 30 mm. These values show that the material has excellent formability properties since the rubber pad used as the lower die could be deformed to an arbitrary shape, unlike dies used in conventional process. In addition the reactive force created by the deformation was active on the plate. Meanwhile, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">Figure 5(b)</xref>, for both the 0.2 and 0.3 mm thick aluminum alloy plates the thickness of the rubber has a relatively strong effect on the filling depth. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">Figures 5(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">(d)</xref>, the effect of the thickness of the rubber on the forming depth is very small; in fact in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954405411434446">Figure 5(d)</xref>, it almost has no effect. In spite of this phenomenon, each rubber pad has the characteristic range of the forming depth. Therefore, it is concluded that the hardness and thickness of the rubber pad can be customized to manufacture a bipolar plate with a specific forming depth using the rubber pad forming process.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954405411434446">Figure 6</xref> shows the forming depth for different rubber hardness values and varying plate thicknesses. A punch pressure of 53 MPa and punch speed of 330 mm/s were used in these experiments. The thickness of the pad was 30 mm, to achieve the maximum forming depth. As can be seen in this figure, the depth is inversely proportional to the rubber hardness value regardless of the direction. This is because a relatively high reactive force is created that is proportional to the deformation of the rubber pad and is inversely proportion to the hardness. This force enables the cavity in the die to be filled with deformed rubber. The depth in the 0.3 mm plate was not only lower than that in the 0.2 mm plate but also did not reach the full value of <italic>H</italic> of 0.4 mm as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954405411434446">Table 1</xref>.

It should be noted that there is little difference in the depth or the velocity values of 30 and 330 mm/s. This is because the bipolar plate reaches the forming limit due to the geometric constraint. Therefore, in all experiments a velocity greater than 30 mm/s barely changes the formability.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954405411434446">Figure 8</xref> shows the forming depth as a function of punch pressure. A punch velocity of 330 mm/s, and plate and rubber (Shore A harness value of 20) thickness values of 30 mm were used in this experiment. The depth was found to be proportional to the pressure, and the maximum forming depths in the horizontal and vertical directions at a pressure of 53 MPa were 0.477 and 0.483 mm, respectively. However, as previously mentioned cracks and fractures can occur in bipolar plates manufactured at pressures over 53 MPa. Therefore, it is clear that the critical pressure to fabricate a bipolar plate without defects must be identified.</p>

For the 0.2 mm thick sample the maximum thinning values in the horizontal and vertical directions of 60 and 50%, respectively, were found at a Shore A hardness value of 20. The equivalent minimum thinning values of 20 and 10%, respectively, were found at a Shore A hardness value of 35. The maximum thinning values for the 0.3 mm plate in the horizontal and vertical directions of 20 and 15%, respectively, were found at the Shore A hardness value of 20. The equivalent minimum thinning in the horizontal and vertical directions were commonly 3% and were found for Shore A hardness values of 30 and 35. From these results, as expected by considering <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954405411434446">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954405411434446">11</xref>, it is clear that for the case of a forming depth over 0.4 mm, the thinning rapidly increases in proportion to the depth despite the small increase of the depth. Therefore, it is concluded that thinning increases rapidly as the forming limit is approached.</p>

The maximum thinning in the horizontal and vertical directions was 60% obtained at the pressure of 53 MPa and 50% obtained at the pressures of 42 and 53 MPa. Conversely, the minimum thinning values in the horizontal and vertical directions were 30 and 20%, respectively, obtained at a pressure of 32 MPa. It can be seen in this figure that the increase in the rate of the thinning could be reduced by adjusting the plate pressure. This is because the pressure reaches the forming limit due to the excessive thinning corresponding to the forming depth. Also, the pressure to cause thinning over 50% has little effect on the forming depth and thinning due to the same reason.</p>

The maximum thinning in the horizontal and vertical directions is commonly 50% at velocities of 30 and 330 mm/s. The minimum thinning is 15% at the velocity of 5 mm/s, regardless of the direction. In the low-speed section between 5 and 30 mm/s the thinning is proportional to the forming velocity. However, in the high-speed section the velocity has very little influence on the thinning. This is because the forming depth reaches the forming limit. Therefore, it is concluded that a very high velocity is not required to manufacture the bipolar plate.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented experiments on the formability of a bipolar plate manufactured from Al 1050 alloy using the rubber pad forming process.</p>
<list id="list1-0954405411434446" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For the rubber pad forming process, a rubber pad with an appropriate thickness is required, because this thickness has a significant influence on the forming depth. In addition, it is concluded that for the rubber pad a relatively low hardness level and a high punch pressure both contribute to an improved forming depth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The forming depth is proportional to the punch velocity and pressure. However, a rubber with high hardness level causes a decrease in the depth. The maximum depth was obtained for a Shore A hardness value of 20, a rubber pad thickness of 30 mm, a punch velocity of 330 mm/s and a punch pressure of 53 MPa.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The thinning had an effect on the formability via its influence on the forming depth. The maximum thinning values for a 0.2 mm thick plate were 60 and 50% in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The minimum thinning values for a 0.3 mm thick plate were 16 and 13% in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. In addition, it was found that the extent of thinning in the vertical direction was greater than that in the horizontal direction.</p></list-item>
