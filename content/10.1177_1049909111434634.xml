<abstract>
<p>Neuropathic pain in a common problem encountered in palliative care. When neuropathic pain is diagnosed, appropriate treatment is important in limiting the severe psychosocial impairment that can ensue with undertreated pain. Proper evaluation of the patient to clarify the type of pain experienced is the first step to determine appropriate management. Tapentadol is an oral mu-opioid receptor agonist and a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor developed by Ortho-McNeil Janssen Pharmaceuticals and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in November 2008 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients and for chronic pain in August 2011 in an extended release form. Tapentadol has been studied for use in nociceptive pain but few studies have yet been done to assess its efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuropathic pain is by definition the result of damage or pathological process within the central or peripheral nervous system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111434634">1</xref>
</sup> It is described as burning, shooting, or shock-like in sensations, which are uncommonly used descriptors in other types of pain. Patients who have characterized their neuropathic pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire used terms such as “punishing-cruel” and “tiring-exhausting.” As nerve conduction is blocked in the neuropathic pain conditions, nerve dysfunction can even result in a loss of deep tendon reflexes, numbness, and weakness. Neuropathic pain is maintained centrally by spinal sensitization which causes expansion in the affected area, in turn producing increased sensitivity to pain response and transmission of pain after nonpainful stimuli, which is mediated through the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111434634">2</xref>
</sup> Sympathetic chronic pain occurs through the sprouting of sympathetic neurons into the dorsal root ganglia of injured sensory neurons and postinjury sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the dermis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111434634">3</xref>
</sup> Peripheral causes of neuropathic pain include metabolic neuropathies, polyneuropathies, certain mediators such as cisplatin, vincristine, nitrofurantoin, and disulfiram, toxic agents such as thallium and arsenic, infections such as HIV and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), hereditary conditions such as Fabry disease and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and malignant conditions such as malignant myeloma and carcinomas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111434634">4</xref>
</sup> Central causes of neuropathic pain originate in the spinal root and dorsal root ganglion and could result from conditions like prolapsed disc, root avulsion, tumors, and surgical lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111434634">4</xref>
</sup> Neuropathic pain sufferers also may have complications outside the spectrum of pain that may include insomnia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, fatigue, anorexia, and fall-related injuries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111434634">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In contrast, nociceptive pain occurs in both cutaneous and deep tissues and is often described as constant, localized, aching, and throbbing. Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers that respond to excess stimulation and may be classified according to the mode of activation of the receptors with examples including temperature, chemical, and mechanical stimuli.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049909111434634">
<title>Treatment Goals</title>
<p>The goal of pain management plans whether of nociceptive or neuropathic etiology is to alleviate pain to the point that it is tolerable to the patient. Full pain relief cannot always be achieved but should be an initial treatment goal. One mark of adequate pain treatment frequently cited is that the activities of daily living should be markedly improved in adequate pain relief.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111434634">5</xref>
</sup> Individualized approaches are important to achieve the optimal pain management with the least side effects and the best cost to benefit profile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049909111434634">
<title>Nonpharmacologic Treatment</title>
<p>Nonpharmacologic treatment is sometimes an option for management of neuropathic pain and should be considered prior to instituting pharmacologic treatment. Removal of offending substances that could be causing or exacerbating the pain should be first-line treatment if possible. However, there is a paucity of sound evidence supporting the efficacy of other types of nonpharmacological treatment as sole therapy. These options include exercise: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, frequency-specific micro current<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111434634">6</xref>
</sup> as well as graded motor imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and supportive psychotherapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111434634">7</xref>
</sup> These treatments are often used in addition to medication with more success.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111434634">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111434634">
<title>Pharmacological Management</title>
<p>Pharmacological management is often the primary treatment method of choice for neuropathic pain as it is so often resistant to nonpharmacologic treatment and over the counter analgesics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111434634">8</xref>
</sup> Anticonvulsants, topical anesthetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and both nonopioid and opioid analgesics are all used to treat neuropathic pain. It should be noted that antidepressants are also considered a third-line treatment for this type of pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111434634">1</xref>
</sup> Carbamezapine is approved only for the treatment of neuropathic pain cases secondary to the trigeminal neuralgia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111434634">8</xref>
</sup> Clinical trials give some guidance on how an agent may perform but do not predict which medication will relieve an individual patient's pain. The pharmacological treatment should be specifically tailored to the patient's pain after subsequent drug trials with periodic evaluation of the pain relief experienced.</p>

<title>Tapentadol Hydrochloride</title>
<p>Tapentadol is a schedule II oral mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. It was developed by Ortho-McNeil Janssen Pharmaceuticals and initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2008 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111434634">9</xref>
</sup> and for chronic pain in August 2011 in an extended release form in the same population.</p>
<p>Tapentadol produces analgesia by utilizing a dual mechanism of action: an MOR activation and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434634">10</xref>
</sup> and because of these actions, it is hypothesized that it would be an excellent option in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The dual action can address the mechanism of neuropathic pain and also the symptoms outside the pain spectrum. The binding of a mu-receptor agonist to a receptor inhibits the release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the nerve terminal thus blocking the inhibitory effect of GABA on dopaminergic neurons. As dopaminergic neurons are inactivated and the release of dopamine into the synapse results in sustained activation of the postsynaptic membrane.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111434634">11</xref>
</sup> Serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors work by blocking the presynaptic reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) and NE, which results in an increased sustained level of both of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111434634">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Tapentadol has no active metabolites and therefore does not require metabolic activation to achieve analgesic effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111434634">13</xref>
</sup> Tapentadol is rapidly absorbed, with a maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) typically observed between 1.25 and 1.5 hours. The half-life is 3.93 hours and more than 95% is excreted within 24 hours of dosing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18062408). Dose proportional increases in the C<sub>max</sub> and area under the curve values of tapentadol have been observed above the 50- to 150-mg dose range, suggestive of linear pharmacokinetics. The bioavailability is 32% after a single dose because of first pass metabolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111434634">14</xref>
</sup> There is no sufficient data available to comment on whether the drug has a ceiling effect.</p>
<p>Tapentadol is primarily and extensively (70%) metabolized via glucuronidation by the UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 enzymes to inactive metabolites. Metabolites include <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl tapentadol (13%) as a result of metabolism by CYP 2C9 and 2C19, and hydroxytapentadol (2%), as a result of metabolism by CYP 2D6, which are further metabolized by conjugation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18062408). The metabolites of tapentadol do not contribute to the drug’s analgesic activity (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nihgov/pmc/articles/PMC2888545/-b5-ptj35_6p330). Tapentadol is excreted primarily by the renal system (99%); most in the form of conjugates, the rest as other metabolites, and a small amount as unchanged drug. Fecal clearance accounts for 1% of tapentadol’s elimination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111434634">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Dosing for tapentadol is every 4 to 6 hours depending on pain intensity. Immediate release forms available include 50, 75, and 100 mg. Dose should not exceed 700 mg on first day of use and 600 mg on subsequent days. It can be used in patients with mild-to-moderate renal and as well as mild hepatic impairment without adjustment. Additionally, it can be used in elderly patients without dosage adjustment if renal and hepatic function is within normal range. It is not recommended for those persons with severe impairment in either renal or hepatic function. In moderate hepatic impairment, schedule should be adjusted to 8-hour intervals and started at 50 mg dosage. It has not been studied in children under age 18 and is pregnancy category C indicating it has not been studied in pregnant women and should be used only if the benefits outweigh the risk to the fetus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434634">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, and constipation are among the most common side effects noted as reasons for discontinuation with opioid pain medications. Multiple studies, including a 10-day phase III study of 666 people with end-stage arthritis awaiting joint replacement have shown statistically significant differences in side effect profiles for tapentadol compared to other opioid pain relievers. The phase III study mentioned above indicated that nausea and vomiting with tapentadol was up to 5 times less likely and constipation was as much as 8 times less likely when comparison was made between 50 and 75 mg of tapentadol and 10 or 15 mg of oxycodone (which is considered the equianalgesic dose). Pruritus was also reported less frequently with tapentadol in the 90-day tolerability study. It is theorized that less respiratory depression would occur with tapentadol but no studies have yet shown this to be the case, meaning that caution should still be used especially in conjunction with other sedating medications. Other side effects do not seem to statistically differ from other opioid pain relievers including central nervous system-associated symptoms like somnolence and dizziness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111434634">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Tolerance to tapentadol appears to develop more slowly than tolerance to morphine because of its dual mode of action.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111434634">15</xref>
</sup> It behaved in a similar fashion to morphine and hydromorphone in animal and human models of physical/psychological dependence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111434634">16</xref>
</sup> Because of its similarity in these properties and the high abuse potential, it was designated schedule II drug by the FDA in 2009, putting it in the same class with morphine and fentanyl,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111434634">17</xref>
</sup> although preclinical trials seemed to indicate that it had less abuse and dependence potential than these medications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111434634">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Tapentadol appears to be a well-tolerated and effective analgesic for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Although just recently approved for the management of chronic pain, it has for some time been reported to effectively manage lower back pain associated with osteoarthritis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111434634">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Tapentadol was tested against morphine and tramadol in a model of terminally induced nociceptive pain in mice and rats. The results found that morphine was twice as potent as tapentadol, and tapentadol was also 3 to 4.5 times as potent as tramadol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111434634">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In present studies, done by Tzschentke et al, tapentadol showed antinociceptive action in the L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathy in rats. In the SNL model, it was shown that the analgesic effect of tapentadol was much more sensitive to antagonistic effect of a given dose of yohimbine than that of an equianalgesic dose of morphine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111434634">18</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, under identical experimental conditions, the analgesic effect of morphine was much more sensitive to the effect of naloxone than that of tapentadol.</p>
<p>The primary site of action of tapentadol is the spinal cord, and the analgesia it induces depends solely upon opioid inhibitory mechanisms and a noradrenaline inhibition which shows predominance in neuropathic pain states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434634">10</xref>
</sup> However, no studies as of yet have been published studying tapentadol in comparison to gabapentin, a commonly prescribed neuropathic pain relief agent, nor specifically in the context of opioid-resistant or cancer-related neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Tapentadol was studied with moderate-to-severe diabetic neuropathic pain that might typically be treated with morphine and oxycodone (which act on MOR receptors) to assess its efficacy and side effect profile as significant side effects are an often cited reason for discontinuation of these medications. The study was a randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled phase III study. The results of a 12-week study determined that tapentadol was safe and effectively managed diabetic neuropathic pain with less gastrointestinal side effects and the tolerability and analgesia profile was consistent with other analgesics with MOR activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111434634">13</xref>
</sup> Tapentadol has also been shown to selectively inhibit thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathic pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111434634">19</xref>
</sup> Thermal hyperalgesia is one component of neuropathic pain that leads to hypersensitivity. The doses in the mouse model were even below the nociceptive pain relief dose profile.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049909111434634">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Neuropathic pain cases are clinically challenging. The efficacy of drugs should be evaluated with a cost and benefit perspective. As of recently, tapentadol is an attractive treatment option for the relief of moderate-to-severe acute pain, acute postoperative pain, osteoarthritis pain, and/or low back pain and in chronic back pain as well but it is not studied in pure neuropathic pain settings except in diabetic neuropathy. As more animal trials and human trials are conducted using tapentadol, clarification will be attained as to how clinically applicable the drug is in regard to the neuropathic pain treatment model.</p>
