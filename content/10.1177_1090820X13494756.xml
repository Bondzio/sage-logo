<p>Introduced in 1962, the Steri-Strip (3M Health Care, St Paul, Minnesota) is the sterile version of Micropor Surgical Tape. It was quickly embraced in operating theaters around the globe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13494756">1</xref></sup> Steri-Strips are breathable, hypoallergenic, and available in 3 widths (1/8-, 1/4-, and 1/2-inch strips) as well as in 2 variations (reinforced with polyester filaments, which are stronger, show better resistance to elongation, and have a high level of shear adhesion; or blend-tone, nonreinforced for use in areas where a cosmetically pleasing appearance is the priority).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13494756">2</xref></sup> The adhesive strips are an excellent method of wound reinforcement in the immediate postoperative period and are frequently used in primary wound closure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13494756">3</xref></sup> They have lower rates of wound infection and also prevent stitch marks when used in place of superficial sutures or staples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13494756">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13494756">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Steri-Strips should be applied parallel to each other and perpendicular to the wound edges. The work of Katz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13494756">5</xref></sup> showed that application of the strips in a parallel, non-overlapping fashion yields the best results in healthy skin. However, the specific application techniques for Steri-Strips vary between surgeons. To reduce the time associated with dressing a wound, we have devised a particular method of Steri-Strip application in our institution, and the purpose of this letter is to share that technique with our colleagues. First, after having the operating room nurse cut the whole card of Steri-Strips in half, the card end-tabs are torn off. Second, in contrast to the standard method of removing every Steri-Strip individually, all 3 strips are peeled off at once using a 3-finger technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13494756">Figure 1</xref>). With all 3 Steri-Strips completely removed from the card and stuck to the index, middle, and ring fingers, respectively, both thumbs are used for exact positioning and application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13494756">Figure 2</xref>). A video of the 3-finger technique is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com</ext-link>.

<label>Time is Money: A Faster Method of Steri-Strip Application (The 3 Finger Technique)</label>
<caption><p>In this video accompanying their Letter to the Editor, the authors demonstrate amethod of Steri-Strip application that reduced reduce the time associated with dressing a wound.</p></caption>
</media></p>
<p>To evaluate whether the 3 finger method of Steri-Strip application is a true time-saver, we compared it with the standard technique in 10 bilateral breast augmentation mastopexies. One side was dressed in the traditional manner; the other was dressed with the 3-finger technique. To standardize the data, the same number of Steri-Strips was used on each side, and the method of application was randomized to different sides. The mean (SD) dressing time for the 3-finger method was 27.41 (4.04) seconds versus 42.38 (7.04) seconds for the the standard method. Therefore, this 3-finger method we suggest proved significantly faster (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in this small group of patients.</p>
<p>Although the strips, once removed, can curl and stick together when a surgeon is first learning this technique, this problem should be remedied easily with some practice. In general, to reduce curling, the strips should be removed at a 45-degree angle to the card. Over the past 50 years, the Steri-Strip has become an indispensable part of everyday practice for most surgeons. With the implementation of this simple 3-finger application technique, they can be used in an even more efficient way.</p>
