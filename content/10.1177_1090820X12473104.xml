      <p>The facial nerve, which innervates the mimetic muscles that control facial expression, emerges from the stylomastoid foramen and traverses the parotid gland. The main trunk usually divides into 2 principal partitions: the “temporofacial” and “cervicofacial” portions. Facial expression is an exclusively controlled trait, and dysfunction of this nerve may lead to psychological and physical complications. Furthermore, the anatomy of the facial nerve is complicated and might vary among ethnic groups, which may explain the diverse facial expressions and animations among different groups.<sup>

         </sup> To reduce injury to the facial nerve during facelifts, maxillofacial surgery, or radical neck dissection, plastic surgeons must proceed with careful anatomic dissection of the important facial nerve motor branches, taking anatomic variations into account. Detailed knowledge of facial nerve anatomy, including the variations among different ethnic groups, is essential to securing and distinguishing nerve branches as well as preventing iatrogenic injuries during surgery.<sup>

         </sup> Reliable, fixed landmarks in relation to this nerve and its branches are needed to predict the precise location of important structures, guarantee safe margins, prevent aesthetic and functional complications, and avert legal issues, Distinguishing the topography of the facial nerve could therefore help provide an accurate guide for predicting the precise location of this nerve.</p>
      <p>Variations in facial nerve anatomy are well documented in the scientific literature. Davis et al<sup>

         </sup> described the branching patterns of the facial nerve and noted 6 patterns in 350 hemifacial dissections. The most common type (type III) had a single connection between the frontozygomatic and cervicofacial divisions, with a connecting loop between the zygomatic and buccal branches.<sup>

         </sup> made diagrams of the facial nerve after 100 parotidectomies, classifying them into 5 groups. In all cases, the main trunk was divided into a larger frontozygomatic and smaller cervicofacial section. On the basis of anatomic dissection of 10 fresh cadaveric hemifacial dissections, Tzafetta and Terzis<sup>

         </sup> substantiated this a year later. They acknowledged that the direction of the fascial branch was constant on a line starting 0.5 cm below the tragus and passing 1.5 cm above the lateral end of the eyebrow. Because of the superficial location and vulnerability of the frontal branch over the zygomatic arch,<sup>

      <p>The prevalence of elective facial surgery has increased with improvement in surgical techniques and with the increased average human age. Unfortunately, the anatomy described in some of the classic references is usually discussed from a basic science perspective and rarely from a surgical point of view. Therefore, this report, and other observations like it, may lead to quantitative and qualitative improvements in procedures and outcomes for certain patients. We conducted this study to examine the facial nerve branches in Persian (Iranian) cadavers, propose classification of the extratemporal nerve, determine topography of the nerve using fixed facial points, and define a new fixed point.</p>

         <p>This was a topographic survey of the facial nerve and its branches on both sides of 21 fresh Persian (Iranian) cadavers, for a total of 42 hemifaces. The study was performed at the Medical Forensics Center of Tehran, Iran. Cadavers were selected in a simple nonrandom sequence. The cadavers in the sample were older than 18 years and were dissected no more than 24 hours after death. Compliance with moral and legal criteria from the Medical Forensic Institute was maintained while performing the dissections.</p>
         <p>Prior to dissection, each cadaver’s face was marked with an irregular hexagon. The selected points for marking out the hexagon were as follows: Point A = upper border of the tragus, Point B = lateral canthus, Point C = lateral oral commissure, Point D = angle of the mandible, Point F = the point in the middle of the line between Point D and the cross point between the inferior border of the mandible and the anterior facial artery, and Point G = tip of the mastoid process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12473104">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12473104">2</xref>). The exact surface marking of Points A, B, C, D, G, and F helps to identify facial nerve branches before starting the operation. It also helps to avoid facial nerve branches injury. Point F is a newly defined point, which is in the middle of a line between Point D and the cross point of the facial artery with the inferior border of the mandible. The importance of Point F is that the marginal mandibular nerve is always above the inferior border of the mandible, anterior to Point F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12473104">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

         <p>A bicorporal incision was then made, curving along the preauricular line and continuing posteroinferiorly at the mastoid area to the posterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After removal of the skin, dissection was started with exposure of the facial nerve trunk at its exit from the stylomastoid foramen. During dissection of the facial nerve branches, loupe magnification (4.5×) was used and measurements were taken using a ruler and calipers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12473104">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12473104">Table 2</xref>).</p>

         <p>The mean ± SD age of the dissected cadavers was 43.29 ± 18.24 years. Fourteen subjects were male (66.7%) and 7 were female (33.3%). The mean ± SD distance between the facial nerve trunk on the right side of the face and Point G on the A-G line was 11.81 ± 2.01 mm; on the left side, this distance was 11.62 ± 1.93 mm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12473104">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12473104">2</xref>). The mean ± SD distance between the facial nerve bifurcation and the AD line was 1.57 ± 2.59 mm on the right side and 1.67 ± 2.47 mm on the left side, whereas the mean ± SD distance between the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and the A-D line at the level of the mastoid tip was 2.29 ± 2.28 mm on the right side and 2.71 ± 2.72 mm on the left. These anatomic features are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12473104">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
         <p>The number of temporal branches of the facial nerve on the zygomatic arch on the right side was 1 in a single cadaver (4.8%), 2 in 10 of the cadavers (47.6%), and 3 in the remaining 10 cadavers (47.6%). On the left side, it was 1 in a single case (4.8%), 2 in 8 of the cadavers (38.1%), and 3 in the 12 remaining cadavers (57.1%).

On the right side, the main temporal branch was the first branch in 7 cadavers (33.3%), the second branch in 13 cadavers (61.9%), and the third branch in 1 cadaver (4.8%). On the left side, it was the first branch in 7 cadavers (33.3%) and the second branch in 14 cadavers (66.7%).

On the left side, there was 1 fascial layer in 4 cadavers (19%) and 2 fascial layers in 17 cadavers (81%). In all cadavers, the temporal branches were deep to the SMAS and superficial temporal fascia as they crossed the zygomatic arch both at left and right sides. Only 1 zygomatic-buccal branch exited the anterior border of the parotid gland above the parotid duct and then arborized on the right side in 2 cadavers (9.5%) and on the left side in 1 cadaver (4.8%). On the right side, 3 zygomatic-buccal branches crossed line B-C and were bordered by the quadrangle formed by lines A, B, C, and D in 4 cadavers (19.0%); 4 branches crossed line B-C in 4 additional cadavers (19.0%); 5 branches crossed line B-C in 7 cadavers (33.3%); 6 branches crossed line B-C in 2 cadavers (9.5%); and 7 branches crossed line B-C in 4 cadavers (19.0%).

         <p>The mean ± SD distance between the marginal mandibular nerve and the inferior border of the mandible at Point F was 3.33 ± 3.77 mm on the right and 2.81 ± 3.76 mm on the left. On the right side, the marginal mandibular nerve exited from the inferior border of the parotid gland as an independent branch in 14 cadavers (66.7%) but was common with the buccal branches in 5 cadavers (23.8%) and common with the cervical branch in 2 cadavers (9.5%). On the left side, this nerve was independent in 16 cadavers (76.2%), was common with the buccal branches in 2 cadavers (9.5%), and was common with the cervical branch in 3 cadavers (14.3%). On the right side, a branch from the marginal mandibular nerve above or at the level of the mandibular angle (Point D) innervated the platysma muscle in 7 cadavers (33.3%), and the cervical branch innervated the platysma muscle in 2 cadavers (9.5%). On the left side, these findings were the same.</p>
         <p>When exiting from the lower parotid border, the marginal mandibular ramus had 1 branch. However, this branch was also common with the buccal (16.5%) and cervical branches (12%). These findings were the same in all cadavers and on both sides. Two of the 42 marginal mandibular nerves dissected from the 21 cadavers in this study featured more than 1 branch, but only a single main branch innervated the muscles below the lip in more than 90% of the cadavers (n = 40). Posterior to Point F, the mandibular ramus seemed to pass above the inferior border of the mandible when the distance was negative and passed below the inferior border of the mandible when the distance was positive. Anterior to Point F, 100% of the branches of the marginal mandibular nerve that innervate the depressor muscles of the lower lip seemed to be above the inferior border of the mandible.</p>
         <p>The marginal mandibular branch, the cervical branch, or the cervicomandibular branch innervated the platysma muscle at the level of or above the mandibular angle in more than 40% of the 21 cadavers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X12473104">Figure 5</xref>). Unlike the buccal branches, this branch critically passed the parotid fascia and was then superficialized.

         <p>The results of our study on Persian (Iranian) cadavers confirm the variable branching pattern of the extratemporal facial nerve. This variability may help explain the different facial expressions that appear among individual ethnic groups. The facial nerve branches that innervate mimetic muscles in individuals of Iranian descent may differ from those in individuals from Northern Europe. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an anatomical researcher has published a hypothesis to try to explain this difference. We have observed in many countries that different ethnic groups exhibit different types of smiling and facial animation. The animation muscles (especially the frontalis, corrugators, and platysma muscles) are not active when people speak Farsi (the Iranian language), but these muscles are very active when people speak English and certain other European languages. This may explain the fact that procedures such as frontal lifts and platysma muscle-weakening corrections are rarely performed on Iranian individuals. Additional study, including investigation of facial nerve branches of other ethnic groups, is necessary to prove this theory.</p>

            </sup> and the number of temporal branches in the current study was between 1 and 3. As the temporal branch coursed the zygomatic arch, it was located under a fascial plane deep to the SMAS. This fascial plane is a continuation of the superficial fascia. In the current study, 1 dissectible anatomic layer lay under the temporal branch and the zygomatic arch periosteum in approximately 23.8% of the cadavers, and 2 anatomic layers lay under this area in 76.2% of cadavers. The deeper fascial layer was clearly dissectible and continuous with the deep temporalis fascia. The second layer, which was superficial to the first layer, is the innominate fascia, a fibrofatty layer deep to the SMAS. Agarwal et al<sup>

On the basis of these studies, some authors have presented classifications for the facial nerve ramification.

         <p>On the basis of our observations in this study regarding the branching patterns of the facial nerve, we propose the following classification system for facial nerve arborization in Iranian individuals, paying particular attention to the relationship between the marginal mandibular branch and buccal branches. Our classification system defines type I as the classic type reported in traditional anatomy books (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1090820X12473104">Figure 6</xref>). Type II features buccal branches that are mainly arborized from the marginal mandibular nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1090820X12473104">Figure 7</xref>). In type III (the sweeper type), the buccal, zygomatic, and temporal branches are all arborized directly from the main trunk just after leaving the cervicomandibular branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1090820X12473104">Figure 8</xref>). In type IV, which surprisingly constituted more than 40% of our cadavers, there is an area devoid of motor branches between the most inferior buccal branch and the marginal mandibular branch, and the buccal branches are arborized from the temporozygomaticobuccal branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1090820X12473104">Figure 9</xref>). In type IV cadavers in our study, we did not see communication with the cervicomandibular branch. Of importance, a safe zone for dissection was apparent in type IV cases, situated between the lowest buccal branch and the marginal mandibular branch. This safe zone could be identified preoperatively by electroneurodiagnosis.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>On the basis of our findings from 42 hemifacial anatomic dissections in fresh Persian (Iranian) cadavers, which demonstrated the incredible variability of facial nerve branching patterns, we proposed a new classification of the facial nerves for Iranian patients. We defined a new fixed Point F, the point in the middle of the line between Point D (angle of the mandible) and the cross point between the inferior border of the mandible and the anterior facial artery, and measured the distance of the marginal mandibular nerve to this point. The predissection hexagon described in this article can help plastic surgeons recognize the facial nerve trunk and its branches before surgical dissection, which will prevent injury to this nerve. In addition, we defined the larger temporal nerve branch and calculated its distance to Point A, the upper border of the tragus. This study was the first research of this type to be performed in Western Asia. Overall, our results should serve as an effective surgical guide. Future studies are warranted to identify additional variability in branching patterns of the facial nerve among different ethnic groups, which may account for the significant variations noted in facial animation patterns among these groups.</p>
