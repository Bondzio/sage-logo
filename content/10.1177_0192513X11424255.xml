<abstract>
<p>Using data from a probability sample of 943 married women and men in Assiut and Souhag, Egypt, we explored spousal reports of lifetime physical intimate partner violence (IPV) against wives and the determinants of spousal disagreement overall and by type. More than one third of wives and about one third of husbands reported wife <italic>beating</italic> since marriage. More than one quarter of couples disagreed about its occurrence, usually because wives reported wife beating when their husbands did not. Wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> and wife-<italic>no</italic>-husband-<italic>yes</italic> disagreements were more common among couples who were married for more than 7 years, suggesting poor recall by either spouse of distant events, an unwillingness of husbands and wives to disclose a distant event, or variable within-couple definitions of what constitutes wife <italic>beating</italic>. Wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>yes</italic> and wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> responses were more common among wives with little or no schooling, suggesting that these women were more likely to experience physical IPV and to have husbands who denied its occurrence.</p>

<p><italic>Intimate partner violence</italic>, or IPV, refers to “assaultive and coercive behaviors that adults use against their intimate partners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11424255">Holden, 2003</xref>, p. 155). According to studies often of purposive samples in North America and Europe, men and women commit physical and psychological IPV equally often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11424255">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11424255">Straus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11424255">Swan, Gambone, Caldwell, Sullivan, &amp; Son, 2008</xref>); yet men’s physical violence is more injurious, and men more often stalk, sexually assault, and use coercive tactics of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11424255">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11424255">Swan et al., 2008</xref>). Women’s violence also is spurred more often by fear or self-defense, and women experience worse psychological outcomes in situations of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11424255">Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11424255">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11424255">Swan et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, women in poorer, more gender-stratified settings report physical IPV more often than do men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11424255">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11424255">McCue, 2008</xref>). According to surveys in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, 12% to 71% of women have reported any prior physical IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424255">Douki, Belhadj, Bousaker, &amp; Ghachem, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11424255">Garcia-Moreno, Henrica, Jansen, Heise, &amp; Watts, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11424255">Hindin, Kishor, &amp; Ansara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11424255">ICF Macro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X11424255">Watts &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>), and according to reports by women and men, women have initiated such violence less often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11424255">ICF Macro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11424255">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). Thus, reported IPV is asymmetrical in ways that disproportionately adversely affects women in most settings.</p>
<p>Despite clear definitions of IPV and its high global prevalence, partners often have disagreed about its occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11424255">Arias &amp; Beach, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11424255">Bohannon, Dosser, &amp; Lindley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11424255">Browning &amp; Dutton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11424255">Edelson &amp; Brygger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11424255">Heyman &amp; Schlee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424255">Jouriles &amp; O’Leary, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11424255">Moffitt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11424255">O’Leary &amp; Arias, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11424255">Szinovacz, 1983</xref>). Self-reports of IPV usually lead to underreporting, because participants forget that the violence occurred, misunderstand the questions asked by interviewers, or purposely conceal victimization or perpetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11424255">Caetano, Schafer, Field, &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). Among couples, biased reporting is possible in either direction. For male-to-female violence, the woman may report when her partner does not because he minimizes his actions on the basis of social desirability. Conversely, a woman may not report male-to-female violence if she fears reprisal as a result of her disclosure. A meta-analytic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11424255">Archer, 1999</xref>) and subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11424255">O’Leary &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11424255">Simpson &amp; Christiansen, 2005</xref>) showed that systematic underreporting occurs in self-reports by both sexes but that underreporting may be more frequent among men than women. Yet most of these studies were based on small, community-based samples of couples; small, unmatched samples; or small, clinical samples of couples from North America, the United Kingdom, or Europe. Only recently have large probability surveys in such settings included reports about IPV from both partners, permitting wider inferences about reliability.</p>
<p>Data, for example, from 4,088 couples participating in Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families and Households showed that agreement about the nonoccurrence of violence was high but that agreement about its occurrence was low, largely because of the low reported prevalence of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11424255">Szinovacz &amp; Egley, 1995</xref>). This study suffered, however, from a limited number of indicators of violence and different modes of data collection from the husband and wife. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11424255">Schafer, Caetano, and Clark (2002)</xref> used face-to-face interviews with both partners and the revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) to assess IPV among couples who took part in the Ninth National Alcohol Survey (1,599 couples of 1,925 eligible). For male-to-female and female-to-male IPV, respectively, chance-corrected agreements (kappas) were low for any reported violence (.39 and .36), and were lower for more severe violence (e.g., .15 and .16 for forced sex) than for less severe violence (.49 and .45 for pushed, grabbed, and shoved). Kappas, again, were low partly because reporting violence was uncommon, with most partners agreeing that they had not experienced either male-to-female (86%) or female-to-male (82%) violence. In adjusted models, however, the odds of spousal agreement were higher for more than for less severe male-to-female IPV, regardless of the type (e.g., adjusted odds ratio = 4.2 for severe vs. minor psychological IPV, 6.5 for severe vs. minor physical IPV, and 8.5 for severe vs. minor sexual IPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424255">Caetano, Field, Ramisetty-Mikler, &amp; Lipsky, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the same data set, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11424255">Caetano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424255">Caetano et al., 2009</xref>) compared spousal reports of male-to-female and female-to-male IPV among White, Black, and Hispanic couples in the contiguous United States. Across all ethnic groups, kappas were low (≤.55) for any IPV regardless of the perpetrator, and were especially low for forced sex and other severe violence (.00-.30). In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11424255">Caetano et al., 2002</xref>), lower adjusted odds of agreement about male-to-female IPV among Hispanics versus Whites were attributed to cultural norms of collectivism and nonconfrontational relations, which may have led men to underreport IPV perpetration. A subsequent study of this sample, however, found no adjusted ethnic differences in the odds of agreement about any type of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424255">Caetano et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential differences across ethnic groups in the United States suggest that rates of agreement between spousal reports of IPV may vary across contexts with different norms about gender and IPV. Yet localized studies outside the West are conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Barazi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Tewtel-Salem, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11424255">Schluter, Paterson, &amp; Feehan, 2007</xref>). Small studies of Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon showed higher spousal agreement about violence against wives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Barazi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Tewtel-Salem, 2004</xref>), whereas among Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand, men reported less victimization and perpetration than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11424255">Schluter et al., 2007</xref>). Such discrepancies may have resulted from differences in sample design and instruments for data collection. Otherwise, partner agreement about IPV against wives may be higher in more gender-stratified settings having fewer taboos about such violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Tewtel-Salem, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the cross-cultural reliability of spousal reports of IPV is germane, as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have, since 1990, included questions on IPV in more than 25 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The DHS reveal a wide range of rates of lifetime physical IPV against women (12% to 71%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11424255">ICF Macro, 2010</xref>). Yet most IPV modules have been administered only to women, or in a few cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11424255">Uganda Bureau of Statistics &amp; Macro International, 2007</xref>), to separate samples of men and women, precluding the matching of reports within couples. Thus, to date, the reliability of women’s reports of IPV against women is largely unknown in poorer and more gender-stratified settings, where reported rates may be high and formal recourse very limited.</p>
<p>Our analysis begins to fill this gap in research. We capitalize on a unique dataset in which reports of lifetime male-to-female physical IPV were asked of couples in two governorates in Southern Egypt. Such reports were collected from a probability sample of 943 married women in Assiut and Souhag who took part in the 1995-1996 Egypt DHS. These reports were matched with responses to a parallel question that was asked of husbands in a follow-up interview in 1996-1997. We explored the levels and consistency of spousal reports of lifetime physical IPV against wives and the determinants of spousal disagreement about its occurrence. The findings provide insights about the reliability of reports of physical IPV in a probability sample of couples in a highly gender-stratified setting.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X11424255">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Assiut and Sohag governorates are located in southern Egypt and account for 10% of Egypt’s total population size (68,648,000 in 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11424255">United Nations Development Programme &amp; Institute of National Planning [UNDP &amp; INP], 2005</xref>). Compared with the north, southern Egypt receives fewer public resources, and the levels of schooling and income are lower. Rates of literacy (≥15 years), for example, are around 50% in Assiut and Sohag, compared with 66% at the national level. Similarly, the gross domestic profit (GDP) per capita (PPP $2,256 and 2,458, vs. 4,152 nationally) and percentage of households with access to sanitation are lower (73% and 76% vs. 94% nationally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11424255">UNDP &amp; INP, 2005</xref>). In the 1990s, Assiut was the site of conflict between Islamist insurgents and the police, reflecting a historical distrust of the government. Compared with the north, southern Egypt is also distinct in its stronger adherence to customary forms of kinship.</p>
<p><italic>Classic patriarchy</italic> is a useful model to depict family relations in southern Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11424255">Kandiyoti, 1988</xref>). In this model, kin relations revolve around a <italic>patriarchal kin contract</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11424255">Joseph, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11424255">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11424255">Rugh, 1984</xref>), in which the members of a kin group are expected to provide instrumental or material resources and to preserve the family’s honor. Each member expects, in return, to receive emotional, economic, and social security, and with these, a sense of identity from belonging to the kin group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11424255">Joseph, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11424255">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11424255">Rugh, 1984</xref>). The rights and duties of kin members are defined on the basis of gender, age or generation, and relation. Norms of <italic>gender complementarity</italic>, which partly are rooted in Islamic prescripts, uphold distinctive family roles for men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11424255">Nelson &amp; Olesen, 1977</xref>). As such, men should provide protection and financial maintenance in exchange for women’s obedience and domestic labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11424255">Jowkar, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>In southern Egypt, as in other classic patriarchal settings, children typically remain in the parental home until marriage. A daughter’s duties then shift to her husband’s family; yet she often maintains enduring ties with her parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11424255">Kandiyoti, 1988</xref>). For example, 41% of women marry a blood relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11424255">El Zanaty &amp; Way, 2009</xref>), and such women retain an important place in their bloodline. Most married daughters also live near their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X11424255">Yount, 1999</xref>), which facilitates visitation, gift giving, and other exchanges. A father, moreover, is obliged to support a daughter who experiences spousal neglect, separation, or abandonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11424255">Shaham, 1994</xref>). Such ties with natal kin can offer protection to women who experience some form of marital conflict.</p>
<p>Patriarchal families in southern Egypt have undergone dramatic changes as a result of legal reform, urbanization, industrialization, mass schooling, and especially increased schooling of girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11424255">Fargues, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11424255">Moghadam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11424255">Tabutin &amp; Schoumaker, 2005</xref>). In all of Egypt, gender gaps in never attendance among adults 20 to 24 years old declined from 23% in 1992 to 8% in 2008 because of faster declines in never attendance among women (from 34% to 15% vs. 11% to 7% among men; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11424255">El-Zanaty, Sayed, Zaky, &amp; Way, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11424255">El-Zanaty &amp; Way, 2009</xref>). These gains have contributed to increases among women in the mean age at marriage and the proportion of women never married (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11424255">Fargues, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11424255">Tabutin &amp; Schoumaker, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, the family remains a powerful icon of cultural authenticity, and threats to classic patriarchy by structural change have met with conservative movements to refuel the moral discourse of gender complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11424255">Yount, 2004</xref>). The rise of Islamists in the 1970s spurred political debates about women’s authentic roles in the family and society, and such debates played a part in conservative revisions of family law in Egypt (Mohgadam, 2004). Certain features of the patriarchal family, thus, have endured in Assiut and Sohag, including lower mean age at first marriage (24.5 and 24.3 vs. 26.1 nationally) and lower rates of female labor force participation (16% and 15% of those ≥15 years, vs. 24% nationally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11424255">UNDP &amp; INP, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Family violence in Egypt falls under the provisions of general law that cover all cases of assault or abuse. The law, thus, does not specifically prohibit spousal abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424255">Ammar, 2006</xref>). Certain criminal-law articles punish any person who contributes to a woman’s spontaneous abortion through hitting or similar violence. Women have the right to divorce on grounds of <italic>incompatibility</italic>, but they must give up their financial and custodial claims. Few nongovernmental organizations offer direct services to abused women, and the few existing shelters often follow rigid rules for admittance, and like law-enforcement authorities, prioritize spousal reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424255">Ammar, 2006</xref>). Thus, patriarchal values and a view of wife abuse as legitimate “discipline” contribute to “passive acquiescence in its inevitability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424255">Ammar, 2006</xref>, p. 249). As such, one third of women across all regions report having experienced psychological, physical, or sexual IPV, and few recently abused women (&lt;1%) have sought formal recourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11424255">El-Zanaty &amp; Way, 2006</xref>) because such acts are shameful and would lead to an irreconcilable divorce.</p>

<sec id="section2-0192513X11424255">
<title>Sample and Data</title>
<p>This analysis is based on married female respondents in the 1995-1996 Egypt DHS (EDHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11424255">El-Zanaty, Hussein, Shawky, Way, &amp; Kishor, 1996</xref>), who are linked with husbands who took part in the 1996-1997 Egypt In-depth Survey (EIS). This DHS was one of the only three to ask questions on IPV in a matched sample of spouses. The master sample for the 1995-1996 EDHS was based on an update of the 1986 national census frame. A three-stage sample was selected separately in rural and urban areas. After systematically selecting 934 segments from 467 primary sampling units (263 villages, 204 towns/urban areas), a systematic random sample of households was selected from retained segments. In Assiut and Souhag, households were oversampled to have a sufficient number of cases for the EIS follow-up, and 99% (15,567 of 15,689) of identified households were interviewed. A <italic>household listing</italic> permitted the recording of age, gender, and relation to the head for all members; marital status for members at least 15 years; and schooling and recent work status for members at least 6 years. A <italic>household form</italic> included questions about the amenities of the dwelling and the household’s ownership of consumer goods and durables.</p>
<p>Eligible women in the EDHS were ever-married, 15 to 49 years old, and usual residents or visitors in the household. Consenting eligible women received a <italic>woman’s form</italic>, which included questions on age, marriage, education, work, religion, reproduction and family planning, and health knowledge and practices. A <italic>women’s status module</italic> (WSM) was administered in a one-third subsample of interviewed households except in Assiut and Souhag, where the WSM was administered in all sampled households. The WSM included questions on the woman’s family background, marriage, intrahousehold relations, domestic labor and work, household eating practices, financial autonomy, and treatment by her husband. This last section included questions on attitudes about wife beating, experience of beating since marriage and perpetrators, frequency of beating in the prior year, reactions to any past beating, injury and/or need for medical attention because of a beating, experiences of beating during pregnancy, help seeking and sources of help, and reasons for not seeking help if help was not sought. more than 98% of all women selected for the WSM responded (7,121 of 7,223), and more than 97% of eligible women were interviewed in Sohag (<italic>n</italic> = 1,631) and Assiut (<italic>n</italic> = 1,711). Such response rates corroborate those from prior EDHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11424255">El-Zanaty et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424255">Sayed, Osman, El-Zanaty, &amp; Way, 1989</xref>) and our surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X11424255">Yount, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The EIS follow-up sample in Assiut and Souhag included nonmenopausal EDHS respondents 15 to 44 years old in 1995 who were usual residents of the sampled household and were still married (<italic>n</italic> = 2,516). Of these women, 2,444 (97%) were interviewed. The EIS also included interviews with the husbands of EIS respondents who were found in a random subsample of half of all households in the 1995/1996 EDHS household sample. Of 1,229 eligible husbands, 1,018 completed interviews (83%). The <italic>husband’s module</italic> included questions about ever perpetration of wife beating since marriage, wife beating in the prior year, main reason for wife beating at last occurrence, and views about whether there were any situations in which a husband was justified in beating his wife. The sample of couples for this analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 943) excludes 75 couples, of which 13 wives (17%), 60 husbands (80%), and 2 pairs of spouses (3%) had missing data on IPV.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0192513X11424255">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Three dependent variables were created from spousal reports about whether the husband had beaten his wife since marriage. One outcome retained all four possible cross-classifications of spousal reports: both spouses reported <italic>yes</italic>, both spouses reported <italic>no</italic>, the wife reported <italic>yes</italic> but her husband reported <italic>no</italic>, and the wife reported <italic>no</italic> but her husband reported <italic>yes</italic>. A second outcome collapsed these categories to capture spousal agreement (both reported <italic>yes</italic> or both reported <italic>no</italic>) versus disagreement. The third outcome indicated whether the husband and wife agreed (e.g., both reported <italic>no</italic> or both reported <italic>yes</italic>), the husband reported <italic>yes</italic> but the wife reported <italic>no</italic>, or the wife reported <italic>yes</italic> but husband reported <italic>no</italic>. To adjust for the 21- to 23-month gap between the wives’ (1995-1996) and husbands’ (1997) interviews, a wife’s negative report of beating since marriage was recoded to a positive one if her husband reported such violence in the year before his interview. In effect, this recoding strategy provided an upper bound on <italic>yes</italic>-<italic>yes</italic> agreement between spousal reports of wife beating since marriage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192513X11424255">
<title>Covariates</title>
<p>Based on prior research, the following covariates were included in the analysis: husband’s age and schooling, wife’s age and schooling, the duration of the couple’s marriage, and the couple’s location of residence (urban Assiut, rural Assiut, urban Souhag, or rural Souhag). Missing data on husbands’ schooling (<italic>n</italic> = 264 of 943 couples) were imputed from the wives’ reports. Data on the duration of marriage came from the wives’ reports, adjusted to the date of the husbands’ interviews. Because of nonlinearities in the associations of husband’s and wife’s age, schooling, and duration of marriage with spousal reports of wife beating, these covariates were recoded into ordinal measures with quartile cutpoints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0192513X11424255">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Univariate analyses were conducted of all variables to assess their completeness and distributional properties. Bivariate associations among all covariates were estimated to assess potential collinearities among them. Rates of ever–wife beating, as reported by husbands and wives separately, then were estimated, as were the crude percentage agreements and chance-corrected agreements between spousal reports, with and without adjusting for the time lapse between spouses’ interviews. Chi-square tests of independence were used to assess bivariate associations of all covariates with the binary measure of spousal agreement and the measure of spousal agreement–disagreement by type, both adjusted for the time lapse between spousal interviews.</p>
<p>Finally, logistic regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of spousal disagreement (vs. agreement) about wife beating for all covariates. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model the crude and adjusted ORs for spousal disagreement about wife beating (wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> and wife-<italic>no</italic>-husband-<italic>yes</italic>, vs. agreement) for all covariates. In both cases, the method of generalized estimating equations was used to account for the multistage, cluster-sample design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11424255">Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of Husbands and Wives</title>
<p>The mean age of husbands was 39 years, with about 23% of husbands aged 46 to 85 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X11424255">Table 1</xref>). Wives, on average, were considerably younger; with a mean age of 31 years and about 29% aged 36 to 46 years. Husbands, on average, had much more schooling than the wives (6 grades vs. just more than 3 grades, respectively). Only 24% of husbands compared with more than half (58%) of wives had no schooling, and 13% of husbands compared with only 6% of wives had more than 12 grades of schooling. The sample was predominantly rural (82%), and roughly equally distributed across Souhag (51%) and Assiut (49%) governorates. On average, couples had been married 13 years at the time of the husbands’ interviews, with about one quarter having been married 2 to 6 years and about 22% having been married at least 20 years.</p>

Among cases of disagreement, couples in which the wife reported wife beating when her husband did not (19%) were more common than the reverse (between 8% adjusted and 16% unadjusted).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X11424255">Table 3</xref> shows, by spouses’ characteristics, the percentage distribution of matched spousal reports of wife beating since marriage and the crude percentage of spousal disagreement (both adjusted for the time lag between spousal interviews). The percentage of disagreement varies from 10% among couples in which the wife has more than 12 grades of schooling to 34% among couples in which the husband is 39 to 45 years old. The percentage of disagreement tends to decrease with higher spousal schooling attainments, and to increase with increasing duration of marriage and age of the husband (but not the wife). Specifically, in couples in which the husband has more than 12 grades of schooling, 19% of spouses disagree about the occurrence of wife beating, compared with 31% of spouses in couples in which the husband has no schooling. Similarly, the percentage of disagreement is lower in couples in which the wife has more than 12 grades of schooling (10%) than in couples in which the wife has no schooling (31%). Finally, in couples married at least 20 years, just less than 29% of spouses disagree about the occurrence of wife beating; whereas, in couples married for 2 to 6 years, 18% disagree.</p>

<p>The percentage distribution of matched spousal reports about the occurrence of wife beating since marriage varies significantly by both spouses’ schooling attainments, location of residence, and marital duration. In all subgroups of couples except two (in which the husband or wife has more than 12 grades of schooling), the percentage of couples in which the <italic>wife</italic> reports wife beating and the <italic>husband</italic> does not is higher than the percentage of couples in which the <italic>husband</italic> reports wife beating and the <italic>wife</italic> does not. In couples in which the husband is younger (33-38 years old) and less schooled (0-5 grades), the wife is younger (17-25 years old) and less schooled (1-5 grades), and the marriage occurred 2 to 6 years before the husband’s interview, wives report wife beating more than 3 times more often than do their husbands. Thus, most of the crude disagreement about wife beating results from husbands not reporting it when the wife does. In the bivariate setting, this type of disagreement is less common when husbands and wives are more schooled and the duration of marriage (or recall period) is shorter.</p>

<title>Odds Ratios of Spousal Disagreement About Wife Beating</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0192513X11424255">Table 4</xref> shows unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of spousal disagreement versus agreement and of spousal disagreement by type versus agreement about the occurrence of wife beating. Because of the high Pearson correlations between measures of spousal age and the duration of marriage (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.67), adjusted multivariate models are presented that include spousal age (Model 2, Model 5) and marital duration (Model 3, Model 6) separately. According to Model 2, couples in which the husband is older (39-45 years) have 2.0 times higher odds of disagreeing about wife beating since marriage than do couples in which the husband is younger (19-32 years). Couples in which the wife has more than 12 grades of schooling have about 75% lower odds of disagreeing about wife beating since marriage than do couples in which the wife has no schooling. According to Model 3, couples married for 7 or more years have 1.7 to 2.0 times higher odds of disagreeing about the prior occurrence of wife beating than do couples married for fewer years.</p>

<p>According to adjusted Models 5 and 6, similar attributes matter when the type of spousal disagreement is disaggregated, and their associations are most prominent with wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> disagreement. Namely, the odds of such disagreement are 76% lower when the wife has more than 12 grades of schooling than when the wife has no schooling. Couples married for 7 to 19 years have 1.8 to 1.9 times higher odds of such disagreement, and those married for 7 or more years have 2.4 to 2.7 times higher odds of wife-<italic>no</italic>-husband-<italic>yes</italic> disagreement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this article has been to explore husbands’ and wives’ reports of wife beating since marriage, levels of spousal agreement and disagreement about prior wife beating overall and by type, and the determinants of spousal disagreement overall and by type. To date, research comparing partners’ reports of IPV suggests that both partners may underreport their own perpetration of violence, but that men may underreport more than do women. Such findings, however, are based largely on small, selected samples in the West, and little is known about spousal reporting on IPV cross-culturally. One hypothesis is that partner agreement about the occurrence of wife beating may be higher in more gender-stratified settings characterized by fewer taboos about IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Tewtel-Salem, 2004</xref>). Southern Egypt is an excellent site in which to explore this hypothesis, being a highly gender-stratified setting in which IPV against wives is viewed as a legitimate form of discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424255">Ammar, 2006</xref>). Assiut and Souhag, Egypt also are among the very few settings where the DHS have collected reports of prior wife beating from a community-based probability sample of couples.</p>
<p>In this sample, between 37% and 45% of wives, compared with 34% of husbands, reported wife beating since marriage. Thus, regardless of the source, reported levels of such IPV fall within the range (12% to 71%) documented in the DHS. To some extent, this intermediate-to-high ranking on reported levels of wife beating corroborates Egypt’s relatively tolerant legal environment regarding IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424255">Ammar, 2006</xref>) and its relatively poor standing on the U.N. index of gender empowerment (91 out of 93 countries; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X11424255">UNDP, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, compared with the findings from selected Middle Eastern populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Barazi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424255">Khawaja &amp; Tewtel-Salem, 2004</xref>), crude and chance-corrected spousal agreement about prior wife beating is low in this sample. More than two thirds of discrepant responses arise because the wife reports wife beating when the husband does not. These findings corroborate reviews and recent research from the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11424255">Archer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11424255">O’Leary &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11424255">Simpson &amp; Christiansen, 2005</xref>), suggesting both low levels of spousal agreement about the occurrence of IPV as well as men’s possible tendency to underreport perpetration. Such findings, thus, refute the idea that spousal agreement about wife beating will be higher in more gender-stratified settings where such behavior is legal and presumably more tolerated. Yet the discrepancies between our findings and those from other Arab Middle Eastern samples have other potential explanations. First, Middle Eastern scholars make a strong case that gender norms differ widely across Arab Middle Eastern communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11424255">Obermeyer, 1992</xref>), and so taboos about IPV may likewise vary. Second, the surveys in Egypt were conducted in the wake of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. One major message coming out of this conference was the need for women’s empowerment and reproductive rights. Thus, the conduct of these surveys soon after ICPD may have spurred female respondents to disclose IPV and their husbands to give the socially desirable response and deny perpetration.</p>
<p>Finally, this study suggests that the reasons for spousal disagreement may depend on the type of disagreement in question. On one hand, all types of disagreement (wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> and wife-<italic>no</italic>-husband-<italic>yes</italic>) may arise if the spouses in longer marriages fail to remember more distant events. The EDHS have not collected data on the time since first marriage that wife abuse began, but in Cambodia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, a majority of wives who reported violence also reported that it started within 4 years of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11424255">Kishor &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). If this pattern also prevails in Egypt, then at least some portion of the variance in <italic>all</italic> types of spousal disagreement about wife abuse may result from poorer recall in couples that have been married for more years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wife-<italic>yes</italic>-husband-<italic>no</italic> disagreement about wife beating was the most common type of spousal disagreement, and this type of disagreement varied systematically with the wife’s schooling attainment. Namely, such disagreement was less common among couples in which the wife was highly schooled, and several interpretations of this result are plausible. First, more schooled wives may have sufficient marital power to avoid wife abuse (see all reported rates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X11424255">Table 2</xref>), and to discourage their husbands from denying perpetration. Second, the definition of IPV may be more consistent in educated couples, leading to greater agreement about its occurrence. Third, the stigma of wife beating may be higher among educated couples, discouraging <italic>both</italic> husbands and wives from reporting prior wife abuse. To disentangle the reasons for these associations, mixed methods studies are needed that include cognitive interviewing and test-retest surveys in samples of husbands and wives. Such research would permit exploration of husbands’ and wives’ interpretations of questions about IPV and the reasons for their responses. Such research also would assess in tandem the within-subject and within-couple reliability of reported IPV across modes of data collection and across time.</p>
<p>Some limitations of this analysis are notable. First, the questions on IPV in both spouses’ interviews were limited to acts of physical violence against wives. Despite this limitation, the 1995-1996 EDHS was the first of only three DHS to ask questions on IPV of husbands and wives. So, the availability of these data offers a rare opportunity to evaluate spousal reports about wife beating cross-culturally. Still, studies of the reliability of reported psychological and sexual IPV are needed, especially in non-U.S. populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424255">Caetano et al., 2009</xref>). A second limitation of the analysis was that the husbands’ interviews took place 21 to 23 month after those of the wives. This time lag may have had multiple, competing effects on spousal agreement about wife beating. On one hand, some of any difference in husbands’ and wives’ reports may have been real, resulting in underestimates of spousal agreement compared with concurrent measurements. On the other hand, the time lag may have enhanced disclosure by both partners if they were less likely to consider that their spouse’s interview included questions on IPV. Also, the estimates of agreement that adjust for this time lag provide a reasonable upper bound on spousal agreement about wife beating. Finally, the levels of wife beating as reported by husbands are consistently lower, despite the later timing of their interviews. Thus, although some question of comparability arises from the survey’s panel design, spousal agreement about wife beating is low by any estimation, and may result in part from husbands’ less frequent reporting.</p>
<p>A third limitation of the analysis was the rate of nonparticipation or item nonresponse among eligible husbands, which together was 23% (286 of 1,229). A main reason for the husband’s nonparticipation was noncoresidence with his wife (see table in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0192513X11424255">appendix</xref>). Nonparticipating husbands and wives tended to have <italic>less</italic> schooling and to have been married for marginally <italic>longer</italic> (14 vs. 13 years, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), and these variables are shown to have competing associations with spousal agreement about wife beating. Thus, the net effects of nonparticipation on population inferences are, to some extent, uncertain.</p>
<p>A final possible limitation of this analysis was that divorced couples were excluded. If levels of spousal agreement about wife beating differ between married and divorced couples, then the findings presented here are not generalizable to ever-married couples in Assiut and Souhag. Despite this potential concern, less than 2% of married EDHS respondents aged 15 to 44 years in 1995-1996 were divorced between their interview and the start of the EIS. Thus, any bias resulting from the exclusion of divorced couples is likely to be low.</p>
<p>Together, this analysis suggests that levels of disagreement between spousal reports of wife beating are high, despite a context of greater gender stratification and more tolerance for IPV than in the West. Thus, taboos regarding wife abuse even in non-Western settings may encourage husbands to underreport IPV. If this interpretation is correct and such underreporting is widespread, then Egyptian policy makers should view with caution the levels of wife beating that are based on husbands’ reports. Also, to build on the findings from this analysis, research is needed that compares spousal reports of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV in other highly gender-stratified settings. If our findings prevail in other such settings, then poorly schooled women may face the double risk of experiencing wife beating by husbands who deny it.</p>
