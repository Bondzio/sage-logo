<title>Background:</title>
<p>Among the types of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs), the osteochondral and chondral types make up the majority of OLTs. There is a possibility that between these two types of lesions, the clinical outcomes and characteristics may differ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472976">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>This study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of osteochondral- and chondral-type lesions of OLTs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472976">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472976">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The authors retrospectively analyzed 298 ankles that underwent arthroscopic marrow-stimulating procedures for OLTs between 2001 and 2009 that had been arthroscopically determined as either chondral type (210 ankles) or osteochondral type (88 ankles). Clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of the lesions were compared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472976">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The age distribution showed that the chondral type reached its peak in patients in their 50s, whereas the osteochondral type had a peak distribution for those in their 20s. The average duration of symptoms was greater in the chondral type (28.3 months; range, 7-240 months) than in the osteochondral type (14.4 months; range, 8-120 months) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). With regard to the characteristics of the lesions, differences only existed in the combined intra-articular lesions between the two types. Subchondral cysts (odds ratio [OR], 3.71; 95% CI, 1.61-8.55; <italic>P =</italic> .001) and soft tissue impingement (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.10-3.03; <italic>P =</italic> .021) were more frequently present in the chondral type. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain showed significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative scores in both groups. However, the preoperative and postoperative VAS and AOFAS scores did not differ significantly between the groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Differences were found with age distribution, duration of symptoms, and combined intra-articular lesions between the osteochondral- and chondral-type lesions of OLTs.

<body>
<p>The term “osteochondral lesion of the talus” (OLT) is currently used to describe a lesion of any origin that involves the articular surface and/or subchondral region of the talus. The OLTs are characterized according to stability, displacement, location, size, containment, and type of lesion, and they are categorized according to the type of lesion as chondral (cartilage only) or osteochondral (cartilage and bone) type. With access to the bone marrow, spontaneous repair of the osteochondral type is much more efficient compared with a repair of the chondral type, which is sparsely repopulated by cells migrating from the synovial membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472976">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there is a possibility that the clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of the lesion may be different between the osteochondral and chondral types, little has been reported comparing the clinical results and characteristics between these two types of lesions. A major problem with the assessment of outcomes of these two types of lesions is that previous reports reference a variety of classification systems, ranging from Berndt and Harty’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472976">3</xref></sup> staging system based on plain radiography to newer classification systems using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and arthroscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472976">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472976">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472976">19</xref></sup> Despite the lack of agreement on the exact diagnostic criteria for these two types of lesions, many investigators do not even mention the actual classification system used in their studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472976">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472976">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472976">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472976">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472976">19</xref></sup> which makes interpretation difficult.</p>
<p>A few authors have tried to clarify these two types of lesions by examining CT, MRI, and arthroscopic findings in OLTs. They collected information from a single institution using a relatively small number of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472976">20</xref></sup> In addition, they did not focus on comparing the osteochondral and chondral types of lesions. This study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of arthroscopically determined osteochondral- and chondral-type lesions among a relatively large number of patients.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512472976" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We obtained approval from our institutional review board, and all patients provided informed consent. From 2001 to 2009, 379 patients who had arthroscopic treatment for OLTs were retrospectively identified. We conducted a review of individual medical records and obtained patients’ clinical data. We applied strict criteria for entry into our study. The inclusion criteria for both chondral and osteochondral types of OLTs were (1) localized defects on the talar dome, (2) symptoms of ankle pain and/or functional limitations, (3) a minimum of 6 months of nonsurgical management, (4) type of lesion confirmed by arthroscopic surgery, (5) complete medical records and preoperative MRI scans, (6) only primary cases with no previous surgical treatment, and (7) a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patients were excluded from the study if they had rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic change of the ankle joint, a severe structural malalignment, chronic ankle instability, and associated ankle fractures. In total, 298 ankles from 294 patients were finally enrolled, comprising 210 ankles with chondral-type OLTs and 88 ankles with osteochondral-type OLTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512472976">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To compare clinical features between the groups, we evaluated the patient’s age, duration of symptoms, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and history of trauma using the patient’s medical records. The age-specific incidence of both types of lesions was assessed for 6 age groups: &lt;20 years, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60+ years. We then analyzed the differences in the age distribution between the two groups.</p>
<p>To investigate the characteristics of the lesions, the location of the lesion, lesion size, containment, number of lesions, and combined intra-articular lesions were identified. The location of the lesion, containment, number of lesions, and concomitant intra-articular lesions were assessed using preoperative MRI scans and determined finally by arthroscopic surgery. The location of the lesion was categorized as anteromedial, centromedial, posteromedial, anterolateral, centrolateral, and posterolateral. To measure the lesion size, we used a method previously described by Choi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472976">5</xref></sup> From the preoperative MRI, the lesion size was measured independently by a single observer who did not participate in the treatment and who was blinded to the purpose of this study. In addition, lesions were categorized according to size as lesions that were less than 150 mm<sup>2</sup>. A lesion greater than 150 mm<sup>2</sup> was defined as the defect cutoff size for the optimal identification of poor clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472976">5</xref></sup> Lesions were classified as an uncontained or contained lesion. An uncontained lesion was defined as a shoulder lesion, which involves the shoulder of the talar dome and, as a result, lacks a stable border of articular cartilage at the site of marrow stimulation, whereas a contained lesion had a stable rim of articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472976">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We used the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472976">15</xref></sup> to evaluate clinical outcomes and assessed the level of pain using the visual analog scale (VAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472976">23</xref></sup> Clinical evaluations were performed before and after the operation. Patients who underwent osteochondral transplantation as a further operation were then identified.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512472976">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The senior author (J.W.L.) participated in all of the arthroscopic procedures, and all procedures were performed in a standardized manner. After routine arthroscopic examination, the lesion was evaluated along the surrounding cartilage and underlying bone, and all unstable and damaged cartilage in the lesion was debrided, including the calcified layer down to the subchondral bone plate. A microfracture awl (Linvatec, Largo, Florida) was then used to make multiple holes in the defect, 3 to 4 mm apart, in areas where the subchondral bone was intact. For areas with subchondral bone loss, abrasion arthroplasty was performed with a ring-shaped or curved curette. Associated lesions, such as a subchondral cyst, anterior spur in the distal tibia, loose body, soft tissue impingement, and tibial chondral lesion, were identified and treated at the same time. After surgery, patients were allowed to bear weight as tolerated, and high-impact sports were limited for 12 weeks.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546512472976">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18 software (18.0.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). All continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Student <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted for the comparison of continuous variables between the osteochondral and chondral groups, and paired <italic>t</italic> tests were performed for the evaluation of changes in preoperative and postoperative values. Either χ<sup>2</sup> tests or Fisher exact tests were used to compare nominal variables between the two groups. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the independent factors (age, sex, and type of OLT) affecting BMI. χ<sup>2</sup> tests were also used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the differences in associated intra-articular lesions between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess demographic factors associated with subchondral cysts and soft tissue impingement, and ORs were calculated with 95% CIs. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>There were 184 men and 114 women, with a mean age of 40 years (range, 14-78 years) at the time of operation. In the chondral group, 82.4% (n = 173) underwent a microfracture, and 17.6% (n = 37) underwent abrasion arthroplasty. In the osteochondral group, microfracture and abrasion arthroplasty were carried out in 47.7% (n = 42) and 52.3% (n = 46), respectively. The average follow-up period was 52 months (range, 24-132 months). Demographics, duration of symptoms, history of trauma, and BMI of both groups are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472976">Table 1</xref>. The percentages of patients in each of the 6 age groups and the mean age of patients in both groups are also presented. Mean age was significantly greater in the chondral group in comparison with the osteochondral group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and age distribution showed a distinctive difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512472976">Figure 2</xref>). The chondral group reached its peak age in the 50s, which had the largest percentage of patients at 27.6% (n = 58), and patients in their 40s were the next largest at 24.8% (n = 52). The chondral-type lesions were more frequent with advancing age. On the other hand, the osteochondral group showed peak distributions for patients in their 20s and teens at 50.0% (n = 44) and 20.5% (n = 18), respectively. This distribution decreased as age increased.</p>

<p>Other significant differences regarding demographics found between the groups were duration of symptoms and BMI. The average duration of symptoms was greater in the chondral group (28.3 months; range, 7-240 months) than in the osteochondral group (14.4 months; range, 8-120 months) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The mean preoperative BMI was 24.5 ± 2.7 in the chondral group (range, 16.6-33.7) and 23.1 ± 3.2 in the osteochondral group (range, 17.7-34.3) (<italic>P</italic> = .001). However, a multiple regression analysis revealed that age (β = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and sex (β = 2.16, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) had a relationship with BMI (<italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, <italic>r</italic> = 0.37, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the type of OLT was not related to BMI.</p>
<p>No statistically significant differences were found with respect to sex, history of trauma, and follow-up period. There were predominately more male patients in both groups. They comprised 59.5% of the patients (n = 125) in the chondral group and 67.0% (n = 59) in the osteochondral group (<italic>P =</italic> .220). The majority of patients in both groups had a history of trauma. In the chondral group, 71.4% (n = 150) had a history of trauma, and 75.0% (n = 66) in the osteochondral group had a history of trauma (<italic>P</italic> = .529). The mean follow-up was 49.8 months (range, 24-132 months) for the chondral group and 56.5 months (range, 24-132 months) for the osteochondral group (<italic>P</italic> = .118).</p>

<title>Characteristics of Lesions</title>
<p>Characteristics of lesions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512472976">Table 2</xref>. The average lesion size was 98.2 ± 52.8 mm<sup>2</sup> in the chondral group and 99.2 ± 57.9 mm<sup>2</sup> in the osteochondral group (<italic>P</italic> = .890). The size of the lesion was &lt;150 mm<sup>2</sup> in 84.3% (n = 177) of patients in the chondral group and 83.0% (n = 73) of patients in the osteochondral group (<italic>P =</italic> .873). Among 6 locations of the lesion, the most commonly affected sites were the posteromedial talar dome, which accounted for 47.6% (n = 100) of the chondral group and 55.7% (n = 49) of the osteochondral group (<italic>P =</italic> .643). When comparing the medial and lateral lesions, medial lesions were more common than lateral lesions in both groups: 78.1% (n = 164) of the chondral group and 78.4% (n = 69) of the osteochondral group had medial lesions (<italic>P</italic> = .952). Contained lesions were 50.0% (n = 105) of the chondral group and 48.9% (n = 43) of the osteochondral group (<italic>P</italic> = .858).

<title>Associated Intra-articular Lesion by Type of Lesion</title>
<p>We were able to identify subchondral cysts, anterior spurs in the distal tibia, loose bodies, soft tissue impingement, and chondral lesions in the tibial plafond as combined intra-articular lesions using preoperative MRI scans and arthroscopic surgery. Among all the patients, soft tissue impingement (64.4%, n = 192) was the most frequently identified intra-articular lesion, followed by anterior spurs (21.5%, n = 64), subchondral cysts (19.5%, n = 58), and loose bodies (13.8%, n = 41), in that order.</p>
<p>Chi-square tests were used to compare the frequency of the associated intra-articular lesions between the groups. Among the combined intra-articular lesions, subchondral cysts and soft tissue impingement showed statistically different frequencies between groups, and subchondral cysts differed the most (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512472976">Table 3</xref>). Subchondral cysts (OR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.61-8.55; <italic>P =</italic> .001) and soft tissue impingement (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.10-3.03; <italic>P</italic> = .021) were more frequently present in the chondral group compared with the osteochondral group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although there is a possibility that the clinical outcomes and characteristics of lesions may be different between the chondral and osteochondral types, only a few studies have investigated the differences between the two types, and these studies enrolled a small number of patients. Consequently, we sought to compare the chondral type of lesion to the osteochondral type with regard to the clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of the lesions among a relatively large number of patients.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the two groups for mean age, age-specific incidence of both types, duration of symptoms, BMI, and associated intra-articular lesions. The mean age of the chondral type was significantly greater than that of the osteochondral type. The chondral type showed its peak age in the 50s, and its incidence increased with advanced age until the 50s. On the other hand, the osteochondral type had a peak distribution for patients in their 20s and decreased as age increased after the 20s. It has been described in the literature that the degree of skeletal maturity has a strong influence on where failure occurs in osteochondral lesions. In mature human joints, the plane of separation occurs between the well-defined calcified and uncalcified interface (ie, along the tidemark, leaving the osteochondral junction undisturbed), whereas in immature human joints, failures primarily occur in the bony tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472976">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472976">17</xref></sup> In addition, previous clinical observations have indicated that osteochondral separations are an injury affecting predominantly adolescents and young adults, while chondral separations are most commonly seen in the third decade of life, and the incidence thereof decreases with increasing age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472976">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472976">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472976">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref></sup> However, our results did not entirely coincide with the results of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472976">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472976">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref></sup> in that the chondral type increased with age until the 50s and had a peak distribution for patients in their 50s. However, the fact that the osteochondral type was dominant in adolescents and young adults was in accordance with these previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472976">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472976">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In our study, duration of symptoms and BMI were significantly different demographic factors between both groups, and both of them were greater in the chondral type than the osteochondral type. Traumatic cartilage injuries are categorized as a chondral-separated lesion, osteochondral-separated lesion, or blunt trauma damage, which can lead to bruising and softening of the cartilage. Even though blunt damage of the cartilage can either heal or remain asymptomatic, separation can occur between the chondral and subchondral layers by repetitive external stress or degenerative process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472976">22</xref></sup> Therefore, the development from blunt damage of the cartilage to a chondral lesion can require a lot of time. This may be another reason why the mean age and duration of symptoms were greater in the chondral type rather than osteochondral type. Multiple regression analysis in the present study showed that BMI was associated with age and sex, whereas the type of OLT was not related with it. Therefore, the difference in mean BMI between the two groups could be owing to a difference in mean age between groups.</p>
<p>We compared associated intra-articular lesions between the two types of lesions. Subchondral cysts and soft tissue impingement were more frequently present in the chondral type. The cause of subchondral cysts has not been established, and various causes may affect subchondral cyst formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472976">9</xref></sup> Monden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472976">18</xref></sup> reported that subchondral cysts were observed in 20.7% of their chondral-separated types, and our results showed that 24.3% of the chondral types had subchondral cysts. They have described that the bone sclerosis area formed in the subchondral layer, then microcysts occurred in the sclerotic area, followed by a gathering of the microcysts that led to the formation of a honeycomb, and finally, the honeycomb evolved into a single large cyst. They also mentioned that, in some cases, the bone went through a degenerative process and cysts formed, but in other cases, reparative processes occurred. In our study, the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subchondral cysts were associated with no history of trauma and duration of symptoms. This may support the idea that suchchondral cysts develop by a degenerative process. Subchondral cysts can take a significant amount of time to develop by degenerative changes. This is one possible explanation as to why subchondral cysts were more common in the chondral type: the mean duration of symptoms was greater than the osteochondral type.</p>
<p>Chuckpaiwong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472976">6</xref></sup> reported that soft tissue scar impingement was observed in 46.7% of their 105 OLTs, and Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472976">5</xref></sup> indicated that soft tissue impingement was found in 70.8% of their 120 OLTs. In the present study, soft tissue impingement was identified in 64.4% (n = 192) of the 298 OLTs. Soft tissue impingement lesions of the ankle usually occur as a result of synovial or capsular irritation secondary to traumatic injuries like ankle sprains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472976">10</xref></sup> In our study, even though there was no significant difference between the chondral and the osteochondral type in terms of history of trauma, soft tissue impingement was more common in the chondral type than the osteochondral type. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify demographic factors affecting the incidence of soft tissue impingement and demonstrated that only the patient’s age was associated with soft tissue impingement. This seems to be the reason why soft tissue impingement was more frequently observed in the chondral type because the mean age was significantly greater in the chondral type. In previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472976">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512472976">21</xref></sup> about soft tissue impingement of the ankle, the patients’ ages ranged from 31 to 33 years, whereas the average age of the patients with soft tissue impingement in our study was 41 years. However, there is a limitation in comparing the mean age between the above-mentioned studies and our study because the inclusion criteria for each of the studies were different. In the previously mentioned studies, patients with OLTs were excluded from the study group. Therefore, we suggest that further studies be performed to identify the relationship between patient age and soft tissue impingement.</p>
<p>In this study, we used marrow-stimulating procedures, including microfracture and abrasion arthroplasty, to treat chondral or osteochondral lesions. The VAS and AOFAS scores were used to compare the clinical outcomes of the chondral and osteochondral types after the procedure. We achieved successful results in both types, and the differences in all the clinical outcomes between the two types were insignificant. Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472976">5</xref></sup> investigated prognostic factors, including the patient’s age, duration of symptoms, trauma, associated lesions, location of lesions, depth of lesions, and defect size, in OLTs and suggested that initial defect size is an important prognostic factor. They also suggested a cutoff point of approximately 150 mm<sup>2</sup> to assess the risk of clinical failure in defect areas. However, other prognostic factors measured did not significantly influence clinical outcomes. Chuckpaiwong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472976">6</xref></sup> noted that excellent results were obtained in patients with OLT sizes smaller than 15 mm. They also reported that age, BMI, duration of symptoms, history of trauma, and presence of osteophytes were individually and significantly correlated with negative outcomes. Cuttica et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472976">7</xref></sup> found sex, BMI, OLT location, cystic nature of the lesion, and mechanism of injury not to be statistically significant predictors of a poor outcome, whereas OLTs greater than 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> and uncontained lesions were associated with inferior outcomes. They also described increasing age (up to 33 years) to be associated with inferior outcomes but stated that aging did not predispose patients to poor outcomes for patients older than 33 years. In summary, lesion size is the most important prognostic factor of clinical outcomes, whereas an associated intra-articular lesion is not a significant prognostic factor. Additionally, age, duration of symptoms, and BMI remain controversial in their association with clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>In our study, associated intra-articular lesions, the patient’s age, duration of symptoms, and BMI were significantly different between groups; however, lesion size did not differ significantly between them. This may be the reason why we found no significant difference between the clinical outcomes of the two types. On the other hand, we believe that our results support the findings of previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472976">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472976">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472976">7</xref></sup> which reported that patient’s age, duration of symptoms, and BMI are not significant predictors.</p>
<p>One limitation of the present study is its retrospective design; however, we comprehensively compared all patients’ clinical outcomes, demographics, and characteristics of lesions between the two types of lesions. This comprehensive comparison was not performed in previous studies. In addition, age-specific incidence of both types of lesions showed different patterns compared with previous clinical studies. Although we surveyed a relatively large number of patients compared with other clinical studies, we cannot suggest that our results are more reliable than others. We expect that this ongoing study will contribute to the identification of a more reliable age distribution for each type of lesion in the future because the number of patients will increase with time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, differences were found with age distribution, duration of symptoms, and combined intra-articular lesions between the osteochondral- and chondral-type lesions of OLTs in our study. The chondral type showed its peak age to be in the 50s, and its incidence increased with advancing age until the 50s. The osteochondral type had a peak distribution for patients in their 20s and decreased as age increased after the 20s. The duration of symptoms was greater in the chondral type than the osteochondral type. With regard to the characteristics of the lesions, differences only existed in the combined intra-articular lesions between the two types. Subchondral cysts and soft tissue impingement were more frequently present in the chondral type. We achieved similar successful clinical outcomes in both types using marrow stimulating procedures including microfracture and abrasion arthroplasty.</p>
