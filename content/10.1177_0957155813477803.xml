<abstract>
<p>‘The “exceptional” nature of the French cultural and political tradition’, as scholar Catherine Raissiguier sees it ‘resides … in its ability to foreground a strong discourse of universal inclusion and equality along with its unique resistance to acknowledging exclusionary and discriminatory discourses and practices both in its past and in its present’ (2010: 1). In keeping with Raissiguier’s conceptualisation, <italic>les contrôles au faciès</italic> (which translates as ‘racial profiling’) fit squarely within this model at this moment when politicised discourse racialises diversity and defines it as a threat to personal and national security. The French Republican model functions in this context as an authoritarian mode of assimilation and universalism that seeks to destroy difference at the expense of equality and inclusion. These ‘controls’ are only, however, the surface of a deeper and more insidious problem in French society that continues to go misnamed and thus mishandled: race.</p>

<p>And, if you trust me … I will ensure that each of my fellow countrymen is respected not suspected, based solely on appearances. I will fight not against identity controls, which are necessary. I will fight against ‘racial profiling’, which is unacceptable. I will fight against all discrimination, discrimination due to age, colour, origins, or neighbourhood as well as sexual orientation.

<p>By abandoning the use of stop forms during an identity control, the maverick at Place Beauvau [a reference to Manual Valls, Minister of the Interior] buries a third promise of candidate Hollande. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477803">Géraud and Tassel, 2012</xref>)</p>
<p>The unfortunate statements by the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior in the last few days must not be allowed to overshadow the lived reality of those who suffer abusive identity controls. Identity check reform is urgent, necessary, and realistic, indeed bound to improve the efficiency of police controls, said the eight organizations [listed]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155813477803">GISTI et al., 2012</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155813477803">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>On 11 April 2012, lawyers in France filed a groundbreaking civil lawsuit on behalf of 15 people, ranging in age and professions. These individuals all claim that they were stopped by French police, not for anything they had done, but rather for how they ‘look’, or, perhaps more accurately, who and what they are perceived to be. All claimants are Arab or black, and all but one a French citizen. This first-ever class action alleges racial profiling against the Ministry of the Interior and, by extension, the institution central to the lawsuit for which that Ministry is responsible: the French police force. In part, this pioneering lawsuit stands not only to establish a recourse procedure for existing and future victims of abusive police controls, but also, and more importantly, to set a much-needed legal precedent on racial discrimination specific to policing practices where no such measure currently exists.</p>
<p>These 15 claimants are, however, only the legal face of a long-denied and volcanic problem in the French Republic, which has essentially gone misnamed and thereby mishandled by the state. This potentially includes President François Hollande’s new administration, by dint of its swift backpedalling on the use of stop forms by police to document the details of identity controls (an issue to which I will return). As listed in the third epigraph, such a measure, one of many proposed by civil society organisations, aimed at reducing discrimination and improving policing practices, enjoys the support of powerful voices in the French system of justice who, through this lawsuit, have weighed in on this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957155813477803">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this context, the word ‘racial’ in the English translation of ‘un contrôle au faciès’ is somewhat deceptive since race (and its idiom) in France remains a highly taboo concept and word, expunged from political discourse and rare in everyday use. Race is implied in ‘un contrôle au faciès’, which refers to an identity control or stop-and-search by law enforcement, but one ostensibly motivated by ‘appearance’, primarily skin colour. Stigmatised clothing styles, associated with ‘youth culture’, are also incorporated in this definition and serve to accentuate or designate affiliation with undesired groups. Chief among them is ‘Hip Hop attire’, and/or what is perceived as such – clothing that is all the same a racialised variable in France as elsewhere. According to often cited studies by social scientists and human rights groups:
<disp-quote>
<p>data show that blacks were between 3.3 and 11.5 times more likely than whites to be stopped; while Arabs were stopped between 1.8 and 14.8 more times than whites. The study also found a strong relationship between people’s ethnicity, particular styles of clothing worn by young people, and the likelihood that they would be stopped. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155813477803">Jobard and Lévy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155813477803">Human Rights Watch, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further, during a public lecture on these findings, sociologist René Lévy spoke about more nuanced outcomes, noted in their study of police controls in Paris. While differences, he states, are not great between groups, when it comes to stops <italic>and</italic> searches, he highlights, nonetheless, an important distinction with respect to black people, suggesting an anti-black specificity to these practices: ‘Blacks and Arabs tend to be frisked more frequently than Whites’, argues Lévy, ‘but when we look at who’s taken away, Blacks are more frequently taken away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155813477803">Lévy, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957155813477803">3</xref></sup> Moreover, findings from this study show that these stops seldom result in actionable offences, calling into question their effectiveness, their intent and certainly their motivation.</p>
<p>Stop-and-search practices, targeting people of colour and of demonised im/migration are pervasive in (but hardly unique to) the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957155813477803">4</xref></sup> And, as it stands, no EU country, outside the United Kingdom and a few pilot sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Spain, has a viable system in place to record or track who is stopped and why, let alone document racial profiling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957155813477803">5</xref></sup> In the EU, racial profiling is illegal, is considered to violate people’s fundamental rights, and, as the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights further shows, ‘discriminatory profiling has a damaging social effect, as it may destroy minorities’ trust in the police, and in fair treatment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957155813477803">European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957155813477803">6</xref></sup> But that is not the only thing damaged by the violation of people’s fundamental and human rights, as lessons of the past remind us. What is ultimately damaged is society writ large when repressive and racialised practices go unchecked, only to transform into repressive laws or, worse, ‘necropolitics’, to borrow from political scientist and historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477803">Achille Mbembe (2003)</xref>. In so doing, as he argues, ‘the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477803">2003</xref>: 11), or who experiences social death – selectively applied – a recipe for fascism. In light of the above, it is nothing short of startling that the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU, which ‘for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and <italic>human rights</italic> in Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957155813477803">Nobel Peace Prize website, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With this lawsuit, the burden of proof shifts to the Ministry of the Interior, headed by Socialist Manuel Valls, to show that the disproportionate stop-and-searches of Arab and black men, youths, and at times children, is motivated by something other than race or its equally constructed proxy, ethnicity. Valls’ decision, supported by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, to abandon a key reform they had originally supported – specifically stop forms – amounts to a betrayal of the very populations persecuted by this practice. These are the very people residing in the French outer cities to whom Holland repeatedly stated his promise to fight against the ‘contrôle au faciès’, indeed people who also voted largely for him during the presidential elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155813477803">Hollande, 2012a</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477803">Fessard, 2012</xref>). The Valls/Ayrault decision gives considerable pause and raises a number of troubling questions about a lack of state and police transparency that their decision seems to reinforce. That is, when they publicly accept and then abruptly reject a measure opposed largely by conservative police unions – more importantly, one that could produce a paper trail of statistical data potentially proving racial discrimination by the Ministry’s police force – they give the impression that this is the same old politics as before, just packaged a little differently. After all, why reject stop forms outright, when in pilot studies in Spain, for instance, they appear to have had a favourable effect on improving policing practices? Why bury such a reform before carrying out even a pilot study in France, something advocated by the former head of the Socialist Party and mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, who offered Lille as a testing site, as have other mayors. Why kill the stop form <italic>before</italic> the release of the long-awaited report on police–public relations and identity controls by the independent constitutional authority (<italic>le défenseur des droits</italic>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477803">Dominique Baudis (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>This point appeared not to be lost on Baudis in his report, which was released to the public on 15 October 2012, in which he cites key statements made by Ayrault during his televised interview on France 2’s <italic>Des parole et des actes</italic> programme which aired just weeks before on 27 September 2012. Baudis notes Ayrault’s acknowledgement of the many claims of ‘racial’ profiling that Baudis’ office received in addition to Ayrault’s admission of a ‘real problem’, causing ‘un sentiment de mal’. But then Baudis calls into question (perhaps unwittingly) the very legitimacy of his statements and, with it, his premature decision when highlighting Ayrault’s self-incriminating statement that ‘Dominique BAUDIS will make his own proposals. <italic>And then</italic> with Manuel VALLS we shall decide how to proceed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477803">Baudis, 2012</xref>: 31, emphasis mine).</p>
<p>Baudis’ report is not a comprehensive analysis of police profiling or police controls in France, nor could it be without more quantitative data and a national-level study that Baudis actually advocates. Rather, it attempts to assess how police controls impact already eroded public–police relations, and, for the interests of this article, evaluate the viability of stop form use in the French context. One may remember that in April 2012 the Socialists had originally acted quickly in calling for this very measure, only to run headlong into politically conservative police unions, hostile to this initiative. In a highly mediatised response, one union spokesperson publicly denounced stop form use as stigmatising and ‘racist’, while ferociously denying the existence of profiling by French police. Shortly afterwards, Ayrault and Valls would moonwalk away from this measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957155813477803">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a way, Baudis is joining that dance by sending a mixed message about stop forms, which the media presents as a total rejection, though he endorses some form of documentation issued by law enforcement agencies to those whom they control. In reviewing the evidence from the perspectives of the principal players – the legal community, human rights associations, grassroots groups and the police – Baudis acknowledges the benefits of stop forms in countries where they have effectively contributed to the reduction of disproportionate stops of ethno-racialised groups as well as the improvement of police practices, thereby improving public–police relations. However, he also makes plain that simply reproducing models such as those in the UK, the US and Spain is impossible in France, which goes to the heart of the issue and explains why racial profiling continues to be misdiagnosed in French society: the absence of a concept of race (discussed below). Unlike in the models cited, which are not perfect, the ethno-racial dossiers created from ethno-racial data generated in these sites violate principles laid down in the French constitution. In short, these methods are unconstitutional in France since officially documenting ‘racial’ profiling by the state would also necessitate documenting race, socially defined, and the consequences of its use.</p>
<p>In his closing remarks, Baudis rightly recognises that stop forms alone cannot solve the problems of discriminatory police controls at the time a control happens. However, and again, the studies that he cites, which presumably inform his opinion, suggest the very opposite and provide compelling proof of the existence of discrimination that is <italic>racial</italic> in France. He does, however, support experimenting with forms in controlled settings, provided such testing is preceded by formal police training and better community awareness. In so doing, Baudis also offers a face-saving escape to Ayrault’s and Valls’ potential torpedoing of Hollande’s campaign promise that carries real and symbolic significance not only for the populations targeted but also the French Republic’s ideals of equality. ‘The stop form solution appears, by its material effects, to be a method for reducing the number of controls’, states Baudis, ‘and therefore the number of abusive controls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477803">Baudis, 2012</xref>: 51). However, such an admission also reads as an endorsement of stop forms, as proposed by its advocates. And, as has been the case throughout this debate, the public is left once again with very mixed messages that only contribute to eroding further confidence in Baudis’ office, the state, its institutions and its ideals. Moreover, people racially profiled are simply expected to wait while their country figures out that it has a real race problem, one that it lacks the political will to address and which it simply does not know how to tackle.</p>
<p>Hollande’s administration also continues to face harsh criticism from conservative parties for being soft on crime (<italic>laxisme</italic>), and the Valls/Ayrault decision to renounce stop forms – also made in an electoral context (i.e. the past presidential and legislative and upcoming local elections) – strongly appears to capitulate to those very accusations, but at the expense of the Socialist’s Party’s traditional base in ways that recall the past. Starting from the late 1990s through the electric 2002 presidential campaign, the then Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin faced a similar charge of being lax on crime from the self-proclaimed law-and-order political party, headed by President Jacques Chirac. In a climate of public insecurity, already saturated by media-assisted discourses from ‘crime experts’ of catastrophic sub/urban violence and juvenile delinquency overtaking France, Jospin’s political miscalculation to counter that view entailed adopting the same repressive measures advocated by the Right, in particular zero-tolerance policies of police profiling, random controls, harsh frisking and detainment. Not only would Jospin ultimately end up alienating further the populations that the Socialists supposedly represented, he would also lose the first-round vote in the election to the extreme-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen in what was a stunning defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957155813477803">Wacquant, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155813477803">Keaton, 2006</xref>). With this backdrop, that trailblazing lawsuit against racial profiling points to major social change in French society, and in so doing, it also lays bare the non-exceptionalism of the Republican model whose principles operate more like a barrier to inclusion rather than a means for its attainment.</p>
<sec id="section1-0957155813477803">
<title>The ‘French exception’ – the ‘race exception’: warring ideas in a racialised society</title>
<p>That French history, culture and politics are distinctive or ‘exceptional’ is of course debatable. However, the idea and influence of the ‘French exception’ should not be underestimated in French society. Forged by Jacobin revolutionary ideology, its mainstay is a powerful and interpellative discourse of universalism that cements French citizenship to France’s principle of equality and thereby to ethno-racial, religious and social indistinction. The “‘exceptional’ nature of the French cultural and political tradition’, as social scientist Catherine Raissiguier sees it, ‘resides rather in its ability to foreground a strong discourse of universal inclusion and equality along with its unique resistance to acknowledging exclusionary and discriminatory discourses and practices both in its past and in its present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957155813477803">2010</xref>: 1). In keeping with Raissiguier’s framing of ‘the French exception’, police profiling becomes both accepted and desired in an era of in/security whose intensity only mounts with the certain death of the providential state at the hands of neoliberalism. The acceptability and normativity of repressive measures to preserve ‘the French exception’ is reinforced by increasingly unwanted immigrants (a code for Africans, more precisely Muslims) whose presence, once politicised, represents a cultural and religious menace to an authoritarian conception of assimilation and universalism, indeed one that seeks not to accommodate difference but rather to destroy it. During the 2 May 2012 presidential debates, the incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy made this point painfully clear during his heated exchange with then candidate François Hollande about immigrants’ right to vote:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know very well that immigrants’ right to vote is not intended for Canadians or Americans. It is chiefly intended for what is the reality of immigration in France: African immigration, from North Africa, from sub-Saharan Africa. If you give the right to vote to immigrants, with the communitarian politics that we see happening today and every day, with these elections, there will be identity- and community-based demands: separate hours for women and men at the public swimming pools, differentiated menus at the public cafeterias, and separate doctors for men and women in the hospitals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957155813477803"><italic>Le Monde</italic>, 2012</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Social problems have been effectively redefined in terms of personal and national threats, engendering what sociologist Loïc Wacquant calls ‘the law-and-order snare’, whereby zero-tolerance measures and aggressive street policing become the solution to diversity/multiculturalism, poverty and conditions of social exclusion, all criminalised in France:
<disp-quote>
<p>In France, the intensification of policing centred on deterrence through the multiplication of means, measures, and points of surveillance and repression, initiated by Jean-Pierre Chevênement and bolstered later by Nicolas Sarkozy, has similarly [to the US] eroded legitimacy of the law and inflamed relations between the police and marginalized youths from the declining urban periphery. And they have everywhere swollen the national prison system well beyond its capacity to process and warehouse scofflaws. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0957155813477803">Wacquant, 2009</xref>: 279)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the one hand, targeted profiling is held to be in the interest of homeland security against enemies from without (e.g. ‘terrorists’ and unwanted im/migrants), and, on the other, homeland insecurity necessitates this practice because of enemies from within, even when they are French (e.g. outer-city ‘delinquents’ of African origin and, if Muslim, home-grown ‘terrorists’ in the making). As historian Mamadou Diouf illuminates further, the limitations of ‘the French exception’ are laid bare by ‘disaffected immigrants and their descendants’ who have become the embodiment of a ‘mal français’: that is, ‘the various and changing ways in which the French public and political leadership constitute their anguish and fears about French identity’, and thereby about the promises and ideals of the Republic:
<disp-quote>
<p>In one fell swoop, they are denied the material, emotional, and political benefits of the grand victories of the very modernity to which they have to submit, all the while being made the manifestation of a dysfunction and disorder that threaten the survival of French society. Migrants, new generations of French citizens of colour, and in particular those of Islamic confession are perceived, indeed <italic>constituted</italic> simultaneously, as a demographic, health, cultural, and religious threat that multiplies like vermin, at a vertiginous speed … In French society they become those who are the carriers of all maladies … In the courts of politicized public opinion, their cultural and religious practices are blamed for surreptitiously introducing cruel and barbaric traditions into a sanitized French society beyond reproach. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155813477803">Diouf, 2012</xref>: 33–5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957155813477803">Thomas, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ultimately, racial profiling renders ‘the French exception’ meaningless, if not France’s conception of citizenship. The subtlest of examples, uttered in a split second, can be quite revealing, as happened during journalist Harry Roselmack’s televised special, <italic>Derrière les murs de la cité</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957155813477803">2009</xref>). During this arguably investigative report on life in the French suburbs, Roselmack, who is black himself, interviews a group of young black men hanging out in their neighbourhood about how they are publically perceived. In so doing, he articulates that ‘mal français’, which sees these youth as threats and anything but French: ‘I don’t know if you realise it, but you are the ones that a lot of French people fear!’ In specifying <italic>French people</italic> in his statement, Roselmack also expresses a classic form of everyday racialised discrimination, which misrecognises that these persons may be French too.</p>
<p>All this brings to mind another telling example from the 2009–10 National Identity Debate in France, which appeared around the time of crucial regional elections and on the internet homepage of the conservative party, Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP). On one panel of the page, we see an image of five young men strolling along a sidewalk on an overcast day in what appears to be an urban neighbourhood. Their backs are to the camera, obscuring their faces, but three of them are visibly black. They all appear to be wearing traditional jeans or khakis, complemented by a simple dark-coloured jacket, except one who is wearing a hoodie. What’s striking is the caption written on the image in large white letters: ‘Juvenile Delinquency: Put an End to Naïve Optimism’. At the top of the opposite panel is posed the question central to the National Identity Debate: ‘What does it mean to be French today?’ Just under it is a white marble bust of Marianne, a national emblem of France, who appears to embody the answer to that question. Following outcries of anti-black racism from the CRAN, the UMP pulled the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155813477803"><italic>Le Monde</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Over my many years of research in France, I have all too often witnessed and experienced racial profiling, which is not limited to the police. The ever-familiar, green-suited fare controllers of every origin in the metro and security guards (typically large black men) holding vigil at the entrance of supermarkets and department stores are notorious racial profilers who perfectly illustrate how hegemony relies upon consent. In May 2012, while in Paris teaching a course, my 25-year-old Ghanaian graduate instructor (who looks no older than 16) was violently stopped in the metro at the Bastille when returning to her residence, following a dinner with me and a colleague. While a first for her, racial profiling is a naturalised practice in France that often starts at an early age. This was saliently expressed by a black French university student in 2011 via email, a young man who captures the often-neglected emotional costs of this stigmatising form of public humiliation. I use his text as a stimulus in interviews to prompt others to speak about their personal experiences, and who, irrespective of gender or age, nodded their heads in agreement when reading his text, which at times was punctuated by exclamatory remarks in reference to lines that particularly resonated:
<disp-quote>
<p>If during most of my day, I can get by without thinking about the fact that I am black, there are always places that, like a smack in the face, remind me of that fact. For me, places of business most often trigger that effect. Each time that I step into a small shop or a supermarket, I feel as though I appear suspicious. It is a feeling that is systematically triggered, and while I don’t have eyes in the back of my head, I still feel a sense of guilt though, obviously, I haven’t done anything to feel guilty about. When I was between the ages of 8 and 12, my parents would send me to the supermarket for daily errands. I knew all of the store employees, and all of them were nice to me, except the security guard. Even though I was a loyal customer, he remained suspicious of me, and this was not without an effect … whatever the place, the people I am with, or the way I am dressed, I always feel that there is a halo of suspicion that surrounds me, so much so that, when I was young, on several occasions, I decided to buy worthless and unnecessary things rather than leave without buying anything in order to lessen the risk of being labelled a thief … Now, many supermarkets are equipped with anti-theft gates and surveillance cameras, but why do I still have to leave my bag at the customer service desk, which is sometimes unattended, when other customers are not asked to do so?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within the scope of French slavery, colonialism, war, occupation and solicited postcolonial immigration, racial profiling is nothing new, nor is the idea of race or racism in French society. Nonetheless, formidable barriers to the recognition of race are firmly aligned with the ‘French exception’, coupled with living memories and fears of reviving past abuses from the Nazi/Vichy era when ascriptive race, documented in government files, determined life or death. Those government decision-makers and stakeholders who reject the stop form with race or ethnicity indicated nod to this history as a partial explanation of their opposition. The other reason for opposition is somewhat academic, in that classifying the French population racially is simply incompatible with the Republican model. Any attempt to document ‘un contrôle au faciès’ ethno-racially also places that measure squarely within the already explosive debates about ethno-racial statistics in France, with no winners in sight. Sociologist Michel Wieviorka reinforces this point: ‘If you mention “ethnic” or “racial” statistics to a French person’, he argues ‘he or she will consider you to be a racist. The French do not consider “race” as a social construction, they consider it to be a physical definition of human groups, and will not accept it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957155813477803">Wieviorka, 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477803">Simon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957155813477803">Simon et al., 2008</xref>). Here ‘French person’ applies to all origins, as people of colour also reject generating ethno-racial statistics, including SOS Racisme (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957155813477803">Union des Étudiants Juifs en France/SOS Racisme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957155813477803">Sabbagh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>But how can profiling that <italic>is</italic> actually racial be identified in race-blind countries without a social concept of race: that is, one in which race (and its proxies) is understood as a social construct or invention that has real effects, and one that shifts as historical and social contexts shift in a society? Moreover, how, in the pursuit of justice and equality, can the pernicious effects of thinking and classification in racial terms be avoided when using such a concept? Not only does race-blindness deny the obvious, but when it is law or policy, deprived of historical context, it strips anti-racists of the rhetorical weapons they need to battle racial oppression. The current differentialist discourse of ‘anti-white racism’ against people of colour pursued in the French courts and deployed by politicians exemplifies this point. As a rhetorical strategy, referred to as ‘retortion’, it ‘rests on borrowed points and ideas from other, opposing ideological and political quarters, and it seeks to change their discourse around so as to defeat its initial purpose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957155813477803">Taguieff, 1999</xref>: 302).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0957155813477803">8</xref></sup> Ultimately, in the debate on race in France, what we are left with is only the exterior of the house and no way to show its interior design.</p>

<title>Stop les contrôles au faciès!</title>
<p>As someone who has a police officer in her family, my aim is not to demonise the police, who serve an important function in society, nor is that the aim of those who have mobilised against racial profiling in France. To do so is to err in the wrong direction while missing the crucial point. Racial profiling is at best hypocritical in France when placed alongside its principles and ideals, and it is illegal, as well as a violation of fundamental rights. These rights are established by the constitution and reinforced by the European Union’s Racial Equality Directive, ‘the most important piece of EU legislation combating racial/ethnic discrimination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155813477803">European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2012</xref>), of which France is a signatory. France is also, lest we forget, a founding member of the European Union. Nor should it be forgotten that racial profiling led to the 2005 revolts in France, following the deaths of 17-year-old Zyed Benna and 15-year-old Bouna Traoré who mistook a transformer in a power station as a safe haven and were horribly electrocuted when fleeing from an imminent police control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155813477803">Keaton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155813477803">Fassin, 2011</xref>). These tragic events also drew international and mainstream light to what grassroots NGOs and those profiled had been decrying for years and, again, for which there has been no statistical data to support their claims and on whom the burden of proof rests. Enter the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI) and their collaborative study (2012) that produced actual quantitative data that mirrored lived reality.</p>
<p>But to make a legal challenge meant that affidavits would be needed as well as a campaign to bring the specific issue of abusive controls by the police to the mainstream public and those victimised by this practice who may not know that they have rights that were being violated. For this critical phase, foot soldiers were needed who already knew the terrain and understood the crushing sense of powerlessness and anger that accompanies identity checks, particularly those made into spectacle or sport by law enforcement. The expression ‘se faire faire le triangle’ by youth stopped and controlled (in every sense of the term) illustrates such humiliation: that is, of being forced against a wall, arms raised and legs spread in the form of a triangle while being patted down in public, including on their genitals. Activists on the ground had to directly engage a statistically invisible population in France and sensitise them, at times on the spot, to the discriminatory nature of being singled out. This was no small feat when confronted with a practice deemed normative and natural by those subjected to it, particularly outer-city youth who, when speaking with activists on the ground, said that they thought it was normal or that they must have done something, even when they had not.</p>
<p>While the activism which made possible that potentially game-changing lawsuit brought together, in ways sui generis, multiple spheres of influence – human rights groups, academics, judges, lawyers, empathetic police, politicians and grassroots activists – the NGO Stop le contrôle au faciès is worth singling out for its innovative public awareness campaign and strategies to encourage those profiled to speak out. It is also important to acknowledge Tara Dickman, one of the critical founding members of Stop le contrôle au faciès, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes of this action (see Stop le contrôle au faciès website). Central to their interventions were what they referred to as a ‘maraude’, a type of fieldwork carried out by members of recognised anti-racism associations, such the la Brigade Anti-négrophobie and L’Association collectif liberté égalité fraternité ensemble unis (ACLEFEU), in neighbourhoods, spaces and places targeted by the police (see details on the website). The goal was not simply to speak to individuals but also to teach them how to document what the state precisely fails to do. On one side of a business-size card, distributed during a ‘maraude’, are succinct directions for how to document an abusive control, and on the other is a hotline number where people can report the details of their stop. While this seemingly simple item, easily distributed and easily used by its recipient in a cell phone culture, yielded precious data, the ‘maraude’ made a powerful statement to youth in particular that it was in their interests and also possible to fight back (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477803">Bickerstaff, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0957155813477803">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is perhaps the most innovative dimension of their activism is a two-season YouTube series by filmmaker Ladji Real, entitled <italic>My First Identity Control</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957155813477803">2011</xref>). Reaching an international audience, the first season features a variety of French Hip Hop artists who vividly recount, indeed relive, their first experience being stopped by the French police. Similar to the previously mentioned university student profiled while shopping, these acts of violence, which are not apprehended as such, have left indelible memories, and for some indelible scars. The next season, also available on their extensive website, focuses on celebrities, such as Lilian Thuram, the former soccer star now philanthropist, as well as everyday people who, in sharing their stories, denaturalise state-sponsored everyday racism while serving as models for others to join the struggle.</p>

<title>Commencement, not conclusion</title>
<p>OSJI lawyer–activist Lanna Hollo, a key figure in the class action lawsuit, disabuses all illusions about the racial character of profiling in France:
<disp-quote>
<p>The claimants are all black or North African men who were stopped by police because of what they look like rather than what they did. This is racial, or ethnic profiling, constituting discrimination which is illegal according to the French Constitution and international law. (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477803">Hollo and Neild, 2012</xref>)</p>

<p>With the Trayvon Martin case, the issue of racial profiling in the United States was in the media spotlight, though it has been and continues to be a poorly addressed, endemic form of everyday and institutional racism for those subjected to it. The case of New York over-exemplifies this fact, as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957155813477803">New York Civil Liberties Union (2012)</xref> notes, where the stop-and-frisk of innocent, predominately black and Latino New Yorkers has numbered over four million by some estimates since 2002.

<p>Drawing upon established procedures in the UK for police controls, the Open Society Initiative, with the help of the EU, worked closely with police forces in Bulgaria, Spain and Hungary to introduce stop forms as part of several measures aimed at improving police practices. According to their findings, they were able to reduce the disproportionate stops of racialised groups in significant areas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477803">Neild, 2011</xref>). In the UK, unlike other countries in the EU, the generation of ethno-racial data by the state is not prohibited by law.</p>

<p>Though based on self-reports, the survey on racial discrimination in France by the Conseil Représentatif des Associations Noires (CRAN) and the Trajectoires et Origines (TeO) study, co-directed by Patrick Simon and his colleagues at the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED) and the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) are interesting as they were given provisional consent to do so by the Conseil Constitutionnel provided that they strike any questions about skin colour and did not maintain traceable files of their participants. The TeO team was nevertheless allowed to ask informants what they believed accounted for the discrimination that they suffered. According to these researchers’ preliminary findings, ‘The motives cited were first origins (or nationality) and skin colour (57 per cent and 17 per cent), then sex and age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957155813477803">Simon et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957155813477803">Keaton, 2010</xref>).</p>
