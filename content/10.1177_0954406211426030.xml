<abstract>
<p>Bearing strength and fatigue life of pin-loaded glass fibre-reinforced plastics (GFRP) with various interference-fit (<italic>I</italic>) percentages are experimentally investigated. Stainless steel pins with interference-fits ranging from 0 per cent to 2 per cent are inserted into vacuum infusion-processed GFRP. After pin installation, damage in the composite hole is observed. The quasi-static and fatigue properties of the pin-loaded composites with interference-fits (<italic>I</italic> = 0.6 per cent, 1 per cent, and 2 per cent) are then compared to samples with transition-fit (<italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent). The experimental results showed that interference-fit of 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent improved bearing strength slightly and fatigue life significantly when compared with transition-fit of 0 per cent. Bearing strength was decreased with 2 per cent interference-fit due to GFRP damage induced during pin installation. The sample with <italic>I</italic> = 0.6 per cent attains the longest fatigue life and provides the most reliable results, with the least amount of scatter.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211426030" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Composite materials have revolutionized the way that designers tackle complex engineering problems. Manufacturers from almost all fields have incorporated composites into designs for everything from boats to aircraft, cars, automobiles, and wind turbine blades [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211426030">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211426030">4</xref></bold>]. The difficulty with incorporating composites lies in joining material sections together. Composite joints can be created by adhesion or by mechanical fastening using bolts or fasteners [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211426030">5</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211426030">13</xref></bold>]. Adhesion offers many advantages over mechanical fastening such as high strength-to-weight ratio, electrical/thermal insulation, increased conductivity, and corrosion/fatigue resistance [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211426030">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211426030">6</xref></bold>]. Mechanical fastening with a pin is a common method of composite joining due to its low cost, simplicity, reliability, less environmental/ageing sensitivity, and ease of repair/replacement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211426030">7</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211426030">13</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The fit between the pin and the hole is one of the key parameters that help to determine the strength of pin-joined composites. According to ISO286, the fit ranges can be divided into clearance, transition, and interference. A clearance fit results in limits of size that assure clearance between assembled mating parts. Interference-fit has limits of size that always result in interference between mating parts. Most former researchers have followed an interference per cent theory (<inline-formula id="ilm10954406211426030"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0954406211426030"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), where <italic>D<sub>P</sub></italic> denotes the pin diameter and <inline-formula id="ilm30954406211426030"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-0954406211426030"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the hole diameter, in order to define the amount of interference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211426030">11</xref></bold>]. A transition fit is either a slight clearance or interference-fit. In general, designers utilized clearance fit for the composite materials, because interference-fit joining may cause severe damage around the hole which reduces overall joint strength [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211426030">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211426030">15</xref></bold>]. However, clearance-fit pins, in all cases, lead to higher stress concentrations, severe wear at large load frequencies, and thermal degradation due to friction when a stress ratio is negative, since the contact area of the pin does not react with the entire radius of the drilled hole. In addition, clearance fit pins allow moisture intrusion and escape, which limit their use in many applications where fluids must be contained either to prevent leaks and spills, or to prevent the composite itself from absorbing moisture which causes increased inter-laminar degradation. Some studies have shown the benefits of interference-fit pins on the composite joints [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211426030">16</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426030">19</xref></bold>]. Interference-fits are especially effective for single-shear joints due to their ability to reduce fastener tipping and through-the-thickness stress gradients. Application of interference-fit pins into composites reduces the magnitude of the local oscillatory stress components under dynamic loadings, resulting in improved fatigue life [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211426030">17</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211426030">18</xref></bold>]. Recently, Kiral [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426030">19</xref></bold>] reported that the use of interference-fit was beneficial in building the static strength of the pin-joined glass fibre-reinforced plastics (GFRP). Although some benefits of interference-fit pins have been studied for the strength of composite joints reported, the experimental studies concerning fatigue enhancement of interference-fit pin-loaded composite holes are very limited.</p>
<p>This study aims to investigate the effect of interference-fit on fatigue life of pin-joined GFRP. The interference per cent ranges from 0 per cent to 2 per cent when the pin diameter is consistent at 6.35 mm. Stainless steel pins with interference-fits were mechanically inserted into vacuum-infusion processed GFRP. All test specimens have consistent width-to-diameter (<italic>W</italic>/<italic>D</italic> = 4) and edge distance-to-diameter (<italic>E</italic>/<italic>D</italic> = 3) ratios in order to minimize the effect of specimen geometries on failure modes and strengths. Bearing strength and fatigue life of the pin-loaded GFRP with various interference-fit per cent values were experimentally investigated. Damage in the composite holes was observed using an optical microscope. Fractography and failure mode of the joints are discussed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211426030"><title>2.1 Material systems</title>
<p>Test specimens with an average thickness of 2.648 mm were fabricated utilizing the vacuum infusion process with 28 mm Hg or 0.94 atm of vacuum pressure applied at room temperature. The laminate having 70.72 per cent fibre volume fraction consists of non-crimp fabric E-glass fibres (Vectorply E-LTM 3610) and epoxy vinyl ester matrix (Derakane Momentum 411-200) with a ply orientation of [<italic>M</italic>/90/0]<sub>2</sub>, where <italic>M</italic> denotes a mat layer of randomly oriented chopped fibres with approximately 0.25 mm thickness after curing.

<sec id="sec4-0954406211426030"><title>2.2 Pin insertion process</title>
<p>In this study, a double-lap, single-pin joints were considered for experiments. All the specimens have the same dimensions which were taken from ASTM D 953, where the specimen dimensions <italic>L</italic> + <italic>E</italic>, <italic>W</italic>, and <italic>t</italic> are the length, the width, and the thickness of the specimen, respectively, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211426030">Fig. 1</xref>. In order to prevent failure in modes other than bearing [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211426030">20</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211426030">21</xref></bold>], <italic>W</italic>/<italic>D</italic><sub>p</sub> was chosen as 4. Approximately, 50 specimens are prepared for all the tests. In order to create joints with various interference-fit percentages in the composite specimens, the hole diameter or <italic>D</italic><sub>p</sub> was chosen in the range from 6.2475 to 6.3500 mm, while the standard dowel pin was consistent with the diameter of 6.3525 mm. Dowel pin material is of 18-8 stainless steel and its average length was chosen as 38.1 mm. The pins are slightly chamfered at each end, so that driving them in causes much less damage to the composite material.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211426030" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Shape of bearing test specimens (mm)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426030-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The hole in the composite materials was created by undersize drilling and then reaming to desired finished dimensions with a computer numerical controlled milling machine (Mini-Mill, HAAS, USA). A solid carbide slow spiral drill bit with 5.953 mm was employed to create an undersized hole in the specimen. Drill spindle speed and feed were set to 5200 r/min and 0.0762 mm/r, respectively. Straight flute high-speed steel reamers were then used to bring the hole to the required finished size. An intermediate 6.096 mm reamer was used before reaming to the final hole size for all the specimens tested. Reamer speeds of 1200 r/min with a feed of 0.0508 mm/r proved to work very efficiently with prolonged tool life. Flood coolant was used to remove debris, provide cooling, and lubrication. Hole quality parameters including hole size, hole cylindricity, and perpendicularity were assessed using a CMM (Gage 2000, Brown &amp; Sharpe Co., USA) after reaming.</p>
<p>Interference-fit (<italic>I</italic>) percentages between 0 per cent and 2 per cent were obtained. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211426030">Figure 2</xref> shows the hole diameter distribution for each interference-fit. For <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent, hole diameter was 6.3513 ± 0.0047 mm whereas the pin diameter was 6.3525 ± 0.0030 mm. This is a typical transition-fit. The hole diameter was obtained as 6.3135 ± 0.0098 mm at interference-fit of 0.6 per cent. When interference-fit becomes 1 per cent, the hole diameter becomes 6.2862 ± 0.0062 mm. Finally, the hole diameter is 6.2050 ± 0.0065 at interference-fit 2 per cent.

<p>A tension and compression testing machine (Model 4482, Instron, USA) was used to insert the pins into the composite holes. Fixtures were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211426030">Fig. 3</xref>) which allow the pin to be pressed, with extreme accuracy, into the hole. The composite specimen is first centred below the pin using a ball gauge. Then, the specimen is clamped using vise grips 50 mm behind the hole. A pin is inserted into the upper fixture, which has a hole diameter 6.375 mm and depth 19.05 mm in its centre. The pin is inserted at a rate of 1 mm/min for a distance of 20 mm. This allows enough pin protrusion for quasi-static and fatigue testing, and simulates the distance an average bolt would have to travel through the material into a structure below to fully engage a nut or a nut-plate.
<fig id="fig3-0954406211426030" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Pin insertion fixture and photo of pin installation process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426030-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211426030"><title>2.3 Mechanical property test procedures</title>
<p>Quasi-static tests were performed in accordance with ASTM D 953. The tension and compression testing frame was utilized at a speed of 1 mm/min in the tensile direction. Data samples were taken at 20 points per second.</p>
<p>Fatigue testing is used to determine the expected lifespan of a component subjected to sine-wave-type loading. Fatigue tests were conducted on an Instron universal testing machine (Model 8802, Instron, USA) with 250 kN capacity. This test assembly has hydraulically controlled grips which can clamp either flat or round stock. In fatigue tests, a load or stress controlled test was accomplished on the specimen. The stress ratio (<italic>R</italic> = minimum stress/maximum stress) was set as 0.1 and the loading frequency 10 Hz. Displacement <italic>versus</italic> load data were obtained for the pin in each of the fatigue tests accomplished. The displacement–load data were acquired at 200 Hz, which is equivalent to 20 data points per load cycle. Fatigue failure cycle was defined when a pin hole deformation equals 4 per cent of the original pin diameter [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211426030">20</xref></bold>]. The controller was set up with a displacement limit of 1 mm. This corresponds to a displacement of roughly 16 per cent of the pin diameter, and allows for a test stoppage point for failure analysis. The maximum fatigue stress (<italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub> = 172 MPa) applied during fatigue testing was determined by 80 per cent of the static bearing strength which yields an average life expectancy greater than 10 000 cycles for the baseline transition fit (<italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent) specimens. If a test specimen did not fail at 10 <sup>6</sup> stress cycles, which means the pin was not displaced by 1 mm after undergoing 10 <sup>6</sup> stress cycles, then the test was suspended and that specimen was considered a run-out [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211426030">20</xref></bold>].</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211426030"><title>3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211426030"><title>3.1 Pin installation process analysis</title>
<p>The force required to drive the stainless steel pin into the undersize hole was measured and recorded on a tensile and compression testing machine. Typical load–displacement curves from experiments were created for each interference-fit percentage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211426030">Fig. 4</xref>. When the pin travels through the hole, insertion load increases until it hits a maximum value. As the pin progresses through the composite specimen, the friction forces build, leading to an increase in force necessary to continue inserting the pin. Maximum insertion load was obtained as the pin exited the hole in the bottom of the specimen. It can be seen that the graph quickly drops as the head of the pin exits the composite. The slope of the graph then becomes very linear and decreases as the insertion distance increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211426030">Fig. 4</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-0954406211426030" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Typical load <italic>versus</italic> displacement pin insertion force for each interference-fit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211426030-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It can be clearly seen that the load necessary to insert the pin increases with increasing interference-fit per cent. When <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent, it is a transition-fit with an average of 0.12 kN for the maximum pin insertion force. As interference-fit per cent increases to 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent, the average maximum pin insertion forces become 0.81 and 1.10 kN, respectively. When 2 per cent interference-fit was applied, the average maximum pin insertion force reached 1.35 kN. Notice that the load–displacement curves of <italic>I</italic> = 2 per cent has multiple peaks, which reflect local composite failures during the pin installation process. The maximum insertion force data (kN) are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211426030">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Hole quality, before and after the pin installation process, was assessed using an optical microscope (Model MM-40, Nikon, Japan) with a digital readout device (Quadra-Chek 200, USA). The sample was sectioned along the centre-line of the pin in the loading direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211426030">Figure 5(a)</xref> demonstrates the quality of the hole after drilling and reaming. The hole surface is overall smooth; however, it contains minor damages such as fibre pull-outs and matrix damage after drilling [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211426030">18</xref></bold>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211426030">Figure 5(a)</xref>, fibre breakage was found in the 0° lamina, while matrix fracture and fibre de-bonding were observed in the 90° lamina. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211426030">Figure 5(b)</xref> displays a 1 per cent interference-fit pin-loaded specimen, which has been sectioned. Fibre bending, which ran parallel to the pin insertion direction, occurred in the 0° lamina. However, it is seen that fibre bending is recovered due to removal of the pin during mechanical sectioning of the composite. It is observed that 0° and 90° plies of the <italic>I</italic> = 1 per cent sample show more damage than the <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent sample. Depth of 90° ply collapse is close to 45 µm, which is near to the amount of interference-fit. Hole surface bears not only the compressive force, but also the transverse force that originates from the frictional shear force between the pin and hole surface [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211426030">22</xref></bold>]. Matrix fracture and fibre de-bonding in the 90° lamina were created as the pin progressed through the hole. Damage in the 90° lamina is caused due to early matrix failure, which is caused by the head of the pin dragging through the composite, and the displacement of the 0° fibres into the 90° lamina which dislodges fibres and matrix material. The mat laminae, which are matrix-rich and directionally random, tend to readily deform and allow the pin to pass without showing any major signs of damage.

<sec id="sec8-0954406211426030"><title>3.2 Bearing strength analysis</title>
<p>Bearing strength tests were performed on the specimens with interference-fit percentages, up to 2 per cent. The specimen’s width-to-diameter (<italic>W</italic>/<italic>D</italic>) equals 4 and edge distance-to-diameter (<italic>E</italic>/<italic>D</italic>) equals 3; therefore, failure modes in net tension, shear-out, and cleavage-tension were not expected to be found in any specimens [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211426030">20</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211426030">21</xref></bold>]. Indeed, only bearing failure modes were found for all the specimens and interference-fit per cent did not change the failure modes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211426030">Figure 6</xref> shows typical bearing stress-pin displacement curves for each interference-fit percentage. Interference-fit percentage affects the slope of the curves (joint stiffness per unit bearing area) and the maximum load points (bearing strength). The joint stiffness per unit bearing area can be defined as the slope of the linear portion of the stress-deformation curve and is a measure of the rigidity of the joint [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211426030">23</xref></bold>]. Maximum bearing stress was defined as the applied maximum load divided by the bearing area, defined by the diameter of the pin multiplied by the thickness of the specimen [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211426030">24</xref></bold>]. Samples reach a higher maximum load as interference-fit increases, up to 1 per cent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211426030">Figure 6</xref> demonstrates that the curves with higher transition-fit percentages have larger joint stiffness per unit bearing area. This shows that the interference-fit pin actually increases the stiffness of the joint, while providing a decrease in the stress concentration forces in the vicinity of the hole [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211426030">11</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211426030">18</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426030">19</xref></bold>]. This translates into gains in ultimate bearing strength and panel stiffness. In the case of 2 per cent interference-fit, bearing strength decreases and the slope changes in the mid-section of pin displacement–bearing stress curve. It is considered that this phenomenon is induced by damage during pin insertion with an excess amount of interference-fit.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211426030">Table 3</xref> shows the average maximum bearing strength and joint stiffness per unit bearing area for all the samples tested. A recent study shows that small gains, approximately 3 per cent, in bearing strength are found due to the use of interference-fit fasteners when both <italic>W</italic>/<italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>/<italic>D</italic> are set as 4 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426030">19</xref></bold>]. This study shows similar results too. Small improvements in bearing strength are found as interference-fit is increased in the case of 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent. Average bearing strength of <italic>I</italic> = 1 per cent sample shows approximately 6 per cent higher than that of <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent sample. When interference-fit is close to 2 per cent, bearing failure occurred at lower stress level with lower pin displacement than other samples. This is mainly due to its excess amount of interference-fit, which imposed significant damage around the hole. Even though small improvements in bearing strength are found in <italic>I</italic> = 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent, bearing strength data of 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent are more scattered when compared with <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent sample. This may be due to locally damaged specimens with high interference-fit percentage. Even with possible local damage on the joints, interference-fit does not degrade the performance of the composite joints under static loading, especially when kept under 1 per cent. This means that for situations which require a leak proof or locating fastener hole, small interference-fit percentages can be confidently used.

Fractography from the specimens with various interference-fits was found to be almost identical after quasi-static tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211426030">Fig. 7</xref>, there is kink-band formation at the inside 0° layer and shear matrix cracking in the 90° layer. Delamination can also be seen at the ouside 0° layer. In general, the failure progression works as follows. Splitting and delamination of outer layers in interference-fit joint decrease the stiffness of surface region. Because the weak surface cannot support the expansion of damage, the damaged area expands easily. Shear matrix cracks are then originated in the 90° and mat layers by increased force due to the weakness of outer layers. Finally, the kinking, which is occuring in the 0° layer, is expected to become a source to the final failure morphology [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211426030">22</xref></bold>].

<p>Interference-fit specimens ranging from 0 per cent to 1 per cent are considered during fatigue life assessment. It is observed that 2 per cent of interference-fit tends to destroy the composite hole upon pin insertion, which resulted in the degradation of the composite joint strength even under static loading. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211426030">Figure 8</xref> shows the number of cycles to failure for each sample. The baseline sample, <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent, showed the average of 43 423 cycles to failure. Note that all specimens failed. It is apparent that an increase in interference-fit per cent greatly improves the fatigue life. The specimens with <italic>I</italic> = 0.6 per cent attain the longest fatigue life with the least amount of scatter. Out of four fatigue specimens, two specimens survived up to 10 <sup>6</sup> cycles, while only other specimens failed at 150 457 cycles and 817 256 cycles. When interference-fit percentage becomes 1 per cent, still some specimens did not fail until 10 <sup>6</sup> cycles. However, some specimens of <italic>I</italic> = 1 per cent failed sooner than average fatigue life of <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent specimens. Interference-fit of 1 per cent possesses signs of scatter, which perform either extremely well, attaining infinite fatigue life, or poorly when noticeable composite hole damage is induced during pin installation.

The load is defined by the boundaries <italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>min</sub>. The displacement of the pin was minimal at <italic>S</italic><sub>min</sub> and it increases until the fatigue loading reaches at <italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub>. The range in the pin displacement is defined as the difference between minimum and maximum displacements of the pin during each cycle as the pin moves through the composite specimen. The initial range of pin displacement in fatigue test is similar to the range found in quasi-static test as shown in the initial cycle range measurement, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954406211426030">Table 4</xref>. Note that the displacement necessary to achieve <italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub> for <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent samples is greater than those for 0.6 per cent or 1 per cent, which points to the fact that the interference-fit samples becomes stiffened by the pin. This may be due to local pre-compression stresses induced by inference-fit [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211426030">19</xref></bold>]. Local pre-compression stresses in the vicinity of a hole reduce the magnitude of the tensile stress during fatigue loading, which leads to reduction of pin displacement. In other words, the compressed fibres due to interference-fit resisted the pin movement along the load direction.

<p>As fatigue damage is expanded in the matrix and at the pin boundary, the range of pin displacement increases. It means that the pin needs to displace further to reach the constant <italic>S</italic><sub>max</sub> when fatigue damage exists. Therefore, the range of pin displacement can be a good indicator to determine the fatigue resistance of the specimen. The specimens with <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent shows rapid increase in the range of pin displacement. When interference-fit is applied, the range of pin displacement slowly increases over the fatigue cycles. This means that local pre-compression stresses imposed by interference-fit slow down composite damage growth over the fatigue cycles, which delays the fracture of the specimens.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211426030">Figure 10</xref> shows the mechanically sectioned hole surface of the fatigue specimens after test. Overall, failure mechanisms for <italic>I</italic> = 0 per cent specimens in fatigue loading are very similar to those found in quasi-static testing. There is kink-band formation at the inside 0° layer and several shear matrix cracks in the 90° layer, along with delamination at the outside layer as in the tensile cases. The outer layers of the composite tend to bend and delaminate away from the centre. The central laminae generally fail in end crushing, brushing, and kink-band formation. In the case of the run-out specimen with <italic>I</italic> = 0.6 per cent, it was found that a small amount of fibre breakage occurred in the inner 0° layer. However, there were no kinks, shear matrix cracks, or major delaminations found. It can be explained that the compressed fibres due to interference-fit resisted the pin movement along the load direction and hindered fatigue damage propagation during the fatigue test.

<sec id="sec10-0954406211426030"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In order to investigate benefits of the interference-fits, an experimental study was carried out on a pin-loaded GFRP laminate. Four conditions of fits, 0 per cent transition-fit, interference-fits of 0.6 per cent, 1 per cent, and 2 per cent, were applied to the pin-loaded joints. The study is summarized as follows:
<list id="list1-0954406211426030" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Interference-fit over 1 per cent may induce damages around the hole during the pin installation process; 0.6 per cent of interference-fit is considered to create minimal damage to GFRP holes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of 2 per cent interference-fit, bearing strength decreased due to a great deal of damage during pin installation. However, average bearing strength was slightly improved after insertion of interference-fit pin up to 1 per cent. Larger bearing strength deviation was found at the interference-fit joined samples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pin-loaded joints of GFRP laminate with 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent of interference-fit showed enhanced fatigue life than 0 per cent of transition-fit. Half of interference-fit pin-loaded specimens survived up to 10 <sup>6</sup> cycles, while all transition-fit pin-loaded specimens failed at less than 10<sup>5</sup> cycles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pin displacement necessary to achieve maximum applied stress for 0 per cent of interference-fit specimens is greater than for 0.6 per cent or 1 per cent, which means that interference-fit stiffened the joint. This may be due to local pre-compression stresses induced by inference-fit, which delays damage growth during fatigue loadings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 0.6 per cent of interference-fit sample attains the longest fatigue life and provides the most reliable results, with the least amount of scatter. Interference-fit of 1 per cent may be a little excess because the specimens perform either extremely well, attaining infinite fatigue life, or poorly due to the damage induced during the pin installation. In the drilling and pin insertion processes, damage including fibre breakage, matrix fracture, and fibre de-bonding on the GFRP hole surface is observed. After quasi-static and fatigue tests, similar failure mechanisms are observed. Splitting and delamination are found in the outer layers; shear matrix cracks occur at 90° and mat layers. A kink band occurred in the inner 0° layers. In the case of 0.6 per cent of interference-fit specimen, which survived up to 10 <sup>6</sup> fatigue cycle, significant damage is not observed on the hole surface.</p></list-item>
