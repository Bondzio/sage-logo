<p>Election night was sweet—the thrill of watching true champions like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren swept into office and the at least equal satisfaction of watching Todd Akin, Allen West, and Tommy Thompson go down to well-deserved defeat. But what does it all mean?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what the election does <italic>not</italic> mean is that “Americans have voted to reject the Ryan austerity agenda” or anything so hopefully definitive. A 52–48 verdict is not a declaration of the people’s will.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>We should not delude ourselves into believing it was a choice between one evil guy and one guy who, if we work him right, could turn out to be really great.</italic></bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The election is also not a signal that we should now dedicate ourselves to “holding the President accountable.” We cannot hold Obama accountable because he is not, in fact, accountable to us. He raised $1 billion for his election, and most of it was not from us. Furthermore, everyone knows we are not going anywhere; a Republican victory would be so disastrous for the country that we know it cannot be risked just for the sake of rebuking Obama.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1095796012471629">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was a choice for the lesser of two evils. Having won, we should not delude ourselves into believing it was a choice between one evil guy and one guy who, if we work him right, could turn out to be really great. What we won is four more years of the same crappy, disappointing government we had before—no more, no less.</p>
<p>So what can the election tell us about the voters, the parties, and the way forward for labor?</p>
<p>Understanding the electorate begins with understanding the moment we are living in. America is an empire in decline. In the bottom two-thirds of the labor market—where jobs do not require a college degree—things have been getting slowly but steadily worse for forty years. And few people see a way out—only 14 percent of Americans believe the current generation of children will grow up to do better than their parents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1095796012471629">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Long-term economic decline produces widespread fear, anxiety, resentment, and rage. This creates a politics that is combustible and unstable. Anger is voiced in many directions: against the banks and insurance companies, against public employees, and against immigrants. The country’s economic elite is working hard to ensure that resentment is directed at someone other than them, but this is not a force that is easily controlled. So we get contradictory results: 55 percent of Montanans voted for Romney, but 75 percent voted to undo corporate personhood. Large majorities think both that “big government” is a problem and that the country’s wealth should be much more evenly distributed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1095796012471629">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The country is in a bad mood—and legitimately so. What political form that takes is up for grabs. Our task, obviously, is to help people find the clarity and courage to direct their anger at those truly responsible for the misery.</p>
<sec id="section1-1095796012471629">
<title>The Republicans’ Self-Made Trap</title>
<p>In 2010, Dylan Loewe published a book titled <italic>Permanently Blue</italic>, promising that “the Democratic Party is poised to secure a permanent majority.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1095796012471629">4</xref></sup> When it appeared, at the peak of the Tea Party’s momentum, its thesis seemed preposterous. But the book’s data are surprisingly convincing. Latinos constitute the single largest growing ethnic group in the country, and more than two-thirds are Obama supporters; young voters, eighteen to thirty years old, are significantly more liberal than their parents—and every year, 4 million more of them join the rolls; population is shifting from rural areas to more cosmopolitan suburbs, turning places like Virginia and North Carolina into swing states; and women continue to prefer Democrats by wide margins. “Simply put,” Loewe concludes, “everywhere America is growing, it is also liberalizing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1095796012471629">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is why Republicans put so much effort into voter suppression: they are combating an ever-rising demographic tide that threatens to swamp the party. But the party’s core strategies for energizing its base make this a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>The conservative movement is multifaceted, but the Grand Old Party (GOP) machinery is ultimately controlled by a small circle of billionaires and multinational corporations. When there is a conflict between the desires of the base and the dictates of the donors, the economic royalty almost always wins out. When pollsters ask Americans if we should sign a new NAFTA-style treaty with Vietnam and Malaysia, for instance, no one is more opposed than self-identified Tea Partiers. Yet despite the supposed clout of this grassroots juggernaut, on this issue the base is rudely ignored; the interests of the Kochs and Waltons trump the nationalism of the rank and file.</p>
<p>The one-percenters control the party, but only by keeping the base engrossed in noneconomic issues. The Kochs, Waltons, and Chambers of Commerce are pursuing an aggressive agenda—including not only antiunionism but also opposition to the minimum wage, paid sick leave, public schooling, retirement security, and affordable health care—that is certain to make life worse for the majority of the country. The central political challenge facing this elite is how to accelerate economic inequality without provoking a political backlash.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the energy of the GOP base has been largely devoted to campaigns against abortion rights, gay marriage, and undocumented immigrants. But now such causes seem likely to backfire. Party operatives can do the math. Thus, Republican Governors Association Chairman Bob McDonnell warns that “looking at how young voters and minority voters are voting,” the GOP faces “an unsustainable trajectory.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1095796012471629">6</xref></sup> Senior Bush advisor Karen Hughes likewise bemoans the alienation of women voters, vowing that “if another Republican man says anything about rape other than it is a horrific, violent crime, I want to personally cut out his tongue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1095796012471629">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>But this is not an easily correctible problem for the corporate powers running the party. They need the social crusades to keep the base energized and avoid the threat of populism. But those same crusades may condemn the party to the political margins. These tensions ultimately spring from the fact that the working-class base is at odds with—or at least not sufficiently excited by—the corporate agenda of those who rule the party. The question for labor is how to exploit these contradictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1095796012471629">
<title>The Limitations of the Democrats</title>
<p>Why can’t the Democrats be the party we wish they were? The simple answer is that they are too dependent on big money.</p>
<p>President Obama’s reelection cost $1 billion; there is simply no way to raise that without being overly dependent on rich people and big business. In 2010, Democratic candidates for the House and the Senate got ten times as much money from corporations as from unions.</p>
<p>My own Representative—Peter DeFazio—is a true progressive champion, and author of the primary proposal to tax Wall Street. But it is easy to attack Wall Street when you are from Oregon; picking a fight with the timber industry would be riskier. Thus, even progressive Democrats may be able to stand up to corporate power in a single industry; but what almost no Democrat can afford to do is challenge the corporate lobbies or employer class as a whole.</p>
<p>This reliance on corporate money renders the party’s message mealy-mouthed and ineffective. Republicans self-consciously fight not just against Democrats but also against the forces they perceive to be behind the Democrats. Grover Norquist famously identified unions, trial lawyers, and big-city political machines as key pillars of the Democratic Party. Republicans then set out to destroy unions, starve local government, and shrink attorneys’ fees through tort reform to destroy the material base of their opponents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1095796012471629">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>In 2010, Democratic candidates for the House and the Senate got ten times as much money from corporations as from unions.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, the Democrats campaign only against Republicans themselves but not against the forces behind them. If they did not need the money, Democrats could launch a campaign against the Chamber of Commerce—holding hearings on a series of bills that expose the contradictions between the corporate funders and working-class base of the conservative movement. For instance, the conservative base hates “free trade.” If Democrats held press events in every district, standing in front of plants that shipped jobs overseas and challenging Republicans to disavow campaign contributions from lobbyists promoting more NAFTAs, legislators would start feeling real pressure. If this was followed by hearings on minimum wage, class size, guest workers, and carried-interest, we might do to the Chamber of Commerce what the right did to ACORN—make it toxic for anyone to take its money.</p>
<p>But Democrats will never take on this fight—partly because on trade issues, Obama’s policy is identical to Bush’s. Instead, they engage in a kind of political Stockholm syndrome, forever seeking opportunities to declare agreement with the very corporate lobbies that stymie their agenda and fund their opponents.</p>
<p>The job of the labor movement is not to remake the Democrats into a better version of themselves. Our job is to do what the Democrats cannot do.</p>

<title>The Way Forward for Labor</title>
<p>I do not believe anyone in the labor movement has a master plan for victory, and this is not one. But the combination of polls, votes, and experience points to several steps unions can take to help move politics forward in 2013 and beyond.</p>
<sec id="section4-1095796012471629">
<title>Focus on the States</title>
<p>The federal government is going to remain politically deadlocked; the most important battles between workers and the corporate lobbies are being fought in the states. Focusing on these battles will allow us to concentrate resources where they can make the most difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1095796012471629">
<title>Put Workplace Organizing at the Center of Our Political Operation</title>
<p>The unique strength of the labor movement is workplace organizing. This is the thing that only unions do, and that provides a unique advantage over the corporate lobbies. This is also the most effective means to actually <italic>change</italic> people’s understanding of the issues. When “paycheck protection” was first proposed—as a 1998 ballot initiative in California—it was supported not only by the public at large but also by a majority of union members, who at first blush thought the idea sounded reasonable. Over a period of months, the labor movement worked hard to explain that the purpose of the proposal was to silence workers’ voice in politics. After the initiative was defeated, a poll was conducted among people who had started off supporting the measure but changed their minds, asking whether they had gotten their primary information about the issue from television, radio, mail, phone, or talking with a coworker. Talking with a coworker was found to be twenty points more effective than any other medium in changing people’s understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>This points to the unique value of workplace organizing as a model for political education. The core principle of union organizing is the belief that people can change; indeed, the work of organizing is almost nothing but that—helping scared people become brave, helping isolated people become unified and divided people find solidarity, helping timid and mild people feel comfortable taking militant action, and changing how people understand the boss, the workplace, and their own collective power. But there is no place for such transformations in traditional electoral campaigns, where voters’ preferences are treated as fixed and campaigns are built on superficial poll-tested buzzwords aimed not at persuading people to think differently about issues but persuading them to associate particular candidates with something they <italic>already</italic> think.</p>
<p>There is good reason such techniques are popular: they often represent the surest path to victory. And when unions face existential threats at the ballot box, winning is the only thing that matters. But for all their obvious pluses, such campaigns do nothing to transform how people think about the economy or build an organization that lasts beyond the election. Therefore, we need to look for more opportunities to run campaigns that play to our advantage by educating workers and building rank-and-file leadership.</p>
<p>As most unions’ political staff come out of electoral politics rather than workplace organizing, they often do not understand a campaign based on internal organizing. To do politics right, then, will require some unions bringing together political and organizing staffs that typically operate on separate tracks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1095796012471629">
<title>Recruit Members to Serve as Public Ambassadors</title>
<p>It is critical for unions to reach out to the broader public by drawing on our key strength—union members. Attacks on public employees in particular are fueled by misleading propaganda about the nature of our work. Thus, 80 percent of Americans think the public school system deserves a grade of “C” or lower but the same number give <italic>their</italic> kid’s school an “A” or “B.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1095796012471629">9</xref></sup> In other words, when people <italic>imagine</italic> schools as corporate lobbyists portray them, they think the worst; when they encounter the reality of schooling up close, they appreciate the work teachers do. If each local union recruited fifty teachers who each committed to giving five presentations to Rotary clubs, church groups, or neighborhood associations—describing in unscripted terms what their job is like—we would begin to establish a more realistic public understanding of teachers’ work. Such an undertaking requires considerable time and resources. But it draws on our strength, and leaves the union with stronger leadership when the campaign is done.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1095796012471629">
<title>Campaign against the Corporate Lobbies</title>
<p>Unions need to do what the Democrats cannot: run campaigns against the corporate lobbies that stand behind the Republicans. As the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) does for the corporate right, we should identify a set of proposals that can be advanced in multiple states. These proposals should meet three tests: they improve life for working people, they help our members, and they drive a wedge into the opposition—exposing the contradictions between the corporate donors and the working-class base of the conservative movement. Each proposal would promote common-sense reforms that benefit the vast majority even if they are unacceptable to the big business lobbies. In this way, each fight moves us forward—especially if we win but even if we lose—by educating the public on the true agenda of the corporate right, and by emphasizing recurring themes of economic justice and political corruption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1095796012471629">
<title>Run Proactive Ballot Initiatives</title>
<p>The best vehicles for carrying out this agenda are ballot initiatives. People choose candidates for a variety of reasons, making it easy for big-money campaigns to focus voters on misleading debates; we have greater ability to connect with voters when the issue is clearly defined. The clearest example of this distinction is the contrast between the failed recall of Scott Walker versus the successful referendum overturning Ohio’s copycat union-busting law.</p>
<p>So, too, it is easier for corporations to buy off legislators but harder to sway the population on well-defined issues. While the outcome of this year’s initiatives is mixed, a number of states passed progressive initiatives that directly contradicted the action of their legislators. In deeply red Idaho, for instance, voters (by wide margins) overturned by referenda laws that the legislature had passed eliminating tenure, instituting “merit” pay based on standardized test scores, and requiring online courses. Similar results were seen in South Dakota, where voters chose by a 2:1 margin to overturn a law that eliminated tenure and instituted “merit” pay. So, too, voters in both North Dakota and Florida overwhelmingly rejected proposals to allow public funding of private religious schools.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>In deeply red Idaho, voters . . . overturned laws that the legislature had passed eliminating tenure and instituting “merit” pay based on standardized test scores.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other issues also suggest grounds where the broad public—including conservative voters—line up against the corporate lobbies. In both Colorado and Montana, voters passed initiatives to overturn the <italic>Citizens United</italic> decision. Several all-red states similarly rejected the ALEC agenda of constitutionally limiting tax increases to lock in recession-era cuts as the new high-water mark for public service budgets. The Florida legislature passed a “Taxpayer Bill of Rights” bill—strictly limiting future budget authority—by a 2:1 margin, but voters overwhelmingly rejected it. In Michigan, voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have required a supermajority for future tax increases, and repealed the “emergency manager” law that let state appointees slash local government budgets and void union contracts. Oregonians rejected a proposal to eliminate the inheritance tax, and voted instead to end a corporate tax break and devote the savings to K-12 education. And local initiatives in both California and New Mexico raised the minimum wage.</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of recent legislative battles is that, while many people sense what the labor movement is against, few can say what we are <italic>for</italic>—what is <italic>our</italic> vision of how the economy should work? Nothing crystallizes an economic vision like a tightly conceived ballot initiative. After two years of defensive fights, many members are hungry to be on the offense—and the polls show fertile ground for defining a proactive agenda. Exit polls showed, for instance, that 60 percent of the country wants to repeal tax cuts for the rich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1095796012471629">10</xref></sup> A referendum might call for undoing these tax breaks—at the state level—and earmarking the money for job creation, universal preschool, or nursing homes for the elderly poor. Ballot campaigns are expensive. But even if the labor movement chose just one state in which to run a proactive initiative, it might galvanize supporters from around the country excited by the chance to fight for <italic>our</italic> vision of a just society.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Nothing crystallizes an economic vision like a tightly conceived ballot initiative.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1095796012471629">
<title>Encourage Occupy</title>
<p>The labor movement needs a political movement to its left. To the extent that Occupy can remain a vital movement, it helps build public support for a progressive agenda, and helps harness public outrage in the most productive direction. As Stephen Lerner has insightfully detailed, unions are not suited to lead Occupy activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1095796012471629">11</xref></sup> The labor movement’s task is to do what the Democrats cannot; Occupy’s task is to do what the labor movement cannot. This means local union leaders should be encouraged to allow member activists to devote themselves to building the Occupy movement—not as an official union undertaking, but as something that the leadership supports even knowing it will remove activists who might otherwise be devoting their energy to class-action grievances or other more traditional union activities. Union leaders should be encouraged to see this as part of a long-term effort to move the country in a more just direction, to build political allies for organized workers, and hopefully to develop leaders who ultimately return to union activism with newfound skills, understandings, and allies.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>The labor movement’s task is to do what the Democrats cannot; Occupy’s task is to do what the labor movement cannot.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is less a “six-point plan” than “six things we can do.” But any of these will hopefully play to our strengths, build our capacity, and respond strategically to the reality of the times we face.</p>
