<abstract>
<p>My daughter was every parent’s dream. She excelled in everything she did. She was the most caring person I have ever known. She died suddenly in her 29th year from pneumonia, from working too hard, from not taking care of herself. This autoethnography, grounded in reflective inquiry, relates my journey in grief. Excerpts from my 858-page grief journal provided the foundation for this research study. Rather than stages of grief, what emerged were way stations in a desert with sails set to <italic>New Normal</italic>: Early Desert, Belly of the Whale, The Shadow of Death, Desert’s Edge, and New Normal. Challenging some long-held notions of the grief process and reinforcing others, this study provides insight borne of a mother’s experience, borne of the pain of loss</p>

<body>
<p>August 12, 2008, the beginning of my journey. I never contacted AAA for a trip tik. I never called the post office to stop my mail. I never arranged the journey at all. I certainly would never have signed up for this journey. No one would. A phone call from a coroner in a city hundreds of miles away hurls me into this journey, a journey that holds me captive, a journey that has opened my eyes to loss . . . and to love, a journey that may never end. The first destination: <italic>Early Desert</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800411433549">
<title>The Early Desert: Shock</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My baby, my sweet, sweet Lorie</p>
<p>Is no more.</p>
<p>Dead. The coroner states,</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Miss, I have some bad news.”</p>
<p>Yes, bad news indeed.</p>
<p>My daughter is dead.</p>
<p>How? We don’t know yet.</p>
<p>But she was alone, all alone.</p>
<p>As I wait for Dan to get home from his class, I am numb,</p>
<p>Broken, shocked, but not dead.</p>
<p>My baby is dead.</p>
<p>She is gone.</p>
<p>Now I must grieve. . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Looking out the window of the airplane, going to collect my sweet angel and bring her home, the clouds swirl as do my thoughts. How am I going to respond when people ask me how many children I have? With delight, I have always answered, “Three.” Then to the next question, “How old are they?” I respond with only two ages followed by, “The last two are twins.” Only now there is just one twin. Sweet Jaime.</p>
<p>Sitting around a table. Listening to the coroner explain how the infection caused her death. Wondering why she didn’t call 911 or tell me when I called her how sick she was so I could call 911. Choosing a funeral home. Seeing my sweet daughter lifeless in a body bag. Carrying her urn through the airport, bringing her home, home to stay. A blur. Numb. Going through the motions. Trying to be strong for my sweet family.</p>
<p>Bereavement. Having someone significant torn from your life. Taken away forever. The term, <italic>bereavement</italic>, means “to be shorn off or torn up” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411433549">Despelder &amp; Strickland, 1987</xref>, p. 206). When someone has been suddenly ripped from your world. An action of immediate severance beyond our control. Something done to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411433549">Dubose, 1997</xref>). This immediate severance has hurled me into an unfamiliar city, an unfamiliar world.</p>
<p>At the morgue. I stand at a distance observing my sweet daughter in a body bag, her father holding her hand, grief stricken, quiet, confusion and despair lining his face. In an astonishingly silent room I observe my daughter’s beautiful red hair cascading from the partially unzipped, black, plastic body bag. Her face and arms, which are folded across her chest, are all that is unveiled; the body bag consumes the rest of her. I stare, frozen to the floor, frozen in time, my mind racing. Should I go over there and take her other hand? I glance around to see if anyone is watching me. What should I do? I can’t make myself cross the room. I stay at a <italic>safe</italic> distance, I tell myself, because I don’t want to remember her that way. Not so. I cannot cross the stark room because I am protecting myself from the reality that my daughter has been taken from me, ripped away. Bereavement takes place outside the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411433549">Dubose, 1997</xref>). Therefore, beyond my control. I can’t go over to Lorie and make her get up to come home with us. I am not ready to accept this rip in my life, that Lorie is gone forever. In shock, I am unable to comprehend the journey that lies ahead, beyond this room, the desert I must cross. So I don’t cross the room . . . I can’t.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We are home now. It really feels like we have been away for weeks. Yet a week ago we were here sleeping with no knowledge that our baby was dying, alone in a cold, hard city [Lorie was a CPA and was sent to New Orleans by her accounting firm as part of the federal effort to help in Katrina’s aftermath]. I try not to focus on those things . . . on what her last moments were like. Was she scared? Was she in pain? Was she calling for me to help? I don’t know. I will never know. I must accept that and quit tormenting myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Grief, the emotional response to bereavement, is one’s emotional reaction to loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411433549">Despelder &amp; Strickland, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411433549">Stroebe, Stroebe, &amp; Hansson, 2008</xref>). What is striking to those who have experienced loss is the severity, depth, and sweep of the experience and how little room is left for living life as usual. In the death of a child, the effects of the loss are pervasive. At conscious and unconscious levels, parents feel partly responsible. This combines with guilt, helplessness, and frustration so that parents are forced into a state of confusion and flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411433549">Freud, 1957</xref>). Responsible, helpless, confused . . . indeed!</p>
<sec id="section2-1077800411433549">
<title>It’s Been a Week. . . .</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everything is surreal. Does that mean surrender to the real? I feel that’s what I am doing. I have no choice. Fighting won’t help. I must surrender. And it is, unfortunately, real. We seem to be okay as long as we plan for the celebration of Lorie’s life. It’s like planning a party for her. Making sure everything is as it should be . . . for my sweet Lorie. So we move toward tomorrow. A celebration of Lorie’s life—of who she really was. Of the promise. Of the hopes and dreams. Hopes and dreams ultimately not realized. I must move now. Still in bed in a quiet home. Holding onto my emotions rather well. Not wanting to break down, yet sometimes knowing I need to.</p>
<p>According to my doctor, therapist, and friends, the stages of grief are denial, anger bargaining, depression, and acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411433549">Kubler-Ross, 1969</xref>). I know I am not in denial. I don’t think I ever was. I know this has happened. I know my baby is no longer with us. Maybe seeing her next to me in a box for so many days sharpened that understanding. Anger. How can I be angry? Whom do I blame? Precious Lorie? Her job? I know what the bargaining stage is. What’s the point of bargaining? There’s no chip here with which to bargain.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yes, Kubler-Ross’s stages of grief. A map. What I am told I must go through to get through. Framed in my mind. Yet clearly not what I am experiencing. Well-meaning, wonderful people remind me that I must go through each stage; it is the healthy thing to do. Yet I know I have skipped over denial, anger, and bargaining and landed right in depression. What does that mean?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411433549">Kubler-Ross (1969)</xref>, working with dying patients, illuminated the final stages that terminal patients experience after learning of their impending death. These stages of death and dying have since been taken out of context and generalized to all types of grief, misrepresented by both the public and the medical community. Unfortunately, I do not realize this until I am far along in my grief journey.</p>
<p>The notion that grief unfolds in predictable patterns over time has been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411433549">Holland, Currier, &amp; Neimeyer, 2006</xref> ). Research has shown that the amount of time following a loss is a relatively weak predictor of one’s level of grief and other related symptoms, such as guilt, anger, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411433549">Holland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411433549">Vezina, Bourque, &amp; Belanger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411433549">Zisook, Devaul, &amp; Click, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411433549">Zisook &amp; Shuchter, 1985</xref>). Recent grief theory has focused on meaning making and other forms of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411433549">Neimeyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411433549">Stroebe, Hansson, Stroebe, &amp; Schut, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>I remain alarmed and saddened that well-meaning professionals treat grieving patients using misinformation. Not only does it not help, but it can also harm. When I realized that I had skipped several steps in the grieving process that my friends, doctor, and therapist insisted were steps everyone should experience, I internalized that I was not grieving correctly. Which I interpreted to mean that I would never get beyond the intense grief I was experiencing. Which compounded my grief. I have become poignantly aware that each person’s grief emerging from loss follows different courses. There are too many variables to come up with a list of stages or phases. Instead of stages or phases, I have embraced the metaphor <italic>journey</italic> that emerged within the first hour of learning of my daughter’s death. It captures my experience of losing my daughter.</p>

<title>The Celebration of a Beautiful Life</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hundreds of people celebrated Lorie’s life with us yesterday. It was a beautiful service. Those who spoke knew the selfless Lorie we knew. It resonated through every speech. A beautiful eulogy for a beautiful soul. Starting tomorrow, I move into a different realm. No longer planning for a celebration. But moving on without all the fanfare and close support. Thank you notes will be one of the first orders of business. There are so many to write—and I look forward to writing each one. Letting people know how much their support has meant and what their love for Lorie means. Friends are checking on me and talking . . . and making me talk. I’d rather write. I need less Kleenex when I write . . .</p>
<p>My cousin wrote me a sweet note. In part she stated that I will always have three children . . . two here, and one somewhere else. How wonderful is that! And it is true. I will always have three daughters. Always.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fourteen days into this journey. In shock. Not comprehending what lies ahead. And not at all prepared for what is to come.</p>

<title>In the Desert: Belly of the Whale</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Where am I? I do not recognize this place. It is dark. It is dank. It is cold. It is barren. Ah, now I remember: I am in the <italic>belly of the whale</italic>. I am reminded of the book, <italic>Dark Nights of the Soul</italic>, I read not long ago that describes this place well, this whale’s belly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jonah gets into the whale when he refuses the call. He sits all alone in the darkness inside the whale meditating, having no control over his situation yet somehow getting somewhere even though he, himself, is not moving but asking questions, deep questions about life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411433549">Moore, 2004</xref>). According to Moore, when someone close to you dies, friends try to comfort you in your grief, but what they don’t know is that your experience is beyond grief. You sense a great rupture throughout your body, throughout your world. Yes, I feel the rupture.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s been a bad day today. I am gasping for breath now. I look at the <italic>things</italic> in my life and am repulsed at how valuable they used to be to me. My grandmother’s Chippendale sofa. Quilts. Things. They mean nothing to me now. And I don’t think they ever will. I know now that my world will never be the same again. The colors are gone. The purpose-driven life I led seems so meaningless now. I am flat. No air. I breathe, but I don’t really want to anymore. I just want to sleep. Sleep long. Sleep hard. Just sleep.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The thank you notes arrive. Looking forward to letting people know how appreciative I am for all they have done, I sit down to write. Before pen can meet paper, I fall to pieces. I literally fall to the floor heaving. Thanking people for their generosity and support is something I really looked forward to doing; but once I realize WHY I am writing the notes, I can’t breathe, much less write. I feel like I should be getting better, but I don’t seem to be doing any better and maybe worse.</p>
<p>I try to stay away from taking medication. Yet my racing heart is wondering whether that is such a good plan. I have lost 8 pounds. I just can’t eat. I don’t think the <italic>New Normal</italic> is getting close. I don’t see normal in my life ever again. What used to seem so important to me is worthless to me now. Totally worthless. I am just going through the motions of living—drinking coffee, watching TV, cleaning the kitchen. But with no purpose. Just motions.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077800411433549">
<title>Ruminative Thoughts Chase Me</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The distant chirping of a smoke alarm in need of a battery chases the silence as I sit alone looking out at the landscape. It is metaphoric for how I am feeling now. Sitting quietly, appreciating nature and the quiet, and then the reminder, the alarm, that nothing is right. If only I could change a battery for everything to be right again. No battery will fix me. No battery will bring Lorie back to me. Sad. So very sad. No joy in any thought. Crazy dreams. One about Lorie—but not with Lorie. Not enough pieces of it left to interpret—just enough to cause <italic>dis-ease</italic>. Grieving is so tiring. Who knew? It swallows everything. I think of something I should be worried about—like teaching—and I realize there is no room to worry about that. All space is taken up with this thing they call grief. Sometimes it consumes me . . . takes my breath away. Guttural sounds emerge from the depths of my being. I want to die.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>No, I don’t want to die. I can’t die now. Not now. I know I must live for my family—and for me. But I know it will never be the same. <italic>New Normal</italic>. I seek that New Normal I have heard about. The New Normal where I don’t collapse; where I don’t feel my heart racing and breaking, where thoughts of Lorie don’t involve <italic>what ifs</italic>. Those are the killers. Negative thoughts. Incessant thoughts that jump in and grab me.</p>
<p>Ruminative thoughts. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411433549">Nolen-Hoeksema (2001)</xref>, ruminative thoughts are characterized by persistent and repetitive, chronic, and passive focus on the occurrence, causes, and consequences of grief-related emotions and symptoms; they are associated with poor adjustment to the loss. The individual repeatedly goes over and over problems and her feelings about these problems without moving into problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411433549">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>). These ruminative thoughts, they chase me.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I awakened at 5:22 to Dan’s [my husband] groan, “Oh, God. . . .” The realization. It hits me every morning. <italic>Oh, God, it wasn’t a dream. Lorie is really gone</italic>. My heart has raced today. The medication has taken the edge off and kept my heart from racing, but I feel <italic>needly</italic>, nervous for some reason. Like my heart is going to burst. A part of me wishes it would. Just take me from this place now—a part of me doesn’t want to live anymore. Some days I just feel like I can’t go on . . . today was one of those days. A part of me died with Lorie. That part that was optimistic, carefree, devoted to work and life’s purpose. I get to wake up tomorrow—remembering all over again that Lorie is gone. Every morning I get to recall that. Ruminative thoughts . . . thoughts that splinter the soul.</p>

<title>Serene in the Belly of the Whale</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s been 7 weeks since Lorie died. The <italic>what ifs</italic> aren’t invading my mind as much anymore. I hope I’ve about exhausted that unproductive line of thought. The <italic>what now?</italic> is coming through in my thoughts. How to live without Lorie in our lives. What does that look like? Depression. I see it as a calmness, a slowing down, taking a deep breath. I never am excited these days, but I am serene. I am quiet in the belly of the whale. I know this desert will be with me for many more months and probably many more years. I will never be as I was. I know that. I have seen too much; I have felt too much; I have lost too much. . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am cognizant that we are doing the only thing we can do right now. We are grieving. It is the hardest thing I have ever done—it takes all my energy every day. I had a dream that my daughters and I were calling Lorie on the phone because we knew she was sick and realized she needed to be with us—that she had sick leave and could get well at home with us taking care of her. When I awakened, it felt real for a second or two. Then the truth crashed in around me. All over again. Each day. You’d think the body would eventually run out of tears, but I have found that tears beget tears. They chase each other down my cheeks as if in some race to the finish. I don’t expect anyone to understand the despair, the profound grief, we are experiencing now. In fact, I hope no other parent ever experiences this, although I know that many more will. For now, we are in the <italic>belly of the whale</italic>, working each day in darkness on our grief in our own way. And we have many more months ahead of us to be in the whale’s belly. We recognize, and accept, that we can’t be there for other things now. So, in darkness, we grieve.</p>

<title>In the Touch of Lorie’s Disappearance</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now I want to get pregnant! Seriously! I want to be pregnant. I want to have a baby, get up in the middle of the night and nurse, tuck in my baby, go to little league games. I raced so to get over that stage of my life—now I just want it back! Rewind. Can we just rewind and let me fix it this time? Please, God? As sick as I know that is, I would get pregnant if I could.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411433549">Cain and Cain (1964)</xref> identified the <italic>replacement child syndrome</italic>. Terming this a <italic>maladaptive response</italic> to child loss, a later child serves as a replacement for the dead child and a truncation of the painful grief process. I take issue with the term <italic>maladaptive</italic>, but that may be due to the fact that I don’t like to see myself as maladapted, maladjusted. How does one adapt in a normal way to the loss of a child? Cry for 3 to 6 months, get up on Day 1 of the 7th month, and all is well in their world? Really? Something was ripped from me suddenly. My wanting to be pregnant was my body and soul’s reaction to a part of me being amputated.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411433549">DuBose (1997)</xref>, what is present as a result of bereavement is a world of absence. I experienced my own <italic>disappearance</italic>, my own awareness of time and place and perspective, in the <italic>touch</italic> of Lorie’s disappearance. The bridesmaid dress hanging empty on the hanger in the closet, the retainer she wore at night suddenly without purpose, the antique brooch a sorority sister gave her that I returned because Lorie is no longer here to wear it or value what it represented. Tangible loss. A ripping away.</p>
<p>A <italic>replacement</italic> child rather than <italic>another</italic> child? Perhaps, but I don’t think so. I wouldn’t have expected another child to fill Lorie’s bridesmaid dress, wear her retainer, or value the brooch. But I would have another child to hold and love if I could, and I would treasure each milestone in that child’s development. I would miss nothing! That’s what I wanted to do when I wanted to be pregnant. Get back the moments I took for granted, that I wished away. I couldn’t wait for the girls to be able to take their own baths; brush their own beautiful, thick, red hair; and sleep through the night. I couldn’t wait. Now . . . now I want it back, all of it.</p>

<title>The Holidays</title>
<p>The holidays have always been special in our family. We all get together, leave work behind, and enjoy our time together as a family for as long as we can take off from our respective jobs. We state what we are thankful for on Thanksgiving; we hang the traditional bells and decorate the tree together on Christmas; we make a toast to the new year, which also happens to be my oldest daughter’s birthday. So the arrival of the holiday season proves particularly difficult this year.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lorie’s death looms large; it fills every molecule around me. I have known it, but now I <italic>know</italic> it. Now I know she isn’t driving here from New Orleans for Thanksgiving, that she won’t toast another Thanksgiving with us. I ache. I feel my life from a third-person point of view. Actually I don’t feel my life except for the grief over my loss. Everything else doesn’t matter. Turkey and dressing—who cares? So I find myself thinking incessantly of Lorie. Of Thanksgiving without her—of all Thanksgivings in the future without her. I just wish my baby were packing to catch a plane to be with us now. Knowing she isn’t is heart breaking—over and over. May God—and Lorie—help me through this Thanksgiving. The table settings get smaller each year. As my heart breaks further.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I dread the arrival of Christmas. The decorations don’t find their way down from the attic. The tree doesn’t materialize either. I don’t think I will ever care about Christmas again— the tree, the decorations . . . the bells. I don’t ever want to see or hear the bells again.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Lorie,</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Christmas Eve . . . our first in 30 years without you. Thirty years ago, I didn’t know you . . . you were a part of me, in utero, but I didn’t know you then, nor did I know there were two of you sharing my womb. This year you will not be here . . . you are someplace else . . . some place without us. I have thought all day about the word faith. It has leapt in several times today, even in the movie we watched tonight. Faith. Do I have faith? Faith that my baby is tucked in tonight? Faith that you are where you need to be? Faith that there is something beyond the here and now? A part of me had faith that if I fixed your room downstairs perfectly that you would come. But you didn’t. Faith. A fool’s belief in miracles? I don’t know. I want to believe. I want to feel you. I NEED to feel you. Tears . . . tears are my pathway to the pain I feel every time I think of you. I want it to STOP! I need you now, sweet baby. Oh, how I need to tuck you into your new room downstairs. How I need that. I love and miss you, little girl,</p>

<p>The new semester commences at the university. My return to the world commences as well. I realize that I am not prepared, and I am not sure I am ready to go back to work. The lake has become the <italic>belly of the whale</italic> for me, a place where I actively grieve. The only place where I can breathe without gasping for air every 25 seconds because I forget to breathe. The place where I can just be. Be with my sweet husband and my sweet Lorie. The place where I can grieve—in the belly of the whale. Not facing well-meaning people who don’t know what to say to me or how to say it. The place where I don’t have to respond to the inane salutation, “Hey, how are you?” The place where tears can erupt without any notice and no one will see them or hear the sobs that follow. No apologies necessary. Although I have taken productive steps out of the <italic>belly of the whale</italic>, I haven’t left like I will tomorrow, shifting my focus from my grief to teaching. Even though I am not sure I am ready, I know it’s time.</p>
<p>A big step. Leaving the belly of the whale, returning to life. But not out of the desert, not even close.</p>

<title>In the Desert: The Shadow of Death</title>
<p>It’s been 5 months since I started this journey, since Lorie died. Yesterday. A lifetime. I wish I could feel her spirit around me. I pray to feel her with me. I cajole myself into believing that when the grief lets loose its tight grip I will be able to pick up on her energy. But I only feel a void. Like I’ve lost a part of me—the best part. I mistakenly feel that things are better since the meltdowns have ceased. At 5 months, I believe things are improving because I don’t hyperventilate anymore; I make plans, have goals. I even smile, and tears are fewer and further between. All good signs, right? But not right. Although I think at this time that the acute pain and panic have abated, they haven’t. It is just the anxiety medication that makes me think that. The <italic>Shadow</italic> . . . it lurks.</p>

<title>The 6-Month Myth</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The magical 6-month thing where things are supposed to get better after a death is a myth. At least for me anyway. I wake up with images, repetitious questions, and ponderings of Lorie. It’s like a plague. You’d think I would have answered all the questions, or at least let them go, by now. No. Same ones. Sometimes different answers or realizations. On a steady loop in my brain. If they left, I don’t know what I would think about. It seems the only time they recede to the quiet spaces in my brain is when I’m teaching, shopping online, arranging furniture, picking paint colors in my mind, or playing with our sweet, new puppy, Mac. I’m just so sad.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those pesky ruminative thoughts that hound me, loop in my brain. Linked to my depressed mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411433549">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>), online shopping and redoing our basement distract me from those incessant thoughts.</p>
<p>Although most of the literature views distraction negatively, as a form of avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411433549">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411433549">Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800411433549">Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, and Lyubomirsky (2008)</xref> have found that distractions can reap positive short-term effects leading to more positive appraisals of situations, better problem solving, and less distress. I find the distractions of picking out paint colors and carpet and shopping online for pillows, sheets, and other such things keep the ruminative, dead-end thoughts at bay, if only for a little while. But during that little while, I can look forward to something, and I can breathe without gasping for air. I understand how distractions could become problematic if they keep someone from the grieving process altogether or the bereaved become shopaholics or alcoholics in order to avoid the pain of grief. However, for me it is a reprieve from the invasive, incessant ruminative thoughts that plague me, even if it is just a brief respite.</p>

<title>Walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A new week begins. Begins as the one before ended: with tears and sadness. It seems to stalk me lately, the grief, the shadow. Just when I expect it to let up, it chokes me and pulls me down. I just expected something warm and comfortable to happen at the 6-month point. And something did happen, but it wasn’t warm or comfortable. It is sadness that I realize is settling in like a dense fog, covering everything, impeding my vision and my progress. Some days, many days, I just want to be an ant so someone will crush me . . . get it over with. I hurt so badly; it is pain that doesn’t let go. I just expect it to get better with time. I get so distressed when I feel that it will be like this for the rest of my life, this sadness that shadows my every move. I believe I will never walk without the shadow. . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In conducting my research, I discover that, as time progresses, I begin personifying the shadow. I begin, unwittingly, capitalizing <italic>shadow</italic> as it starts taking over my life. It seems to have come out of nowhere. As I think of it now, it’s like this: When I was in the belly of the whale the first 5 or so months, I was in total darkness. There was no light, so there was no shadow as a result. Then when I left the whale’s belly and emerged into the light, thinking I was done with the darkness, the Shadow followed me out and started stalking me, blotting out all light. I can see it now because I am out of the whale’s belly.</p>
<p>What does the Shadow do when it emerges? When the Shadow enters the room, my heart races, I gasp for breath, and panic sets in. Fearing I cannot control my emotions, I seek escape routes. I walk out of meetings and stores. Preemptively, I decline invitations for fear the Shadow will accompany me. The only place I feel safe from the Shadow is in front of my classroom. It finds me everywhere else. The Shadow, it stalks me . . .</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Shadow hung close today. I have just missed Lorie’s LOVE so much today, her unconditional love for me, for us. To know it is gone from me forever has choked me today. Tears adorn the pores of my face and neck now. Tears of loss. Just not a good day today. I need a break! I wish, I pray tomorrow is a good day. A day without the Shadow. I pray. The Shadow chokes me when it appears, blotting out all light . . . and hope. So I weep now. Cry myself to sleep. Again.</p>

<title>Happy Birthday, Jaime</title>
<p>Today is Jaime’s birthday. The first birthday she doesn’t have to share. Bittersweet. Thirty years ago our lives changed forever. We changed forever. Nine months and 9 days ago, our lives changed again . . . forever. As 12, the day of Lorie’s death, is an inversion of 21, the day of her birth, our joy has been inverted as well. Pain has replaced the elation and adulation of three decades ago when Lorie and Jaime were born. The sadness, the <italic>Shadow</italic>, grips me, chokes me. Thirty years ago when our precious twins were born, we were overjoyed. So perfect, so beautiful. The last 21 minutes of that day were happiest of my life. Two incredible babies were born who changed our lives forever. As did Lorie’s untimely death. Unreal. Our new reality. What we wake up to each morning.</p>
<p>On this beautiful, cool spring morning, I sit alone on the deck drinking in nature, my first cup of coffee, and my new reality. Dan is inside in a supine position on the couch, a position that has become all too common place as of late, watching a sports program on television. Tracy and Jaime are together in Blue Ridge for the weekend for Jaime’s birthday. They have become so close. Jaime needs her big sister, and Tracy is such an incredible one. Her strength, courage, and compassion overwhelm me. Jaime does not open up to me like Tracy does. “I’m fine, Mom,” is Jaime’s mantra when I inquire as to how she is doing. She gets frustrated with me when I encourage her to let me in, to share her grief. So it is good that she is with her big sister, a sister who provides such support for her, for us all. Maybe, just maybe, Jaime will open up, although I doubt that will happen. I guess in many ways it is good that she stays so busy in her job as a veterinarian, less time to be consumed by grief. I guess. I hope. If I could just grieve for her, I would.</p>
<p>I shuffle back into the house to refresh my cup of coffee. I walk by the couch, lean down, and kiss Dan on the forehead, receiving a wet kiss from Mac, our 86-pound boxer–bulldog mix who is curled up next to his master on the couch, his massive head resting on Dan’s shoulder. I don’t ask how my husband is doing today. I know how he is doing; he is especially sad today, something we don’t discuss because he won’t. I just know. His eyes bear the haunting pain of loss and guilt that he couldn’t protect his daughter, that he couldn’t save her. He isn’t getting better; he may be getting worse. I can’t imagine either of us getting up in the morning without our sweet Lorie on our minds . . . the loss, the love, the pain. I want so much to turn this grief into something positive, to be better from it. Yet seeing where my sweet husband is in his turbulent journey, I don’t see how that can be.</p>
<p>On top of his profound grief over Lorie’s death, he is also worried that he is bringing me down. What he doesn’t realize is that I am better because of him, because I love him and the girls so much that I can go on. Without them, I wouldn’t want to. He even gave me permission to leave him the other night. He doesn’t believe he is ever going to get better. Does he not understand how much I love him? Even more now than before, if that is possible. We share something no one else can understand. We share love, wonderful memories, and grief. I know how much he hurts. I’m the only one who can. And I know I wouldn’t survive without him. So I will hold his hand. Which means I must remain in the desert for now. I can do that. I will do that. Dan’s grief has taken my breath away, too often replacing it with tears that flow as freely as his pain.</p>
<p>Although I believed that the death of a child strained marriages, leading to separation and/or divorce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411433549">Schwab (1998)</xref> found no conclusive evidence that parents who lost a child were likely to divorce. On the contrary, his review of the literature found that the majority of marital relationships survive and may even be strengthened from the experience of loss as our relationship has been.</p>
<p>So I pour another cup of coffee, stir in a teaspoon of creamer, grab another tissue, and amble back to the deck. Mac glances up at me as I pass, not lifting his head from his master’s shoulder, somehow knowing how much he is needed today. Dan continues watching television, not acknowledging me as I pass. Both of us wishing our daughter Jaime is doing okay today, both hoping this day passes quickly, both in the enervating clutches of the Shadow.</p>
<p>Later today we will call Jaime to wish her a happy birthday. I will try to be upbeat even though my heart is breaking. I won’t call to wish my sweet Lorie a happy birthday today. I will ache. I will cry. I will persevere. I will. Somehow. And I’m not an ant. Ants can’t feel pain like this. . . .</p>

<title>Panic Attacks</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I drifted off to sleep and awakened to a speeding heart. Precursor to a panic attack. I took half of a Xanax and can’t settle back down. It’s like I am on speed. Tired, but can’t settle down. The thoughts. The same thoughts . . . over and over. Rehashing. Reliving. Grieving. So I just got up to write. So tired, but not enough to nod off. Surely the Xanax will kick in soon. If not, I’ll go take the other half. I’m so exhausted with this Shadow that has affixed itself to me and won’t let go, won’t let the light in. And sometimes I wonder if others can see it . . . that sounds just so strange, but I do wonder. Surely they can see the darkness around me . . . the faded Alice choked off by the Shadow.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bereavement and the brain. A new era. Using MRI technology to examine bereavement, to plot the course of grief. Neuroimaging has shown that grief demands attentional resources directed inward toward the body. The painful nature of loss seems to have a somatic, physical, component. Perhaps that is where the terms <italic>broken heart</italic> and <italic>pangs of grief</italic> originated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411433549">O’Connor, 2005</xref>). Using MRI technology, O’Connor found that the posterior cingulate cortex was activated during the grief elicitation, most likely due to its role in the interaction between memory and emotion leading to the theory that normal grief shares more similarities with anxiety than with depression.</p>
<p>My panic attacks make sense in the light of this finding, panic attacks that plagued me for over a year. It also makes sense to me that I should have remained on medication to mute the attacks, realizing that this would not have inhibited the grief process but would have helped me experience less strife, both emotionally and physically.</p>

<title>Ants and Random</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Shadow is holding tight to me as the 1-year mark draws nigh. My faith in God, purpose, meaning in life—gone. An ant in a sea of ants in a random universe. I see everything through the lens of loss and regret. I am left doubting and questioning everything I’ve ever believed in. I am left with the understanding borne of ant hills. Borne of grief.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411433549">Neimeyer (2005)</xref>, how a person deals with the death of a loved one is either consistent or inconsistent with her preloss meaning structures. The consistency of a distressing event with one’s existing meaning structures can reinforce these structures as they help to explain the difficult event, thus providing comfort. Losses that are inconsistent with preloss meaning structures trigger a dissonance that forces the bereaved to recognize that those meanings can no longer be <italic>true</italic>, meaningful, or helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411433549">Braun &amp; Berg, 1994</xref>). This causes the bereaved to engage in a search for meaning, or, in my case, to throw off all former meaning structures and dwell on ants and random.</p>

<title>Turning Points</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Being busy keeps the Shadow at bay. But I am also feeling something different . . . like I’m getting used to Lorie not being here. Almost as if I’ve been on a plane holding onto her so she won’t fall into the void below. My nerves on heightened alert, the noise of the plane drowning out all else around me. Then I turn to do something else, and when I turn back, she isn’t there. So I can’t hold onto her anymore. I can give my full attention to things of this earth . . . and care about doing them. Still missing her, yet not clinging to her in desperation, not turning my back on the life I am still living.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Enter Goethe:</p>
<p>Woke up early this morning. . . . I found that sleep was not to overtake me, so I decided to read. I picked up the book on Goethe and thumbed through thinking it would lull me to sleep with the big thoughts and oversized words. Which it ultimately did. But before doing its work, the book held me captive for a while. Toward the end of his life, like everyone, Goethe had experienced loss. When someone wanted to toast a friend gone from his life, Goethe stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Anything great and beautiful and impressive that comes our way, can’t be re-remembered from outside in; it must become part of our being from the instant we experience it. . . . There is no past, that we need look back upon regretfully. . . . Real regret can never be anything but productive, making a new and better thing out of the old. Haven’t we all known that, in these few days? That sweet, noble creature . . . lives in us, with us, henceforth; and though she should try her very best to get away from me, I have her for evermore. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411433549">Ludwig, 1928</xref>, p. 563)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It struck a chord with me. Lorie was such a noble soul. And she will live in me, with me, for evermore. She is a part of me; I am changed because she was in my life. I will never be the same, and I mean that in a good way. I want to focus on how she has changed me—for evermore. And that I have her for evermore.</p>
<p>Bereavement literature has recognized the significance of ongoing connections with the deceased, known in the field as <italic>continuing bonds</italic>, a method of coping and adaptation following the death of a loved one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411433549">Field &amp; Friedrichs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411433549">Field, Gao, &amp; Paderna, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411433549">Field, Nicholas, Holen, &amp; Horowitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411433549">Klass, Silverman, &amp; Nickman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411433549">Klass &amp; Walter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411433549">Packman, Horsley, Davies, &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411433549">Stroebe, Gergen, Gergen, &amp; Stroebe, 1992</xref>). It is now generally accepted that in spite of the permanence of physical separation through death, the bereaved can still be emotionally sustained through a continuing bond to their loved one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411433549">Field et al., 1999</xref>). Since I haven’t felt Lorie’s presence, something I have longed for since her death, I am trying to <italic>feel</italic> Goethe’s thoughts, to make them a part of me. So I don’t focus on Lorie’s loss but on how she is a part of me always, so I can continue to feel connected to her on some level. I am grasping at that faint light as a turning point in my journey of grief. Struggling to find a way to accept that which I cannot change. Not to feel the intense loss, but to feel the beauty that was Lorie within me. To keep the Shadow at bay.</p>

<title>The Water Is Rising</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An overcast day with more water in the lake. I’m so used to seeing drought and an increasing red-mud basin that I don’t trust my eyes when I see less red mud and more beautiful water. It reminds me of where I am in my grief journey. The massive red mud beach reminds me of my intense grief period. Of the day I broke down on the peninsula, asking God to take me, to let me be with my sweet baby. As the water rises, with it comes my spirits. The water—time, energy, reflection, hope—covers the parched earth so life can return again. When I look out at the lake, I am encouraged. I’m still headlong in my journey in grief, but I have come a long way, just like the water has come a long way. I am not trembling inside as much. I seldom gasp for air. Gut-wrenching screams still emerge from deep within my being, but the bouts are like light rain compared to the tornado of 6 months ago. I am better. Not just for today. It’s like I have stepped up the rung of a ladder, knowing I won’t go back down, at least not for long. The incessant whirring in the background of my mind is slowing. Becoming more white noise that I can choose to ignore. I hear the birds sing outside. They don’t irritate me anymore; they make me smile and feel calmer. The beauty of the world is flickering through the gloom of despair in my heart.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And there is so much beauty in the world. I have witnessed such beauty since Lorie’s death. Melted to my core, I have emerged understanding so much more about life. I no longer fear death; I take nothing for granted. I will no longer invest time or energy into things I’m not passionate about. I will back out of menial things. I will invest in family and friends. Listen to them, truly <italic>hear</italic> them, be there for them. Especially my family. I will take the time to enjoy the beauty in the world.</p>

<p>Today I thought about Lorie, but there were no sobs this time. Like a butterfly passing by, catching my attention but not hurling me into the whale’s belly. How much time is spent on thoughts of Lorie each day? Hours. The tormenting thoughts are seldom present—the why’s, the <italic>what ifs</italic>, the guilt, the loss of a future. Random thoughts peek through the steady thoughts of living. “Why did I make her buy that bra?” “What would she be doing now if . . . ?” “Why was Jaime crying at Tracy’s last week?” “When did she become sick?” Seldom bone-crushing thoughts. That is progress. When will thoughts of her death subside and be replaced with thoughts of her life? I know that is what I must begin focusing on. Not feeling the pain when I look at her beautiful photo next to me, but feeling the love of that angel. Those are the thoughts I long for. The good memories of our angel, and there are a lifetime of those.</p>

<title>What Have I Learned?</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Page 480 in my <italic>Journey in Grief</italic>. A lot of pages. A lot of grief. A lot of progress through the desert. I am in a good place now. The way I thought about it this morning is that now I have two programs open on my desktop as opposed to a program operating in the background that slows everything else that is being processed as it has been heretofore. I can think of plans, ideas, and so on and in the next instant my thoughts shift to something about Lorie. Then they shift back to the everyday thoughts that plague a human mind, and I can focus on those and think productively about them. . . .</p>
<p>So each morning I wake up, Lorie floods my mind still. It is intermixed with my internal to-do list—so that is progress. But each morning is another morning in my journey in grief. Without Lorie. I feel this journal has become my therapist, my way of journeying, by journaling. And it has helped so much. I have learned so much in this journey in grief. Mostly, I have learned about the small stuff, the big stuff, and that people can be so incredibly wonderful. One friend asked me what I had learned from the experience of Lorie’s death, and I told her, “Nothing matters, and everything matters.” That is what I have learned . . . as an ant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When I look back on my journey at this point, I can see how far I have come in my trek through the desolate desert. Although the extreme loneliness of the desert may be behind me, the desert sprawls ahead of me still, as far as the eye can see.</p>

<title>The Desert’s Edge: Escaping the Shadow, Seeking New Normal</title>
<p>The Shadow is at bay. I no longer think this is Hell, Hell on earth. I feel despair over losing Lorie, but look forward with hope. Lorie’s loss is devastating and will always be devastating. But with that devastation, among the ruins, I see more clearly the beauty within and without. The beauty of nature. The beauty of relationships. And I don’t dwell on the imperfections of others, myself, or things. My new favorite saying: “It’s just a thing; it doesn’t matter.” Things don’t matter; love does. Yes, I am softening. I guess some of that comes with age. But most of it is coming from loss.</p>
<p>Conducting research on my <italic>Journey in Grief</italic> brings back so much pain. Tears accompany the coding and highlighting. Yes, I have come a long way on my journey. I stated a year ago, “A part of me died with Lorie.” How true that is. I know now that I will never be the same person I was on August 11, 2008, which is a good thing in some ways. I will never sweat the small stuff again—I will be very selective of things I do in and with my life from now on. Yet I am left with only the belief in ants and random—my sense of purpose, the thing that has guided my life, has dissipated. My belief in <italic>happily ever after</italic> and fate and purpose—gone. I don’t understand why I can’t feel Lorie. We were so close. If I could just feel her around me . . . if I just knew she was somewhere and that she was okay.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I wrote earlier: <italic>When is the pain of loss supplanted by the joy of remembrance?</italic> Obviously, it can’t be as long as I journey down dead-end roads full of remorse and regret. So I want to plot my path intentionally. I don’t know how. Going to MapQuest offers no help . . . indeed. So maybe I pick out a memory or something good about Lorie and focus on that, not letting myself take the worn-out, dead-end roads I go down daily. There are so many wonderful memories of Lorie. As my mind sees those images, tears and heaves find me. Why can’t those wonderful memories bring a smile now? Because when I see those images, I realize the loss, and it overwhelms me. I want to feel the joy in remembrance, but the loss slams into me when I venture down Remembrance Road. When is it going to get better? Ever? Tears. Not a good start to a day. They have found me early today. It must be the fog that has set in outside my window and inside my heart.</p>

<title>Reflections on My Journey</title>
<p>Several of us are helping a colleague pack up her deceased companion’s things. She needs to move on. People say that about friends, spouses, and partners. They don’t say it about children. It’s like they know you can never move on. Move on to what? A child can never be replaced. Or forgotten.</p>
<p>Yet I realize the pain I feel over Lorie’s death is different now. The pain I feel when thinking of Lorie has been supplanted by something else. Not sure what that is yet, but it isn’t intense pain and regret. I want to remember her. Unlike earlier, now I want to see pictures with her in them. Yes, I wince when I realize there will be no more family photos with Lorie in them, but when I see her in the ones we have, I smile now. I loved her so much. I never want to forget that, any part of that, even if it brings a sting of pain with it.</p>
<p>The intense pain, the panic attacks, the inability to concentrate, and thoughts of ants and random seem to be behind me now. I have reengaged with the world. And that is good. Tears find me, usually on a daily basis, but they don’t sting. And they pass quickly, like a summer shower. I fear the Shadow will find me and put me in my place, in the darkness, again. I fear the Shadow. I fear being thrust back into the whale’s belly. The despair is so enervating there. I don’t want to return. Sometimes I find myself hurled back there when my sweet husband is having a bad day. Even though I know we are ultimately better when we have passengers with us on this journey, the progress is not synchronous. When one of us reaches back to help another, it stalls our forward progress. Tracy has been so helpful to me on this journey. She has listened intently, encouraged me, and cheered me on when I could easily have slipped back into the belly of the whale. I hope I am helping Jaime and Dan, but I don’t know that I am. It is so painful being pulled back into the abyss. Yet as I hold my sweet husband when he is in the depths of despair, the love and connectedness I feel is transforming. That I can love him so completely and share his pain . . . it is just transforming.</p>

<p>I am in a good place. Today anyway. Some days aren’t so good. I sing, but not as easily; I laugh, but not as loud; I sleep, but not as well; I teach, but don’t get involved in much else beyond that; I write—a lot in my journal; I appreciate the little things in life; I don’t sweat the small stuff or dwell on the negative; I take nothing for granted; I miss my angel every second of every day. Today was a good day—I almost wrote <italic>normal day</italic>, but I seriously don’t know what normal is anymore. Today seemed reminiscent of before August 12, 2008. I attended a panel discussion on issues with women in education—just to support a friend—and found myself involved in the discussion. Caring. I truly didn’t know if caring about things in life outside my family and my grief would ever return. I’m falling back into the ant formation, I think. I’m not in the middle of the ant army, and I’m certainly not leading the army, but I’m moving now. I’m not sitting on the sidelines with a box of Kleenex. That is progress.</p>

<title>The Bells of Christmas Ring Again</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The tree and all mantels are decorated. The <italic>mess</italic> is cleaned up. The house is ready for Christmas. I turned on the bells after I hung them today. That the bells, bells we first put up when the girls were 2 years old, can sound without Lorie to hear them makes no sense to me. But maybe she can still hear them on her perch on the mantel. Maybe she is enjoying the festive atmosphere that is congregating. A year ago I thought I would never celebrate Christmas again. I have come a long way. I look forward to Christmas. I look forward. That is progress.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Presents adorn the room beneath a tree filled with family ornaments representing trips to Disney World, Washington, D.C., St. Simons Island, and many other family vacation spots, in addition to scruffy, hand-made ornaments, the handiwork of three very inventive children. Leftover memories of a perfect family; a family that will never be whole again; a family that will always value the scruffy, child-made ornaments affixed to the tree each year; a family that is doing its best to recover from its devastating loss.</p>
<p>Tracy always spends more time and energy, as well as creativity, wrapping her gifts. They are truly works of art with beautiful wrapping paper or colorful bags punctuated by fancy, swirly ribbons and bows. Jaime’s gifts are usually last-minute, albeit thoughtful and generous, gifts that often appear under the tree dressed in the sacks they wore out of the store unless she arrives early enough to dash into my room to wrap them. My gifts are usually wrapped in recycled gift bags, many left over from Tracy’s fancy gifts from the year before. Reflective of the three of us, no doubt.</p>
<p>As I watch my family interacting while the gifts are being opened, I feel hope inching up between cracks in the ever-present grief. Tracy, the resident cheerleader, is coaching us through the gift opening. “Mom, now it’s your turn to open a gift. . . .” Jaime seems to be doing well, although she always holds her emotional cards close to her chest, not keeping us out, but not really letting us in. I don’t think she knows how to articulate her feelings over losing her twin, her best friend. So she works harder mending the sick animals that come to her for help. And she is always there when any one of us needs her. Dan, the quintessential father, is hovering. Though noticeably sad, he loves having his girls back home under his roof . . . all three of them. Through it all, the Christmas bells sound incessantly, reminding us of love . . . and of loss.</p>

<title>Happy Birthday, Jaime</title>
<p>When the twins were 5 years old, I started a tradition of writing letters to them during special times in their lives. The first letter I wrote was the night before they started kindergarten, which was published in <italic>Twins Magazine</italic>. I had always planned to write them a letter for their milestone 30th birthday, but the suffocating Shadow prevented me from penning the letter to Jaime on that special occasion. Feeling guilty, as well as being in a better place this year, I begin writing a letter to my sweet daughter for her birthday, the second one without her twin.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Jaime,</p>
<p>What an incredible woman you have become, growing up before my eyes, 31 years old now. How proud you have made your parents, are making your parents! You are just extraordinary! Beautiful, confident, empowered; stubborn, intense, loyal; full of promise and passion. Yet in your 31st year, I also know you are full of pain, the pain borne of loss, loss of your best friend in life. I read in the <italic>Sisters Book of Memories</italic> you gave Lorie, in your handwriting, that one of the good things about being a twin was that “you were guaranteed a best friend for the rest of your life.” I feel so sad because your best friend is no longer here to share your life, to share all our lives. For your pain and loss, I wish I could “kiss it and make it better,” but that is not in my power to do. I do hope you have found your peace with the loss of your best friend the best you can. . . .</p>
<p>I am so happy that you have followed your passion, passion that possessed you at the early age of 10! You pursued your career, not without setbacks, and are who you always wanted to be. And you continue refining your craft, pursuing that excellence that defines you. You value important things: family, friendships, and commitment. On Mother’s Day as I write this, I am beaming with joy and pride at my beautiful, brilliant, committed daughter.</p>
<p>So in this letter to you, on your 31st birthday, I don’t need to tell you to value friendship and family—you are doing that. I don’t need to tell you to remember your roots and follow your dreams—you are doing that; I don’t need to tell you to play fair or know right from wrong—you are doing that. But I do need to tell you how remarkable you are. I love you, have always loved you as an individual, and will always love you, as a daughter and as a friend.</p>
<p>With Much Love &amp; Admiration,</p>
<p>Mom</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Glancing back at the wasteland I have traversed, I breathe a sigh of relief, believing that I am leaving the desert behind me now, although not completely trusting my eyes. Ahead of me lies <italic>New Normal</italic>, the place for which I set my sails many, many months ago. At long last, can it be that I am actually arriving at my destination?</p>

<title>New Normal</title>
<p>With the second Christmas and the second birthday behind us since Lorie’s death, I feel the need to write to Lorie. Like she’s waiting to hear from me, proud of my progress in my journey in grief.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Lorie,</p>
<p>Another letter from Mom. I hoped you heard the bells on Christmas Day as we opened presents. I looked up on the mantel at you and the ringing bells and smiled, hoping you could feel the love in the room. The genuine happiness. As tears find me now, I can assure you that I am in a good place. A place where I don’t have to know where you are when I think of you; a place where the what ifs don’t find me, at least not often; a place where thoughts of you usually bring a smile rather than a meltdown; a place where I feel your love when I think of you more often than your loss; a place where I find myself thinking, “What would Lorie do?” in situations that would otherwise breed cynicism; a place where I know I am going to emerge as a better, more caring, and considerate person; a place where death is accepted as a natural part of life; a place where love trumps all else always; a place where I can be content not having the answers to existential questions that have plagued me since your death. I am in a good place, my sweet angel, just as I know you must be. I wish I could know more about your place, but am accepting the veil between us now, knowing that one day I will know the answers, that one day I will be with you again on some level. I am in a place of acceptance. Accepting that which I cannot change and feeling serenity within that acceptance. I am in a place where I carry you with me, where I feel myself holding your sweet hand as I am left to live my days on earth without you. Holding on to the beauty and love that was you that I will carry with me always. I am beginning to accept that this place I find myself in is, in fact, the New Normal I have sought since the beginning of my journey. I don’t trust that I am here to stay, that the Shadow won’t find me or that I won’t be thrust into the Belly of the Whale again, but I am in a more peaceful, serene place. And if I can’t go back and change what happened to you—and I can’t—then I hope to stay in this New Normal, this place of acceptance and calm.</p>
<p>I found it enlightening today as I realized how important letters to you have become to me—ever since the first letter I wrote to you the night before you started kindergarten. I realize now that those letters I wrote to you on significant occasions during your life were written for me as much as for you. Guiding you, yes, but also letting you know how proud I was of you and how much I wanted for you in life. Now I see these letters as letters for me, guiding me through my journey in life, my journey in grief, my journey in love. I love you, my little girl,</p>
<p>Mom</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It has been 3 years since I began this journey in grief, and I still struggle with my daughter’s death. In going through photo albums recently to make a collage of our family, I pulled out Lorie’s college photo album filled with such glory and happiness. On one page, with photos of her with friends at graduation and one with her sisters, she had added the caption: “Don’t cry because it is over; smile because it happened.” Even though tears erupted and fled down my face, I found myself smiling, smiling because I am so thankful that <italic>it happened</italic>, that Lorie happened in my life. Even if she had to leave us.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411433549">Gillies and Neimeyer (2006)</xref> proposed a model of meaning reconstruction that posits the following key meaning-making processes: sense making, benefit finding, and identity change. “By these processes the bereaved engage in meaning reconstruction through which preloss meaning structures may be reviewed, reevaluated, renewed, and/or rebuilt” (p. 54). In this model, the process of reconstruction leads to new postloss meaning structures that lead to a new world view. If the new structures are helpful to the bereaved, they can alleviate distress and become integrated into her worldview; however, if these new structures are not helpful in finding meaning and leave the bereaved distressed, they are subject to more reconstruction.</p>
<p>Having shed my preloss meaning structures, I am still in the process of framing a meaning structure to help me make sense of Lorie’s death, of the world in general. I know that I have experienced identity change as a result of the loss. I am more caring as a person. <italic>Things</italic> don’t matter as much to me as they once did; <italic>people</italic> matter more. I no longer fear death; I view death as a part of life.</p>
<p>Tracy has given us a grandson, almost a year old, who has brought joy back into our lives, and we have set up a scholarship in Lorie’s memory at the university she attended, Oglethorpe University in Atlanta. The awarding of the scholarship to the first two recipients was heartening, the benefit finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411433549">Gillies and Neimeyer (2006)</xref> referenced. However, returning to her university, the place where she was the happiest, is accompanied by the pain of loss, tears of grief—alongside smiles <italic>because it happened</italic> and knowing that Lorie would love that the scholarship is helping someone attend the university she loved so much. Helping others is something she always did so well.</p>
<p>If pushed to articulate a meaning structure, I turn to the title of a 1996 romantic comedy film, <italic>Love Is All There Is</italic>. That simple, profound truth has been revealed to me as a result of my profound loss. And the belief that I will have my little girl’s love with me <italic>for evermore</italic>.</p>
<p>How to end this journey in grief? Will it ever end? I don’t know. I sincerely doubt it. I believe I have arrived at <italic>New Normal</italic>, but I don’t tease myself into thinking the Shadow won’t find me again, stalk me again, thrust me back into the desolation of the desert. But I journey onward, continuing forward on my journey, armed with beautiful memories, my wonderful family and friends, and the belief, the understanding, that <italic>love is all there is</italic>.</p>
