<abstract>
<p>Based on ethnographic research on the encounter between local culture and schools in multicultural suburban areas, this article explores possibilities suggested by autonomous learning activities in a hip-hop collective that may have a potential to break urban segregation patterns. The collective’s artistic production raises questions that have not been answered in schools, such as how the increasing class divisions between different parts of the urban landscape should be understood and dealt with. Different types of learning are identified connected to the self, others, and careers. Implications for schooling are briefly discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Sweden, as in other countries, growing up in certain areas often functions in political and media discourse as a motif for education failure, crime, and social difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912437415">Gannon, 2009</xref>). In Sweden, these kinds of motif are often aimed at people, particularly young men, that have grown up in the suburban areas of the Swedish Million (Homes) Program (Swedish: Miljonprogrammet), implemented the Social Democratic government in Sweden between 1965 and 1974. These neighborhoods were intended to provide 1 million modern accommodation units, thereof the name of the program, and they now provide homes to some 20% of Sweden’s population. However, the architecture and local culture of the areas had a change of discursive status from the 1970s onward, first though an exodus of wealthier clientele and then via an upswing in immigration, with these new groups moving into the empty apartments. These days reputation precedes the Million (Homes) Program housing areas, and they have become territorially stigmatized areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912437415">Wacquant, 2009</xref>) that are caught up in societal and medial discourses that demonize living conditions in a way that gives rise to fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>This article begins by acknowledging the stigmatizing discourses that are leveled at areas like these and those who live there (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912437415">Strayhorn, 2009</xref>), before then going on to explore alternative ideas about such places and their populations, primarily from research with an informal learning collective called Filthy Dozen Incorporated (FDInc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>). In this research, an urban place-based informal pedagogy is described as a critical response that challenges common stereotypes about the knowledge and aspirations of groups like these and their friends, neighbors, and relatives from the former Million (Homes) Program areas.</p>
<p>We refer to the areas we have done our research in as suburbs. However, we use the term in a different way to the American terminology, where a suburb is a residential area within commuting distance of a city that constitutes a separate community of principally upper-middle- and middle-class people. These areas are generally wealthier than average, with some political autonomy, a lower population density than inner-city areas and a prevalence of detached homes. This is not so in Sweden and much of Europe. Although there are also wealthy suburbs there, we are referring to physically and socially segregated, poverty-intensive, immigrant-dense high-rise housing areas on the edge of major towns and cities. In Sweden, the Swedish Metropolitan Committee characterize such areas as socially vulnerable, with particular but rarely met educational needs. In the U.S. context, multiracial areas of high poverty are found in urban regions, such as the Bronx in New York or Watts in Los Angeles. In South America, the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro represent these areas of depression, with even greater levels of unemployment and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912437415">Neate &amp; Platt, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the suburbs in our research, more than 35 different ethnic backgrounds are represented and 39 different languages are spoken in their schools, which also share another set of common features. The schools are openly underfunded in relation to their needs with staff-recruitment and retention difficulties that have led to them no longer being seen to provide an obvious passageway into adult society in the way schools in other regions do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>). Since 2005, consistently above 50% of ninth graders have failed to obtain a complete set of passing grades on leaving their junior high schools and on average a continuous 35% of young adults aged between 20 and 25 in the areas the schools belong to have been outside of both education and work during the research period. The schools thus constitute a problem for integration rather than a means and may actually reinforce young people’s experience of alienation from Swedish society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912437415">Runfors, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0042085912437415">
<title>The Research Base</title>
<p>The empirical basis of the article comes from four research projects. The first and most drawn on is the above, with the FDInc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>). It is supplemented, however, by data from three other projects: Schools and Their Surroundings (VR Reg. No. 2005-3440), Stereotypes, Naïve Theories, Cultural Norms and Their Effects on School Performance (VR Reg. No. 721-2006-2554), and Creativity and Performativity in Teaching and Learning (VR Reg. No. 2004-11499-26389-27).</p>
<p>One of these projects has been done in schools in the same suburb as the FDInc. originated from. The other two have been done in schools in similar areas on the outskirts of other towns that are also among the 20 most impoverished and territorially stigmatized suburbs in the country. They are characterized by local historical divisions of race and class, and these distinctions are often, as is also the case elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912437415">Gannon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912437415">Strayhorn, 2009</xref>), offered in the media and political debate as explanations for current tensions in the suburban communities and the schools in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437415">Hill, 2009</xref>), as well as for low grade point averages, vandalism, and social stigma.</p>

<title>Research Method</title>
<p>When conducting our investigations, we have used an ethnographic methodology. This approach is common in Scandinavian education research, where it is about developing theoretical and practical descriptions through situated investigations that produce knowledge about the conditions of educational systems and practices and the perspectives of the participants involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>). This is done so that the ethnography can identify previously unexplored dimensions of school lives and learning without oversteering from purely personal ideas. Participant observation field notes and interview transcripts have been the main data sources for the analysis, which is inspired by the work of the Birmingham (CCCS) School of critical cultural ethnography (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912437415">Willis, 1977</xref>). Central to the approach has been an emphasis on an active and creative citizen and an assumption that there is a dialectical relationship between human social practices, human consciousness, and social structures.</p>
<p>The ethnographic research we have used has involved over 400 hr of participant observation with members of the learning collective and equally as many with pupils and teachers in schools and their surrounding communities. In addition, more than 60 individual interviews (of some 50 min each), 20 focus-group interviews and a multitude of field conversations have also been carried out, most particularly of course with members of the FDInc. One of us also lived for 5 months in one of the suburbs in 2007 as another, if slightly Whiter community member, who also kept a field-work diary over everyday occurrences.</p>

<title>Suburban Communities and Schooling Processes</title>
<p>The suburbs we have worked with/in are areas with high poverty levels and prominent patterns of marginalization and discrimination that affect both the activities of schools and the communities established by young people outside them, and that serve to segregate and separate immigrant-dense territorially stigmatized housing areas from the rest of the city, both physically and symbolically (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912437415">Dikec, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912437415">Gannon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912437415">Hill, 2009</xref>). Many young people in these areas say that they live with a feeling of alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>), and researchers characterize the areas as socially vulnerable low-income, high-unemployment, high social insecurity regions with low levels of formal education and health standards.</p>
<p>Developments of, in, and in relation to these suburbs liken in several respects processes taking place during the 1980s and 1990s in large parts of Western Europe through the structural economic transformation processes that converted welfare states into welfare societies, through changes to central aspects of the social contract that was the foundation for the Keynesian economic model that dominated the political climate in the decades after the Second World War. Instead of Keynesianism, neoliberalism became the new banner under which politics was conceptualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>). But not simply as a set of economic policies for facilitating free trade and corporate profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912437415">Brown, 2003</xref>, p. 7)! Rather, neoliberalism within the welfare state involved extending and disseminating market values to institutions both inside and outside of the welfare state itself, and advancing the concept of the market solution at the same time as the State itself remained as a key player in relation to the operation of these markets. A number of Swedish researchers and debaters considered these changes as representing an epoch shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912437415">Bengtsson &amp; Wirtén, 1996</xref>). Through them, different groups have been marginalized and have ended up outside of a society with ever clearer patterns of marginalization and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In Western Europe, the development of a postindustrial, neoliberal societal order has entailed increasing social polarization in regions such as these, with new forms of social exclusion and the growth of what is often called a new urban subproletariat without work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912437415">Wacquant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912437415">Willis, 2004</xref>). Through it, Europe today has become a continent where millions of people are obliged to live in poverty and social exclusion, even in the former shop-window democracies of the Nordic states. In Europe in 1998, there were 52 million people who were officially living in poverty. By 2005, the number was more than 75 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912437415">Lindberg, 2005</xref>) and it is still rising.</p>
<p>The figures presented above outline a new European continent with fermenting social tensions which strengthens racism and other social conflicts. In line with the British sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912437415">Scott Lash (1994)</xref>, an institutional deficit has been created that is particularly evident in the same urban settings in which modern misery is most manifest. As Lash wrote as early as 1994, it is no longer a question of <italic>if</italic>, but instead of <italic>when</italic> and in which city a European version of the 1992 Los Angeles Rodney King riots will take place. The violence that erupted in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois and spread rapidly to other ghetto-like neighborhoods throughout France in 2005 is perhaps an example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912437415">Dikec, 2007</xref>), as are the recent London riots in the United Kingdom, and although the social democratic welfare states of Scandinavia seem to have been generally spared from these developments, several areas around Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö are beginning to show them.</p>
<p>Territorial stigmatization penetrates and poisons every corner of life in areas like these according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912437415">Wacquant (2009)</xref>. It taints the schools, civic organizations, relationships between people, and individual self-images and contributes to forming stereotypical notions of crime, as well as cultural and religious antagonisms that give rise to fear and moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912437415">Wacquant, 2009</xref>). These demonizing processes are particularly apparent to young men from the areas we have researched and in the media images angled at them.</p>
<p>For these young men, schools constitute a barrier for integration and they are no longer seen as arenas where they can develop self-respect, knowledge, and an understanding of the time in which they live. They provide the youngsters attending them with educational grades so far below national averages that these grades will result in difficulties for their eventual continuation through the school system and into higher education and stable, well-paid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912437415">Schwartz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As a partial response, young people have started to create their own cultures and communities in a search for the respect, understanding, belonging, security, intimacy, meaning, identity, and knowledge that Swedish society and its schools have not been able to provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>). These cultures represent a need for cognitive maps to navigate the surrounding world and they provide a means for challenging and transforming common sense and informing conventional educational understandings and practices.</p>
<p>Young people’s locally based cultures can be viewed as communities of practice that constitute a <italic>horizontal dimension</italic> of life in vulnerable suburban areas that comprise local traditions, ties between neighbors, activities organized by civic organizations, and everyday relationships within young people’s subcommunities. The official municipality structures, such as schools, kindergartens, after-school activity centers, clinics, social services, and the like, may be said to constitute a chiefly <italic>vertical dimension</italic> of institutions whose role is to mediate between differentiation and integration and establish, mediate, and maintain Swedish-ness. The horizontal dimension constantly meets the vertical dimension, and this encounter often causes various kinds of complications and frictions. One focus of our research project has been on the points of intersection between these two dimensions.</p>

<title>Hip-Hop as a Global-Tribe Community and a Response to Social Degradation</title>
<p>Olleryd is the name we have given to the suburb in which we have done much of the fieldwork. FDInc. is a hip-hop collective with roots in this suburb. It has emerged partly as a means of responding to the stereotypical notions of immigrant-dense suburban areas and consists of some 20 young men aged 18 to 28 years with family backgrounds from all continents of the globe. While they together form a collective, each member participates in some form of creative project, either as a solo artist or in small groups of two or three. None of them can support themselves through their artistry alone, however. Surrounding the collective is a friendship group that runs a theater group and Olleryd’s Center for Digital Story Telling.</p>
<p>The collective is formalized around the activities of hip-hop, which since its emergence on the North American east coast in the mid-1970s has been defined in terms of four well-known elements—rap, breakdance, DJing, and graffiti. According to hip-hop veteran Africa Bambaataa, a fifth element has recently emerged from the need to keep the hip-hop movement together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912437415">Chang, 2005</xref>). This fifth element consists of knowledge and teaching in what is now the worldwide movement, “The Universal Zulu Nation,” committed to developing a collective consciousness related to messages about peace and a life without discrimination or prejudice.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing discussion within the global hip-hop community about how authentic hip-hop should be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912437415">Perry, 2005</xref>). So too with/in the collective of FDInc. Although the collective are not officially members of the Zulu Nation, they define themselves similarly as standing outside the commercial branch of hip-hop, which they regard as superficial compared with the subversive underground hip-hop culture they consider themselves to be exponents of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912437415">Sernhede, 2007</xref>), and they refrain from using the common stereotypes of violence, street crime, and sexism that is common in the commercial stream. Moreover, they do not advocate irresponsibly breaking laws and societal commitments in their music, which on the contrary expresses the value of honesty and attempts to influence society positively. The ability of all to define, defend, and educate themselves is expressed and promoted as a means toward prosperity and the protection and development of self-worth. In one interview, an informant, Diaz, put these things as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hip-hop true culture cannot be bought, nor is it for sale. It is not a product but rather a principle for self-empowerment, self-development and ones community . . . The Universal Zulu Nation projects this. It is an international consciousness that unites people . . . For us there is entertainment but not at any price . . . We are talking about multi-skilled, multi-cultural, multi-racial communication (that) speaks about injustice and aims for an equal society and a more peaceful world that can heal divisions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Diaz explains hip-hop is a way of giving a voice to people on the margins regardless of race. It is about consciousness and social mobilization as well as entertainment and having a good time with your friends. There is a connection to the Zulu Nation that gives a symbolic dimension of continuity, but the group has no other bonds to the organization itself.</p>
<p>One of the main informants in The FDInc. is Enrico. He came to Sweden from Latin America as a young child in the early 1980s. He did not bother much about school and did not obtain good grades. However, through his parents he had access to a cultural capital that helped give him self-confidence. His parents encouraged him to read and express himself, and they have always discussed books, films, and TV programs in the family.</p>
<p>Enrico’s father had been a university lecturer back home and his mother a primary school teacher. His father’s political activities forced him to flea the country, and after some years in exile he came to Sweden in 1981 as a political refugee. The next year, Enrico came to Sweden with his mother. After some four years in different immigrant camps in small towns in the south of Sweden, they got an apartment in Olleryd, and Enrico’s father became a part of the mobilization of the immigrant population in this part of the city. Enrico sometimes followed his father to meetings and became socialized into a kind of thinking which he then linked to the youth culture of his own generation. As he expressed it in interview,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I . . . became interested in hip-hop . . . there were a couple of guys doing it and talking about the ghetto and Black culture. I liked everything about it . . . But I also felt that it was a way of continuing doing what my father had done . . . It was our way to carry on with politics even though we were not political in the same way as my father was back in Latin America. I felt that we were the Blacks of this country. We were not really accepted and we had to do something that was similar to what Black people in the U.S. had done and that was basically the same thing that my father and his comrades did in Latin America, fighting to get the voices of the repressed heard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Enrico became one of the chief inspirational figures for the hip-hop culture in Olleryd in the 1990s, and he is one of the reasons why FDInc. looks at itself as a part of a bigger youth movement that wants to get out of the urban margin and become a social force that can be heard around Sweden. Hip-hop and similar movements or forms of expression are able to bring people together and create a cultural identity that also has scope for knowledge and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912437415">Neate &amp; Platt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437415">Söderman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An identification with the U.S. African American population is there all the time for Enrico and other members of the group. Being White for Enrico means being associated with the extensive “disruption of the normal integration of his neighbourhood . . . his people . . . his person . . . his conscious sense of belonging (and) his social functioning.” So even though he is of Latin heritage, he considers himself as Black by disassociation, in the sense that his main identity “is that he is not White (but) living in a White society.” This is why “hip-hop is an important part” of his identity. It provides an alternative starting point to mainstream media, schools, and other institutions for developing analyses and messages that problematize the social reality in which young people with immigrant backgrounds live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912437415">Chang, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Hip-hop for young men like Enrico can be regarded in this way as a response to processes of social degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912437415">Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912437415">Toop, 2000</xref>). However, it does not only constitute symbolic or ritualized resistance against the prevailing order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912437415">Hebdige, 1979</xref>) but also contain a programmatic, political dimension that actively relates to one’s own neighborhood. There is a focus on the importance of belonging to a place and attempts to deal with the social, economic, and cultural devaluation there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912437415">Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912437415">Toop, 2000</xref>). Victor, a 19-year-old of Latin American origin, expressed this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Olleryd is really like a reservation . . . When I’m in Olleryd everything feels okay. Everybody badmouths it, but nobody’s been there . . . In Olleryd it’s another world. I know everybody and everybody’s just like me. When I leave Olleryd I come to Sweden, and when I’m in Sweden I feel discriminated. It doesn’t feel like my country and it never will . . . I have a theory that the world is where you want to live. If a place feels good, you should live there. But Sweden doesn’t feel like my country. When I look around . . . I really don’t want to be part of that society. There’s no reason to . . . I don’t feel at home there anyway . . . Hip-hop gives me a place to feel at home in . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hip-hop is suggested here to hold a strategy for self-respect and solving conflicts outside of official institutional contexts such as those of the schools. The schools teach what some of the older FD members sometimes refer to as a White man’s history that takes no interest in the discrimination that has relegated racial minorities to the dark side of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912437415">Smith, 2002</xref>). Based on its consciousness-raising practices, the authentic hip-hop of groups like the FDInc. counters this and tries to replace this history in an effort to elevate the suburban areas and combat a bad media reputation. The FDInc. do this through their art and by lecturing in schools, youth centers, libraries, and community centers. Laslo, a young man with a background similar to Enrico’s but who comes from Iran, is one of the young men that together with Enrico are role models in the neighborhood. He put things as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we’re doing is a kind of adult education for our time. We try to get people to . . . grow as people and begin to think . . . intellectually . . . Of course, we can’t give them any formal credits . . . but we can give hope and visions. And we can give people a goal. Something to work towards! What we do is give belonging. People need belonging. You know you can’t just be an immigrant kid from this place, because then you’re a nobody and that’s what the criminal gangs build on. You gotta be something and we give opportunities for another kind of belonging. (Laslo)</p>

<p>Many young people in suburban areas feel the need to upgrade the local spirit of community in this way. To an outsider, this idealization of concrete ghetto districts seems odd and contradictory. However, it is actually part of the history of these places and central to a feeling of community and a need to have a liberated sphere “where you don’t constantly have to face the Sweden that regards you as a second-class citizen” (Teo). These young men and women describe the relationship between Olleryd and the rest of the city as Victor did, as neocolonial. “Segregation is a continuation of colonialism,” Laslo said, and continued:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are here because you were there in our countries and fucked them up . . . French, Spanish and British colonialism destroyed the cultures of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Now the people from these continents that used to be the white man’s slaves are making trouble in the heart of your world . . . The immigrant-dense suburban areas are modern reservations in which the third world makes itself felt . . . The schools and the ordinary ways of becoming members of society, or whatever that’s called, seemed to be closed to us. But when we make music and perform, we get in through the back door.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Comments like this suggest how groups like the FDInc. may be beginning to give up their strict city neighborhood nationalism. “Now it’s a matter of breaking the isolation of the suburban areas” (Laslo) and of coming out and “meeting all parts of the city to spread the message, participate in debates and arrange lectures and workshops in libraries and so on” (Enrico). The confrontational image has been replaced by a wish for dialogue. The ambition is to make a way into society through the outgoing artistry and message making of the collective structure of hip-hop, to provide a security-creating and identity-bearing subaltern message in opposition to and as a correction toward the kinds of “Othering” that are experienced otherwise. It is a form of creative resistance.</p>

<title>FDInc.—The Collective as a Prerequisite for Learning and Growth</title>
<p>One way to view FDInc. is as an informal learning community with a common passion and a goal of gaining knowledge through sharing information and experiences together and actively representing and reflecting on the surrounding world, their relationship to it, and the group’s presentation of itself. The patterns of behavior at work in the group’s relationship to the surrounding world, as well as those directed toward work within the group, thus play a great role in constituting an identity and engagement. There is a constant process of conscious, strategic, and even incidental learning with/in an informal sense of community. Moreover, the informal learning of the group should not be regarded as an inferior form of learning to that of an institution like the school, or as a mere precursor to formal learning in official institutions. It is instead a form of learning that is necessary and valuable in its own right and that is directly relevant to the lives and understanding of the people involved. As expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437415">Leadbeater (2000)</xref>, it seems indeed to sit at the heart of what real education should do: that is, inculcate a body of knowledge and develop basic capabilities of acting responsibly toward others by working creatively and collaboratively and, perhaps most importantly, “creating the ability and desire to carry on learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437415">Leadbeater, 2000</xref>, pp. 111-112).</p>
<p>The learning that takes place in a group such as FDInc. has multiple dimensions in respect of the above aims. It is oriented toward <italic>the outer world</italic> the young people are part of and a number of capacities that are needed to handle this external social reality. Immediately apparent is the emergence of several <italic>practical skills</italic> that are not normally acquired by studying in school. The skills the young hip-hoppers name include learning to handle Cubase programs, booking and arranging a rehearsal hall or studio, using film cameras, creating an Internet homepage, and furnishing a meeting place. What we might call <italic>administrative capabilities</italic> are also developed. The members of FDInc. learn to manage study circles, manage their economy, arrange and conduct meetings, and attend to the advertising of various activities. In addition, important <italic>cognitive knowledge</italic> is developed through analyses and representations of their experiences and understandings of objective social reality. These examples primarily concern self-evident insights “such as the necessity of acquiring knowledge about what one wishes to express” (Laslo).We can get a sense of this from the following extract:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some six or seven rappers have gathered in the hallway outside the library. They planned to write some new songs and try to find some books on the subject they intend to write about. The collective is engaged in a conference on segregation and discrimination on the labor market, organized by a trade union. Ollie looked for a book on apartheid. He said that he needed something to relate his own experiences to. There were not that many in the library and Ali started to talk about the history of colonialism and argued that discrimination and racism have the same roots. He said that his brother had some films they could watch instead of borrowing books. They all went home to Ali’s and watched <italic>The Battle of Algier</italic>. A more or less organized discussion led by Enrico was held based on the film. (Field notes 071210)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The learning described above presents concrete activities of independent research such as watching and critically discussing movies. However, it is oriented toward a world that is basically <italic>intersubjective</italic> in the senses described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437415">Leadbeater (2000)</xref>, in that it exists as part of the social and meaning-bearing fabric that we normally call culture. It is their subjectively shared world of <italic>symbols, styles, and other forms of linguistic, meaning-bearing communication</italic>, and it constitutes an important aspect of the learning processes taking place.</p>
<p>Learning through hip-hop is thus characterized by an <italic>intertextuality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912437415">Gilroy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912437415">Kristeva, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912437415">Lindberg, 1999</xref>) between visual symbols, calligraphy, tattoos, rhythmic and musical patterns, rhymes, puns, and so forth that are used to refer to things both within and outside the culture itself. However, the <italic>intertextual</italic> aesthetics of hip-hop are complex and often depend on references to such an extent that an uninitiated listener does not always understand what a rap song is about. Even if he or she understands the words, the intertextuality is lost and the artistic expression becomes banal.</p>
<p>Discourse theorist Norman Fairclough describes this as <italic>manifest intertextuality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912437415">Fairclough, 2003</xref>). Through aesthetic forms of expression, in this case via words, music, numbers, and moving pictures, one learns to use and develop symbolic codes (verbal, musical, and visual). Knowledge and new communication patterns are developed. The group is engaged in a semiotic guerrilla warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912437415">Hebdige, 1979</xref>) that redefines and shifts meanings. Such learning processes are of vital importance to the way in which the young people involved orient themselves. A field note extract (070903) in this read,
<disp-quote>
<p>One group of two rappers has recorded a song—363 Dyrello—that has been video-recorded and up-loaded onto <italic>YouTube</italic>. At Olleryd’s senior high school in spring 2007, it was played incessantly on the TV in the school’s common room. It pays homage to Olleryd and to two rappers who were killed in a tragic accident. The song’s references to the local city neighborhood appear in a subtle and encoded way—through portions of old local rap songs, allusions to certain events (that are important to the initiated), or the use of number symbolism. The film is, on the whole, one of the most frequently downloaded music videos produced by amateurs in Sweden. The song and the video have become an underground hit in suburban areas as well as in other hip-hop communities around the country. The number 363 is Olleryd’s postcode, and Dyrello is Olleryd written backwards. In this way the song is intertwined in various other references.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This piece of rap is about the neighborhood. It contains references to known events but it does not have any of the commonly identified homophobic and misogynous markers of commercial rap. This is deliberate. When asked about this, the members said that although they do not personally take offence to this side of popular hip-hop, it is “annoying hearing that kind of shit everyday . . . we have sisters you know . . . and girlfriends and we treat them with respect (and) expect others to do so” (Diaz). Enrico spoke similarly. He pointed out that unlike the image projected by commercial hip-hop, he is not afraid of having something he says construed as homosexual and he would not use misogynous slurs in his performances just to project or trade off an image of manhood. This ‘is just not what we’re about’ (Enrico).</p>
<p>In another example (below), the group illustrates another aspect of learning in a community such as FDInc., this time in terms of learning <italic>normative capabilities</italic>. What we mean by this is that the group is formalized around certain norms, such as those expressed above, but if these are to work, they must form part of the intersubjectively shared world and become accepted by everyone involved. Conflicts must be handled and solutions sought in relation to each individual’s own responsibility, such as for example learning when it is necessary to work toward a solo career and finding an acceptable way of doing so, while at the same time working on strengthening the group. A field note extract put things as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is obvious that FDInc. has fundamental values, specifically the written and unwritten laws of the hip-hop culture. However, these fundamental values leave, as Enrico says, more room than the schools do for “testing what is right and wrong.” One such thing is how the group should treat those who break agreements and another is how to conduct group meetings. The meeting today was in the rehearsal room. It was a bit frustrating since some of the younger members had problems concentrating. Enrico became angry and said that they will have to leave if they can’t be serious. Then after another 10-15 minutes Ollie got angry too. The two young boys reacted and called him a fag and a “boss wanna be.” Enrico told them to grow up and come back when they have considered how stupidly they behaved. They did not come back that night. Some of the other members agreed with Ollie and Enrico and meant that this is the only way to get some order. The two who had to leave “are of course welcome back again.” This joint testing or elaborating with the norms is an important precondition for developing norms that are supported and respected. (Field notes 070912)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<italic>Relational capability</italic> is a further aspect of the learning in the group expressed above. This term signifies the ability that emerges from the kinds of learning processes that are involved in reaching common agreements on how to operate, who to include or exclude, and why. However, by interacting in these ways, FDInc. members also <italic>get to know and understand themselves</italic> through reflective processes that are built into their continuous responses to one another’s ways of being. They develop a reflexive self-knowledge and understanding. This type of learning also comprises dealing with visions and the goals and ideals young people develop for their lives. For the members of FDInc., this is a matter of being “true to oneself and the fundamental values of hip-hop” (Enrico).</p>
<p>The last type of learning is perhaps the most significant one. It concerns an <italic>expressivity</italic> through music, film, and theater that provides both listeners and musicians with tools for grasping and giving voice to inner needs and feelings. What we are referring to here is a creative and yet also a strongly critical perspective, such as was once found perhaps in expressionist art or theatre, premised on the idea that modern societies have turned into stinting totalitarian systems, through which individual autonomy and full subject possibilities for all humankind have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Expressionist art forms have aimed to get the intense emotional experiences invoked through participation in such circumstances into a communicative media, in a way that <italic>gives voice</italic> to the subjective emotions that these experiences arouse. They describe the harshness of a situation with boldness and intensity in an emotionally charged manner and speak out about the frustration, anxiety, disgust, and discontent felt about contemporary situations and the contradictions of modern life. Expressivity is often interwoven with other dimensions of the activities in the collective. It is connected but not restricted to how inner feelings can be expressed in a lyric or in gestures on stage. As one of the young men in the group said,
<disp-quote>
<p>When you feel bad it can be hard to talk about it . . . It’s not always so easy to know why you’re down, then it can feel real good to write some lyrics. To start to sing or just do some free styling to a fat beat. It feels like it’s coming out. You feel relief somehow. (Noussam, 19 years, interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Expressivity is one of the core elements of the social praxis of the collective. It occurs when they represent their neighborhood on stage and when they interact with the social world via recordings or by working with their website. In these situations, instead of just picking up knowledge that has already been produced by others, the group is symbolically creative and carries out a more open search for knowledge in their specific contemporary living conditions than seems to be possible in schools. Not only does the group provide security, community, and opportunities to express feelings for its members in this way but it is also an arena for different ways of responding to and commenting on social conditions, such as Othering, poverty and exclusion from genuine citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Through its creative capabilities, the FDInc. has thus become able to connect to currents that can bring them closer to the center of the city. As a collective, they have been able to identify <italic>career paths</italic> that exploit the new postindustrial economy’s interest in cultural manifestations of the exoticized Other’s cultural expressions and streetwise, innovative, ghetto-infused creativity.</p>

<sec id="section7-0042085912437415" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusions: Hip-Hop as Education</title>
<p>A discussion has recently arisen about the relationship between hip-hop culture and the tradition of adult education. In his doctoral dissertation, music pedagogue Johan Söderman emphasizes a number of important observations from hip-hop in Malmö and New York. According to him, hip-hop cannot be placed in a given popular music genre or marked with an unequivocal label. Because just as FDInc. refers to hip-hop as being both underground and mainstream, Söderman shows how the hip-hop sphere is characterized by this tension. He holds that there are important and interesting aspects of today’s hip-hop that have few opportunities to emerge and that if we enter the environments in which hip-hop is practiced, we can discern the contours of a suburban culture that not only is striving after recognition but also embraces the desire to learn to <italic>analyze and develop strategies for social change</italic>.</p>
<p>Hip-hop’s aesthetic, almost programmatic starting point in the encounter between cultures plays an important role in this context. Starting from his own discipline, Söderman believes that on one hand hip-hop can be seen as a strategy for teaching musical craftsmanship and on the other it also provides an instrument for staging liberating pedagogical processes that can serve as a tool for political activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437415">Söderman, 2007</xref>, p. 115).</p>
<p>Söderman’s empirical material has been collected in Malmö as well as in the United States. He describes the hip-hop settings that he has studied as marked by the intention to “set people free from marginalization and alienation” and he believes that hip-hop “may become a means of communication for reaching people who are difficult to reach by traditional means” in schools or through conventional media. By seizing power over the cultural means of production, some of the rappers also, however, “display strategies similar to those employed by the Labor Movement when they started their cooperative associations at the beginning of the 20th century” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437415">Söderman, 2007</xref>, p. 116).</p>
<p>However, any identification with hip-hop culture will also contain contradiction. On one hand, it appears as if the openness of this culture, its “call-and-response” structure, leads to embryos of new communities and cultural models with aesthetic codes that are particularly evident in the music. These constitute a language that in certain respects loosens up ethnic boundaries and can create new forms of alliances as a basis for constructive dialogues and learning processes. On the other hand, there is a male dominance and an amplified and exaggerated homophobic masculinity that has become the centerpiece of this culture; particularly its commercial fraction.</p>
<p>The political actions and the cultural expressions of hip-hop have been dominated by young men. However, there are signs that young women are becoming more visible. This is a clear tendency globally and in the neighborhoods where we have been doing our ethnography. There is an increased female participation in rap music and break dance, and increasing attention is now given to global multimedia festivals for women encompassing the elements of hip-hop. These organizations enable alternative images of women to be projected to the often stereotypical and one-sided ones of mainstream commercial varieties. The B-Girl Be and Ladies of hip-hop festivals provide examples of attempts to dispel myths and provide tools, connections, creative spaces, and role models so that females can be creators and innovators in hip-hop culture in the future.</p>
<p>Thinking of hip-hop as part of a project for adult education is a principle intention of the universal Zulu Nation and is certainly not foreign to members of FDInc. Several of them have attended courses arranged by adult educational associations that support and help them organize study circles. These organizations are given money from the state for cultural activities, and there is also “popular-education” based on activities from primarily the trade unions. This education has given the collective insight into the historical context in which adult education emerged during the first decades of the last century as part of the workers struggle and has shown clear historical parallels to them with respect to their situation.</p>
<p>Laslo described the group’s intentions as “a kind of adult education for our time” that tries to get people they become involved with and who become involved with them to develop both personal and intellectual goals. There is an intention to help a sense of belonging to develop. Without this sense of belonging, the members mean that the youngsters they meet risk being just another immigrant kid that the media and criminal gangs can exploit. The aim is to find that sense of being something and belonging so that the temptations from gang iconography and the mutations of mainstream “Othering” can be rearticulated, reunderstood, resisted, and transformed.</p>
<p>But how does the youth culture practiced challenge mainstream understandings of what it means to learn and what is needed and involved in learning practices? The hip-hop of the FDInc. involves a kind of learning and development of life strategies of informal learning in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912437415">Leadbeater (2000)</xref> that deal with areas the schools have not been able to provide for. Within the framework of the collective and through its activities, capacities are developed that compensate for a marginalized and stigmatized existence. This does not happen in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>). However, beyond this the group has also developed insights that are valuable to wider society. Through the cultural expressions that are formed by them from both below and within, they comment strongly on and portray social problems and conflicts and how they can be dealt with in a different way to the mainstream and conventional. In the youth culture of the territorially stigmatized suburbs, the inquiry and learning that takes place is governed by the needs and realities of young people from the heart of the places themselves and this helps form an alternative voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912437415">Söderman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the collective’s artistic productions—in rap texts, plays, films, and so forth—questions are raised that have not been answered in the schools. Why are our neighborhoods stigmatized? How should the increasing class divisions between different parts of the urban landscape be understood? Does society have to consist of winners and losers? Why did we, of all people, end up in these poor areas? The young people’s search for answers to these questions is intertwined with their aesthetic practices. If municipal schools in marginalized suburban areas want to develop opportunities for dealing with their situation, they could start from this position and open up to the world of their pupils. This is what makes it so important to respect their cultural expressions. As Paul Willis wrote a few years ago,
<disp-quote>
<p>Informal education sites can offer access to cultural commodities on terms controllable by young people, maintaining a critical difference from private sites of consumption in their recognition of informal <italic>cultural production</italic> and in their attempts to connect it with more formal expression: speaking, writing, singing, recording, and filming. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912437415">Willis, 2004</xref>, p. 194)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By not attending to the insights and criticism developed in local youth culture, schools may miss making essential contributions to key discussions about how social development can be understood or how social problems can be dealt with. The kind of autonomous activities taking place in the hip-hop collective can be seen as an arena for various forms of learning in the urban context in this sense. Stigmatization has sent these young people off to reservations in which the contact with the surrounding society is limited. One important aspect of efforts to break segregation patterns in Swedish society is to create arenas in which young people in particular are made more visible.</p>
<p>In this context, and as expressed by Willis above and, if in a different way, by our informants throughout the article, cultural expressions from below can provide an ideal starting point for creating meeting places between different social, ethnic, and religious groups and for providing young people from these different backgrounds who share similar experiences with opportunities to play an important role. This is now beginning to take shape in many big city suburbs in Sweden, but it would benefit from a more active and far-reaching participation from a school system in which education and learning are self-evident components of the creation of truly democratic living conditions for all citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912437415">Beach &amp; Sernhede, 2011</xref>). This would be a school that the pupils could perceive as their own and that could answer their questions by speaking openly about discrimination and stigmatization. It would be a school that conceives of itself as involved in mobilization for genuine citizenship and that is prepared to meet and learn from the world around it. Such a school could become an important building block for a globally connected and vital civil society.</p>
<p>Similar issues are discussed in contributions to Ladson-Billings and Gillborn’s book addressing race and racism in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912437415">2005</xref>). As they point out, schools and classrooms are not neutral spaces but rather contested arenas within which the representation of marginalized groups is dependent on the willingness and capabilities of teachers to challenge historical givens and raise awareness of racial images and the impact they have. Schools should, they write, but are rarely able to, reduce marginalization through the recognition and promotion of historically disenfranchised peoples to challenge historical dogma and offer nonviolent counternarratives.</p>
