<abstract>
<p>In Pakistan, absence of a nationwide surveillance mechanism and strategy is the main reason for the failure in effectively controlling communicable diseases. The seasonal outbreaks of various infectious diseases every year call for an integrated surveillance system on a national level for planning effective preventive strategies. Opportunity to adopt a tested and tried model exists at this time in terms of the “Disease Early Warning System” set up by World Health Organization in conflict-affected districts. Replicating this system in other districts is both practical and feasible as technical support is readily available through the World Health Organization. Such a system once put in place has potential to not only decrease morbidity and mortality through early detection and prompt control of outbreaks but also to facilitate effective financial, human resource, and materials management at the district level. This would be a step toward a more responsive health system at the local level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infectious diseases are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. This is to some extent due to the absence of an effective and integrated disease surveillance mechanism and failure of many countries to plan for effective disease control programs. Disease surveillance systems form the basis of an effective strategy to control and prevent communicable diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends effective response systems for the control of infectious diseases, which are not possible without an efficient surveillance system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510395377">1</xref></sup> Such systems are instrumental in gathering data on the occurrence of health events and in monitoring the trends over time, in addition to operating as a tool to assess the effectiveness of health interventions and services offered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510395377">2</xref></sup> A vital element for establishing and sustaining a disease surveillance system in developing countries is its viability and cost effectiveness. Models of such practical and inexpensive systems implemented in other developing countries can serve as examples for others to follow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510395377">3</xref></sup> In the absence of an effective routine disease surveillance system, a syndromic surveillance system implemented in the milieu of a natural disaster can serve as a model for replication in other regions of the country. One such district-level syndromic surveillance system was set up and implemented in Pakistan by the WHO in the districts affected by the massive earthquake of 2005. Later on, this system was extended to cover the flood-affected districts in 2007 and conflict-affected districts of Northern Pakistan in 2009. This article will attempt to discuss the potentials and implications of replicating such a surveillance system in other districts of Pakistan and will analyze the barriers and constraints thereof. Moreover, possibility of integrating the individual surveillance systems implemented by various vertical programs into the national Health Management Information System (HMIS) of the country will also be discussed.</p>

<title>The Eventful Scene</title>
<p>All kinds of disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, or mass displacement of people due to conflict, pose harmful consequences as a result of the interaction between the hazards, vulnerability of the population, and the degree of exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510395377">4</xref></sup> In October 2005, an early morning earthquake of magnitude 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the northern areas of Pakistan. This resulted in widespread destruction, with an estimated 74 650 people dead, 76 000 injured, and another 2.8 million left homeless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510395377">5</xref></sup> Health sector infrastructure was extensively damaged or destroyed in the majority of the affected districts and there was a significant loss of human resources from first-line care facilities through death and displacement. The breakdown of traditional community structures, the loss of family support systems, long-distance immigration, and economic uncertainty have put many people in a precarious situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510395377">6</xref></sup> Consequently, at a time when a large number of people were left without adequate shelter, safe water supply, and basic sanitation facilities, very low or nonavailability of health care services left the earthquake-affected population vulnerable to many epidemics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539510395377">Figure 1</xref>). As part of the humanitarian response in such disasters, establishing an Early Warning and Response System for prompt detection of disease outbreaks is a priority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510395377">7</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Within days of the said disaster, the WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health Pakistan, designed, arranged, and implemented a district-level, weekly Disease Early Warning Systems (DEWS) in the earthquake-affected area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510395377">8</xref></sup> This system was developed in consultation with all the stakeholders involved in health planning, namely, the public sector, United Nations agencies, international and national nongovernmental organizations, to ensure its acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. An attempt was made to comprehensively recruit both public and private care facilities of all levels of care and located throughout the district as reporting sites. It started with weekly reporting from 20 facilities and has since grown to include more than 300 facilities, covering 3.5 million affected people (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1010539510395377">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510395377">9</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Through a prioritization process, 12 health events were included. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510395377">Table 1</xref> displays a list of these events. Active surveillance procedures were put in place with trained surveillance staff investigating the reported cases and actively pursuing the secondary contacts. The weekly number of health events in terms of morbidity and mortality were collected in 2 age groups (&lt;5 years and ≥5 years). A computer application was developed for data entry, data analysis, and production of a comprehensive weekly bulletin. By each weekend, the reports and data were submitted to the district health offices and 5 WHO hub offices in the earthquake-affected districts, where they were compiled and analyzed with a report submitted to the National Institute of Health at the federal level for consolidation and publication of a weekly morbidity and mortality report (WMMR). This WMMR was then distributed to policy makers at the federal, provincial, and district levels to facilitate decision making. The public health laboratory at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, acted as the reference laboratory for disease diagnosis requiring laboratory confirmation. The consistent standardized case definitions, weekly reporting forms, and alert thresholds were hence achieved.</p>

<p>Although no documented evidence exists, personal communication of the author with the surveillance team at the WHO shows that numerous outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea and acute respiratory infections were successfully controlled since the inception of the said surveillance mechanism in the earthquake-affected districts. Several alerts have been received, investigated, and responded to, well in time. This has resulted in containment of many potential outbreaks in the disaster-affected areas in Pakistan, demonstrating the strength of the early warning system to prevent morbidity and mortality at a large scale. It is noteworthy that in the early days following the disasters, there was a massive congregation of internally displaced population from many areas into relief camps and make-shift shelters. Early implementation of the DEWS reporting mechanisms virtually identified number of cases of diarrhea, scabies, and respiratory infections, leading to prompt action being taken to prevent all these infections from becoming epidemics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1010539510395377">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The successful implementation of the DEWS in the districts struck by repeatedly disasters creates an opportunity for Pakistan to adopt the system as a routine surveillance mechanism nationwide. There is a strong need for the district health authorities to strengthen their operational and technical capacity in order to take ownership of the existing disease warning and response system. Replication of similar systems in other districts and provinces could lead to an integrated and effective surveillance mechanism all across the country for the control of communicable and infectious diseases and can serve as a tool to improve our state of preparedness in the wake of future disasters. This can be undertaken as a phased approach starting with the local management of the system as currently designed, followed by the integration of the DEWS into the Pakistan’s national Health Management Information System (HMIS) to foster a permanent and sustainable role for it within the already existing government systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510395377">10</xref></sup> The information generated by this system could then be used to make policy-level decisions, plan interventions, and ensure preparedness for future outbreaks on a countrywide level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1010539510395377">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1010539510395377">
<title>Implications and Challenges</title>
<p>There are many factors that need to be considered and addressed before implementing and up-scaling the DEWS across the country.</p>
<sec id="section4-1010539510395377">
<title>Human Resource</title>
<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the health authorities, especially at the district level, is the paucity of trained human resource for activities such as needs assessment, priority setting, monitoring, disease surveillance, project management, and so on. In particular, an effective surveillance system needs trained public health personnel skilled in surveillance and prevention interventions at all levels of the health system. Capacity building in terms of training of human resource will be an issue of utmost priority.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510395377">
<title>Logistics and Financing</title>
<p>Surveillance systems are an expensive proposition. This is due to the fact that logistic support is crucial for the information produced by the system. This means acquisition of computers, office supplies, vehicles, surveillance tools, and communication facilities. In some remote localities, such logistic support would be very difficult to provide but alternatives could be worked out for such special scenarios. However, such logistics are already in place in most of the districts in terms of HMIS infrastructure, which can be used to complement the activities under DEWS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539510395377">
<title>Sensitization of the District Authorities</title>
<p>The district health authorities although appreciative of the effectiveness of the surveillance system are not actively involved in it. The foremost reason for this noninvolvement is a severe dearth of trained health personnel who could understand the role that such a surveillance mechanism could play in improving their own performance and overall health services delivery. Another limitation is the lack of budget allocations for surveillance activities. In prioritizing issues, surveillance activities are not given primary importance. This is partly due to the workload and perhaps due to nonrecognition of the importance of surveillance data and its use in further planning for prevention. For implementation of an effective surveillance and response mechanism, the health staff at all strata, from the grassroots to the Ministry of Health at the federal level, must show commitment and ownership toward such a system, which can only be achieved through information, motivation, training, and ongoing monitoring. This is a challenge that the government has to accept and invest in if such a system has to be successful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539510395377">
<title>Laboratory and Diagnostic Facilities</title>
<p>At present, only 1 reference public health laboratory at the National Institute of Health is available at the central level. For a country of 160 million people and with a burden of rampant infectious diseases only 1 public health laboratory is far less than sufficient. Shortage of such facilities is a serious constraint for timely processing of specimens. Functioning reference public health laboratories should be available ideally at the district level, if not at least at the provincial level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539510395377">
<title>Collaboration and Integration Into the National HMIS</title>
<p>The presence of multiple vertical surveillance systems leads to duplication of efforts and wastage of already scarce resources. An integrated approach starting from the central level and trickling down to the district level can be a major step in strengthening the surveillance mechanism. This will require political will and commitment at the Ministry of Health level together with sound policy making and implementation in this regard. Integration and coordination of various vertical surveillance systems with the district health information system and then linking up with the national HMIS is therefore needed to make the entire system functional and useful.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1010539510395377" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nonavailability of trained human resource is an issue of serious concern and requires immediate attention. Induction of epidemiologists to fill in positions at the district and the regional levels has to be undertaken forthwith. This could be accomplished by offering more incentives in terms of salary and job benefits to lure qualified personnel (doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and other paramedical staff). This should be supplemented by on-the-job trainings and workshops in field epidemiology designed for health staff working at district levels. In the longer term, more emphasis has to be given to training in epidemiology and public health in medical schools with revision of the current curriculum as it is inadequate at present. A more practical, short-term, and cost-effective solution could ensure the sustainability of the system in Pakistan. A community-based model using lay people such as village health volunteers were used in Cambodia to set up a very cost-effective and efficient surveillance mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510395377">11</xref></sup> A novel approach would be to involve the National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care workforce of lady health workers (LHWs) for reporting of health events. Currently, there are about 100 000 LHWs working in communities offering health promotion and preventive care services across Pakistan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510395377">12</xref></sup> Involving the LHWs in surveillance activities will build on the strengths of existing human resource within the government infrastructure.</p>
<p>Health management information systems in most developing countries are weak and are in need of major reforms. In recent years, Pakistan has made some progress in modernizing its HMIS, but it is limited to the national and provincial levels. Like many other developing countries, lack of technological and communication infrastructure is a hurdle, particularly in collecting authentic data from the rural areas where the majority of the population resides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510395377">13</xref></sup> The current state of HMIS in Pakistan is beleaguered by inadequate coverage, poor quality of data, and lack of timeliness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510395377">14</xref></sup> In this situation, adoption and incorporation of an existing and tested model for surveillance on a countrywide level can result in strengthening of the HMIS. Coordination and collaboration of the various vertical surveillance systems at various levels (district, provincial, national, LHWs, and vertical programs) can also go a long way in developing an integrated and effective district-level surveillance system.</p>
<p>For surveillance systems to work efficiently, robust logistic support is of utmost importance. The availability of logistic support such as vehicles, fuel, media for collecting specimen, and specimen carriers for the timely and effective collection of specimen and alert/outbreak investigation is essential. The availability of electronic tools such as computers and statistical software make analysis and report generation much more effective and efficient. The district health authorities have to ensure that all the materials and support necessary for the optimal functioning of the system are readily available. There is a need to allocate a separate budget for surveillance and outbreak response activities and the related expense.</p>
<p>At the level of the district health offices a change in the organizational culture and mindset will be required. As seen in similar scenarios in other developing countries, traditionally, priority is given to issues relating to provision of curative services on an individual patient level, whereas the community-wide or containment of risks approach is yet to seep in.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510395377">15</xref></sup> Reporting of notifiable diseases is another issue that needs immediate attention. Currently, there is no system for the notification of diseases of public health importance by the health service providers in Pakistan. Legislation addressing this issue is the need of the hour as this could also lead to an early warning and prompt action thereby improving the control measures against such diseases. This will require continuous training and mentoring of the district health officials to make them aware of the modern public health approaches. However, this process will require commitment and ownership at the highest governmental echelons and a fundamental restructuring of the health system to integrate a surveillance mechanism that can generate a feedback system to bring about a change in approach from patient-centered strategies to community-based interventions. An intersectoral effort would also be required to embark on health education and health promotion strategies among the affected communities, but taking into consideration their socioeconomic and cultural dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510395377">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Laboratories are lacking in diagnostic capabilities, which stem from either lack of trained laboratory personnel or nonavailability of equipment and supplies as is the case in many developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510395377">17</xref></sup> A study conducted in 2006 reported that 54% of the health facilities were without any lab facilities in District Bagh (an earthquake-affected district with operational DEWS) and the ones that did have a lab were inadequately equipped.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510395377">18</xref></sup> Allocation of funds for establishing reference laboratories and/or advocacy with foreign donors for acquisition of funds to undertake this challenge should be included in the priority list. Another approach would be to use the already present resources in terms of laboratories present in the various public hospitals. Up-gradation of these existing laboratory facilities to be commissioned as public health laboratories could be achieved with relatively lesser funds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1010539510395377" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pakistan with a high burden of infectious diseases is in dire need of a robust integrated surveillance system on a national level. Communicable diseases, particularly vaccine-preventable diseases and diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, malaria, hepatitis C, and meningitis, account for around half of the deaths in Pakistan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510395377">19</xref></sup> The information on disease outbreak patterns collected can be used to adequately equip and prepare primary health care facilities for future outbreaks, especially of seasonal communicable diseases. Poorly developed health infrastructure has played an important role in holding back any previous attempts toward an effective data collection and response mechanism. Effective control of presently rampant communicable diseases can only be achieved through obtaining firm commitment and buy-in from the federal government authorities; training of the human resource at the primary care level on data collection, analysis, and alert/outbreak investigation; building laboratory capacity at all levels in the district to allow for quicker confirmation of cases of priority diseases; and allocation of ample funds to manage an integrated disease surveillance and response system independently. These steps would facilitate the adoption of the entire early warning system by the district health system from simple data collection through all aspects of epidemic preparedness and investigation to field visits and laboratory analysis.</p>
