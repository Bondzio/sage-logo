<p>In <italic>Brazilian Immigrants in the United States</italic>, Bernadete Beserra focuses on the role of cultural imperialism in shaping the identities of Brazilians in Los Angeles, drawing on the literature on colonizing and hegemonic processes to develop a thesis on the process of adaptation and acculturation and the way these immigrants are viewed. A key aspect of her account is Brazilians’ effort to set themselves apart from other Latino communities in the United States. She identifies this as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative stereotypes associated with the three main Latin American immigrant groups, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban. She clearly details the condition of Latino immigrants, defined by mainstream white America as a homogeneous group of second- or even third-class citizens whose sole purpose is to serve the white majority (in their homes as domestics and gardeners, in their restaurants as servers and dishwashers, and even in their schools as teachers). To step out of this rigid definition is to challenge the social order, and step out we Brazilians (and other Latinos) do. Beserra shows that this means double duty for Brazilians: not just setting themselves apart from other Latin American groups but proving that they are on the same level as (or better than) white Americans.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of a positive identity, Brazilians face a much larger challenge in the encounter with the imperialist project. Beserra addresses the American sense of entitlement stemming from the colonial project initiated in Europe and translated into the concept of Manifest Destiny. She refers to the Brazilian immigrant experience in Southern California as leading to the recognition of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12457350">Mignolo (2005</xref>: xii) calls “the colonial wound,” part of American imperialism and the colonial expansion project, which imposes a feeling of inferiority on human beings “who do not fit the predetermined model of Euro-American narratives.” It is because of this colonial trauma that Brazilians attempt to create a place for themselves as a group apart from the other Latin Americans and forge an identity outside of the stereotypes of the Latino immigrant. But Beserra’s narrative points to the difficulty they have in doing so.</p>
<p>Beserra explores the reasons Brazilians immigrate to the United States, beginning with the simplistic “to make money” and “to better one’s life” and then moving beyond these economic explanations. Referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12457350">Pierre Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> concept of types of capital, she sees leaving Brazil as not just a way of increasing one’s economic capital but a way of gaining social, symbolic, and cultural capital. Mastering the English language is seen as at the least a gain in symbolic capital and as an upgrade of Brazilian identity. Thus she situates Brazilian immigration to Los Angeles in the imperialist project of modernization, the American ideology, and the homogenization of practices of consumption, a process that operates to fix Brazilian immigrants in the same inferior location as other Latinos in American society. She finds that Brazilians living in the Los Angeles area tend to maintain the same class position they held in Brazil and attributes this to the rigidity of the Brazilian class system.</p>
<p>Beserra argues that the religious group she studied (Adventists in the city of Chino) is not representative of the “common Brazilian stereotypes” embodied in samba dancers and bikini-clad women. In my view, it is the most representative of Brazilian cultural patterns and social life: conservative, religious, and maintainers of the status quo, reproducing a hegemonic ideology that favors males and elites. The contradiction and source of misreading lies in the low inhibition displayed in, especially, the female body, itself a facet of traditionalism as an affirmation of patriarchy and male domination.</p>
<p>The most interesting subject in nearly all of Beserra’s interviews is racism and class differentiation based on race, which are constantly compared with Brazilian “equality.” The process of Americanization remains incomplete because of this difference in the concept of race. In the United States racism is acknowledged and open to debate. In Brazil, the truth about racism is denied but racism is exercised openly (with jokes and assumptions about blacks and restricted access to resources). Brazilians arrive in the United States carrying these hegemonic notions of race, and, prompted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12457350">Gilberto Freyre’s (1946 [1936])</xref> study, the belief that Brazil is a racial democracy is reinforced by distance and longing, glossing over the deep racial divide in Brazil and romanticizing Brazilian culture.</p>
