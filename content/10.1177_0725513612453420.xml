<abstract>
<p>The collapse of the Weimar Republic remains central to the history of the 20th century and to contemporary debates on 'classical modernity' and its Europe-wide crisis in the wake of the First World War. The present issue of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> focuses on three dimensions of the Weimar crisis: the experience of fundamental societal crisis and closure and its diagnostic power in relation to the rise of fascist movements; the cognitive and normative resources that sought to work against this crisis-ridden sense of closure; and third, the degree to which these counter tendencies anticipate postmodern interrogations of the premises of classical modernity.</p>

<p>‘Bonn is not Weimar’, declared the founders of West Germany’s new Federal Republic after 1945. Democracy in Germany, they hoped, would never again succumb to the weaknesses that had made possible the rise of National Socialism from the ashes of Weimar. The new political and constitutional arrangements would be constructed so as never again to grant opportunity to forces opposed to the very system of democratic liberties.</p>
<p>Any number of variations of this slogan seem to find resonance in Western normative discourse today. Democracy in Europe and the West, it is avowed time and again, shall never again be the midwife of dictatorship. The new order of the West founded in 1945 was not to be, and shall never again be, or in any way resemble, the terrible disorder of the 1920s and 1930s – the beleaguered and benighted old Europe of the inter-war decades.</p>
<p>As Western societies today look more continuous than ever before with the feverish cocktail of circumstances that produced the stock market crash of 1929 and the resultant social and political meltdown of the 1930s, it seems important to be asking ourselves once again about this peculiar contemporary sense of an angst of history. More and more, the recognition seems to be growing that phenomena that were once thought to be culturally unique to European national societies between the wars are looking ever more like familiar recurring features of Western liberal democratic capitalist societies of the present day, undergoing basic crises of legitimation. Increasingly the sense has emerged that the German and wider continental European experience of the malaise of the early 1930s was and is not a unique historical development confined to its time but a structural societal phenomenon, eminently capable of returning in some functionally analogous pattern. The collapse of Western financial markets in 2008 and the ensuing recession has indeed been only another reminder of commonalities with the past as the myopia of governments addicted to neoliberal economic policies resembles ever more closely the perilous state of affairs of degraded social solidarity in Europe after 1918.</p>
<p>It is against this background that the present issue of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> looks afresh at the relevance of German intellectual and artistic culture from the years of the Weimar Republic. Written primarily by authors with backgrounds in the social sciences but drawing closely on the latest research of specialist historians and literary scholars, the essays collected here reengage normatively with the wealth of social, political and cultural thought and criticism conceived in Germany during the years of the Republic and disseminated after its demise.</p>
<p>A central point of departure for us is Detler Peukert’s seminal book of 1987, <italic>The Weimar Republic: The Crisis Years of Classical Modernity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612453420">Peukert, 1992</xref>), which still stands out today as one of the most compelling attempts to elaborate a deep holistic explanatory account of Weimar’s downfall and the rise of the Third Reich. Against the notion of any entirely nationally unique and longstanding German cultural resistance to democratic modernity, Germany’s Weimar crisis, Peukert argued, is best regarded as a reflection of a more universal configuration of challenges faced by all modern states and societies undergoing processes of rapid organizational transformation. In Peukert’s terminology, many societies underwent particular phases of crisis at the height of the age of ‘classical modernity’. In Europe, these ‘crisis years of classical modernity’ occurred in a period marked by the outbreak of the First World War and the two decades of its aftermath. But the <italic>differentia specifica</italic> of the German case was the unparalleled degree of socio-economic dislocation suffered by the mass of the population within a short period of time relative to elsewhere – military defeat in 1918, revolution and virtual civil war thereafter, hyper-inflation in 1922–3, credit dependency throughout the 1920s, and total vulnerability to global economic breakdown at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Building on the thematic opened up and synthesized by Peukert as well as on more recent work that has sought to qualify, attenuate and refine his framework, the articles in this issue of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> have broadly three broad interrelated goals. A first centres on explanatory diagnoses of Weimar and the rise of fascist totalitarian politics in general by reference to Peukert’s idea of an experience of fundamental societal crisis and closure. A second goal is to explore the validity of counterfactual thinking in the period in terms of an appreciation of alternative cognitive resources that might have yielded a different outcome in Germany after 1930, had socio-economic circumstances been more favourable to this end, and in terms of these resources' intrinsic normative relevance for contemporary discussion. A third undertaking is to consider how Weimar intellectual culture looks forward to dimensions of the radicalized cultural reflexivity of societies that have been addressed in recent times under the various rubrics of `post-', `late', `second' or `post-Eurocentric' modernity.</p>
<p>In the first essay, Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612453420">Makropoulos (2012</xref>) elaborates Peukert’s paradigm of crisis to shed light on how the shattering of social order and the critical experience of the contingency of social relations in Germany after the war plunged the country into a seemingly endless ‘state of emergency’ that in turn would provoke a corresponding longing for a new totality. In this open undetermined situation of crisis, modernity appears as a permanent transitional situation in which collective social expectations have lost their bearings – in much the same sense in which Reinhart Koselleck analysed the pathological turn taken by the French Revolution in his influential book of 1954, <italic>Critique and Crisis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612453420">Koselleck 1998</xref>). Over against the deafening calls of voices on both the right and left for restored, unitary and ordered reality, commentators such as Karl Mannheim, Robert Musil or Helmut Plessner recognized the need to live with inescapably heterogeneous, fissured, multiple worlds of political identity and authority. In this perspective what was called ‘crisis’ at this time could have been recognized as a general situation of the contingency, uncertainty, indeterminacy and complexity of modern societal conditions in a rapidly changing age – conditions that in some way had to be creatively and courageously embraced.</p>
<p>David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612453420">Roberts (2012</xref>) explores how, from a perspective of the historical crisis of the modern age, technology would be construed as fate or destiny by authors from Oswald Spengler to Ernst Jünger and Martin Heidegger. But Roberts contrasts Heidegger’s return to antiquity in search of a way beyond the crisis of modernity with Ernst Cassirer’s little known outline of a philosophy of technology from 1930, also written against the background of the crisis of modernity in the Weimar Republic and mainly directed against the influence of Spengler. Roberts considers how Cassirer’s reading of the disclosive, liberating possibilities of technology points to an affinity between modern technology and art as opposed to the affinity between ancient technology and art that Heidegger discerns in the original conception of <italic>techne</italic>. It was in this connection that Cassirer wrote of the ‘possibilization’ of the world as ‘the greatest and the most remarkable achievement of technology’.</p>
<p>In <italic>Die ‘Krise’ der Weimarer Republik: Zur Kritik eines Deutungsmusters</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612453420">Föllmer and Graf 2005</xref>), a path-breaking critique of German historiographical literature on Weimar of the last 40 years, Moritz Föllmer and Rüdiger Graf argue that the naming and diagnosis of crisis by particular actors or groups of actors in the period could frequently serve strategic intent. In their contribution to this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612453420">Föllmer and Graf (2012</xref>) emphasize how, under the heading of crisis, complex and perplexing experiences could be arranged in satisfying narrative form and thereby made to rationalize and justify particular perspectives on the world carried by particular groups and milieus. Föllmer and Graf argue in this way that while deep-seated structural conjunctures played their part in the calamitous events of early 20th-century European history, any general or systemic crisis cannot be taken as a thing in itself but only as something mediated by particular perceptions and value-orientations of particular groups and not as something straight-forwardly deployable by historians with an independent or self-evident explanatory value allowing for clear and transparent links between situation and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612453420">Morgan (2012</xref>) takes up Föllmer and Graf’s argument about the narratively constructed character of crisis discourses in the Weimar Republic to show how, in the arena of sexual identities and gender roles, any sense of crisis is at the same time, for some actors, also an affirmative moment of opening and opportunity, a liberation from hitherto oppressive normative expectations and conventions. The situation of crisis would enable an opening up of fields of representation of hitherto taboo, prohibited, censored, or one-dimensional sexuality as writers began to explore ideas of male homosexuality as the basis for individual and group identity outside the accepted boundaries of civic life. Drawing on two literary works of the period, Max René Hesse’s novel <italic>Partenau</italic> and Thomas Mann’s novella ‘Mario and the Magician’, Morgan considers the possibilities and the limitations of Weimar masculinism as an enabling framework for male homosexuals.</p>
<p>Austin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612453420">Harrington (2012</xref>) also takes up the question of ways of thinking about the consciousness of crisis in the Weimar Republic that point not so much to a sense of decline or downfall but to an openness on the part of the intellectual advance-guard of the period to plurality, conflict, dissension and fragmentation as authentic challenges of life in a modern age. This applies not only to Weimar ideas about sex, gender and social class but also to German debates of the time about European ethno-cultural and civilizational self-understandings. Through an exploration of some neglected writings by authors from Ernst Troeltsch to Max Scheler, Karl Jaspers, Helmuth Plessner and the Weber brothers, Harrington considers here how Weimar Germany produced – arguably uniquely in the period – a body of penetrating interrogations of the truth-claims of European philosophical and theological world pictures in the wake of the First World War. Harrington shows how a clear consciousness existed of tasks of European immanent self-critique and cognitive self-transformation from within – some six or seven decades before the rise of the discourses of globalization and Eurocentrism that predominate in debates of the present day.</p>
<p>Christine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612453420">Magerski (2012</xref>) examines Arnold Gehlen’s reading of the history of visual art since the early 20th century as an experience of the gradual exhaustion of motors of immanent development in art and their replacement by processes of institutional ritualization. As Magerski highlights, Gehlen understood this process as one aspect of the rise of <italic>post-histoire</italic> in 20th-century social self-consciousness. As Magerski shows, even as Gehlen’s general philosophical anthropology has the taint of compromise with fascist politics, his late book of 1960, <italic>Zeit-Bilder</italic>, offers a wealth of insights on the Weimar and high-modernist experience of defeat of the utopian social political aspirations of the avant-garde by the end of the 1920s and the withdrawal of art thereafter into its own autonomous, self-protected institutional space. His conservatism notwithstanding, not only does Gehlen anticipate postmodernism with his theory of post-histoire, he also offers an interesting sociological alternative to Theodor W. Adorno’s reading of the crisis of modern art.</p>
<p>Two last papers in this issue revisit the seemingly inexhaustible pertinence of the Frankfurt School and the thought of Adorno for contemporary reflection. The veteran German theorist Helmut Dahmer, who studied with Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas and Plessner in the 1960s, offers a comprehensive focused review of Adorno’s appropriation of psychoanalysis – an appropriation shaped profoundly by the social conflicts and pathologies of the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612453420">Dahmer (2012</xref>) underscores, psychoanalysis always had meaning for Adorno only in conjunction with sociology and not in disciplinary isolation – and not least because, in an age of societal mass administration, the individual as psychoanalysis’s primary unit of reference becomes an essentially problematic concept. In particular, Dahmer pinpoints Adorno’s observation that psychoanalysis arrives on the scene of European culture at just the moment that the individual, and the concomitant bourgeois idea of autonomy and self-flourishing of the individual, comes under threat from processes of industrial bureaucratization and the consequences of capital concentration. No longer autonomous beings, individuals become mere extensions of their economic functions, and the consequent ego weakness leads to an externalization of the superego in the reified form of authoritarian totems and mass leaders.</p>
<p>David Kettler and Thomas Wheatland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612453420">2012</xref>) round off this issue with the protocol of a discussion between Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse and Franz Neumann in New York on 17 January 1941, in which the exiled former members of the Institut für Sozialforschung in Frankfurt deliberate about research funding opportunities from American sources (mainly the Rockefeller Foundation). As this text makes clear, the Frankfurt figures reflect at the same time on differences between European and American university situations and in part on the bearing of the stagnation of academic philosophy and mistrust of the social sciences in Germany since the 19th century on the travails of Weimar and the possibility of its downfall in 1933. The transcription of this meeting, entitled ‘Debate about methods in the social sciences’, translated here by Kettler and Wheatland, reveals the differing attitudes taken by the Frankfurt theorists to the question of compromise with American empiricist traditions in social science. As Kettler and Wheatland point out in their introduction to the document, Neumann’s comments anticipate a subsequent lecture of his from 1953 on the failings of social and political responsibility of universities in Germany compared with their American counterparts.</p>
