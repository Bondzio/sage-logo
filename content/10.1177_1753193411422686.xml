<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We present a case of a 24-year-old man with right thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint locking due to radial sesamoid displacement. The patient presented 5 days following a sports related injury caused by a blow to the palmar aspect of the joint. Examination showed a hyperextension posture of the joint. Both active and passive joint motions were limited and painful. Radiography showed ulnar subluxation of the thumb MCP joint under an interposed radial sesamoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411422686">Figure 1</xref>). An attempt at closed reduction of the displaced sesamoid with a digital block failed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Open exploration found that the radial sesamoid was radially and distally displaced and trapped in the space of the MCP joint by both the radial condylar ridge of metacarpal head (RCRMH) and abductor pollicis brevis, thus blocking reduction. The radial portion of the flexor pollicis brevis muscle and its tendon were also displaced radially. The volar plate was not attached to its metacarpal origin with partial proximal avulsion associated with a longitudinal tear between the radial and ulnar sesamoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411422686">Figure 2</xref>). The radial sesamoid was not adherent to the volar plate. The proper and accessory radial collateral ligaments were intact but also entrapped.</p>

(C) Both the RCRMH and abductor pollicis brevis prevent reduction of the radial sesamoid. (D) Horizontal plane of the thumb MCP joint. When performing extension of the joint, the tendon of extensor pollicis brevis causes lateral displacement of the radial sesamoid through the connective tissues. The abductor pollicis brevis prevents reduction of the radial sesamoid.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753193411422686-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Although open reduction could be achieved by retracting the radial sesamoid medially through the interval between the RCRMH and abductor pollicis brevis, recurrent entrapment of the sesamoid and locking occurred when performing joint extension. We performed a radial sesamoid excision. After re-position of the radial portion of the extensor pollicis brevis and its tendon, the volar plate was repaired and the radial portion of the extensor pollicis brevis tendon was reinforced with suture. We did not note recurrence of joint subluxation or locking. Hyperextension of the joint was corrected. Radiographs showed a reduced thumb MCP joint. Range of motion exercise was initiated 3 days after surgery. At 25 months after surgery, the joint was painless with almost normal range of motion.</p>
<p>The inter-sesamoid ligament rupture described in this report and the proposed role of the abductor pollicis brevis tendon in blocking reduction do not appear to have been previously explored. Other reported cases presented different mechanisms of joint locking, including displacement of the radial sesamoid into the intercondylar notch of the metacarpal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422686">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>), or the sesamoids and volar plate could also be trapped inside the joint thus preventing joint reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411422686">Ip et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
