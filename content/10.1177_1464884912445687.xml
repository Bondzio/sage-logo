<p>Anyone looking to <italic>The News and Public Opinion: Media Effects on Civic Life</italic> for significant new insights into how the process of news coverage, opinion formation, and their impacts on public policy are related to one another might come away disappointed, as the book mostly treads across very familiar ground. But the authors manage to turn that familiarity into a strength, not a weakness.</p>
<p>The book traces the history of a large swath of the media-effects tradition with regard to public impacts of news coverage and summarizes it in a concise and effective way. Much of the book reads like a lengthy, yet well-composed, literature review. This seems to be by design; the introduction states that ‘the heart of the book [is] an examination of the empirical social science evidence about the impact of journalism on the civic life of citizens’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>This review relies heavily on agenda setting and its ‘relatives’ – notably priming, attribute agenda setting and, to some degree, framing – to explain the impacts. This is hardly surprising given the authors and their long history of work on this research agenda.</p>
<p>Other effects-tradition approaches also are covered. The limited-effects paradigm is presented as an example of some of the earliest theory-building with respect to news coverage and public opinion (Lazarsfeld’s voter studies). Uses and gratifications theory is used to discuss individual differences in exposure to and usage of political news. The knowledge-gap hypothesis is used to explain unintended effects, and information-processing approaches (such as the elaboration likelihood model and selective attention/reception) enter the analysis also. But in most cases the authors present these ideas in relation to, or sometimes in contrast with, the various elements of the agenda-setting research tradition.</p>
<p>This multi-perspective approach is a consistent feature, as when the authors explain how concepts such as ‘effects’ and even ‘audience’ are not monolithic and emphasize that understanding how such constructs work depends on definition and contexts. For example, they carefully differentiate between cognitive, affective, attitudinal, and behavioral impacts of news consumption and also distinguish intended and unintended consequences of news. They repeatedly return to the notion that channel matters, as research has consistently shown different impacts when audiences consume news through newspapers vs. television.</p>
<p>Another idea that repeatedly emerges is how media effects are almost always mitigated by other factors, and understanding those factors is crucial in assessing the effect that is being studied. The authors emphasize the hierarchy of effects, from simple exposure through awareness to cognitive and affective influences and finally to actual political behavior.</p>
<p>The review of prior work culminates in two final chapters that are each built around eight questions that the authors see as central to understanding impacts of the media on civic life. The questions address media usage and its relationship to: awareness of public affairs; public knowledge about politics; stability of opinions and attitudes; variety of opinions on public topics; political participation; political polarization; disenfranchisement and ‘gaps’ in political participation; and influences on policymaking. The penultimate chapter poses the questions and summarizes the earlier discussion related to them; the final chapter seeks to answer the questions in light of all the prior research presented. The questions are answered both empirically – describing what the research has documented as the apparent effects – and normatively, i.e. what the authors say the media effects <italic>should</italic> be for improving civic life.</p>
<p>While the book is generally thorough and effective in its discussion of this material from a legacy-media perspective, its treatment of internet-based media could have been more in-depth for a better understanding of the contemporary state of political information and its influences. For example, a brief discussion on the growth of social media such as Twitter and Facebook in news reporting concludes that ‘Understanding the effects of all these perspectives and channels, both traditional and contemporary, is essential to our knowledge of news and public opinion’ (p. 40). A later chapter on cognitive effects reports that ‘As more people use the Internet, new media will play an increasingly significant role in the diffusion of political information’ (p. 93). It would be difficult to dispute either statement, but more specific and thoughtful analysis about the concepts and ideas raised would be more beneficial.</p>
<p>The authors do return to effects of the new-media communication system in some of the answers to the eight questions in the concluding chapters, addressing such topics as the influence of citizen journalism as a form of civic participation and how a media environment built around on-demand information can lead to information-seeking that serves mostly to reinforce opinions (and what that, in turn, means with regard to polarized viewpoints). But more in-depth discussion of these topics throughout the book would help to improve our understanding of how media are affecting civic life in the contemporary age.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this book serves as a good primer and research summary for readers seeking to understand the influence of news media on public opinion and civic life.</p>
