            <p>Young age and lone parenthood are risk factors for impaired health among mothers and their children. Due to the higher risks of negative influences on physical and mental health, young and single mothers should be of special concern to the Child Health Services (CHS). In the present study, we investigated consumption patterns of child health care services among young and single mothers in Uppsala County, Sweden to study whether they are reached by the universal CHS program and if selective or indicative measures were administered in daily CHS practice. Register data on CHS contacts and socio-demographic indicators were collected for 10692 infants, born in 1998-2006. Results show small differences in contact pattern and immunization status, between children of young versus older, and single versus cohabiting mothers. However, both young (RR 0.64) and single (RR 0.80) mothers had significantly lower rates of participation in parental group. The CHS were consequently successful in implementing the universal preventive child health programme for all families, including families with young or single mothers. There was no indication, however, of an established selective preventive strategy aimed at these high risk families. Programs for strengthening the support provided to vulnerable families by the CHS are needed.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In the industrialised parts of the world parents are generally provided with child health care, which despite rather similar content shows significant differences in organisation and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512450624">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>). Sweden has a long tradition of Child Health Services (CHS), offered free of charge to all Swedish parents with children under the age of 6 years. This universal approach includes home visiting, health examinations and vaccinations at Child Health Centres (CHCs) by public health nurses and general practitioners (GPs). All parents are also to be offered participation in parenting groups, where parents of infants gather to discuss issues of mutual interest. The Swedish CHS State-of-the-Art conference in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512450624">Sundelin and Håkansson, 2000</xref>) concluded that the CHS lacked a selective perspective towards vulnerable families and proposed that indicative measures should be taken, that is, that a series of home visits should be offered in cases where the CHC nurse detected children at risk.</p>
         <p>In a number of studies, early childbearing (under 20 years of age) and single parenthood have been associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes for both mothers and their infants. Many adolescent mothers lack knowledge about normal infant growth and development as well as mother–child interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450624">Koniak-Griffin and Turner-Pluta, 2001</xref>). These mothers also tend to experience difficulties in expressing a positive maternal affect and in verbal reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512450624">Hann et al., 1996</xref>). Early childbearing mothers have been related to low educational attainment, unemployment, unskilled occupation, living as a single parent, and collecting disability pension and social allowance later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450624">Olausson et al., 2001</xref>). Children of teenage mothers have been shown to have increased risk of substance abuse, hospital admission due to suicide attempts and mortality from suicide, compared with children of older mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512450624">Ekéus et al., 2006</xref>). Findings in several Swedish studies on the offspring of young mothers show a higher risk for both unintentional and violent injuries in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512450624">Ekéus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512450624">Hjern et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
         <p>Studies based on lone parents in Italy, Sweden and Great Britain have shown that single mothers have poorer health compared with couple parents, and are more likely than mothers in two-parent households to suffer material disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512450624">Burstrom et al., 2010</xref>). Single mothers have lower levels of social capital which is associated with less self-rated health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512450624">Westin and Westerling, 2007</xref>). They also run a higher risk for premature death than mothers with partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512450624">Ringback Weitoft et al., 2000</xref>), and a higher risk for psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512450624">Wade et al., 2011</xref>). Studies suggest that this higher risk for mental disorders could be mediated by financial strain or social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512450624">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512450624">Targosz et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, single parenthood appears to be a risk factor for the children in the household. Children with single parents have in a Swedish study been shown to have increased risks of childhood psychiatric disease, suicide attempts, injury and addiction to alcohol and narcotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512450624">Weitoft et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>Due to the higher risk of short- and long-term development of physical and mental health problems, young and single mothers and their children should be of special concern to the CHS. In the present study, we investigated consumption patterns of child health care services among young and single mothers, respectively, to study whether they are reached by the universal programme, and further if the proposed selective perspective and indicative measures are reflected in daily CHS practice.</p>

         <title>Patients and methods</title>
         <p>The present quantitative cohort study was based on data from one regional database and several national registers. The sampling frame constituted the total population of 27838 children born during 1998 through 2006 from mothers registered as residents in the county of Uppsala at time of birth, and the children still being registered as residents in the county of Uppsala on the 31st of December of the year they reached the age of one. All children were registered in the database of statistics of the Child Health Care Unit in Uppsala County. Since many mothers had more than one child, only the firstborn child was selected, leaving 11958 children in the study cohort. Children born preterm (&lt; 37 weeks) and children with birth weights less than 2500g or with Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 minutes (n = 1205) were expected to have a divergent pattern of contacts with the CHC for medical reasons compared with children born at term, and were therefore excluded. Children lacking information about visiting CHC (n = 43) or the disposable income of the household of the mother (n = 18) were also excluded. The final study population thus consisted of 10,692 children distributed across 34 CHCs.</p>

            <title>Outcome variables</title>
            <p>Two types of outcome variables are analysed: binary (coded either 0 or 1) and continuous variables (which can take on any of a range of values). Data on CHC contacts and immunization status during the child’s year of birth and the following two calendar years, was collected from the database of statistics of the Child Health Care Unit in Uppsala County. This database consists of key variables from the child health records, reported according to a standard procedure by the CHC nurses. The data is collected with parental consent and linked to the personal identification number of the child. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512450624">Table 1</xref> for variable definitions. Parental group participation was counted regardless of whether it was the mother or the father that was present. Participation from fathers, however, was rather unusual.</p>

            <title>Statistical methods</title>
            <p>Continuous outcome variables are commonly analysed using linear regression, with the estimates presented as beta-coefficients. Hence, linear regression models were used to analyse the effect of socio-demographic circumstances on the number of home visits and visits at the nurse’s office. Analyses of binary variables generally use logistic regression where the estimates are presented as odds ratios. However, adjusted odds ratios derived from logistic regression tend to exaggerate the risk ratio when the studied outcome exceeds 10 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493512450624">Zhang and Yu, 1998</xref>). This is the case for the three binary outcomes in our study (received home visiting; ≥ 6 visits at the nurse’s office; and participation in parental group). In such cases, risk ratios based on, for example, Poisson regression have been suggested as an alternative to odds ratios as they provide more interpretable estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512450624">Barros and Hirakata, 2003</xref>). Consequently, we have used Poisson regression in the analyses of the binary variables.</p>
            <p>All analyses, of both continuous and binary outcome variables, were performed using multilevel modelling with the children (n = 10692) at level 1 and the CHCs (n = 34) at level 2. Multilevel modelling makes it possible to simultaneously examine outcome variance at the individual and contextual level, in this case the child/family versus CHC-unit. For example the total variance in home visits between single mothers and cohabiting mothers can be divided into the variance that is influenced by individual factors (e.g. the tendency by mothers to accept home visits) and factors that are connected to the CHCs (time available for the nurse to perform the home visit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450624">Merlo et al., 2005</xref>). The influence of maternal age and single motherhood on the outcome variables was analysed in three models. Model 1 was an empty model, without explanatory or confounding variables, carried out to investigate the difference between the CHC on the outcome. Model 2 was used to test the effect of maternal age and single motherhood, respectively, on the outcome variables. The model was adjusted for the children’s year and month of birth. Finally, in model 3, the disposable income of the household of the mothers was added. Results were expressed as beta-coefficients with <italic>p</italic>-values (5% level of significance) in the linear regression analyses, and risk ratios (RR) with 95 per cent confidence intervals (95% CI) in the Poisson regression analyses. Additionally the occurrence of contextual effects at the CHC level was estimated by intra-class correlation (ICC) in the linear regression and median odds ratio (MOR) in the Poisson regression. The ICC is the proportion of the total variance attributable to the group level, in this case the CHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450624">Merlo et al., 2005</xref>). The median odds ratio can be thought of as the median change in odds an individual incurs when moving from one CHC to another CHC with higher risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450624">Merlo et al., 2006</xref>). Interaction analyses were carried out to investigate the effect of combinations of the independent variable categories on outcome measures. The statistical analyses were performed using the MLWin ver. 2.23 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512450624">Rasbash et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

         <p>All study children had at least one contact with the CHS nurse during the child’s year of birth and the two following years. The mean number of home visits was 1.4 and the mean number of visits at the nurse’s office was 17.1. Of the total study population, 99.1% had reached the minimum number of recommended visits of six or more at the nurse’s office. A total of 92.9 per cent of all children had received the three health examinations by the CHC physician stipulated in the CHS programme, and 90.1 per cent had received at least one home visit. In terms of vaccination, 98.7 per cent of the study children had received a full series against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hemophilus influenza type B and poliomyelitis, and 93.3 per cent had received immunisation against measles, mumps and rubella. Approximately half of the mothers in the study (48.5%) had participated at least once in a parental group held by the CHC.</p>

            <title>General main </title>
            <p>The results of the present study indicate that children of young and single mothers received the universal child health programme on equal terms with children of older and cohabiting mothers in Uppsala County, with the exception of lower participation rates in parenting groups. However, the results did not indicate that children of young and single mothers received more intervention from the CHS when compared with children of older and cohabiting mothers.</p>
            <p>The results of the present study show further, in concordance with previous studies performed in Swedish populations, that the parenting groups offered by the CHS do not reach all parents with infants. First-time parents generally participate to a greater extent than do parents who already have children, but mothers with disadvantaged social situations, such as immigrant, low income, young or single mothers, are more likely to refrain from participation in parenting groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512450624">Fabian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512450624">Wallby and Hjern, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>Comparable figures of general child health programme coverage are hard to obtain from most countries, but immunisation coverage data may be used as a rough proxy. According to UNICEF data, the percentage of children under 1 year who received measles-containing vaccine in 2008 amounted to less than 90 per cent in France, Ireland, Great Britain, Switzerland, Austria and Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512450624">UNICEF, 2010</xref>).</p>

            <title>Practical implications</title>
            <p>The organisation of CHS in Uppsala County is evidently very successful in implementing the universal CHS prevention programme. This might be due to the long tradition of decentralised, easy-to-reach and free of charge Swedish Maternal and Child Health Services, which has created a strong public norm and a built-in collective trust towards the CHS among Swedish parents. However, methods for selective prevention seem to be lacking. The proportion of the study population being either young, single or both was 11.5 per cent (n = 1229). This implies that a rather large group of Swedish mothers and their children are at an increased risk of impaired physical and mental health, both in the short and in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512450624">Burstrom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512450624">Ekéus et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512450624">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512450624">Hjern et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512450624">Wadsby et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512450624">Weitoft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512450624">Westin and Westerling, 2007</xref>).</p>
            <p>The vulnerable situation and the higher risk of health problems among young and single mothers and their children should make these families a higher priority for the CHS and should, reasonably, result in a higher consumption of child health care compared with the average family. In the present study there was no indication that young and single mothers received more intervention than other families. This finding suggests the existence of barriers to health care, probably both at individual and CHC levels. Previous studies have made recommendations, including offering services in local neighbourhoods, services available outside normal office hours and making home visits, to improve access to health care for vulnerable populations and to ensure continuity of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450624">Ames, 2007</xref>). It is also vital that primary care providers understand the social and cultural determinants of health commonly encountered in these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512450624">Klein et al., 2011</xref>). The multilevel analyses in the present study show contextual differences between the CHC units, suggesting that some CHCs perform better than others in offering extended support to groups of families with greater needs. This variation might be due either to individual CHS nurses’ capability or to a choice on the part of the mothers not to utilize the CHS. The CHC-level variance might also be explained in part by individual factors such as clustering of mothers with a similar socio-economic position to some specific CHCs. However, controlling for disposable income aggregated to the CHC level in model 3 did not substantially alter the group level variance compared with model 2 (data not presented in the table).</p>
            <p>A possible explanation for this finding can be found in the way the CHS is funded today, where resources are allocated entirely on the basis of the number of inhabitant children in each CHC district, without consideration to variations in socio-demographic population characteristics. CHCs located in disadvantaged areas might lack the necessary time to meet the actual needs of their populations. At best, working in such areas should make it possible to aggregate competence specifically adapted to the population. However, improvement of CHC qualifications in health care among disadvantaged families is likely to depend on access to a sufficient amount of time and a different strategy for allocation of resources.</p>
            <p>The use of extended indicative home visiting programmes is an example of methodological progress that could be made within the Swedish CHS, and was previously recommended in an evaluation of the Swedish CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512450624">Sundelin and Håkansson, 2000</xref>). In several studies, home visiting has been shown to offer effective opportunities for identifying families in need of extra support and for detecting children at risk at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450624">Aurelius and Nordberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512450624">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>). The nurses who make home visits describe the method as important to establishing trust and obtaining a picture of the family’s life situation, as well as creating a supportive climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512450624">Jansson et al., 2001</xref>). Intervention studies from Finland also show positive results from resource-enhancing psychosocial support given to families with extended needs by public health nurses with special training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512450624">Tanninen et al., 2009</xref>). The CHC nurse can also be a valuable source of knowledge and information on infant growth and development and mother–child interactions, particularly for young mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450624">Koniak-Griffin and Turner-Pluta, 2001</xref>). However, an extended home visiting programme should also be accompanied by structured content, which currently is lacking. Furthermore, the methodology used in the CHS parenting group programme needs to be developed, as do CHS services that integrate primary care and easily accessible social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512450624">Klein et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been shown that nurses who work exclusively with CHS consider it easier to focus on, for example, strengthening social networks and psychosocial problems, than nurses who additionally deal with health care issues for adults and the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512450624">Magnusson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

            <title>Methodological strengths and limitations</title>
            <p>The study population was drawn from the entire population of infants in the county of Uppsala during nine consecutive years. The attrition was low. The Register of Statistics of the Child Health Care used in the present study is controlled by functionality reminding the Child Health nurses to complete data at given time points. The register design of the study makes it likely that dropouts varied primarily by the characteristics of the reporting Child Health nurse, rather than by the individual characteristics of the households of the infants.</p>
            <p>The use of registers for research purposes has been questioned as a violation of privacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512450624">Rahu and McKee, 2008</xref>). However, in recent years it has been approved as a kind of research that can be done safely and with a low risk of revealing individual information. It is a type of research where the ethical implications of doing no research by far outweigh the concerns of doing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512450624">Olsen, 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>A serious limitation of the present study is that it depends solely on quantitative proxy data to measure the level of support from the CHS. We lack qualitative data that considers the supportive value that a parent experiences from a meeting with the CHC staff, which depends on several aspects, such as the time devoted to each visit, the methods used and the individual experience and knowledge of the staff.</p>
            <p>The results of the present study, based on data from Uppsala County, are not necessarily representative of the entire Swedish CHS. The CHS programme as well as the organisation of the CHS and the conditions for performing the programme vary among the counties of Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512450624">Magnusson et al., 2011</xref>). Comparable data describing psychosocial features of the Swedish CHS are lacking. However, recent national data from all Swedish counties consistently shows a reduction in the number of home visits by the CHS to families with newborn children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512450624">Almquist-Tangen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Results from the present study showed that aside from the parenting group activities, the CHS was successful in implementing the basic universal preventive child health programme for all families, including families with young or single mothers. However, there was no evidence of an established selective preventive strategy aimed at these high-risk families. Methods for strengthening the support provided by the CHS to vulnerable families are needed.</p>
