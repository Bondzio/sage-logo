<abstract>
<p>Drawing on interviews and participant observation, I analyze two communal living groups where members are encouraged to participate in the practice of polyamory. Through examining the ideological work these members perform as they transition from monogamous relationships to polyamorous practice, I reveal how circumstances shape sexual behavior. More specifically, I demonstrate how members practice and sometimes embrace a nonmonogamous relationship model because of links between structural and cultural factors in the communities and because of the ideological connection members draw between feminism and polyamory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of nineteenth- and twentieth-century communal living groups, such as the Oneidas, viewed monogamous relationships as problematic and undesirable, particularly because they distracted members’ energy and commitment for the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241612464886">Metcalf 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241612464886">Oved 1988</xref>). Some of these communities also believed that heterosexual monogamy reflected the patriarchal ownership of women, which they actively resisted. In this article, I examine contemporary communal groups who face a similar concern to their nineteenth- and twentieth-century predecessors regarding the role of monogamy. Like their predecessors, these communities provide a unique microcosm of society where alternative sexualities can thrive because many of the societal structures that encourage monogamy are replaced by communal structures that promote nonmonogamy.</p>
<p>While living in these groups, community members experience less exposure to the pressures to be monogamous that exist in the dominant culture, thus giving them more freedom to openly adopt nonmonogamous sexual practices. First, members encounter idealized representations of monogamy in mainstream media less often because of limited access in the community. Second, the economic benefits of monogamy, such as tax incentives for marriage or the higher costs of single living, are absent in the community. Third, members’ understanding of the theory of social constructionism distances them from essentialist notions of monogamy as “natural,” a common belief in the dominant culture. Finally, community members tend to be young, well educated, white, able bodied, and from middle- to upper-middle-class backgrounds, confirming that those who have access to status and power more actively resist dominant cultural constructions of sexuality and have the least to lose by doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612464886">Noël 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241612464886">Sheff and Hammers 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241612464886">Wilkins 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These communal living sites, however, are still influenced by mainstream cultural influences, social expectations, and sexual scripts. All members in this study moved to the communities as adults, and thus have deeply ingrained dominant cultural notions of gender, sexuality, intimacy, and relationships. They have regular meetings about how to challenge what they call the “dominant culture hangover,” referring to the patriarchal and capitalist ideologies they learned to embrace as they were socialized. Thus, the processes whereby members of these intentional communities shift from having exclusively monogamous relationships to open, nonmonogamous relationships merits investigation precisely because this shift highlights how social structures powerfully (re)shape sexual beliefs and behaviors.</p>
<p>My analysis highlights (1) how the communities’ cultures and policies influence their members’ choice of relationship models and (2) the ideological process members undergo to make sense of these new relationships. Through examining these themes, my research bridges the situational sexuality and polyamory literatures. More specifically, it contributes to both by revealing how members’ sexual acts are bound to a certain social location and exist outside of an identitarian understanding of sexuality.</p>
<p>In this article, I define an <italic>intentional community</italic> as a group of people who live together with a common purpose and share income and resources. I also define <italic>polyamory</italic> as a form of relationship in which people openly court multiple romantic, sexual, and/or affective partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241612464886">Sheff and Hammers 2011</xref>, 201). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241612464886">Haslam (2008)</xref> lists the characteristics that practitioners of polyamory use as guiding principles for their living: nonexclusivity in both love and sex; autonomy of persons; transparency and honesty in dealing with each other; and valuing intimacy, caring, equality, and communication. A large overlap exists between the values promoted by practitioners of polyamory and by members of intentional communities in this study because both groups deeply emphasize honesty, personal growth, equality, communication, nonpossessiveness, and intimacy. In this article, I refer to all openly nonmonogamous relationships as “polyamory” because that corresponds with how the community members label it, even when complete honesty, equality, and full communication are not attained.</p>
<p>I begin by reviewing the literature on monogamy to establish how monogamy maintains its position as a dominant ideology. I also briefly explain the concept of ideological work, particularly in relationship to challenging dominant ideologies. I then examine the literature on the relationship between feminism and polyamory to establish polyamory as a feminist discourse. Finally, I introduce the brief literature on situational sexuality, highlighting the gaps in that discourse this paper seeks to fill.</p>
<p>In the analysis section, I examine the power relationships negotiated around the practice of polyamory and the community discourse that works to normalize and idealize it. The community members who adopt polyamory do so by finding an overlap between their new community-based ideology and a pre-existing ideology. In this case, they link polyamory to the tenets of feminism, a philosophy which many of them already embrace. Through examining how this process of “ideological work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612464886">Berger 1981</xref>) unfolds, we can gain a unique glimpse into how people acquire and accept new ideologies that significantly challenge their commonly held beliefs.</p>
<sec id="section2-0891241612464886">
<title>The Dominant Ideology of Monogamy</title>
<p>Monogamy remains a dominant ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241612464886">Abercrombie and Turner 1978</xref>) in mainstream Western culture. This belief considers monogamy not simply the most successful model for intimate relationships but the <italic>only</italic> relationship model. Several social factors sustain the ideology of monogamy, but two factors are particularly strong: its institutionalization in the form of marriage, and the construction of monogamy as a natural component of human biology and evolution. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241612464886">Duggan and Hunter (1995</xref>, 108) point out, the state conflates both of these factors by codifying monogamy into law through marriage while also asserting its “naturalness” for heterosexual couples.</p>
<p>Together, beliefs that marriage represents a normal part of the life course and that people are naturally monogamous serve to reproduce monogamy as a hegemonic discourse and practice. The emotion of jealousy, which many people experience at the thought that their lover might stray, reinforces the idea that monogamy is “biological,” making jealousy appear to be an innate proof of love and commitment. Other powerful cultural and structural norms supporting monogamy include idealized constructions of the nuclear family and the idolization of monogamous romance and love. Dominant cultural scripts suggest that weddings, a celebration of lifelong monogamy, should be the “happiest day” of people’s lives. The media are also saturated with messages about one’s “soul mate” or “one true love” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241612464886">Ingraham 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241612464886">Otnes and Pleck 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241612464886">Schmookler and Bursik’s (2007</xref>, 819) study, although women and men both value monogamy, women place greater importance on “both emotional and sexual monogamy.” Schmookler and Bursik propose that this gender difference occurs because monogamy involves “relating emotionally to another person,” “allowing the self to be dependent on another,” and “sexual restraint,” all behaviors that society positively reinforces in women (832). Men, on the other hand, learn to demonstrate “independence,” “self-sufficiency,” and hypersexuality with multiple partners, characteristics “that are not as relevant for sustaining monogamous relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241612464886">Schmookler and Bursik 2007</xref>, 833). These social constructs of gender affect the differences in value men and women place on monogamy.</p>
<p>Women experience particularly severe repercussions for rejecting monogamy. Less-severe consequences include being labeled as “promiscuous” and having their morality called into question; more-severe consequences may include losing their children, family, friends, jobs, and/or their reputations. These repercussions go far beyond mere social disapproval of a “deviant” behavior. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241612464886">Emens’s (2004</xref>, 13) study of legal briefs shows, lawmakers legally codify monogamy in a wide range of contexts with “proscriptions against promiscuity, against adultery, against bigamy, against singlehood, and against deviations from what we might call ‘simple monogamy,’ the idea of one partner at a time.” Given the social and legal ramifications, very few people, and especially few women, dare to [overtly] challenge this entrenched ideology.</p>
<p>Given monogamy’s dominant status in U.S. society and the many social factors working to maintain its dominance, an individual’s deliberate rejection of it would take a great deal of ideological work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612464886">Berger (1981</xref>, 114) coined the term “ideological work” to explain how a person or group makes sense of the dissonance between their actual behavior and stated values.</p>
<p>Among the communards, disjuncture occurs when members join an intentional community where polyamory is practiced and encouraged, and their deeply held beliefs about monogamy are challenged. In order to reconcile their belief system with their newly adopted sexual practices, individuals must engage in ideological work to find a common ground between their new understandings of the philosophies of polyamory and their long-standing knowledge of feminism.</p>

<sec id="section3-0891241612464886">
<title>The Rise of Polyamory as a Feminist Discourse</title>
<p>Discourse on polyamory in the 1990s emerged at the intersection of several progressive social movements, including several “waves” of feminism challenging institutionalized heterosexual monogamy as the dominant relationship model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241612464886">Haritaworn, Lin, and Klesse 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612464886">Noël 2006</xref>). Feminist scholars studying sex and gender have linked institutionalized heterosexual monogamy with patriarchy for decades. The feminist critique against monogamy, and against the institution of marriage emphasizes (1) the implied “ownership” of women by men as akin to slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241612464886">Dixon 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612464886">Morgan 1970</xref>); (2) the institutionalization of rape and domestic violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241612464886">Dworkin 1976</xref>); and (3) the perpetuation of patriarchy at the household level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612464886">Robinson (1997</xref>, 144), for instance, writes that institutionalized monogamy “privileges the interests of both men and capitalism, operating as it does through the mechanisms of exclusivity, possessiveness and jealousy, all filtered through the rose-tinted lens of romance.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241612464886">Jackson and Scott (2002)</xref> summarize the feminist arguments:
<disp-quote>
<p>Monogamy was questioned as a cornerstone of patriarchal privilege, enshrining men’s rights over women’s bodies, and as central to an ideology of romantic love through which women’s compliance was secured. More radically, it was seen as antithetical to egalitarian sexual relations: it reduced human beings to property, promoted destructive emotions such as jealousy and emotional dependency as positive proofs of “love” and impoverished our wider social relations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Feminists opposing institutionalized monogamy argue that <italic>non</italic>-monogamy enables “a radical reworking of gendered power relationships” that “allow us to respond imaginatively to changing social trends” and “rethink social arrangements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612464886">Robinson 1997</xref>, 144). The idea that nonmonogamy frees women was integral to the ideology of women’s “sexual liberation,” and profoundly shaped cultural practices and political debates in many social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241612464886">Haritaworn, Lin, and Klesse 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241612464886">Wouters (1998</xref>, 227) writes that the sexual revolution was “a breakthrough in the emancipation of female sexuality” because it took women’s sexual pleasure seriously, and both men and women learned to work toward and appreciate female sexual pleasure. Despite this increased awareness, the sexual revolution did not address the still-unequal balance of power that existed between men and women.</p>
<p>New ways of thinking about sexual relationships and intimacy arose from feminist critiques of monogamy, the sexual revolution, and the gay and lesbian rights movements. In the 1990s, third-wave feminists continued challenging dominant constructions of gender and sexuality by taking a defiantly pro-sex stance. They resurrected the connection between sexual agency and women’s liberation, a focal point of the second-wave feminist movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241612464886">Wilkins 2004</xref>), by calling for a new model of female sexual subjectivity, by reclaiming femininity through a revaluing of the markers of “girly-ness,” and by a mass re-appropriation of historically woman-negative words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241612464886">Attwood 2007</xref>). In particular, they reclaimed the word “slut” to show pride for sexual agency as supported by the 1990s version of “girl power,” which endorsed an image of a strong, sexual, and independent woman who did not need a man, but might desire one or several (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241612464886">Forrest 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the polyamorous discourse, which emerged around the same time as third-wave feminism (and may have emerged out of third-wave feminism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241612464886">Bernhardt 2009</xref>), emphasizes that having multiple lovers does not mean “sleeping around” but instead represents engagement in several caring, intimate, honest, equal, and nonexclusive relationships. Easton and Liszt, authors of <italic>The Ethical Slut</italic>, long considered an authoritative source on polyamory, write that “as proud sluts, we believe that sex and sexual love are fundamental forces for good, activities with the potential to strengthen intimate bonds, enhance lives, open spiritual awareness, even change the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612464886">2009</xref>, 4).</p>
<p>Feminism and the tenets of polyamory overlap significantly in that both connect monogamy and patriarchal ownership of women, and both emphasize women’s sexual agency and liberation. In Barker and Richie’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241612464886">2007</xref>) study of polyamorous women, “All participants but one identified as feminists and many linked this explicitly to their polyamory” (150). The participants cited polyamory as “women-centered,” because it values the “feminine” practices of organizational skill (necessary to manage multiple relationships) and communication. Barker and Richie also claimed that polyamorous women are less dependent on men than are heterosexually monogamous women, and they are freer to place equal value on friendships and sexual relationships. Other researchers suggested that polyamory is feminist because it challenges “exclusivity, possessiveness and jealousy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612464886">Robinson 1997</xref>, 144), women’s unpaid domestic labor on which monogamy relies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612464886">Munson and Stelboum 1999</xref>), and the isolation some monogamous women experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241612464886">Jackson and Scott 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0891241612464886">
<title>Situational Sexuality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612464886">Barker’s (2005</xref>, 83) study showed that most polyamorous individuals viewed their polyamorous behavior as “natural,” spoke of being “wired this way,” and said they “couldn’t help” their desire for multiple relationships. As Barker notes, this prevalence of biological explanations is unsurprising given “the strong discourse in Western culture at present that things with biological origins are somehow more ‘real’ than products of socialization or cultural construction” (83). At the same time, the notion that sexual behavior necessarily leads to a construction of a “sexual identity” constitutes a more recent idea. Historian Regina Kunzel writes, “Most historians locate the formation of modern Euro-American sexual identities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Around this time, so the argument goes, sexual acts became newly constitutive of identity: what one <italic>did</italic>, and with whom, came to define who one <italic>was</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241612464886">2002</xref>, 253). This idea has been most strongly associated with gender-based sexual behaviors, such as hetero-, homo-, and bisexual sex leading to gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities. In addition, other people engaging in non-gender-based sexual behaviors also employ the construction of a sexual “identity,” such as polyamorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612464886">Barker 2005</xref>), sadomasochists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241612464886">Langdridge and Butt 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612464886">Newmahr 2008</xref>), and asexuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241612464886">Scherrer 2008</xref>). Thus, polyamorists’ biological discourse makes sense given their place in the history of sexuality.</p>
<p>From the 1940s through the 1970s, sociological texts used “situational sexuality” to “describe the occurrence of homosexual <italic>behavior</italic> in social settings and institutions that are predominately same-sex—such as prisons, military settings and boarding schools. It was used as a way of differentiating ‘real’ homosexuals from those who engaged in homosexual behavior only when heterosexual sex was unavailable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612464886">Escoffier 2003</xref>, 531). As scholars employed a more social-constructionist theory of sexuality, distinguishing “real” homosexuals from “real” heterosexuals engaging in same-sex sex fell out of favor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241612464886">Rust 2000</xref>). Katz explains, “The term [<italic>situational homosexuality</italic>] is fallacious if it implies that there is some ‘true’ homosexuality which is <italic>not</italic> situated. All homosexuality is situational, influenced and given meaning and character by its location in time and social space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241612464886">Katz 1976</xref>, 11, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241612464886">Kunzel 2002</xref>, 254).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891241612464886">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the past decade, a few scholars have reclaimed the idea of “situational homosexuality,” this time replacing core/biological sexuality with a more fully social-constructionist perspective. These scholars assert that the concept remains useful to examine particular homosexual behaviors that are specific to a social setting and distinct from homosexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612464886">Escoffier 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241612464886">Kunzel 2002</xref>), such as the sexual behaviors of heterosexually identified actors in gay-porn films. He suggests that the reconceptualization of situational homosexuality opens up the “possibilities of examining other forms of homosexual behavior that cannot be explained by contemporary notions of <italic>gay identity</italic>,” such as “men who identify primarily as heterosexual but who have casual or opportunistic sex with men, those who are sex workers or prisoners, and/or those who belong to same-sex cohorts of immigrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612464886">2003</xref>, 532).</p>
<p>In this article, I use “situational sexuality” to examine sexual behaviors that occur outside of, and cannot be explained by, stated gender-based sexual identities. I apply the concept of “situational sexuality” to understand polyamorous behaviors that take place among nonpoly-identified people in the specific social setting of a rural commune. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241612464886">Harper’s (2010</xref>, 94) study of bisexuality among the NeoPagans, where “a combination of the idealization of female bisexuality . . . and the pressure from fellow practitioners and the male partners in their lives” led straight-identified women to practice bisexuality, I too consider the confluence of social factors that encourage communal group members to renounce monogamous relationships for polyamorous ones. This work builds on the previous research done on situational sexuality, reclaiming it as a useful tool in expanding our understanding of the intersections of sexual practice and identity.</p>

<title>Research Setting</title>
<p>I used participant observation, content analysis, and in-depth interviews to investigate two egalitarian intentional communities from 2006 to 2007. Both were rural and depended on operating several small businesses to meet their economic needs. At the time of my visits, the larger community, Red River, had approximately hundred members, while Applewood included about twenty-three members. I received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the University of Colorado at Boulder and followed their protocols, including changing the names of the communities and the interview participants to protect members’ identities and having participants sign consent forms.</p>
<p>Both communities belonged to the Federation of Egalitarian Communities, which is a “union of communities which have joined together in a common struggle to create a lifestyle based on equality, cooperation, and harmony with the earth.” They also both identified as feminist communities, and one was part of a loosely organized group of feminist eco-villages who claimed to “hold feminism as a core value.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891241612464886">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0891241612464886">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>During my stay at each community, I was a noncovert researcher with “peripheral membership” in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241612464886">Adler and Adler 1994</xref>). I lived, ate, worked, and attended community meetings and social functions alongside the members of the community, but I did not participate in group decisions or advocate any of my own positions. During the several months that I stayed at each community and the years I retained contact with the groups, I slowly became what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241612464886">Naples (2003)</xref> calls a “conditional insider,” a term that reflects the shifting insider–outsider dichotomy and the continued negotiation of insider status in fieldwork. This status allowed access that was unavailable in the beginning, giving me a deeper understanding of the role polyamory plays in members’ lives.</p>
<p>To recruit interview participants, I posted a page on the main bulletin board of each community that explained the purpose of the study. These communities valued social research, were open to researchers’ visits, and encouraged members to participate by allowing them to count time spent interviewing toward their weekly labor quota of thirty-five to forty-five hours. I paid the community eight dollars per interview hour to compensate for their lost labor. Each interview lasted approximately two hours. Follow-up questions were very informal because I was living at the community while conducting interviews. I digitally recorded interviews unless the participant opted for me to take hand-written notes instead (n = 2). I kept all audio files and transcriptions in a secure location, locked via password.</p>
<p>While polyamory was not the sole research focus, members talked about it eagerly and often. It may be, however, that those members who readily spoke about polyamory in the interviews were most strongly affected by it, either positively or negatively. About half of the members of each community (and a significantly larger percentage of those under age thirty-five) had engaged in polyamory at some point. Those without personal experience with polyamory shared their opinions about polyamory and its role in the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0891241612464886">
<title>Demographics of the Interview Participants</title>
<p>Members of egalitarian intentional communities tend to be younger adults. My sample reflected this, as twenty-three of my thirty-two interview participants were under thirty years old, and 9 participants were forty years or older at the time of the interview. The communities maintained a deliberate gender balance, meaning that they only accepted new female members if, for instance, the community became more than 60 percent male. I interviewed an equal number of men (n = 16) and women (n = 16). No one identified as transgender when interviewed, although there had been trans-identified community members in the past. Interviewees considered their sexuality fluid, often with a preference for one gender and a willingness to experiment with others as opportunities arose. Most of them self-identified as “mostly” heterosexual, or “heteroflexible”; some claimed to be “pan-sexual,” and several refused to sexually label themselves. Members mainly identified as white and middle-class, as in past research in similar communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241612464886">Miller 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>I gathered field notes, interview transcripts, and community documents using inductive data-gathering methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241612464886">Lofland and Lofland 1995</xref>). I categorized the data into emergent themes throughout the data collection and analysis process using constant comparative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241612464886">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>). I added questions about polyamory to interviews based on data I obtained while observing participants and based on themes that emerged in the first interviews. I recognized that saturation had been reached when subsequent interviews yielded no additional information. Using axial coding, I systematically identified relationships between concepts that revealed causal conditions, contextual factors, actions and interactions taken in response to the phenomenon, intervening conditions that assisted or hindered actions and interactions, and consequences of actions and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241612464886">Berg 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241612464886">Neuman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241612464886">Strauss and Corbin 1990</xref>).

<title>Analysis and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section11-0891241612464886">
<title>The Pathway to Poly Behaviors</title>
<p>Community conditions create an environment in which polyamory thrives. First, communities that openly practice polyamory are often geographically isolated. This isolation protects them from the stigma of engaging in deviant sexuality, similar to how isolation protects other subcultures (such as the Goth subculture studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241612464886">Wilkins 2004</xref>). Second, the communities’ acceptance and encouragement of an alternative lifestyle, along with their commitment to feminist politics, provide room to explore sexuality and nontraditional relationship models.</p>
<p>Although polyamory was common, no member I interviewed cited polyamory as a reason for joining the community, and only two members had practiced consensual nonmonogamy prior to joining. Reasons for joining varied, but most members cited the egalitarian economic arrangement of full income sharing or to counter the social isolation they felt in mainstream society. During the informational sessions for new members, current members introduced polyamory as an optional but highly regarded practice. I met open couples, poly families (including one with a child), and some singles who appreciated the practice of open sexuality. Monogamy was never outwardly maligned but was presented as one option among many, and a few members remained committed to it.</p>
<p>When I questioned participants about polyamory, a large majority of the newer members (of six months or less), and particularly the newer women, expressed disinterest in open relationships, often stating that they could never overcome the jealousy they would feel if they shared their lovers. As Falicia, twenty-five, explained, “I don’t think it’s a relationship model that would work for me. I require to be adored! (laughs) . . . and I need a lot of attention (laughs) and I think it would take a lot of work for me to feel emotionally fulfilled in that kind of relationship model, and so I don’t want to do that.” Conversely, many members with a year or more of membership supported polyamory, often explaining why they decided to try it or why, even if not currently practicing polyamory, it is still a “good idea.” Like the newer members, several long-termers claimed that they too had said “not for me” when introduced to the idea of polyamory. As the long-termers explained, the idealization of monogamy is deeply entrenched, and new members struggle to imagine polyamory as something desirable. Most of those who practiced polyamory did not claim it as a sexual identity, instead viewing it as simply a behavioral practice.</p>
<p>Thus, newly joined members indicated reluctance to practice polyamory because of a deeply socialized desire for monogamy, their fears of jealousy, and their equation of exclusivity with love; yet, many longer-term members who were otherwise like the newcomers engaged in polyamorous behaviors. Three factors fostered this transition: the encouragement of intimate physical contact, the challenge of maintaining a monogamous relationship, and access to sexual/romantic partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0891241612464886">
<title>The Encouragement of Intimate Physical Contact</title>
<p>Within these communities, physical contact with friends in the form of cuddling, sleeping next to someone, or hugging all become normalized and frequent occurrences, unlike mainstream culture in which individuals mostly limit physical contact to close family members or intimate partners. Friends (male, female, or coed) cuddled together in hammocks, beds, or on picnic blankets reading or talking. This kind of personal contact is one reason people frequently cited for joining an intentional community in the first place. Some members said that living far from family or without a romantic relationship left them “literally craving physical touch” with other people, and finding a community that encouraged this was wonderful. However, “cuddling” and “sharing a bed” still held symbolic meaning for new members as actions they did only with intimates, and when practiced with friends, feelings of attraction and intimacy emerged. Similarly, the open practice of nudity at the communities also triggered unanticipated sexual/romantic feelings for some. Cuddling or spending time with others in the nude, some claimed, led to romantic emotional and sexual connections with several members at the same time.</p>
<p>Beyond platonic touch that sometimes led to sexual touch, the communities sometimes hosted “make-out parties” where members engaged in nonpenetrative sexual acts in a group setting. One of the communities held such a party while I was researching the community. The party organizers were clear that guests had to be willing to participate to be welcome; onlookers were discouraged. Several members spent the day hard at work preparing food, arranging the party rooms’ pillows and blankets, and getting the right music ready. The group was excitedly nervous. When the party started, most members dressed up and went to the other house to engage in sexual play. I, and a few of the newer, older, and more reluctant members stayed in the main living area to talk and play board games. Within an hour, two of the newer members overcame their shyness and headed over to the party. The next day, one of the organizers, Theresa, twenty-four, told me:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think about some of the parties that we have here sometimes and how open they are, how much people have freedom of expression. You know, there’s a level of intimacy, and openness, and connection, and welcoming that I think we offer here in our social scene that I haven’t experienced in many other places, and my take on why that is, is because we’re living so closely and there’s a lot of shit that we deal with, with each other, and the shit we deal with is painful, it sucks a lot at times, it’s frustrating, and there’s a lot of things that people don’t like about each other, and things that happen, and the fact that on some level, we’re dealing with it, even if badly, does still allow us a level of openness and intimacy and self-expression that is pretty amazing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reimagining of sexual contact from something you do only with a partner to something done for fun and communion with friends normalizes such contact, easing the transition to having multiple partners, yet by keeping the make-out party optional, members conform to the community rhetoric that “all sexual preferences are accepted, embraced, and celebrated.”</p>

<title>The Challenge of Maintaining Monogamous Relationships</title>
<p>The communities’ implicit and explicit support for poly behaviors challenged the relationships of newly joined monogamous couples. Several members who desired to remain monogamous with their partners felt threatened and apprehensive that another sexually available person who did not value the exclusiveness of their relationship would seduce their partner. Emily, twenty-nine, a Red River member who joined with her boyfriend, spoke about the pressure their relationship faced when confronted with the possibility of multiple sexual partners:
<disp-quote>
<p>During my visitor period here, [polyamory] was definitely a concern for me, and part of the reason my relationship broke up is because my then partner had said that if he had his ideal relationship, he would be polyamorous and I said no, but because of that difference between the two of us, I was really insecure and I was really worried about moving to some place where it was a polyamorous haven and that he would start meeting all these people . . . and when I moved here as a new member, suddenly it seemed like everyone was polyamorous. I thought, “Who isn’t?” and “Oh my God, what am I doing here?” There are so many potential threats here, so many people who would potentially steal my boyfriend, and it was rough; it was really hard. And the fact that I was so insecure contributed to our breaking up. And he wasn’t good about calming my fears.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their relationship, like several others I studied, fell apart under the pressure that new couples experienced about whether to remain exclusive or to open up to new partners. At this early stage of membership, most couples viewed polyamory as a threat to their exclusive relationship and not as an opportunity for sexual liberation or as a way to live out a feminist belief system. Rich, twenty-one, who had spent time at both communities in this study, explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is pattern at both Applewood and Red River of people arriving as a couple and then one of them develops an interest in someone else and the other one ends up leaving because they can’t stand sharing their lover or constantly living with this person who they have so much hurt associated with. It is definitely a problem that not everyone finds an amicable solution to.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rich’s observation that members hurt by their lover’s interest in another person ended up leaving the community suggests that those individuals who remain accept open relationships, leading to a more like-minded community. Relationships that did not dissolve under the pressure sometimes “opened up” to new lovers. In the case of heterosexual couples, this opening was often at the man’s suggestion.</p>
<p>Community members did not censor male members for their desire for sex with multiple women, even though men in these communities typically distanced themselves from other aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as aggression and competition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612464886">Sheff (2006</xref>, 625–26) noted in her work on poly-hegemonic masculinity, polyamory offers men the possibility of access to sex with multiple women, which affirms hegemonic masculinity’s reliance on hypersexuality and the fantasy of “the iconic triadic relationship.” Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241612464886">Harper’s (2010</xref>, 99) findings among NeoPagan men, where “male partners seemed to be the driving force behind their female partners’ sexual escapades,” males in my study encouraged their female partners to have multiple sexual relationships so that they too could do the same. John, twenty-six, for instance, encouraged his wife to initiate a romance with another man by explaining to her that he could not fulfill all of her needs. “My spouse spent a good deal of time hanging out with [another man]. He was a very different person from me. He provided something for her that she wasn’t getting from me. I encouraged it; I think it was a good thing to encourage.” He highlighted for his wife that each partnership contains different qualities depending on the partners’ unique physical, emotional, or intellectual connections. The following year, when I asked John what happened between his wife, Meghan, thirty-one, and the other man, he said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I got more jealous as time went on, because a serious relationship developed between them, and, although we were initially monogamous, we’re in a community that encourages polyamorous relationships. And that was really hard. It got messy, really messy. It was hard, it put a lot of strain on our relationship, it was really painful, and Meghan now believes that there is a part of her that isn’t necessarily monogamous.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the time of the second interview, the man with whom Meghan had developed a relationship had recently left the community, and John was forming a new secondary relationship with a recently arrived female member. John and Meghan still considered themselves in a committed relationship with each other that involved co-raising their young son. Like John and Meghan’s situation, most women who practiced polyamory said that their male partner first suggested it. It is possible that women and men were equally open to initiating a polyamorous relationship, but women hesitated to disclose this to me out of fear of being judged as promiscuous, a label with more serious consequences for women than men. Even though John encouraged the relationship between the other man and his wife, he still struggled with the transition from a monogamous to an open relationship. Like other couples at the communities, John and Meghan’s initial excitement about multiple partners partially obscured the obstacles they faced in adjusting to this new relationship model.</p>
<p>Members like John and Meghan transitioning into polyamory must engage in a great deal of emotional work because of the complexity of and their inexperience with feelings of jealousy. Both the communities offered emotional care for the transition to polyamory in the form of support groups and counseling. Community members willingly did the work, because “personal growth” was highly valued and rewarded. A “beginners” pamphlet on managing polyamorous relationships, <italic>Open Hands</italic>, was available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241612464886">Adelova-Calta 1996</xref>). This text stresses the benefits of nonpossessiveness, personal growth, and rebelling against the dominant culture’s limited definition of relationships:
<disp-quote>
<p>Why bother with open relationships? In part it challenges part of our socialization: society’s standard is monogamy, a possessive contract which implies love is scarce, like CD players or hair driers, and once you’ve got it, you better grab it and hold it, because you don’t want to be without it. I think we can be more creative than this about our feelings.</p>
<p>The idea behind open relationships is that each relationship is free to determine the best way to communicate. If it includes sex, that’s fine. Because we have not escaped our socialization, we have to work with our lovers in order to accept other sex partners. But it is useful work, in helping us to understand our desires and insecure feelings and if we succeed, we set our lovers free, to come back to us out of true desire.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage of the pamphlet exhorts community members to challenge their dominant cultural socialization and resolve jealous feelings. Jealousy, instead of being viewed as a natural/biological emotion to be overcome, represented a cultural byproduct of monogamy reinforced by the dominant society. As they worked to overcome jealousy, members began to see other emotions and social institutions as socially constructed. In other words, members felt that if they could actively overcome the powerful emotion of jealousy, then questioning and reassessing other powerfully dominant ideologies presented to them as <italic>natural also</italic> became possible. This engagement with social constructionism promised members a transformed worldview and was, according to several members, “empowering.”</p>
<p>Members often cited a broad commitment to personal growth and development on many levels as a key reason for joining an intentional community. Polyamorous relationships required intense emotional work, and members viewed this work as progress toward their personal development goals. Red River offered weekly formal group meetings on both polyamory and radical honesty, and Applewood held weekly meetings to discuss members’ “emotional needs,” with the conversation often revolving around polyamorous relationships in the community. In these meetings, members reaffirmed that “no one person can fulfill all your needs” and “putting all your eggs in one basket can lead to emotional dependency and a loss of self-esteem.” They asserted that polyamory keeps women from “rivaling each other for male attention” and allows for “honesty and openness” to emerge. Another passage from the <italic>Open Hands</italic> handbook provided evidence for the benefits associated with overcoming jealousy:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the point when you are able to overcome your jealous feelings, when you can be happy that your lover is enjoying being with someone else, there is a tremendous liberation that occurs. You stop holding tight, and love with open hands; this makes you much more attractive to your lovers, who will feel both free and secure. This starts a positive cycle—you feel better about yourself, and make lovers and friends happier, too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This text states that by working to overcome their jealous feelings, members will become more liberated, be more attractive to their lovers, feel better about themselves, and make themselves and others happier.</p>
<p>Members emphasized the emotional labor required to maintain these “enormously complex and emotionally demanding relationships.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241612464886">Petrella (2007</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241612464886">Haritaworn, Lin, and Klesse 2006</xref>, 521) suggests that polyamorists borrow from the Protestant ethic by presenting themselves as morally superior to those merely engaging in sex as a carnal pleasure, because polyamorists engage in spiritual and emotional growth. The emotional labor polyamorous community members performed came with the benefit of not only personal growth but also validation from the community as someone who wanted to become “better,” as was evidenced by this statement from Martin, twenty-two:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Being a member] has also changed my ideas about monogamy and how relationships “should be.” It’s kind of opened my eyes, and I kind of got rid of the notion of jealousy for the most part. I still see it sometimes in myself, probably in other members of the community as well. I’m better for [the change].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0891241612464886">
<title>Access to Sexual/Romantic Partners</title>
<p>Finally, some members joined an open relationship not at the insistence of a current partner but strictly because finding a monogamous partner proved difficult, or the particular person to whom they were romantically attracted was not interested in an exclusive relationship. For instance, Katy, thirty-two, told me that she will “have to [become polyamorous], mostly because it makes it easier to find someone. If you’re only looking for a monogamous relationship, your chances of finding someone are less.” Likewise, Kris, nineteen, remarked that “in terms of being able to jump in [to the dating scene], there’s who you’re willing to share. If you’re interested in someone, it can’t bother you that they would also be with someone else. You have to learn to embrace a new perspective of how to be intimate with people.” Community members adjusted their sexual preferences to accommodate partner availability. One member called herself “polyconvenient” to express her situation of reluctantly engaging in polyamory so that she could be with the man in the community to whom she was attracted but who had no interest in monogamy. Another member, Carter, twenty-two, shared his story about a relationship he started with a woman who already had another male partner:
<disp-quote>
<p>During my visitor period, I met this really attractive woman here who had a boyfriend. She said she and her boyfriend had experimented with being monogamous for two months and it didn’t turn out well, because she really wants to be monogamous, but he doesn’t want to. So she told me, “We tried this experiment where me and him sleep together for six nights a week,” (laughs) “and the other night we can sleep with whomever else we want.”</p>
<p>So basically that’s what I was doing. I was dating a girl for one night a week, which I was happy with, because she was super attractive, and I was never really confident at home. So it’s like, one night a week we can sleep together. I was happy with that. But her relationship with her other boyfriend was very stressful on her, because he would basically sleep with every woman that stepped foot on this farm, visitors and guests. So I guess it was polyamory, but he sort of was pushing her boundaries a lot. That was a lot of stress on her. And she figured—she really wanted to be monogamous with him, and if she couldn’t get him to be monogamous, by default she had to have other partners, because she didn’t want to be the one—yeah. So I was that other person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Carter, the woman reluctantly agreed to a six-night-a-week arrangement with her primary boyfriend to maintain her relationship with him. Carter, too, did much the same. While he would prefer a monogamous relationship, he too sacrificed his desire for monogamy to gain sexual access to the person he found attractive. Also, while polyamory involves engaging in multiple loving and caring relationships, and not “sleeping with every woman who steps foot on this farm,” some community members used the label of polyamory as a cover for casual sex.</p>
<p>In sum, several factors together steered community members away from monogamy and towards polyamorous relationships. They included the normalization of close physical (and sometimes sexual) contact between members, the lack of support for monogamous relationships, and the relatively small number of available sexual and romantic partners. Some members agreed to engage in polyamory to maintain intimacy with partners who required it. Some reasons for participating in polyamory appear to contradict the idea of polyamory as “feminism in practice”; however, I suggest that the equation of polyamory with feminism was the <italic>tool</italic> members used to make sense of their agreement to a relationship model that initially did not attract them. Finding the ways that feminism justified their behavior helped them reconcile their actions with their changing beliefs and feel supported in practicing polyamory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0891241612464886">
<title>Polyamory Is the Feminist Way</title>
<p>Once members moved toward a practice of polyamory, they called upon their cultural resources to justify their decision. Members viewed themselves as participants in a particular strain of socialist feminism that values shared resources and no private ownership, and came to understand polyamory as a relationship model that also embraced those ideals. The parallels between the two ideologies created opportunities to put their feminism into practice.</p>
<p>People who move to an intentional community go through a period of major cognitive and emotional readjustment as they question formerly held beliefs and forge new social understandings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612464886">Wolkomir (2001</xref>, 407) explains, “ideological change can be threatening and difficult, entailing periods of cognitive and emotional disruption as people relinquish old ideas and wrestle with new ones.” The community members in this study deliberately challenged many of their previously held beliefs regarding leadership, competition, and capitalism, but monogamy may have been the most difficult belief to discard. To reconcile their belief system with their new sexual practice, they needed to find common ground between their newly acquired understandings of the philosophies of polyamory and their long-standing knowledge of feminism.</p>
<p>Members helped each other find the parallels between feminism and polyamory as they make the difficult and emotional ideological shift. For instance, in the <italic>Open Hands</italic> pamphlet, monogamy was referred to as “a possessive contract,” linking the “possessiveness” of patriarchal monogamy with the exclusivity of a lover. Rejecting monogamy was a symbolic ideological protest against this “possessive and patriarchal” relationship model. For instance, Emily, twenty-nine, spoke of her conceptualization of the relationship between feminism and polyamory: “I do feel that for myself and the other [members who are] feminists, [polyamorous relationships] are a feminist thing. The non-ownership aspect is very important to us.” By redefining polyamory as a feminist practice, members felt good and proud of their intentional decision, which might otherwise be construed as a situational necessity.</p>
<p>By contrast, monogamy did not get the same feminist stamp of approval, particularly in heterosexual relationships, precisely because of its implied ownership of women by men. One member wrote, in a book about her experience at the community, “We aren’t a society that gives much respect or support to marriage or marriage-like arrangements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241612464886">Kinkade 1994</xref>, 183). She suggested that a growing interest in feminist thinking among community members encouraged women to “feel complete in [themselves] and not dependent on a man. [The women] are urged not to arrange her life to suit her partner’s, nor subordinate her other interests to the success of her relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241612464886">1994</xref>, 183). This encouraged sexual and relational independence and persuaded female members that monogamous long-term relationships were not in their best interests and did not follow the feminist philosophy of the community.</p>
<p>Additionally, the community treated all members as individuals, not as a part of a couple or a family unit. This treatment was most apparent in the assigning of living quarters. Every member, including each child, was assigned her or his own room. Barbara, seventy-six, a founder of both of the communities in this study, explained that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The [original] structure is still in place, with everybody having their private room. Male and female, they can get together. They can sleep in each other’s room. But we don’t house people as families. We house people as individuals. I think that is what’s led, not to the dismantling of family, but to the encouragement of alternative families, which, even here, there might be, you know, someone as a primary parent and then there’s maybe a secondary parent, but other parents’ relationships are polyamorous.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to housing people as individuals, all the rules, benefits, and costs of membership took place between the community and the individual. Every member received the same monthly allowance, with no additional benefits or special privileges awarded to couples or families. These structural factors defined the individual as the basic social unit just as the community’s support of feminism and polyamory defined multiple lovers as the basic relationship configuration over monogamy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research offers a processed view of ideological work that members of two intentional communities undertook to accept polyamory as a sexual/relational practice. Members did not initially join the community to practice polyamory, but once there, they encountered several mechanisms that encouraged polyamory while discouraging monogamy. Most new members fully embraced the idea of nonmonogamy and could easily understand it as a feminist sexual arrangement, but the practice of nonmonogamy presented a challenge that required a great deal of ideological and emotional work both on their part and on the part of other members.</p>
<p>In previous studies of noncommunal polyamorous groups, couples or individuals engaged in multiple relationships after they had already become interested in the theories of polyamory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612464886">McLean 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612464886">Noël 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241612464886">Sheff 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612464886">2006</xref>). In my study, most polyamorous members found themselves practicing polyamory before they had fully subscribed to the philosophy. Thus, members spent more time doing “remedial ideological work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612464886">Berger 1981</xref>). They validated their actions by linking them to feminism, a parallel philosophy to which they already subscribed. My research reaffirms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241612464886">Snow and Benford’s (2000</xref>, 56) views of ideology as a cultural resource used to frame activity: a process “that involves the articulation of elements of existing beliefs and values, most of which are associated with existing ideologies.” For most members, the combination of the connection between polyamory and feminism, the communities’ ongoing emotional and structural support of polyamorous relationships, and the members’ desire for personal growth through ideological work proved sufficient for their acceptance and even embrace of the practice.</p>
<p>In addition, this research contributes to a broader understanding of situational sexuality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612464886">Escoffier (2003</xref>, 552) points out, “all sexual performance is fundamentally situational and does not always result in long-lasting social psychological commitment to any one form of sexual activity.” What I have termed <italic>situational polyamory</italic> occurs when monogamously identified people enter a community encouraging polyamory and marginalizing monogamy. As described in this study, the particular features of these communities as well as the privileged social location of the members allowed members to shift away from their former practice of sexual/relational monogamy. Their access to financial, social, and cultural capital promoted experimentation with nontraditional sexual and relational arrangements and supported the time-intensive ideological work needed when rejecting dominant ideologies.</p>
<p>Further research should focus on how members’ sexual/relationship practices change after members leave the community. I suspect that members who return to mainstream society return to monogamy, because the situational circumstances encouraging polyamory will no longer be present, and they will instead be replaced by factors maintaining monogamy’s dominance in mainstream society. Of course, polyamorous individuals exist outside of intentional communities, and the structures that supported polyamory in the communities are not necessary conditions for polyamory in general. When members leave the community, they also leave behind whatever compelled them to join the community in the first place, such as an extended transition to adulthood and the search for an alternative lifestyle. Many members leave because they wish to “settle down” in a traditional sense by starting a career and a family. While it is possible to be polyamorous and have a family and career, these members may view their polyamorous behaviors as a wild part of their youth. Even, and perhaps especially, if polyamorous practices are short-lived, the finding that members reject monogamy while in the community reaffirms research on situational sexual behaviors by showing how sexual behavior can shift when one’s environment changes. Members’ possible reversion back to monogamy when leaving the community by no means proves the “naturalness” of their monogamy but again points to the impact of environment on our sexual choices, behaviors, and identities. In this case, the culture and policies in place in the community and the connection between polyamorous ideology and feminism provided many members with the ideal situational framework to shift away from monogamy. These changes, even if temporary, will likely have long-term impacts on how they view and negotiate future relationships.</p>
<p>This research also demonstrates that people use sexual behavior as a means of living their values and politics. The participants in this study offered a contemporary example of people practicing sexual relationships in a way that paralleled their stated egalitarian, communication, and feminist values. Members’ political beliefs shaped their sexual choices, and their sexual choices became politicized, thus moving the practice of polyamory beyond an “individual choice and personal agency” model often seen in mainstream polyamorous texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612464886">Noël 2006</xref>). Little writing exists about the politics of sexual behavior outside of a gendered sexual orientation; however, the politicization of sexuality, and in particular the decision to change one’s sexual behaviors to more closely match one’s values, has been explored before. One example is the case of political lesbianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241612464886">Jeffreys 1990</xref>). Polyamorous relationships in intentional communities provide a unique opportunity to examine how a group commits to progressive gender politics through its encouragement of sexual diversity.</p>
<p>Finally, this research sheds much-needed light on the complex relationship between sexual identity and sexual behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612464886">Barker (2005</xref>, 84) notes that unlike notions of “sexual orientation” which center around gender preference as a way of organizing sexual identity (hetero-, homo-, and bisexual identities), “the way in which people conduct their relationships (monogamous, polyamorous, or otherwise) seems to have a more complex relationship to self-identity” (84). Past studies of situational homosexuality in prisons or the military suggest that one’s sexual identity does not necessarily change even if sexual behavior changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241612464886">Rust 2000</xref>). The lack of change in sexual identity was also true for community members in this study. Members who practiced polyamory did not actively embrace the identity of a “polyamorist.” The members’ lack of claim on the identity was due to their awareness of the situational status of their practices. It was also due to their belief (shared by much of Western society) that sexual identities are something one is essentially “born with,” not a practice in which one engages. They did not see themselves as born with a desire for polyamory, so community members did not claim this identity. This contrasts the polyamorist participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612464886">Barker’s (2005</xref>, 83) study who “often explicitly stated that they were ‘naturally’ polyamorous” and therefore claimed a polyamorist identity. As our scholarly understandings of sexual identity move beyond “gay, lesbian and bisexual” into other axes of desire and ways of relating, empirical studies such as this one illuminate the complex intersection between identity, desire, and behavior.</p>
