<p>As in the two earlier volumes of this <italic>History</italic> reviewed in the <italic>Expository Times</italic> 122.4 (January 2011), Reventlow is always strong on the historical context, or more accurately, the life-stories of his interpreters. It is very much an account of people, rather than movements or schools of thought. Historians might find it a bit naïve in its preference for history as biography. Sometimes, for example in the coverage of Thomas Cartwright as the representative English Puritan, we get seven pages of ‘life’ to two pages about ‘Cartwright and the bible’; and the anachronism ‘fundamentalism’ is used.</p>
<p>Volume Three concerns the Renaissance and the Reformation. It quickly becomes evident that Reventlow likes the humanists. Colet as a Pauline scholar receives much attention, with his combination of attention to historical context and to allegory owing to Platonising, as would also be the case with the great Erasmus: such a synthesis led them both to emphasise ethics. But it is refreshing that our author has a place for the Florentine Manetti. I was hitherto unfamiliar with the debate over Ps 8:6/Heb 2:7: ‘a little lower than God’, was proposed by Lefèvre d’Étaples, who thought ‘“lower than the angels” would be going too far.’</p>
<p>The work on the mainline Reformers seems less fresh: the reading lists at the back are dated. It is almost as if in this volume the amount of scholarship on these almost overwhelmed him. Reventlow is thorough on Calvin, but it is on the ‘minor’ figures where his contribution lies. When we get to Grotius it seems that we have finally climbed out of the clouds. This despite that polymath’s Catholicising in later years, when he came to believe in apostolic tradition as important for interpretation of Scripture. He appreciated patristic exegesis (although that would not make him almost Roman Catholic as Reventlow implies) so in that sense he was not fully a modern exegete. For the Lutheran Calov, Grotius’ posthumous opponent, it was not the case that he tied bible to dogmatic meanings, but inversely, the bible was the source for all development of doctrinal themes. <italic>Analogia fidei</italic> means merely interpreting scripture by scripture, which Grotius forgot in chasing after all sorts of foreign interpretations. Reventlow’s setting high store by biography helps here, for it is useful to know that Calov attempted his commentaries where he takes on Grotius in his old age (the 1670s).</p>
<p>When one turns to Volume Four, it becomes clear that sometimes the translation is not perfect, e.g.: ‘…for having saved the Lutheran subject-matter’, when the last word ‘Sache’ really needs to be rendered ‘cause’ (p. 5). Or on p. 158: ‘[Reimarus]…died peaceably’ is not quite right. But to be honest over the piece it does rather well and I think improves as it goes on.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hobbes, while it seems right to feature him, a lot of the secondary literature here seems a generation out of date. ‘The Word of God delivered by the prophets is the main principle of Christian politics’. This is a different picture of Hobbes from the received one. The OT provided ‘the model according to which the NT was understood’. It is rather an odd judgment however when Reventlow writes that Locke was not ‘following the views of Paul [but] remained in the humanistic tradition’ (p. 65). Perhaps he means ‘Augustine’ rather than Paul, not least because, as Reventlow admits, by the time he came to write his Annotations on Paul, Locke had put a distance between himself and rationalists like Toland, and asserted the ‘divine authority of Scripture’. He viewed Adam as a representative of the human race, not its patriarch. Locke’s fundamental views of freedom and equality ‘originally rested not in biblical faith but rather in modern theories of natural rights’ (p. 66). Perhaps, but one has to think where these ‘modern theories’ sprang from.</p>
<p>Spinoza believed that biblical prophecy relied on a more vital power of the imagination, akin to the natural knowledge that human beings were originally endowed with. Christ was different from prophets because he grasped things truly adequately, like a philosopher. Spinoza had a functional view of Scripture’s holiness: if used aright, it could lead people to holiness, as a book of moral instruction. Intuition of God’s laws left room for moral freedom (p. 99). But it was with his differentiation of ‘meaning’ and ‘truth’ (to be bracketed out) that Spinoza made his mark, such that henceforth academic study became committed to ‘what the bible <italic>meant</italic>’.</p>
<p>There is then a long middle section on Pietism and the Bible. One question is this: how did Pietists allow the bible to become a book to be studied rather than obeyed? Does it make sense to see Radical Pietists as owing their ‘radical’ nature to Pietism itself, so as to make their contribution to this shift, or was it something of a common inheritance from Deism imported from England, as Reventlow presumably used to think? In any case this all seems to have happened quite late, symbolised in the triumphant return of Christian Wolff, the Leibnizian philosopher to Halle in 1740. How much need one think of standard Pietism as being a stage on the way to full-blown ‘historical criticism’ as seems to be the thesis of Reventlow? The likes of Reimarus and Lessing are hardly to be thought of as Pietists in any meaningful sense, yet they are included under that heading. In fact they did have pietist contemporaries in the shape of Bengel and Zinzendorf, whose occupation with the bible was quite different. Reventlow presents the Pietists as almost hollowed out from the inside by the parasite that was Enlightenment Scholarship. Otherwise it is quite hard to know what Reventlow is up to, beyond giving us information, rich as it is.</p>
<p>For Reventlow, Semler and Eichhorn appear as the pioneers, placed at the head of the “Bible and Scholarship” section. The latter took over the <italic>Einleitung</italic> form from Michaelis, that historian of literature. But Eichorn was the first to try to cover the whole Hebrew bible. Gabler was more a systematic theologian, so Reventlow regards G.L. Bauer as one who, with hindsight was a better option for the future of biblical scholarship. Really De Wette is the stand-out figure. Personal mentoring by Herder stamped him and the influence of Schelling moved him to see the bible as an aesthetic work, since access to God was through the elevation of our minds. A theology of progressive revelation is apparent here, and likewise in the case of his argument against any interpolations in the Pentateuch, theology was driving DeWette’s decisions about the text. Reventlow’s own preferences do come to the fore. Yet he tries to be fair to Hengstenberg, praising his positive arguments – e.g., that Daniel has to be prior to Ezra-Nehemiah to have got into the canon; and Christ and the apostles’ testimony confirms Daniel’s status– for all his failure to take the bible as being a record of saving <italic>history</italic> and to raise any real objections to his enemies’ positions. Such is the case with the argument against DeWette and the consensus position, that the change from calling God Elohim to the tetragrammaton came through the action of his self-disclosure. The chapters on Ewald and Vatke (conservative Göttingen) versus Hegelian Berlin are useful.</p>
<p>Reventlow is rather weak on the Twentieth Century. The plot is one of Barth and Bultmann as forming a reaction against the History of Religions School, which in the figure of Bousset is given, arguably, too much coverage, although the space given to Gunkel is both deserved and rewarding.</p>
<p>Of course this work is not comprehensive. How could it be? But it takes the reader a long way. There are a number of things to fault, and some things badly need updating, but this is a work of a giant, and the English translations of these volumes, the odd infelicity apart, provide a fitting monument to this recently deceased scholar.</p>

<title>Facsimile of the Matthew Bible</title>
<p>William Tyndale &amp; Myles Coverdale, edited by John Rogers, <italic>Matthew’s Bible – A Facsimile of the 1537 edition</italic>, with an introduction by Joseph W. Johnson (Peabody: Hendrickson, 2009. $46.99. ISBN: 978-1-59856-349-8).</p>
<p>The four hundredth anniversary of the King James Version of the bible has been marked with such gusto that the earlier English translations of the bible have been virtually overshadowed. The <italic>Matthew Bible</italic> is sometimes said to have the distinction of being the first complete English Bible to have been translated from the Greek and Hebrew. That is both true, but also slightly misleading. Its slightly earlier predecessor the Coverdale Bible (1535) was the first complete printed English Bible, but various sections were not translated from Greek or Hebrew, but were secondary translations of Vulgate or even German bibles. Much more of the Matthew Bible was the result of direct translation from the original biblical languages – the entire New Testament replicated Tyndale’s 1526 translation (later revised 1534 and 1535) and substantial portions of the Old Testament, which he had translated prior to his martyrdom. Other portions of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha were the work of Coverdale, who translated primarily from German and Latin sources.</p>
<p>This facsimile replicates one of the finest surviving examples of the 1537 printing of the Matthew Bible, which is part of the collection of Joseph W. Johnson, the author of the introduction. It is also noted that ‘the images were meticulously edited, with stains, marks, and damage removed, and imperfect type improved’ (p. x). An original 1537 Matthew Bible can be purchased for $270,000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.greatsite.com">www.greatsite.com</ext-link>). Alternatively, one may chose to pay $46.99 for this splendid facsimile, which is beautifully presented, professionally bound, reproducing the red-ink in the appropriate places in the prefatory matter; the choice is of course the reader’s! One’s eye quickly adjusts to the Gothic script and the early-modern English spellings. The visuality of this book as a sixteenth century artefact, and the cadences of language that are heard when the text is read aloud almost transport the reader back to Tudor England.</p>
<p>This volume would be valued as a teaching tool, a display item, or even as a bible to be read for personal devotion. However, what it does do above all is to give one a sense of the physical shape and feel of one of the earliest complete English Bibles. Hendricksons are to be highly commended for making such an important facsimile so affordable and readily available.</p>
