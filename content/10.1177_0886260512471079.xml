<abstract>
<p>Four hundred and fifty-three married or cohabitating couples participated in the current study. A meditational model of men’s perpetration of sexual coercion within an intimate relationship was examined based on past theories and known correlates of rape and sexual coercion. The latent constructs of adjustment problems and maladaptive relational style were examined. Adjustment problem variables included perceived stress, perceived low social support, and marital discord. Maladaptive relational style variables included psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy. Sexual coercion was a combined measure of men’s reported perpetration and women’s reported victimization. As hypothesized, adjustment problems significantly predicted sexual coercion. Within the meditational model, adjustment problems were significantly correlated with maladaptive relational style, and maladaptive relational style significantly predicted sexual coercion. Once maladaptive relational style was introduced as a mediator, adjustment problems no longer significantly predicted sexual coercion. Implications for treatment, limitations, and future research are discussed.</p>

<p>As shown in a recent review of sexual coercion in intimate relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512471079">Monson, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, &amp; Taft, 2009</xref>), the majority of research on sexual aggression focuses on understanding predictors of sexual coercion outside an intimate partner or marriage context. Studies focusing on sexual coercion within intimate relationships are often based on their relation to psychological and physical aggression, not to other relationship factors such as marital discord and stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a model of sexual coercion within couples, in which maladaptive relationship style mediates the relationship between adjustment problems and sexual coercion. To our understanding, this is the first research focusing on maladaptive styles of partner interaction and perception of social support, general stressors, and relationship stress that may lead to the development of sexual coercion.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512471079">
<title>Current Understanding of Sexual Coercion</title>
<p>Sexual aggression has been studied most prominently as a form of assault against females (i.e., rape), and estimates of its prevalence often come from studies on crime, such as the National Crime Victims Survey (NCVS). The NCVS has shown that about one-third of females in representative populations report that they have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512471079">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Sexual assault in the NCVS refers to rape and other forms of physically coerced sexual activity, and data from the NCVS show that only 10% of such assaults were made by a married partner or an ex-partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512471079">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Therefore, from the crime survey data, one might conclude that approximately 3% of women are assaulted by a husband or ex-partner. However, based on research with a San Francisco random community sample by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512471079">Russell (1990)</xref> and a Boston area probability community sample of mothers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512471079">Finkelhor and Yllo (1985)</xref>, it is estimated that the lifetime prevalence of marital rape by husbands, cohabiting partners, or ex-husbands is between 10% and 14%. Rape of men by women is very rare; it was reported by only 0.3% of the population in a national sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512471079">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). The differences in these prevalence rates of 3% and %10 to 14% seem large, but these differences may be methodological in nature. Though both the NCVS and research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512471079">Russell (1990)</xref> focused on crime, Russell took great care to train interviewers to elicit detailed personal information from participants regarding their experiences with sexual coercion and rape. Additionally, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512471079">Finkelhor and Yllo (1985)</xref> was initially part of a study on child victimization, and mothers were only asked about their experiences with rape and sexual assault later in the study. As discussed in the Sexual Victimization of College Women study (SVCW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512471079">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000</xref>), the screening procedures given to potential participants in the NCVS may not have described behaviors specifically enough and may have contained language with criminal connotations that led to lower reports of rape.</p>
<p>The lifetime prevalence of male perpetration of sexual coercion (not rape) within intimate relationships across various samples appears to range from about 29% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512471079">Hines &amp; Saudino, 2003</xref>) to nearly 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512471079">Marshall &amp; Holtzworth-Munroe, 2002</xref>), with rates higher in clinical samples than in community samples and rates of coercion higher than rates of rape and assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512471079">Monson et al., 2009</xref>). There is significantly less research on women’s perpetration of sexual coercion and aggression with estimates between 1% and 5%. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512471079">Meyer, Vivian, and O’Leary (1998)</xref>, 35% of husbands seeking marital therapy and 23% of husbands in a community sample reported perpetration of sexual coercion within the past year. However, the current study goes beyond solely surveying prevalence rates by evaluating a mediation model of sexual coercion using individual and relationship variables. Finally, in the current study, sexual coercion is defined as insistence or verbal pressure to engage in sexual activities and/or promising rewards or necessities in exchange for sexual activities.</p>

<title>Theories on Sexual Coercion and Aggression</title>
<p>The etiology of sexual coercion can be understood from several perspectives, including those based on sexual narcissism, hostile attitudes toward women, and evolutionary patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512471079">Baumeister, Cantanese, and Wallace (2002)</xref> proposed that <italic>narcissistic reactance theory</italic> can explain both rape and sexual coercion. Here, when a man is refused sexually, his desire for his sexual target increases, and he then tries to reclaim his target by forcing a sexual interaction. Such sexual narcissism has been found to be a stronger predictor of sexual aggression than more global or general assessments of narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512471079">Widman &amp; McNulty, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Relatedly, one of the most well-known theories on coercion and rape as a function of hostility is the <italic>confluence model</italic>, initially proposed by Malamuth et al. in 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512471079">Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, &amp; Tanaka, 1991</xref>). A 10-year follow-up study of men’s characteristics and violence toward women showed that “hostile masculinity” and “impersonal (e.g., noncommittal, promiscuous) sex” interacted to predict both sexual violence toward women and marital and relationship distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512471079">Malamuth, Linz, Heavey, Barnes, &amp; Acker, 1995</xref>). Other researchers have also found characteristics such as “sexual dominance” and “accepting attitudes toward casual sex” to be significant predictors of coercion (Abbey, Parkhill, Clinton-Sherrod, &amp; Zawacki, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512471079">Schatzel-Murphy, Harris, Knight, &amp; Milburn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other investigators stress the importance of evolutionarily learned patterns of sexual coercion in relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512471079">Goetz, Shackelford, Romero, Kaighobadi, and Miner (2008)</xref> suggest that men’s perpetrated aggression may be explained by paternal uncertainty, where sexual aggression serves to prevent a man from being the husband of an unfaithful woman. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512471079">Kaighobadi, Shackelford, and Goetz (2009)</xref> further theorize that men may engage in sexually coercive behaviors when they are suspicious of sexual infidelity to decrease the chances of parenting another man’s offspring.</p>
<p>We believe that another model, namely a dyadic model of partner aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary, Smith Slep, &amp; O’Leary, 2007</xref>), may be able to be able to account for sexual coercion within an intimate relationship separately from rape and sexual assault. The dyadic model has been evaluated in both the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary et al., 2007</xref>) and in Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512471079">O’Leary, Tintle, Bromet, &amp; Guzman, 2008</xref>) as a predictor of physical aggression in a relationship, but this work has not been extended to sexual coercion. The dyadic relationship perspective is one in which relationship strain, psychological aggression, and dominance/control are key constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512471079">Riggs &amp; O’Leary, 1996</xref>). In the current research, relationship dissatisfaction, low levels of social support, and perceived stress, conceptualized as adjustment problems, as well as maladaptive individual styles in interacting with a partner, measured by psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy, are used to predict sexual coercion. Additionally, many of these characteristics may be seen within the aforementioned models. For example, dominance is an important piece in both the confluence model and in the paternal uncertainty research. Similarly, jealousy and marital distress are also discussed. However, the theoretical mechanisms driving these variables differ markedly.</p>
<p>Because the first three theoretical positions seek to explain both sexual coercion and rape, and rates of sexual assault and rape are lower than rates of sexual coercion, those theories may be more applicable to more severely disturbed relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512471079">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512471079">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, many of these characteristics occur on a continuum and therefore may be more prevalent, whereas other dichotomous behaviors (e.g., impersonal sex) may not happen within the context of a long-term intimate relationship. Research has also shown that as sexual abuse within a relationship increases, relationship satisfaction decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512471079">Panuzio &amp; DiLillo, 2010</xref>), thereby implying that relationships containing more abuse may be more disturbed. However, as discussed previously, rates of sexual coercion within relationships are much higher than rates of rape and sexual assault within relationships. Therefore, it is important to have a strong understanding of sexual coercion in less dysfunctional relationships and in representative samples.</p>

<title>Studies Addressing Specific Variables Used Herein as Predictors of Sexual Coercion</title>
<p>While the studies above were generally designed to provide documentation for a specific theoretical position regarding sexual coercion, there also exist a number of studies that document correlates with sexual aggression or coercion in the absence of a specific theoretical model. Throughout the literature on sexual coercion, it has been shown that sexually coercive men exhibit a greater proportion of reactive and aggressive characteristics toward their partners than noncoercive men. In particular, jealousy has been associated with intimate partner violence in general and specifically with sexual coercion across multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512471079">DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512471079">Dutton, van Ginkel, &amp; Landolt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512471079">Fleischmann, Spitzberg, Andersen, &amp; Roesch, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512471079">Dutton et al. (1996)</xref> has shown significant correlations between jealousy and abusiveness for couples who are together, and jealousy and intrusiveness for divorced or separated couples. Other research has shown that sexually aggressive males and females were both more likely to engage in jealous behaviors and use domineering tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512471079">Muñoz-Rivera, Graña, O’Leary, &amp; Gonzalez, 2009</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471079">Goetz and Shackelford (2009)</xref> found that men’s sexual coercion was consistently predicted by both female infidelity and men’s controlling and domineering behavior. Both jealousy and dominance have also been shown to be significant predictors of both physical and psychological aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, psychological aggression has been consistently shown to be a predictor of sexual coercion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512471079">Meyer et al. (1998)</xref> found that sexual coercion was more closely associated with psychological aggression, whereas sexual aggression (use of force to obtain sexual activity) was more associated with physical aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512471079">Marshall and Holtzworth-Munroe (2002)</xref> have also shown associations between sexual coercion and psychological aggression. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512471079">Katz, Carino, and Hilton (2002)</xref> found that in a sample of heterosexual dating undergraduates, psychological aggression was associated with both sexual coercion and physical aggression. However, both men’s and women’s controlling behaviors were associated with male perpetration of sexual coercion and were not associated with physical aggression, suggesting that more severe psychological aggression and controlling behaviors have a unique relationship with sexual coercion.</p>
<p>Taken together, the body of research on these traits and associations shows that men who engage in sexual aggression and coercion show jealous, dominant, and psychologically aggressive behaviors toward their partners. While the above research suggests that maladaptive relational styles may be central in the prediction of sexual coercion, it is also possible that individual adjustment problems may be centrally related to sexual coercion. Research has also shown that sexual coercion may also be related to several adjustment problems, including stress, social support, and marital dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471079">Bodenmann, Lederman, &amp; Bradbury, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471079">Dehle, Larsen, &amp; Landers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512471079">Mburia-Mwalili, Clements-Nolle, Lee, Shadley, &amp; Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512471079">Panuzio &amp; DiLillo, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260512471079">Sullivan, Pasch, Johnson, &amp; Bradbury, 2010</xref>). These adjustment problems have also been shown to be significantly related to jealousy, dominance, and psychological aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary et al., 2007</xref>). This study evaluates whether maladaptive relational styles mediate the relation between individual adjustment problems and sexual coercion.</p>
<p>Intimate partner violence has repeatedly been shown to be associated with marital discord, with bidirectional intimate partner violence having a stronger association with discord than unidirectional violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512471079">Panuzio &amp; DiLillo, 2010</xref>). Marital discord also has a unique association with sexual aggression, beyond the relationship between marital discord and physical and psychological aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512471079">Panuzio &amp; DiLillo, 2010</xref>). Additionally, when there is high stress in a relationship, marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activity decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471079">Bodenmann et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471079">Bodenmann et al. (2007)</xref> also found that relationship stress mediated the relationship between outside stress and both relationship functioning and sexual satisfaction. Finally, high stress is related to lower marital satisfaction over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471079">Bodenmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512471079">Neff &amp; Karney, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, research has shown that social support (both inside and outside the relationship) predicts long-term marital satisfaction and that strong social support is related to positive conflict management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471079">Dehle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260512471079">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>). Outside social support also may create a buffer against depression in women experiencing intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512471079">Mburia-Mwalili et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Current Study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512471079">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>Maladaptive relational style and adjustment problems are correlated, and not only do they predict sexual coercion within a relationship, but they predict one another as well. With this in mind, the current study focuses on developing a model of the interconnectedness of these constructs and their effects on men’s sexual coercion. We hypothesized that sexual coercion is predicted by a model in which the relationship between adjustment problems (a composite measure of relationship discord, stress, and social support) and sexual coercion is mediated by maladaptive relational style (a composite measure of psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy). Specifically, we predicted that (a) adjustment problems would initially be positively associated with sexual coercion. Once maladaptive relational style was introduced into the model as the mediator, we hypothesized that (b) the relationship between adjustment problems and sexual coercion will no longer be significant, (c) adjustment problems would be positively related to maladaptive relational style, and (d) that maladaptive relational style would be positively related to frequency of sexual coercion. Since maladaptive relational style is more proximally related to sexual coercion, we believe that maladaptive relational style is a more important predictor of sexual coercion than adjustment problems.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Four hundred and fifty-three heterosexual couples from Suffolk County, New York, were recruited through random digit dialing as part of a larger study on families and conflict (for a detailed description of recruitment procedures, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512471079">Slep &amp; O’Leary, 2005</xref>). To be eligible for the study, couples had to be living together for at least 1 year and parenting a biological child (age 3 to 7) of at least one of the partners. Of the 1,815 eligible couples recruited through random digit dialing, 453 agreed to participate. As documented elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512471079">Slep &amp; O’Leary, 2005</xref>), couples were representative of the population of parents with young children in the United States, as compared to the 2000 census data. Additionally, based on the initial phone screen, there were few differences between those people who did and did not agree to participate in the full study. Notably, there were no significant differences in relationship satisfaction, husband-to-wife aggression, or wifeto-husband aggression.</p>
<p>Men had a mean age of 37.25 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.02), and the mean educational attainment was 14.2 years (<italic>SD =</italic> 2.3). The majority of participants reported themselves to be Caucasian (79.4%), with 9.5% Hispanic/Latino, 6.6% African American, 1.8% Asian, 1.3% Caribbean, 0.4% Native American, .2% Pacific Islander, and 0.7% other. The majority of the couples were married (94.5%), and mean family income was $81,498 (<italic>SD</italic> = $43,009). Women had a mean age of 35.1 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.02), and the mean educational attainment was 14.3 years (<italic>SD =</italic> 2.2). The majority of participants said they were Caucasian (81.9%), with 7.7% Hispanic/Latino, 5.7% African American, 2.2% Asian, 1.5% Caribbean, 0.7% Native American, and 0.2% other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260512471079">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Couples came to the lab for two 3-hour sessions or one 6-hour session for a study on how families handle conflict. Participants separately completed extensive self-report measures on themselves, their families, and their relationships, following which some physiological and observational data were collected. Anonymity and confidentiality of responses were carefully explained, and participants were told that although all written answers would be anonymous, information volunteered to research staff would be confidential unless child abuse, suicidality, or likely homicide was reported. Additionally, all participants received a list of family resources, including abuse hotlines and other abuse-related services. This project was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all participants consented before beginning the study. Couples were paid $250.00 for their participation.</p>

The scale has good reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471079">Cohen et al., 1983</xref>), and alpha for men herein was high (α = .85).</p>

<title>Psychological aggression</title>
<p>The measure of psychological aggression was derived from the Psychological Aggression Scale of the Conflict Tactics Scale-II (CTS-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512471079">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>). The CTS-II is a 78-item measure that assesses the frequency of perpetration and victimization of partner conflict behaviors within the past year. Statements are rated from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 6 (<italic>20 or more times</italic>) and assess physical, psychological, and sexual aggression, in addition to partner-inflicted physical injuries. In order to compensate for underreporting and create a couple report of men’s perpetration, men’s perceptions of their perpetration of psychological aggression and women’s perceptions of their victimization of psychological aggression were compared, and the higher of the two scored was used for analyses. Because the overall rate of men’s perpetration of mild psychological aggression was extremely high (96.9%), only items representing severe psychological aggression were used for this analysis. This strategy allowed for us to look at the more pathological aspects of relational functioning, excluding normative levels of conflict. Alpha was high (α = .76).</p>

The dominance measure is a 22-item scale that was derived from a factor analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512471079">Kasain and Painter (1992)</xref>. Because the dominance score reflects interpersonal interactions, scores were based on an average of the husband’s reports of perpetration and the wife’s reports of victimization. Alpha for the average scores for dominance scale for men was .57 and alpha for the self-report of dominance was .71, reflecting in part the lack of agreement between husbands and wives.</p>

<title>Sexual Coercion Measure</title>
<p>The measure of sexual coercion was derived from the sexual abuse scale of the CTS-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512471079">Straus et al., 1996</xref>). In order to compensate for underreporting and create a couple report of men’s perpetration, men’s perceptions of their perpetration of sexual coercion and women’s perceptions of their victimization of sexual coercion were compared, and the higher of the two scored was used for analyses. The final sexual coercion scale consisted of four items from the CTS-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512471079">Straus et al., 1996</xref>). Items used to calculate sexual coercion were men’s responses to “Have you insisted on sex when your partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)?” and “Have you insisted on oral or anal sex when your partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)?” and women’s responses to “Has your partner insisted on sex when you did not want to (but did not use physical force)?” and “Has your partner insisted on oral or anal sex when you did not want to (but did not use physical force)?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512471079">Straus et al., 1996</xref>, p. 309).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All data were initially examined for missing values and normality. If more than half of the items for a variable were available, missing values were replaced using mean substitution. If fewer than half were available, that participant’s variable score was estimated. Variables were examined for outliers, and clear outliers greater than four standard deviations above the mean were deleted. Missing variables were replaced using estimation maximization in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>The overall prevalence rate of men’s self-reported perpetration of sexual coercion was 28.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 453; <italic>M</italic> = .44, <italic>SD</italic> = .87). When using maximum reports, the overall prevalence of men’s perpetration of sexual coercion was 42.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 453; <italic>M</italic> = .79, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22). Differences in prevalence rates were also examined in ethnic groups that contained greater than 10 participants. African Americans’ maximum report of sexual coercion was 73.33%, Caucasians report was 37.88%, and Latino/Hispanics’ report was 55.81%. Despite this heterogeneity, we were not able to examine the possible differences among models because of the small number of participants in the African American and Latino/ Hispanic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512471079">Boomsma, 1983</xref>). However, all participants were retained so that the results would be representative of the general population. Although the sexual coercion distribution was negatively skewed, it was assumed to be an appropriate approximation of the population, and therefore adjustments were not made. As noted earlier, there was a very low endorsement for items related to sexual assault or rape; men’s self-reported perpetration rate was 1.5%, and the maximum report of men’s perpetration was 5.3%.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512471079">Table 1</xref> presents means and standard deviations of all included variables, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512471079">Table 2</xref> presents all correlations. Latent variable analysis was used herein to examine the data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512471079">Figure 1</xref>, the initial relationship between the latent variable adjustment problems and sexual coercion showed a good fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 453) = 1.96, <italic>p</italic> = .38. Additionally, the beta weight of the association between adjustment problems and sexual coercion was significant and positive (β = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The model also showed a good fit with the addition of the mediator maladaptive relational style, χ<sup>2</sup>(12, <italic>N</italic> = 453) = 26.20, <italic>p</italic> = .01. Although the chi-square was statistically significant, it may be due to the large number of participants. Once this mediator was introduced, the association between adjustment problems and sexual coercion was no longer statistically significant (β = −.14, <italic>p</italic> = .08). Sobel’s test was conducted to examine the significance of this mediating effect and indicated it was statistically significant (Sobel’s test = 5.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As predicted, there was a strong positive association between adjustment problems and maladaptive relational style (β = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and a strong positive relationship between maladaptive relational style and sexual coercion (β = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>To further investigate goodness-of-fit, we used the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The CFI is a measure of how well the hypothesized model fits the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512471079">Byrne, 2010</xref>). It has been advised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512471079">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref> that a well-fitting model should have a CFI &gt; .95. The RMSEA asks, “How well would the model, with unknown but optimally chosen parameter values, fit the population covariance matrix if it were available?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512471079">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>, pp. 137-138). This measure is sensitive to the complexity of the model; a RMSEA &lt; .08 is considered a reasonable fit, and a RMSEA ≤ .05 is considered a good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512471079">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>). Additionally, it has been suggested that a narrow 90% confidence interval around the RMSEA indicates a more precise RMSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512471079">Byrne, 2010</xref>). Finally, as described by Brown and Cudeck (1993), the PCLOSE is a p-value that measures whether the RMSEA is a good fit within the population with larger values indicating a better overall model fit. This final model showed a strong fit across these indices: CFI = .99 and RMSEA = .05, with the RMSEA 90% confidence interval from .024 to .78, and PCLOSE = .431.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that a second model controlling for systematic measurement covariance was also examined. Here, the error variances of jealousy and dominance were allowed to correlate, as they are both from the Psychological Maltreatment of Women scale (PMW), and the error variances of psychological aggression and sexual coercion were also allowed to correlate, as they are both from the CTS-II. In this model, the fit indices are as follows: χ<sup>2</sup>(12, <italic>N</italic> = 453) = 14.62, <italic>p</italic> = .15, CFI = .995, RMSEA = .03, 90% Confidence Interval from .00 to .065, and PCLOSE = .79.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As was the case in two previous studies on sexual coercion, in newlyweds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512471079">Panuzio &amp; DiLillo, 2010</xref>) and in a marital clinic sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512471079">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>), the sexual coercion found in this randomly recruited sample was almost solely psychological coercion. Alternatively stated, only 5% of men used physical force to engage partners in sexual activity, despite the fact that 34.9% of the sample reported men’s perpetration of physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512471079">O’Leary et al., 2007</xref>). The data support the hypothesis that maladaptive relational style in the form of a composite measure of psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy is a significant mediator of the relationship between adjustment problems and sexual coercion. As hypothesized, the unmediated relationship between adjustment problems and sexual coercion showed a significant positive association. Specifically, the frequency of perpetration of sexual coercion was higher when men reported greater adjustment problems, with more marital discord, moreperceived stress, and lower social support. However, once maladaptive relational style was introduced into the model, the relationship between adjustment problems and sexual coercion was no longer statistically significant. Hypotheses pertaining to the mediation model were supported; adjustment problems were positively associated with maladaptive relational style, and maladaptive relational style was positively associated with sexual coercion. Accordingly, greater marital discord and stress, and lower social support were associated with higher psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy. Higher psychological aggression, dominance, and jealousy were associated with greater frequency of men’s sexual coercion perpetration within the relationship.</p>
<p>These data are in accord with past research that shows the association of adjustment problems and partner conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471079">Bodenmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512471079">Davila &amp; Kashy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471079">Dehle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512471079">Neff &amp; Karney, 2004</xref>). Our data also corroborate research on maladaptive relational style and the perpetration of various forms of partner control and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512471079">DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512471079">Dutton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512471079">Fleischmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471079">Goetz &amp; Shackelford, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471079">Goetz and Shackelford (2009)</xref> found that in couples, men’s sexual coercion was consistently predicted by both women’s infidelity and men’s controlling behavior. However, the majority of past studies on sexual coercion have been done neither with couples nor in random community samples. This research is the first to provide a model of sexual coercion within a couple relationship based on salient life context and relationship variables. This model of sexual coercion also addresses areas in which past models of sexual coercion focusing on rape fall short; namely, how to apply the research clinically. The researchers address this issue by formulating a theory of sexual coercion that is not only existent within a couple context but also utilizes basic life, relationship, and personality variables to predict sexual coercion perpetration.</p>
<p>Although a fair amount of research exists describing couples therapy with physically and/or verbally abusive couples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512471079">O’Leary, Heyman, &amp; Neidig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512471079">O’Leary &amp; Woodin, 2009</xref>), there is a shortage of treatment literature with couples concerning sexual abuse and sexual coercion. Past work on sexual coercion and abuse predominantly details specific personality characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors, such as sexual narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512471079">Widman &amp; McNulty, 2010</xref>) and paternal uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512471079">Goetz et al., 2008</xref>), which may be less amenable to change than adjustment problems such as stress and social support. Although the research herein does not provide direct answers for treating couples where sexual coercion exists, it can give clinicians and researchers insight into avenues for change for the perpetrator. Stress may be improved through interventions such as mindfulness, either individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512471079">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512471079">Chiesa &amp; Serretti, 2009</xref>) or in a couple context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471079">Gambrel &amp; Keeling, 2010</xref>), and lack of social support may be improved by increasing social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512471079">Riggio, Watring, &amp; Throckmorton, 1992</xref>). Past research also shows increased nonspousal social support may increase effectiveness of intimate partner violence interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512471079">Mburia-Mwalili et al., 2010</xref>). Couple’s therapy targeting jealousy may assist with a person’s maladaptive relational style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471079">Cano &amp; O’Leary, 1997</xref>) or using therapeutic modalities such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which improve impulse control and dysfunctional thought patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512471079">Grant &amp; Potenza, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Although this research fills a gap in the sexual coercion literature, it is not without limitations. Primarily, because other measures of sexual coercion did not exist within the data set, the sexual coercion measure consisted of only four items (two from perpetrator report and two from victim report) from the CTS-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512471079">Straus et al., 1996</xref>). In the future, it may be advisable to replicate this model using a more inclusive measure of sexual coercion, such as the Sexual Coercion in Intimate Relationships Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512471079">Shackelford &amp; Goetz, 2004</xref>). Additionally, future research could examine this model in a more variable sample. Although this model of sexual coercion can be generalized to parents of young children, the implications for couples without children and/or homosexual couples are unknown.</p>
<p>Agreement between partners in the current sample was also much greater for psychological and physical aggression than it was for sexual coercion; percent agreement was 91% for psychological aggression, 78% for physical aggression, and 61% for sexual coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512471079">O’Leary &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). In intimate relationships, perception of coercion is one potential issue, as partners appear to misperceive actions of the other regarding sexual behavior more than they do of other behaviors. Disagreement about sexual relations is a prominent piece of both narcissistic reactance theory and evolutionary and infidelity-related theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512471079">Baumeister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512471079">Kaighobadi et al., 2009</xref>). Research has also related sexual problems to physical and psychological aggression within dating relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512471079">Feiring, Simon, &amp; Cleland, 2009</xref>). Because of the nature of the data collected, we were unable to examine the relationships between intimacy disagreements and the other variables in the mediation model.</p>
<p>Although past research has shown that early marital dissatisfaction may lead to later partner aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512471079">O’Leary, Malone, &amp; Tyree, 1994</xref>), we cannot conclude that the same pathway is acting within this current model. Furthermore, it is very possible our model of sexual coercion may be recursive, such that although adjustment problems and a maladaptive relational style may lead to increased frequency of sexual coercion, increases in sexual coercion also lead to greater adjustment and relational problems.</p>

<p>This study focuses exclusively on sexual coercion, and not on sexual assault or rape, as correlates for the latter may be different. Furthermore, there was a very low rate of endorsement for items related to sexual assault or rape (rate of men’s reported perpetration was 1.5%, maximum reports of men’s perpetration was 5.3%).</p>
