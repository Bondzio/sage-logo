<abstract>
<p>Coating of copper on austenitic stainless steel (SS-316) is useful where high thermal conductivity as well as high electrical conductivity along with high strength is desirable. Common applications of these coatings include aerospace systems such as space stations and satellites. Usually, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques are employed for developing such coatings. In the present work, copper coatings with an average thickness of 230 micrometers were successfully developed on SS-316 substrates using microwave hybrid heating (MHH) technique. The MHH technique was employed in order to enhance the coupling efficiency of the target material (metallic copper powder) with the incident microwaves at room temperature. Copper powders of average grain size 5 micrometers were melted and deposited on the steel substrates by controlled exposure of microwave radiation of 900 W at 2.54 GHz frequency in a multi-mode applicator. Coatings were analysed through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and measurement of microhardness. The developed coatings were reasonably uniform, dense, and homogenous, although the presence of micropores was detected. Coatings were formed by necking, followed by agglomeration, and fusing of melted copper particles during microwave irradiation. Microstructure of the developed coatings consists of 3-D chain like arrays of the fused particles. The presence of oxides of copper in the deposits has been confirmed. The coatings so developed had a mean hardness of 270±30 HV.</p>

<p>The need for faster and eco-friendly methods of production of high-performance, often tailor-made, functional surfaces has been on the rise. Surface engineering of functional surfaces using microwave energy can provide pragmatic solutions to such needs. It has opened-up opportunities to explore the possibilities of using many materials in unusual applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911414652"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. Coating, in general, is a widely used surface engineering technique to develop an overlay of suitable materials on substrates of desired properties. Metallic coatings on alloys or non-metals have many advantages. Superior properties of metals can be better exploited by modifying a functional surface of an alloy or non-metallic substrate through suitable metallic coatings.</p>
<p>In general, stainless steel has good mechanical properties, but has low thermal and electrical conductivities. Copper coating on stainless steel can compensate for these deficiencies. Thus, stainless steel can become a better candidate in such applications while retaining its superior bulk properties. Copper has excellent electrical as well as thermal properties, making it one of the most useful common metals. However, its high cost and low strength become major obstacles in many potential applications even while compromising on the system efficiencies. Copper coatings, on the other hand, can be fabricated by several methods including physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), thermal spraying, magnetron sputtering and electrolytic deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911414652"><bold>2</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911414652"><bold>4</bold></xref>]. While most of these techniques have relatively high set-up and operating costs, electrolytic deposition and magnetron sputtering technique have low deposition rate that results in longer fabrication time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911414652"><bold>4</bold></xref>]. Thus, it is important to investigate new processing technique(s) having the potential to produce improved microstructures and properties, which potentially could be a low-cost technique with a higher processing speed.</p>
<p>In the recent years, microwave processing of materials has emerged as one of the fastest and efficient material processing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911414652"><bold>5</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911414652"><bold>6</bold></xref>]. Microwave processing is considered beneficial over conventional processing methods in the context of reduction in processing time, volumetric and uniform heating, selective and controlled heating, improved properties, environmental friendliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911414652"><bold>6</bold></xref>]. Further, microwave processing of materials is different from the conventional thermal processing methods. Microwave energy heats the material at the molecular level, which leads to uniform bulk heating. In the conventional heating systems, however, the material becomes heated from the surface to interior through thermal gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911414652"><bold>7</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954408911414652"><bold>8</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Recent literatures indicate domestic microwave ovens are being extensively used for faster processing of several ceramic systems at 2.54 GHz processing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911414652"><bold>5</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408911414652"><bold>9</bold></xref>]. However, the microwave absorption coefficient for metals in 2.45 GHz radiation is significantly less at room temperature, which makes it extremely difficult to achieve heating using microwaves. This necessitates the use of hybrid heating (conduction + microwave) technique to achieve effective heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408911414652"><bold>10</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954408911414652"><bold>11</bold></xref>]. Furthermore, in bulk metals, sinusoidal microwaves can penetrate effectively up to the skin depth (<italic>δ</italic>). The skin depth of any material is a function of wave angular frequency (<italic>ω</italic>) of the microwave radiation, conductivity (<italic>σ</italic>), and magnetic permeability (<italic>μ</italic>) of the material body. It is given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formulaml-disp1-0954408911414652">equation (1)</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954408911414652"><bold>12</bold></xref>].</p>
<disp-formula id="disp-formulaml-disp1-0954408911414652"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911414652-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
<p>Skin depth for highly conductive material is significantly less; for example, skin depth for bulk copper is 1.33 µm at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911414652"><bold>13</bold></xref>]. Metals were, thus, earlier contemplated as not viable to be processed through microwaves at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911414652"><bold>14</bold></xref>]. However, this condition does not exist in compacts of metal powder. The skin depth increases (up to few centimetres) and microwaves can penetrate deep into the compacts of powder metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911414652"><bold>13</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Researchers in the last decade started work on microwave processing of metals in the form of sintering and joining. Successful sintering of WC-6Co through microwave heating has been reported in the year 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954408911414652"><bold>15</bold></xref>]. The sintered microstructures show that the platelets are embedded in a fine-grained hardmetal matrix with an average size of 0.6 µm. Sintering of composite materials with a composition of iron (Fe), copper (2 per cent Cu), and graphite (0.8 per cent) using a microwave field has been reported. The sintering was carried out at 1200ºC for 30 min which resulted in excellent density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954408911414652"><bold>16</bold></xref>]. It was further reported that sintering of different metal-based materials (Al, Mg, Solder alloy) and the microwave sintered product exhibited better tensile properties than conventional sintered components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954408911414652"><bold>17</bold></xref>]. Manufacturing of near-net-shape and net-shape green metal part (AISI 420 with polymeric binder) through microwave sintering has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954408911414652"><bold>18</bold></xref>]. Comparative sinterability of as-received powder and activated tungsten powder in microwave was also carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954408911414652"><bold>19</bold></xref>]. In the study, it was observed that the activated tungsten powder shows better densification because of reduced particle size and higher specific surface energy. Joining of bulk copper by using copper powder as filler material through microwave hybrid heating has been achieved by Sharma <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954408911414652"><bold>20</bold></xref>]. This work was carried out in a home microwave applicator at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, and power of 900 W to achieve the joining within 5–10 min.</p>
<p>Studies have also been carried out on the interaction of electromagnetic waves on conductive materials like copper. Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911414652"><bold>21</bold></xref>] have reported that some of the conductive metals get heated up well in an electric field, while others become heated in a magnetic field. Copper, on the other hand, gets heated in both the electric and magnetic field in a single mode microwave applicator. Recent studies, however, show that copper particles are highly conductive, and hence they highly suppress the electric field inside them even if the copper powder particles are smaller than the skin depth. Owing to this, copper powder particles are predominately heated up more rapidly in the magnetic field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911414652"><bold>13</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911414652"><bold>21</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Development of coatings using microwave energy has been reported on Ti-6Al-4V substrate. It was reported that coating of friction reducing alloys has been developed using CuNiIn powder (56.3–59.8 per cent copper, 35.5–37.5 per cent Ni, 4.7–5.2 per cent. In and up to 1 per cent impurities) through microwave radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954408911414652"><bold>22</bold></xref>]. The present paper reports on development of copper coatings using microwave hybrid heating on austenitic stainless steel and their characterization. Results are briefly discussed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954408911414652"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</title>
<p>In the present work, copper coatings have been developed on austenitic stainless steel substrate using a multimode domestic microwave oven (ƒ=2.45  GHz, 1 kW) with dry metallic copper powders. The following sections briefly describe the development and characterization of the coatings.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954408911414652"><title>2.1 Materials details</title>
<p>In order to develop copper coating on austenitic stainless steel, electrolytic copper powder (99.5 per cent pure) having average grain size of 5 µm was used. Typical morphology of raw copper powder used for deposition is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911414652">Fig. 1</xref>, the bi-modal distribution of copper grains is evident.

Austenitic steel (SS-316) plates having dimensions 35 mm×12 mm×1 mm were used as substrate material.

<sec id="sec4-0954408911414652"><title>2.2 Development of coatings</title>
<p>Preparation of raw powder and substrates is critical in development of coatings. In the present work, the substrates were cleaned in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath prior to deposition. The copper particles were pre heated at 100° C for 24 hours in a conventional muffle furnace. Preheating removes possible moisture content in the powder. The substrate SS-316 was placed on a silica-based insulation plate and then powder was spread manually on SS-316 substrate maintaining an approximately uniform thickness of 0.5 mm. Melting of the powder particles was achieved in a domestic microwave oven at frequency 2.45 GHz and 600–900 W power. The skin depth of copper at the frequency used (2.45 GHz) is less than (∼1.3 µm) the size of the copper particles (∼5 µm) used in the trials. Hence the copper particles cannot directly interact with microwave radiation at room temperature, instead, will tend to reflect microwaves. In order to overcome the problem of microwaves being reflected by metallic copper, coatings were developed by microwave hybrid heating (MHH) technique using charcoal as susceptor.</p>
<p>Microwave hybrid heating may be employed to surmount the difficulties in heating low microwave absorbing material like metal. Microwave hybrid heating utilizes an additional material (susceptor) in the microwave cavity that readily absorbs electromagnetic energy at room temperature. The susceptor couples with microwaves at room temperature and gets heated up rapidly which, in turn, elevates the temperature of the copper particles enabling them to couple with microwaves at higher temperature. The metallic material is heated up through the conventional mode(s) of heat transfer from the hot susceptor material.</p>
<p>In order to avoid possible contamination of metallic coating by susceptor charcoal powder used in the MHH, a 99 per cent pure graphite sheet of thickness ∼1 mm was used as a separator between the susceptor and copper powder as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911414652">Fig. 3</xref>. The figure shows a schematic view of the MHH arrangement adopted during the trials. Details of development of coatings / cladding using MHH with suitable examples have been discussed at length by the present authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911414652"><bold>23</bold></xref>] elsewhere.

<p>In the present investigation, experimental trials were carried out at the constant power 600 W and 900 W while varying interaction time from 60 s to 420 s in a step of 60 s for a constant thickness (approximately 0.5 mm) of powder layer. The corresponding observations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954408911414652">Table 2</xref>. It was observed that the coating (melting and dilution) largely depends on microwave exposure (interaction) time. Copper coatings of 230 microns were obtained at the power of 900 W and an irradiation time of 420 s. The parameters used in the investigation are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954408911414652">Table 3</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-0954408911414652"><title>2.3 Characterization of the coatings</title>
<p>The copper coatings were subsequently washed thoroughly with acetone in an ultrasonic cleaner prior to characterization. The deposited copper coatings were cut along the coating thickness at the centre using a low-speed diamond cutter (Model: BAINCUT - LSS, Make: Chennai Metco, India). The cut sections of the coating specimens were cold-mounted using resins for polishing. The mounted specimens were polished first by emery paper of 320 grit, followed by further polishing using emery papers of grades 1X, 2X, 4X, and finally with 1µm diamond paste in a cloth wheel machine. Specimens were then water cleaned and dried in hot air.</p>
<p>The XRD patterns were obtained at room temperature in a Bruker AXS diffractometer with Cu Kα X-ray. The scan rate used was 1°  min<sup>−1</sup> and the scan range was from 20° to 80°. The analysis of coatings microstructures and chemical composition of the coatings were carried out in a field emission scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV equipped with energy dispersive X-ray detector (Model: Quanta 200 FEG). Microhardness on the surface of the coatings was evaluated by Vickers microhardness tester (Mini load, Leitz, Germany) at a load of 10 g for duration of 30 s. Average of three samples and three indentations were considered in each set.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954408911414652"><title>3 MECHANISM OF COATING FORMATION</title>
<p>Microwaves interact with different materials selectively. Bulk metals at room temperature are generally considered not to be processed through microwaves. However, in the present work, it was found possible through microwave hybrid heating. In microwave processing, as the operating frequency used is maintained constant (i.e., <italic>ω</italic> is constant), increase in skin depth can be achieved by possible decrease in the values of either electrical conductivity (<italic>σ</italic>) or magnetic permeability (<italic>μ</italic>), or both, of the materials as indicated by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formulaml-disp1-0954408911414652">equation(1)</xref>. These temperature-dependent material properties can be changed (decreased, in this case) to increase the skin depth (<italic>δ</italic>) of the poor microwave absorbing material (most of the metals at room temperature) to enhance its coupling with microwaves. An initial rise of temperature of such non/poor microwave absorbing materials can be achieved through MHH by conventional modes of heat transfer.</p>
<p>In microwave hybrid heating, sinusoidal microwaves initially couple with a susceptor which helps raising the temperature of the target non-coupling (non-microwave absorbing at room temperature, e.g. copper) material within a short duration. As indicated earlier, copper particles do not couple with microwaves at room temperature owing to its very low skin depth. Consequently, if MHH is employed, the copper particles, at elevated temperature, start coupling with microwaves as the skin depth increases with the decreases in electrical conductivity (<italic>σ</italic>) as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formulaml-disp1-0954408911414652">equation (1)</xref>. This results in volumetric heating in the metallic powder layer which eventually gets deposited on the substrate (in the present work, SS-316). The mechanism of development of coating through microwave can be conceptually divided into three phases, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911414652">Fig. 4</xref>.

<p>In phase–I, the arrangement is exposed to microwaves, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911414652">Fig. 4(a)</xref>. Charcoal rapidly absorbs microwaves and becomes heated up. Consequently, the temperature of the copper powder layer starts rising owing to the conventional modes of heating through the thin graphite separator. This heating of the copper layer is mostly convection dominated as no compaction was carried out on the preplaced layer. Thus, there will be large air gaps between the particles in the preplaced powder layer as shown. Once the temperature of copper powder particles rises, the skin depth of the copper powder particles increases and they start interacting with microwaves. The coupling of microwaves with the powder particles causes further rise in temperature throughout the volume of the preplaced powder layer. At elevated temperature, in phase II, necking of the softened particles occur and the necked particles subsequently get agglomerated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911414652">Fig. 4(b)</xref> as a precursor to fusing and producing homogeneous dense coating. In the meantime, a thin layer of the substrate in the vicinity of the hot, semi molten copper powders becomes heated up through the conventional modes of heat transfer. The thickness of the heated layer remains very small as the heat flow properties of the austenitic stainless steel substrate are not very high. Further, the processing time is too short for the heat to flow from the heated powder layer through a substantial thickness in the steel substrate. Heating of the bulk austenitic stainless steel owing to the interaction with the microwaves, on the other hand, shall remain negligible owing to its small skin depth.</p>
<p>In the third phase, the necked and fused powder particles forms a chain of densely interconnected materials. The molten particles get fused and wets the hot adjacent layer of the substrate, eventually yielding a uniform metallic coating over it as illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911414652">Fig. 4(c)</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954408911414652"><title>4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The present work is concerned with development of metallic coatings with fine metallic powders as precursor on bulk metal-based materials (austenitic stainless steel). Initial results from various characterizations are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0954408911414652"><title>4.1 X-ray diffraction study</title>
<p>A typical XRD spectrum of copper coating developed by hybrid microwave heating is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911414652">Fig. 5</xref>. Pure copper has an FCC structure which is a close-packed structure. The developed copper coatings exhibit a strong preferred orientation towards (111) plane. The XRD pattern of the copper coating having FCC lattice clearly shows three main crystal faces (111), (200), and (220), while the precursor powder contained copper (311) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911414652">Fig. 2</xref>. In the diffraction pattern, traces of oxides of copper are also detected along with the copper peaks. These oxides of copper identified as Cu<sub>2</sub>O (cubic, corresponding to 2θ∼37º) and CuO (monoclinic, corresponding to 2θ∼36º), are generated during the coatings formation which subsequently suppressed the growth of copper crystallites. Formation of initial oxides during microwave processing was favoured owing to the fact that the deposition process was not protected from atmospheric contamination. However, as the susceptor becomes heated, it (charcoal powder) creates a reducing environment which prevents further oxidation of copper powder particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954408911414652"><bold>24</bold></xref>]. The presence of cuprous oxide and cupric oxide during the microwave exposure facilitated better coupling of microwaves resulting in faster heating during microwave exposure. However, coupling of microwaves with copper molecules and resulting rapid heating prevents further oxide formation in the inner layers. The diffraction pattern also shows the presence of graphite (trace) on coating surface. It is attributed to the fact that a graphite sheet was used as separator during deposition process as mentioned earlier. A minimal diffusion of carbon at elevated temperature could have resulted in the appearance of this peak corresponding to 2θ∼27º. A insignificant amount of mixing owing to mechanical handling can also be attributed to this.

<p>However the NIR values do not represent the exact amount of phases present, it gives only a relative representation of amount of phases. Thus, during the formation of coating in the ambient condition, approximately 14 per cent of starting copper powder gets transformed into various oxides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954408911414652">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954408911414652"><title>4.2 Microstructure study</title>
<p>Typical surface topography of the copper coatings on SS-316 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954408911414652">Fig. 6</xref>. The surface morphology of the copper deposits shows reasonably dense, equiaxed, and homogeneous coating. This can be attributed to the volumetric nature of heating associated with microwave processing of materials. The observed unevenness of the top surface is the result of inaccuracies involved in the manual preplacing of the starting powder. Typical microstructures along the transverse section of copper coatings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911414652">Fig. 7</xref>. The scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911414652">Fig. 7(a) and (b)</xref> clearly illustrate the mechanism of formation of the copper coatings. Necking and fusing of powder particles in all three directions, as discussed in section 2 of this article, are seen. The illustrations reveal that the growth of coating is an array of chain like three-dimensional (3-D)network of fused copper particles. The formation of chain-like structures of the fused particles forms basis of the coatings as evident in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911414652">Figs 7(a) and (b)</xref>. The observed microstructures, on the other hand, hardly show any presence of semi molten or unmelted particles indicating once again the uniformity in the coatings structure associated with the volumetric heating during MHH. The agglomeration and fusion of powder particles also reveal good bonding between the particles in the chain like network. However, some micropores are also appearing in the formation of the microchain structures as can be identified in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954408911414652">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911414652">Fig. 7</xref>.

<p>The chemical composition of the coatings was also analysed through energy dispersive spectroscopy. Typical EDS result on the scanned area of microstructures as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911414652">Fig. 7 (a)</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911414652">Fig. 8</xref>. Results of typical EDS spectra of copper coatings shows the presence of Cu-K, Cu-L, O-K, and C-K peaks at their own energy bands. Presence of O-K is attributed to formation of oxides of copper owing to the fact that the deposition process was not protected from atmospheric contamination. During microwave processing, at the elevated temperature, the copper particles react with atmospheric oxygen and form the oxides of copper–cuprous oxide and cupric oxide respectively as follows
<fig id="fig8-0954408911414652" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Typical EDS spectrum of copper coating</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911414652-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>

<p>These oxides facilitate better coupling of microwave in the powder layer. The presence of oxides on EDS spectrum validates the results of X-ray diffraction pattern of copper coating as discussed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911414652">Fig. 5</xref>). In the EDS spectrum of copper coating, localized presence of diffused carbon (C-K energy bands) can also be seen.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the distribution of copper, oxygen and carbon in the coating microstructure, coatings were also analysed with X-ray elemental mapping as illustrated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Figure 9(a)</xref> presents the FE-SEM scan area over which the elemental mapping was carried out. The mapping result as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9(b)</xref> illustrates a uniform distribution of target element indicating formation of a dense and uniform coating. As mentioned earlier the coatings were processed in atmospheric condition. Thus, during microwave heating copper particles interact with atmospheric oxygen leading to formation of oxides on coating surface which is indicated by the presence of oxygen as clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9(c)</xref>. Localized presence of carbon elements as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9(d)</xref>, on the other hand, confirms the presence of impurity carbon atoms owing to the graphite separator used. However, presence of this element is highly localized and insignificant. The localized presence may indicate a possible mechanical mixing of trace graphite with that of starting powder. The relative dominance of different elements on the coated surface can be clearly seen in the overlapping of all the elemental mappings as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9(e)</xref> and the superimposed elemental mappings on the scanned SEM image as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911414652">Fig. 9(f)</xref>.

<sec id="sec10-0954408911414652"><title>4.3 Microhardness study</title>
<p>Vicker’s microhardness survey was also carried out on the microwave heating induced deposits at 10 g load on three sets of samples, where each set contains three identical deposits. In each sample, microhardness has been measured on three different locations. The coating microhardnesses on set-1, set-2, and set-3 were observed to be 270±30 HV, 256±22 HV, 267±27 HV respectively as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954408911414652">Fig. 10</xref>. The bulk microhardness of copper on three different locations was also measured by keeping the same load, which was found to be 70±12 HV. Significantly, the Vicker’s microhardness of the copper coating was found much higher than that of pure copper as measured (70±12 HV) and as reported by Gulbinski <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) (∼36.71 HV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954408911414652"><bold>26</bold></xref>]). The increase in coating surface hardness can be attributed to the high degree of particle fusion. Further, necking and formation of the observed chain like 3-D network structure in the coating microstructure also contribute to good bonding and mechanical interlocking between the particles leading to higher microhardness. It is further observed that the measured microhardness values have a deviation of 30 HV from the mean value, which is 9 per cent of the mean value. The deviation could be attributed to the formation of oxides of copper during deposition. The hardness of Cu<sub>2</sub>O has been reported to be 210 to 230 HV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954408911414652"><bold>27</bold></xref>].

<sec id="sec11-0954408911414652" sec-type="conclusions"><title>5 CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The current work reports the initial results on development of copper coating on austenitic stainless steel substrate through microwave hybrid heating along with a general understanding on the process mechanism. The work confirms the viability of the metallic deposition process on metallic substrates using microwave energy. A conceptual framework on development of copper coatings on metallic substrates through MHH has been presented.</p>
<p>The results establish that it is possible to develop homogenous, uniform and dense copper coatings on the SS-316 steel substrates by heating of metallic powders using microwave energy. During heating, initially, necking of the copper particles takes place which is followed by agglomeration, fusion, and formation of long chained array. The fusion of powder particles result in good bonding between the powder particles. The coatings are formed in a chain like 3-D network onto the substrate surface giving rise to a significantly high microhardness. The increased microhardness of the coatings is attributed to the change in its structure during the microwave processing. The MHH induced coatings contain copper having FCC structure along with oxides of copper. Further characterization of the coatings is in progress.</p></sec>
