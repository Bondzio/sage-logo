<abstract>
<p>Renal relapse in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) is a risk factor for poor renal function. Therefore, there is a need to identify clinical and serological risk factors for renal relapse. A total of 108 patients with LN were enrolled in this study. All the subjects had achieved complete remission or partial remission following six months of induction therapy. We retrospectively analyzed their clinical and laboratory indices, final renal function, and kidney biopsy findings. The median follow-up period after LN diagnosis was 81 months. Renal relapse had occurred in 36 patients; it occurred in 38% and 46% of patients within five and 10 years after achievement of renal remission, respectively. There was no difference between the relapsed rate in patients with complete remission and that in those with partial remission. Clinical variables at LN onset and renal biopsy findings in the patients with sustained remission and relapsed patients were also not different. The probability of renal relapse was significantly higher in patients with an earlier age of onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (≤ 28 years <italic>versus</italic> &gt;28 years; HR 7.308, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), seronegativity for anti-Ro antibody (seronegativity versus seropositivity; HR 3.514, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), and seropositivity for anti-dsDNA antibody at six months after initiation of induction therapy (HR 8.269, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Our study demonstrated that early onset of SLE, seronegativity for anti-Ro antibody and increased anti-dsDNA antibody following six months of induction therapy independently predict renal relapse among the LN patients.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313476357" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, characterized by diverse multisystem involvement. Renal involvement is one of the most serious manifestations of SLE, occurring in 50–80% of patients with SLE during the course of their illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476357">1</xref></sup> The presence of renal involvement produces a higher mortality rate, and reduced renal function is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity in SLE patients, such as accelerated atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476357">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476357"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476357">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the survival of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) has increased during recent decades, 20–30% of LN patients eventually progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Our recent report indicates that chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in 22% of patients within 10 years after LN onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476357">5</xref></sup> Despite an improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and an introduction of new induction regimens, the five-year ESRD rate in LN patients has not decreased over the recent three decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476357">6</xref></sup> For rheumatologists, that disappointing report raises the question of additional surrogate endpoints, other than an achievement of remission at the time of completing the induction treatment.</p>
<p>The rate of renal relapse remains high, even among LN patients who have achieved a successful response to induction therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476357">7</xref></sup> The renal relapse rates vary from 25% at five years, to 46% at 10 years, and 36% early after treatment withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476357">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476357"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476357">10</xref></sup> Although renal relapse has a negative impact on renal outcome, there have been relatively fewer efforts to investigate the clinical and pathological risk factors for the development of renal relapse among LN patients.</p>
<p>The studies investigating renal outcome or treatment response upon LN patients each have different response criteria and various time points for the response evaluation. Moreover, ethnicity may affect the treatment response and clinical course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313476357">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476357">12</xref></sup> Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate previously known risk factors for renal relapse to Korean patients with LN. Furthermore, the observational period of number of previous studies was limited.</p>
<p>For this report, we conducted a case-control study of 108 Korean patients with LN. The enrolled subjects were limited to patients who were successfully treated with six months of induction therapy. Among them, 36 patients suffered renal relapse during a median follow-up period of 81 months. We compared the clinical and pathological parameters and examined the cumulative incidence of renal relapse. Finally, we identified independent predictors of renal relapse in Korean patients with LN.</p>

<p>Between January 1985 and May 2011, 458 patients with LN were identified from the lupus cohort at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital. All the patients met the classification criteria for SLE, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313476357">13</xref></sup> Subjects were excluded if they had less than six months of follow-up after the diagnosis of LN, they had diabetes as a comorbid condition or they lacked clinical data. The patients who underwent quantitative examination for proteinuria at the onset of LN and whose results met the ACR renal criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313476357">14</xref></sup> were recruited for this study. The only subjects in whom treatment response evaluated at six months after initiation of induction therapy met remission (either complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR)) were only included in the present study. Finally 108 patients were enrolled. The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (KC11RISI0762).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313476357"><title>Definition</title>
<p>The response criteria were defined according to the ACR 2006 clinical trial criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476357">15</xref></sup> CR was defined as (1) normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥90 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> or &gt;25% increase from baseline, (2) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &lt;0.2 or a dipstick test of 0 to trace with at least 50% reduction in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, (3) less than five red blood cells/high power field (HPF), and (4) no cellular casts in the urine. PR was defined as meeting the ACR 2006 clinical trial criteria for remission with the exception of a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio between 0.2 and 2. If the patients met at least two parameters, but were missing information on the other criteria, then they were labeled as partial responders (pR). Patients were defined as non-responders (NR) if they failed to meet any of the criteria for remission. Disease relapse was characterized as a &gt;25% decline in the GFR, a 50% or more increase in proteinuria or active urine sediment characterized by &gt;5 erythrocytes/HPF and/or cellular casts. Nephrotic proteinuria was defined as proteinuria &gt;3.5 g/24 hr or a uninary protein:urinary creatinine ratio of &gt;3.0. Hypertension (HTN) was defined as a supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg.</p>

<p>The demographic data (gender, age at the time of SLE or LN onset and the disease duration), clinical data (the kind of treatment regimen as induction or maintenance therapy, the body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure at the time of LN diagnosis), the autoantibody profiles measured at the time of renal presentation (anti-dsDNA, anti-nuclear, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-Ro/La, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulants (LAC), rheumatoid factor (RF)), the biochemical parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), the presence or absence of thrombocytopenia (defined as less than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), serum creatinine, serum albumin, complement (C3, C4) levels, level of 24-hour urinary protein excretion, the absence or presence of hematuria (&gt;5 erythrocytes/HPF) and estimated GFR (eGFR) at baseline, three, six and 12 months after the diagnosis of LN were obtained from the medical records. The onset of SLE or LN was taken as the date at which the diagnosis of SLE or LN was made. The GFR was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation:

<p>The disease duration at the time of LN was taken as the interval between the date of diagnosing SLE and the date of the diagnosis of LN. The histological pattern of disease was established using the 1982 modified World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and the activity and chronicity index (AI and CI) scores were calculated using the scoring systems of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313476357">16</xref></sup> Other pathological findings were also reviewed at the same time. The renal biopsies have been interpreted simultaneously by two different pathologists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313476357"><title>Treatment regimen</title>
<p>This is a retrospective, observational study and consequently the therapeutic regimens were not standardized. Despite this limitation, the data on the immunosuppressive regimen used for the induction and maintenance therapy of LN were available in the majority of cases. We also had access to the information on the cumulative cyclophosphamide (CYC) doses, the renal remission rates and the presence or absence of relapses experienced by the patients during the follow-up period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203313476357"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical software package (standard version 16.0: SPSS, Chicago, IL). When comparing the continuous variables between the groups, a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used if the distribution did not show normality and a Student <italic>t</italic>-test was used if the variables showed a normal distribution. And the chi-square test was employed for categorical variables. Cox’s proportional hazards model for estimating the hazard ratio and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify the predictive factors for the development of renal relapse. Multivariate models used a stepwise forward selection procedure based on a likelihood ratio test with <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.10 for removal and <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05 for entry of variables. Time to renal relapse from achieving remission was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were performed using the log rank test. The results are reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). Values of <italic>P</italic> less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>A total of 108 patients (103 women and five men) with LN who achieved remission six months following induction therapy were included in the analysis. Thirty-six patients had gone through renal relapse during a median follow-up period of 81 months. All of the subjects were Korean. There was no difference in their baseline demographic characteristics, which included gender and age at the onset of LN, between the patients in whom the renal relapse occurred and those in whom it did not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313476357">Table 1</xref>). The onset age of SLE was younger in patients with renal relapse (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013). The disease duration at the time of LN onset was no different. The majority of the subjects (97.2%) were seropositive for anti-nuclear antibody. The BMI, SBP, DBP, Hb concentration, serum uric acid level, presence of thrombocytopenia, presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, positivity for RF, C3 and C4 levels, presence of hematuria, and serum albumin level at LN onset were not associated with the occurrence of renal relapse.

<p>Interestingly, our data showed that seropositivity for anti-Ro antibody was correlated with a better prognosis for relapse-free renal survival. The proportion of LAC, anti-RNP antibody or anti-cardiolipin antibody positivity was not significantly different between the groups (data not shown). Renal function at the time of LN onset, represented by serum creatinine and the eGFR, the level of 24-hour proteinuria, and rate of nephrotic proteinuria were not significantly different between the two groups.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the renal histopathology in the two groups are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203313476357">Table 2</xref>. Forty-three patients (59.7%) from the sustained remission group underwent renal biopsy and 24 patients (66.7%) from the renal relapsed group underwent renal biopsy. A greater proportion of renal biopsies were performed within one month from renal manifestation (79.1% and 83.3% in sustained remission and relapse, respectively). Proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis (WHO class III and class IV) comprised a higher proportion in the relapsed group (82.6%), compared with the sustained remission group (53.5%) (not statistically significant). AI and CI, presence of glomerular sclerosis, fibrous crescent formation, and the presence of chronic tubulointerstitial changes were not associated with the development of renal relapse.

<p>Fifty-eight percent of the patients with sustained remission were treated with cytotoxic agents, including CYC and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Sixty-four percent of the patients who underwent renal relapse were also treated with these agents as induction therapy. The proportions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers used during induction therapies were similar between the two groups (40% versus 50%). Both groups showed similar rates of maintenance treatment with CYC, MMF, or azathioprine (42.1% versus 37.9%, 10.5% versus 6.9%, 17.5% versus 24.1% in sustained remission and renal relapse, respectively).

The median time from remission to relapse was 30 months (from six to 99 months). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of variables on the occurrence of renal relapse, in which potential confounders were included.

However, various investigations, including the present study, demonstrated that the occurrence of renal relapse seemed to result in more time to achieve re-remission than the first therapy to remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313476357">19</xref></sup> Therefore, we postulate that the repetitive development of renal relapse could finally result in deteriorated renal function including CKD or ESRD, although the rescue therapy is successful. Renal relapse was revealed to be one of the strongest predictors of progression of ESRD in patients with LN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313476357">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313476357"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313476357">22</xref></sup> Our recent report also showed that renal relapse after achieving remission is a time–dependent predictor for the development of CKD in patients with LN (HR = 2.806).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476357">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Houssiau et al<italic>.</italic> reported that an early response to immunosuppressive therapy at six months was associated with good long-term renal outcome in patients with LN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313476357">23</xref></sup> We demonstrated that patients who failed to achieve remission at six and 12 months tended to progress to CKD in addition to ESRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476357">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313476357">24</xref></sup> Consistent with the report by Houssiau et al<italic>.,</italic> we also showed that an elevated level of serum creatinine at baseline and six months, and low levels of serum albumin at six months following induction therapy were associated with the development of progressive CKD as well as ESRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476357">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313476357">24</xref></sup> Although the levels of proteinuria were minimal in both groups, the present study demonstrated that the levels of proteinuria at three and six months tended to be lower in patients with renal relapse (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961203313476357">Table 4</xref>), in contrast with what we expected. We carefully inferred that the severity of proteinuria did not play a role as a poor prognostic factor among the patients who achieved early remission following induction therapy. Indeed, the reduction of proteinuria in patients included in our study was at least 50%, as described in the patients and methods section. We provisionally conclude that the clinical variables of serum creatinine level at baseline, three months, and six months, and serum albumin level at six months that were associated with poor long-term renal outcome in proliferative LN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313476357">23</xref></sup> do not have a decisive impact on the occurrence of renal relapse among the patients in whom early renal remission (either CR or PR) was achieved.</p>
<p>Some previous studies searching for predictors for renal relapse demonstrated that patients with PR were more likely to have a renal relapse compared with those with CR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476357">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313476357">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313476357">18</xref></sup> All of those studies enrolled only patients with proliferative LN. On the other hand, we diagnosed and included LN patients according to the new ACR response criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476357">15</xref></sup> basing the diagnosis on their clinicopathological features as well as laboratory profiles. The aim of our study was to determine the predictors for renal relapse over all LN patients that were successfully treated with induction therapy.</p>
<p>Reported predictors of renal relapse include a high activity index, increased proteinuria, male sex, younger age at renal manifestation, hypertension at presentation, delay in initiation of cytotoxic treatment, and delayed response to and short duration of induction therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313476357">25</xref></sup> Our study also showed that a younger onset age at SLE as well as LN was associated with a higher probability of renal relapse. In concordance with our results, some reports demonstrated that a younger age plays a negative role in the long-term outcome of LN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313476357">26</xref></sup> Interestingly, one recent report presented the negative influence of young age on treatment nonadherence in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313476357">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anti-Ro antibody, which is also detected in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary biliary cirrhosis, is found in the sera from 30–50% of SLE patients. The presence of anti-Ro antibody is known to be associated with subacute cutaneous lupus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313476357">28</xref></sup> photosensitivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313476357">29</xref></sup> neonatal lupus heart block,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203313476357">30</xref></sup> and valvular heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313476357">31</xref></sup> in patients with SLE. Although only a small number of studies have been conducted to identify the impact of anti-Ro antibody in LN, they showed conflicting results. One report by Chien et al<italic>.</italic> demonstrated that a lower titer of anti-Ro antibody in SLE patients was associated with renal manifestation, suggesting its preventive effect on LN<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313476357">32</xref></sup> In contrast, other reports by Korbet et al<italic>.</italic> demonstrated that the presence of anti–Ro antibody played a role in progression to ESRD among patients with severe LN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313476357">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313476357">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although not all patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies show renal manifestation, the antibody is thought to be pathogenic, because some glomerular immune deposits from LN patients are enriched in anti-dsDNA antibodies. Along with a low level of complement (C3, C4), the level of anti-dsDNA antibody may be useful for monitoring SLE disease activity, especially in patients with renal involvement. Our results are in agreement with some previous reports, suggesting that increases in anti-dsDNA antibody levels are followed by renal flare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203313476357">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313476357"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313476357">37</xref></sup> Anti-dsDNA antibody levels may increase 10 or more weeks before SLE flares.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313476357">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961203313476357">39</xref></sup> For that reason, some argue that SLE patients whose serum level of anti-dsDNA antibody is significantly increased should be treated with immunosuppressant, even though they do not show any evidence of disease flare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313476357">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations of this study exist, and warrant discussion. Our study was retrospective, and based on a medical record review of the cohort cases. Nevertheless, we carefully selected the subjects that we enrolled in order to overcome the limitations of this type of study. Only patients who were treated over sufficient duration and with appropriate doses of induction and maintenance treatments were enrolled in the present study. The strengths of our study include a single-ethnicity, single-center experience over 25 years, and research limited to the patients first successfully treated with induction therapy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that renal relapse is common, even in the patients with LN who responded early following induction therapy. Renal relapse occurred in 46% of the Korean patients with LN within 10 years of achieving remission. Patients with CR and PR showed a similar rate of renal relapse in our cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified young age at SLE onset, seronegativity for anti-Ro antibody, and increased anti-dsDNA antibody following six months of induction therapy as being associated with a higher probability of renal relapse, rather than histological profiles or the severity of proteinuria.</p>
