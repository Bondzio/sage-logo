<p>This article focuses on a specific aspect of Yu Hua’s satiric criticism of Mao-era rhetoric through the use of double-voiced discourse in his full-length novel <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>. I analyse how this double-voiced discourse is achieved through the contrast between the focalizers’ unreflective and matter-of-fact use of Maoist rhetoric and the public narrator’s clear awareness of the shabby realities behind this rhetoric. The varied understandings of Maoist rhetoric within a variety of narrative voices give rise to sarcasm, irony, and parody. Four episodes in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> will be analysed in detail. In each of these, Mao-era rhetoric is projected and embedded in the daily conversations and language of some characters who hail from villages in the countryside. These episodes invite readers to reflect upon just how much of the daily discourse of the Chinese people alludes to, or incorporates, the words of Mao and the Party, and also to appreciate the varied forms of double-voiced discourse brought about by differentiated perspectives of the public narrator versus the focalizers in Yu Hua’s story.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, while in the early stage of his creative writing career, Yu Hua was known as an innovative writer and as a representative of the Chinese Avant-garde School. He wrote a number of experimental pieces including ‘One Kind of Reality’ (现实一种), ‘World Like a Mist’ (世事如烟), and ‘Past and Punishment’ (往事与刑罚). Yu Hua’s first full-length novel, <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> (在细雨中呼喊), completed in 1991, is regarded as a transitional work between his experimental writing of the 1980s and his comparatively realistic narratives of the 1990s.</p>
<p><italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> is a first-person reminiscence of the protagonist Sun Guanglin. It records his life as a boy in the countryside of Zhejiang Province between the ages of 6 and 18. The Cultural Revolution serves as the temporal setting for the novel. Yu Hua gives the reader a child’s perspective on family, friendship, sex, marriage, fate, death, and birth – all interspersed with Sun Guanglin’s comments and philosophical reflections as an adult. Yu Hua seeks to communicate the disorder and sorrow among Chinese rural adolescents during the 1970s. The experiences of rural teenagers lend themselves to rich artistic portrayals of abandonment, great loneliness, inescapable fear, feelings of alienation from family, yearnings for friendship, and the psychological trauma that accompany the disappearance of hope and fantasy. <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> can be characterized as a coming-of-age story, but it is also a family saga spanning four generations from the 1930s to the late 1970s, a saga that depicts how an ordinary Chinese family navigated a tortuous course through modern Chinese history. In addition to its thematic richness, <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> also differs from Yu Hua’s more popular novels, <italic>To Live</italic> (活着), <italic>Chronicle of a Blood Merchant</italic> (许三观卖血记), and <italic>Brothers</italic> (兄弟), in its refined and limpid quality of diction that marks its unconventional narrative structure.</p>
<p>This article focuses on a specific aspect of the novel, namely Yu Hua’s satiric criticism of Mao-era (1949–76) rhetoric through the use of double-voiced discourse in the text. I have borrowed the term ‘double-voiced’ discourse from Bakhtin. However, Yu Hua’s <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> sheds new light on Bakhtin’s concept. My analyses will show that Yu Hua’s use of double-voiced discourse is achieved and complicated by the involvement of various layers of narrative throughout the novel. In Bakhtin’s investigation of the dialogic nature of language, he introduces the concept of double-voiced discourse, claiming that ‘the sounding of a second voice is a part of the project of utterance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0920203X11432536">1</xref></sup> He argues that in a literary text, a writer may exploit someone else’s discourse for the writer’s own purposes ‘by inserting a new semantic intention into a discourse which already has, and which retains, an intention of its own’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0920203X11432536">2</xref></sup> Yu Hua, in his use of Mao’s and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rhetoric in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, employs double-voiced discourse to satirize and parody that rhetoric. However, Yu Hua’s double-voiced discourse is slightly different from that described by Bakhtin. In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, the double-voiced discourse is presented through different layers of narrative – the public narrator, the private narrator, and various focalizers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0920203X11432536">3</xref></sup> The varied understandings of Maoist rhetoric within a variety of narrative voices result in sarcasm, irony, and parody.</p>
<p>Since the novel consists of an adult’s reminiscences of his childhood and adolescence, the adult narrator Sun Guanglin serves as the public narrator who conjures forth a fictional world. The adult Sun Guanglin has an authoritative voice and a reflective recognition of reality. In contrast, the adolescent Sun Guanglin is the private narrator. He participates in the narrative as a character, recounting both his own actions as well as the actions of other characters. Various other characters such as Guanglin’s family members, neighbours, and other villagers are focalizers whose ‘consciousness is responsible for the perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or orientations to the scene that the narrator relays’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0920203X11432536">4</xref></sup> In the story, Maoist rhetoric is embedded in some of the adult focalizers’ everyday language. The public narrator’s playful and sarcastic tone and the focalizers’ unreflective, matter-of-fact use of Maoist rhetoric form a type of double-voiced discourse. A clear-minded public narrator is standing behind the private narrator and the focalizers with an unclouded awareness of the shabby realities of Maoist rhetoric. To a large extent, the adult Sun Guanglin’s discourse is implicitly a reader-figure or audience ‘outside’ of the text. The discrepancy in the understanding of Maoist rhetoric between the public narrator on the one hand and the focalizers on the other causes the reader to reflect upon issues such as the power of language to cloud a person’s ability to perceive realities right in front of him/her. In this article, I present and analyse Yu Hua’s diverse use of popular ideological jargon and political slogans through some of the adult characters in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>. While doing so, I examine how Yu Hua’s villagers do things precisely at an opportune time by employing Maoist discourse for their own purposes during the Mao era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0920203X11432536">5</xref></sup> Moreover, I analyse how this double-voiced discourse is achieved through the contrast between the focalizers’ unreflective and matter-of-fact use of Maoist rhetoric and the public narrator’s clear awareness of the shabby realities behind this rhetoric.</p>
<sec id="section1-0920203X11432536">
<title>The CCP and the power of language</title>
<p>Before examining Yu Hua’s use of Maoist rhetoric in the novel, it is necessary to briefly review the CCP’s preoccupation with drawing upon the power of ideological language. Many critical studies have explored the conflict-ridden yet reciprocal relationship between political power and rhetorical hegemony in communist China. The CCP is noteworthy for the extreme care it has taken since the Yan’an period of the 1930s and 1940s in selecting words and phraseology for political slogans and other types of official political terminology. In Yan’an, Mao Zedong used narratives in revolutionary discourse to reconstruct China’s discourse and Chinese people’s views about historical and modern-day reality. After eliminating opposition from Zhang Guotao (1897–1979), Liu Zhidan (1903–36), Wang Ming (1904–74), and Wang Shiwei (1906–47) during the 1930s and 1940s and hence monopolizing military, administrative, ideological, and intellectual authority, Mao gradually established a new revolutionary and political discourse and constructed his own version of history. During the Yan’an period, Mao used an amalgam of speeches, articles, talks, and criticism meetings to establish a personal, ideological, and linguistic hegemony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0920203X11432536">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though the CCP’s obsession with the power of language and its investment in discourse control and manipulation date overtly from Mao Zedong’s 1942 ‘Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art’, the Party’s concern with its hegemony over rhetoric can be traced to the Confucian notion of the correctness or rectification of names and terms – <italic>zhengming</italic> (正名), a notion that ‘emphasized the assumed unity between language, morality, and political authority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0920203X11432536">7</xref></sup> This obsession is also related to the New Cultural Movement in the late 1910s. The New Cultural Movement of that time was initiated by a call for language reform, and from that time on issues of language have always been the locus of contention and controversy throughout different historical shifts and ideological battles between different forces. The CCP, however, has carried the Confucian notion of <italic>zhengming</italic> and the May Fourth legacy to an extreme by ‘making language the key index to ideological correctness and public performance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0920203X11432536">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the first 30 years after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the CCP’s heightened recognition of the power of language is evident in the fact that political slogans and documents were produced for recitation and study during various state-orchestrated political campaigns and meetings. This fetish reached its zenith during the Cultural Revolution, when the citizenry of China felt compelled to memorize and incorporate numerous ‘Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong’ within their everyday language. The Party’s control and manipulation of language is directly reflected in the literary works of the Mao era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0920203X11432536">9</xref></sup> The literary works of the Mao era are not only replete with the everyday language of workers, farmers, and soldiers, but also include considerable formularized, Party-sanctioned political and ideological rhetoric. Hao Ran’s <italic>Bright Sunny Skies</italic> (艳阳天) and <italic>Golden Road</italic> (金光大道), Zhao Shuli’s series of peasant stories, and Yang Mo’s <italic>The Song of Youth</italic> (青春之歌) exemplify this tendency.</p>
<p>In the post-Mao era, however, many writers have consciously tried to rid themselves of the fetters of Mao’s rhetoric and have deliberately differentiated their works from the former Party-controlled literature by calling readers’ attention to the narrative processes and to the ironic and twisted rhetoric and ideological language of the Mao era. One such writer, Yu Hua, started to explore broader literary techniques and social themes in the 1980s. In contrast to the focus on the role Mao’s rhetoric played in the life of the Chinese intellectuals – a focus found in the literary and critical works of many of his contemporaries – Yu Hua, in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, reveals how communist ideological language has affected the lives of Chinese villagers. The novel’s treatment of Party language challenges and subverts the CCP’s ideological and linguistic hegemony.</p>

<title>Four ways in which Yu Hua exploits Mao’s rhetoric</title>
<p>In the remainder of this article, I will examine in detail four episodes in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>. In each of these, Mao-era rhetoric is projected and embedded in the daily conversations and language of some characters who hail from villages in the countryside. In each of the four episodes, use of Mao-era rhetoric serves a different purpose, namely (1) villagers use Mao’s official rhetoric for their own benefit and make a conscious effort to ‘do things [right] with words’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0920203X11432536">10</xref></sup> (2) villagers employ Maoist political jargon out of context and unexpectedly produce humour, mockery, or parody; (3) political and ideological slogans are purposely misused to justify emotional violence; and (4) villagers respond to Maoist political propaganda and ideological notions in folksy ways unintended by the Party. These episodes lead us to reflect upon just how much of the daily discourse of the Chinese people alludes to, or incorporates, the words of Mao and the Party, and also to appreciate the varied forms of double-voiced discourse brought about by differentiated perspectives of the public narrator versus the focalizers in Yu Hua’s story.</p>
<sec id="section3-0920203X11432536">
<title>Maoist rhetoric employed for personal benefit</title>
<p>I will analyse here an episode in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> in which the CCP’s promotion of the practices of ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’ (舍己救人) and ‘remembering old bitterness to think of present-day sweetness’ (忆苦思甜) are exploited for different purposes by the teenager Sun Guangping (Guanglin’s older brother) and his father, Sun Kwangtsai.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0920203X11432536">11</xref></sup> In the episode, Guangping’s younger brother, Sun Guangming, drowns while saving the life of an eight-year-old boy. Instead of claiming financial compensation, a common practice under these circumstances, Kwangtsai and Guangping ask only that the rescued boy’s father report to the government and tell other villagers of Guangming’s heroic exemplification of ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’. As a result, on the third day after Sun Guangming’s funeral, the local radio station publicizes the story, portraying Guangming in a heroic light.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0920203X11432536">12</xref></sup> The death and subsequent radio publicity provide the father and brother with the illusion that Guangming is a hero, and they are convinced that government officials will visit them, and confer upon them some type of official, national status. ‘They felt sure that the government would immediately send someone to call on them. This fantasy originated at the district level, but in the more elaborate forms went all the way to Beijing.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0920203X11432536">13</xref></sup> The father and older brother thus anxiously await the arrival of these government representatives.</p>
<p>Even though the admirable act of ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’ had been depicted as a lofty virtue of the New Socialist Man during the Mao era, the public narrator treats Guangming’s heroism as tragic rather than noble. Sun Guanglin, narrating his brother’s story from the perspective of his own adulthood, says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sun Guangming drowned trying to save him [the young boy]. It would be going too far, of course, to present this as an act of heroic self-sacrifice. My little brother had not reached a level of such lofty virtue as to be willing to exchange his own life for someone else’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0920203X11432536">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To say, ‘It would be going too far, of course, to present this as an act of heroic self-sacrifice’ is from the adult Guanglin’s perspective. The focalizers – both the father and older brother at that time – may suspect that Guangming, only eight years old, is far too young to contemplate self-sacrifice, but they also know only too well the important role elaborate language can play in changing the event from a tragic accident to a glorious and heroic feat. Though the villagers might not fully understand that language was ‘an ideological construct of the Party tailored to its revolutionary strategy’, the peasants have learned from numerous political campaigns and denunciation sessions that acquisition and articulation of Party language can empower them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0920203X11432536">15</xref></sup> They have sensed the importance of how one is classified and defined by the Party through labels, names, tags, slogans, formulas, reports, and documents. They know that if language is strategically tailored to the use at hand, it is an implement that can be employed to advance one’s personal interests. They have learned from the Party how to manipulate words, and consciously utilize labels and ‘right language’ to promote their own well-being. Thus Kwangtsai uses the label ‘hero’ and the slogan ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’ to glorify young Guangming and his death. Mao’s rhetoric ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’ becomes his words, and thus his claim to be a member of the family of a martyr and his opinion that his family is worthy of an increase in social status are both justified. In addition, the father Kwangtsai’s practical use of Mao’s rhetoric to elevate little Guangming’s death reveals the character’s opportunistic trait.</p>
<p>In the expectation that the government will send officials to reward the hero’s family, and believing that these officials will look down upon poorly dressed farmers, Kwangtsai borrows money to make new outfits for each family member. Two days later, however, feeling ‘that thrift and fortitude were the family virtues that ought to be showcased’, he asks his wife and sons to wear ragged clothes to impress the expected government representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0920203X11432536">16</xref></sup> He explains to the villagers that his purpose in wearing threadbare clothes is to ‘recall old bitterness to think of present-day sweetness’: ‘When we think of the miseries of the old society, we are all the more aware of how wonderful life is in the new society.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0920203X11432536">17</xref></sup> Here again, these quotes reveal the opportunistic side of Kwangtsai’s personality. In contrast with Kwangtsai, Guangping is greatly concerned about maintaining a sense of face in school. He is ridiculed by his schoolmates for wearing ragged clothes and consequently decides to abandon them. So he justifies this action with the words, ‘to wear the kind of clothes that one could find only in old China is an insult to the new Communist society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0920203X11432536">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>That father and son quote contrasting Maoist sayings demonstrates the unreliability and instability of political and ideological rhetoric. On the one hand, wearing ragged clothes can be interpreted as a meaningful reminder of past suffering and bitterness that encourages the villagers to better appreciate and treasure the ostensibly happy and affluent lives they have under CCP rule. On the other hand, the wearing of ragged clothes can also be seen as questioning the Party’s repeated boasts that it has improved villagers’ material lives. These differing interpretations of the same reality show that the Party is less concerned with reality itself than it is with appropriate expression of that reality. The Communist Party’s ‘obsession with the “right” language can only further expose its basic irrelevance, thus setting up a self-defeating circular process’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0920203X11432536">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>At another level, Guangming’s tragic death and the chimera that the death can be used to elevate the political status of surviving family members are powerful and bitter satire employed by Yu Hua to mock the hierarchical CCP system. Mao had tried to create an egalitarian structure both within the Party and also within the armed forces that he began to build in 1928.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0920203X11432536">20</xref></sup> This egalitarianism, however, was more rhetorical rather than real.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0920203X11432536">21</xref></sup> The system of rank established in the post-1949 communist regime was accompanied by evident inequalities. In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, the villagers fully understand the different treatment accorded to an ordinary villager as compared to a Party-recognized hero. Despite the Party’s verbal emphasis on equality, the peasants are not oblivious to the overt discrepancies in material conditions between urban and rural, and between ordinary people and CCP members and cadres. They are aware of the benefits that may come their way if they gain some political capital for themselves. Thus Kwangtsai and his family do not request any material compensation for Guangming’s death. They simply ask, rather, that they be labelled and recognized as the next of kin of a hero. Kwangtsai well knows the glory and benefits that the ‘hero’ label accorded to his son may bring to his family. Unfortunately for him, however, there is ultimately neither public accolade nor an increase in political status. The entire narrative amounts to a satire in which Yu Hua reveals the emptiness of much CCP discourse about equality and the sham of its usage of heroes and martyrs for political purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0920203X11432536">
<title>Political tags and labels used out of context by the villagers</title>
<p>In his study of the relationship between language and politics in communist China, Schoenhals asserts that ‘language formalization – as a form of power managed and manipulated by the state – thus has a bearing upon all aspects of Chinese politics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0920203X11432536">22</xref></sup> Red-head documents (红头文件) and circulars have been issued by such CCP bodies as the Central Propaganda Department to instruct cadres how to use scientific and formulaic language in their speech and articles. During the Cultural Revolution, everything people said was framed in the terminology of Mao Zedong. Keywords and phrases such as ‘class’, ‘socialist road’, and ‘revolutionary line’ had to be embedded in all that people said. Otherwise, people would not be seen to be loyal enough to the Party and ‘Chairman Mao’. The daily language embedded with Mao’s rhetoric was taken seriously during the Cultural Revolution, but seems ludicrous in the post-Mao era. Examples include: ‘Serve the people. Comrade, could I have two pounds of pork, please?’ and, ‘A revolution is not a dinner party. That makes 1.85 yuan altogether.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0920203X11432536">23</xref></sup> The discrepancy between contrasting ways of understanding Maoist rhetoric – matter-of-fact acceptance on the one hand, and tongue-in-cheek parody on the other – is a result of the disparate perspectives from the Mao era on the one hand, and the post-Mao era on the other. This discrepancy often gives rise to humour and parody.</p>
<p>In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, discrepancy is caused by different perspectives of the public narrator – the adult Sun Guanglin in the post-Mao era – and the focalizers, the villagers during the Cultural Revolution. In the following episode, we can see how the villagers Old Luo and the widow both liberally label their fellow villagers with political keywords ‘model worker’ and ‘intellectual’. Their unreflective and matter-of-fact appropriation of these political labels contrasts with the public narrator’s playful narrative tone, thereby giving rise to humorous and parodistic effects. In the story, when the villagers joke about a widow who sleeps around with men in the village even on the most sweltering of summer nights, Old Luo says sarcastically, ‘Such a hot night, too – she’s really a Model Worker.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0920203X11432536">24</xref></sup> Obviously, it sounds very sarcastic and teasing to the reader through the adult Guanglin’s playful tone, but it is hard to tell if Old Luo is being humorous or serious. He has adopted a matter-of-fact and literal understanding of the term, at least at the surface level.</p>
<p>‘Model worker’ is an honorific term that Mao Zedong started to use to praise his CCP comrades as early as 27 January 1934.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0920203X11432536">25</xref></sup> After the founding of the PRC, ‘national model worker’ was adopted as a formal epithet applied to ‘outstanding representatives of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the working people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0920203X11432536">26</xref></sup> Glory accrued to those to whom the epithet was applied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0920203X11432536">27</xref></sup> When the villagers of <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> refer to the libidinous widow as a ‘model worker’, they are fully aware of the merits that a communist model worker is supposed to possess: ‘selfless devotion, remarkable work ethics and professional commitment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0920203X11432536">28</xref></sup> At a literal level, the widow’s behaviour meets the requirements for a model worker. As recalled by the public narrator in a sarcastic tone, ‘After dark the widow’s bed was seldom anything less than fully occupied. Even on the most sweltering summer night the sound of the widow’s groans would float over to the drying ground where the villagers were trying to cool off.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0920203X11432536">29</xref></sup> So the villagers infer that the widow exhibits all these merits in her devotion to a happy life of sensuality. Though there might be a hidden note of sarcasm behind their literal application of the term, they express it an unselfconsciously matter-of-fact manner, given the political situation at the time. Here, the usage of the term ‘model worker’ presents the double-voiced discourse postulated by Bakhtin. As the public narrator, the adult Guanglin is actually treating the Maoist notion of the socialist model worker in a critical and mocking fashion. The disrespect with which the widow is regarded by her fellow villagers, however, is in sharp contrast to the status accorded to national model workers who ‘embody the noble spirit of the nation and deserve to be fully described as the elite of the nation, the backbone of the country, the mainstay of Chinese society, and exemplars of the people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0920203X11432536">30</xref></sup> The villagers’ literal understanding of the term ‘model worker’ reveals their camouflaged sense of humour; more importantly it discloses the public narrator’s derision of individuals who have been formally designated ‘model workers’.</p>
<p>The novel also contains an episode involving the villagers’ use of the political keyword ‘intellectual’ as a label. In the novel, the abovementioned widow has a one-night affair with Dr Su, a visitor temporarily sojourning in the village with his family. She is attracted to intellectuals such as Dr Su – to his cleanliness, his bashfulness, and to his eyeglasses. After the brief affair, she says to everyone she meets, ‘These intellectuals are so adorable.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0920203X11432536">31</xref></sup> The widow’s matter-of-fact comment about intellectuals embodies multiple levels of meaning.</p>
<p>First of all, the widow’s comment revisits a recurrent theme – the relationship between village labourer and urban intellectual – in 20th-century Chinese literature. In his 1921 short story ‘My Hometown’ (故乡), Lu Xun’s protagonist, an urban intellectual, was moved to reflect upon his role and responsibility as an intellectual and upon his own uncertainty and puzzlement when he encountered his village farmer childhood friend Runtu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0920203X11432536">32</xref></sup> Again, in Lu Xun’s 1924 story ‘The New Year’s Sacrifice’ (祝福), an intellectual was unable to answer an illiterate village woman’s simple question concerning the existence of a ghost or spirit after a person dies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0920203X11432536">33</xref></sup> Later, in the Yan’an period, the relationship between the intellectual and village labourer was polarized by Mao Zedong. The urban intellectual was targeted as an object for ideological remoulding by the Party, and, as made explicit in the ‘Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art’, the work of such intellectuals was declared to be subordinate to the revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0920203X11432536">34</xref></sup> Although Yu Hua sets <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> in this cultural and historical milieu, he reverses the roles of Party, village labourer, and urban intellectual. Most often in the literature of the PRC, village labourers are seen through the eyes of urban intellectuals. The works of Lu Xun, Wu Zuxiang, and Shen Congwen are of this nature. Yet in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, Yu Hua portrays an urban intellectual as seen through the eyes of a village woman. The widow’s comment that urban intellectuals are adorable is in sharp contrast to the Party’s view of intellectuals. However, intellectuals are human beings after all, and have no less in the way of sensual desire than would a village labourer. In the widow’s eyes, Dr Su, notwithstanding his cleanliness and shyness, differs little from her fellow villagers who have climbed into her bed at night. Her serious comment and perception of intellectuals challenges Party-established class boundaries that define and magnify the differences, having created a fundamental separation between the urban intellectual and the village labourer.</p>
<p>In his depiction of the widow and of the response of other villagers to her, Yu Hua satirizes the CCP’s obsession with political terms, labels, and class consciousness by wrenching the terms ‘model worker’ and ‘intellectual’ from established contexts sanctioned by the CCP authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0920203X11432536">35</xref></sup> Yu Hua deliberately blurs the class boundaries that differentiate model worker, libidinous village woman, and urban intellectual by using communist political labels in a context in which they were not intended to be used. At first glance, the village labourers’ literal-minded and matter-of-fact application of these political labels seems inconsistent with the Party’s owlishly solemn approach to political naming and labelling. However, the effect of this out-of-context usage of ‘model worker’ and ‘intellectual’ deflates the Party’s political rhetoric and exposes its inherent absurdity; the Party itself is thus undone by its own political rhetoric.</p>

<title>Political and ideological slogans purposely misused to justify violence</title>
<p>Given the fact that the CCP is obsessed with the power of language, language inevitably becomes a weapon that can be employed by the Party to mistreat its supposed enemies during the Cultural Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0920203X11432536">36</xref></sup> Political slogans and jargon were perverted and quoted out of context as a convenient way to attack the perceived opponent. In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, Yu Hua addresses injury caused by language in a symbolic and humorous way. In his story, Yu Hua has a one-dimensional minor character – a shrewish wife – utilize CCP political slogans as an effective means to target and control her hen-pecked husband, a gifted poet. She decorates their apartment with her husband’s letters of repentance, pledges to remould his thinking, and statements of self-criticism, all typical of the form written by CCP members to show their loyalty to the Party. These become a visible, daily reminder of his obedience to his harsh wife. In addition, whenever the wife is unhappy with her husband, she conveniently and passionately combines fashionable political jargon with classical poetry and pop lyrics to reprimand him.</p>
<p>The wife’s linguistic performance can be interpreted at both literal and symbolic levels. At the literal level, Mao’s political slogans are perverted and quoted by the wife as an instrument of persecution. The wife’s use of Mao’s slogans is an effective threat paralysing her husband with fear. Though the husband is fully aware that his wife is quoting Mao’s slogans out of context, and is using them as a means to control him, he does not have the courage to challenge her. To challenge Maoist sloganeering is to challenge Mao’s authority, a serious crime. Numerous stories reveal how people brought disaster upon themselves and their families during the Cultural Revolution as a result of carelessness and negligence in their attention to Mao’s rhetoric in their daily lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0920203X11432536">37</xref></sup> In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, the husband knows full well the consequences of misuse of Mao’s slogans. He responds subserviently to his wife’s verbal abuse by saying ‘a dead pig’s not afraid of being scalded with hot water’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0920203X11432536">38</xref></sup> Though the public narrator does not reveal to the reader the specific political slogans and jargon the wife uses, their effect on her husband suggests both a ‘clear link between the words that are uttered and their putative power to injure’ and the threatening power of political language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0920203X11432536">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the symbolic level, the wife’s performance mimics the Party’s use of language as an instrument of ideological control. Methods and practices (including writing letters of repentance and undertaking self-criticism) developed during the Yan’an Rectification Movement (1941–5) and one of its constituent parts, the Rescue Campaign (1943), were employed repeatedly and became an effective disciplining mechanism of the Party to remould and control people’s thinking. The Rectification Movement was initiated by Mao Zedong’s 1 February 1942 speech ‘Reform in Learning, the Party, and Literature’. The movement was used by Mao to control revolutionary and ideological discourse and to eliminate his opponents and political dissidents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0920203X11432536">40</xref></sup> The entire Yan’an community was re-educated through studying Mao’s key writings, carefully selected, recorded, and presented. Using Mao’s writings as a mirror, individuals were required to indulge in so-called ‘criticism and self-criticism’ and thus evaluate the past behaviour of both themselves and others. The Rescue Campaign was especially frightening to intellectuals and cadres. Its goal was to eliminate spies and provocateurs who had penetrated the Party and Yan’an. Its main strategy was ‘to get people to confess and to use their guilty knowledge as a point of entry into the process of confession’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0920203X11432536">41</xref></sup> Although the Rectification Movement and Rescue Campaign eventually came to an end, the practices of self-examination, self-criticism, and confession had become familiar, and continued to be employed by ordinary people in their daily lives, reaching the summit during the Cultural Revolution. These practices have been skilfully mastered by ordinary people such as the poet’s wife portrayed in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>. Just as the Rectification Movement eradicated different intellectual responses to the Party rules, the wife’s rectification campaign against her husband in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> successfully transforms her husband from a free-spirited artist into an obedient man under the thumb of his wife. He responds to her tirades with pious utterances: ‘Better to confess my errors…. That’s well put…. You’ve set me straight on that.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0920203X11432536">42</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discrepancy between Maoist political propaganda and peasant response</title>
<p>Yu Hua’s exploitation of Mao-era rhetoric can be read as more than just sarcasm. Although Yu Hua does not directly address Party policy in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, in his adroit use of irony and in the ambiguous approach that he has the novel’s main character, Sun Kwangtsai, take towards the 1958–60 Great Leap Forward, however, the author does suggest that the policies of at least that particular period were both far-fetched and absurd. Mao initiated the Great Leap Forward in the belief that ‘rapid economic development and social progress could be achieved by boosting production through mobilizing every Chinese to transform the country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0920203X11432536">43</xref></sup> In fact, the programme was a disaster that culminated in 1960–3 with a nationwide famine from which it took China five years to recover.</p>
<p>In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, Zheng Yuda, a communist cadre and a member of a town-based rural supervisory team, travels in 1958 to the village where the Sun family lives to check how the Great Leap Forward is progressing. When he sees that small furnaces of dark brick have been constructed on the rice paddies, Zheng, dressed in a grey Mao suit and with a pair of Liberation gym shoes on his feet, asks the peasant Sun Kwangtsai, who wears a traditional-style jacket with canvas shoes made by his wife, ‘Are the People’s Communes a good thing?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0920203X11432536">44</xref></sup> Sun Kwangtsai responds in the affirmative. He says that the People’s Communes are ‘a good thing’ because ‘meals are free’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0920203X11432536">45</xref></sup> Village labourers such as Sun Kwangtsai, then, in spite of extensive propaganda about the ostensible benefits of implementing People’s Communes, benefits that include increasing steel production, undertaking water projects, and improving agricultural productivity, see only their more practical aspects – private cooking has been replaced by communal dining, and everything is shared. The implications in Sun Kwangtsai’s down-to-earth response to Mao’s radical collective unit are multifold.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1940s, the Party launched tax reform, rent reduction, land reform, and voluntary cooperation programmes in the rural areas under communist control. Private lands and properties of landlords were confiscated and redistributed to poor farmers. These reform measures helped restore agricultural production that had been devastated during the war against the Japanese and the civil war that followed it. The living conditions of poor villagers improved dramatically. At the political level, the Party treated land reform as a struggle between landlords and poor peasant classes. There were numerous struggle meetings in the villages at that time, the purpose of which was to ‘forge unity among poor and middle peasants by disgracing a handful of class enemies and forcefully demonstrating the power of the Party and the once poor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0920203X11432536">46</xref></sup> After the founding of the PRC, Mao called for wholesale collectivization to prevent future polarization between the few rich and the many poor. In October 1955, the CCP ordered immediate universal collectivization. The natural villages became People’s Communes. During the Great Leap Forward launched in 1958, village labourers were mobilized to engage in steel production or were drafted for hydroelectric projects, and small furnaces were set up in the villages to produce steel and iron. Public kitchens were formed to save people’s family cooking time and to imitate an Anhui commune praised by Mao, a commune where free meals were provided.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0920203X11432536">47</xref></sup> Household metal cooking utensils were confiscated to serve as raw material for steel production at the village level, and grain was transferred from village labourers’ homes to the public kitchen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0920203X11432536">48</xref></sup> In <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, the encounter between Zheng Yuda and Sun Kwangtsai is set against this political background.</p>
<p>Their conversation about the commune reveals the relationship between Party cadre and peasant. Zheng Yuda is a typical basic-level cadre often seen in many Chinese revolutionary literary works. Cadres such as Zheng might have been peasants to begin with, and are now carrying out the Party’s policy in the countryside. And peasants are there to prove the correctness of the policy. However, in Yu Hua’s story, the stereotypical unity between Party cadre and peasant as ordinarily portrayed in Chinese revolutionary literature is substantiated with irony in the encounter between Zheng Yuda and Sun Kwangtsai. Zheng Yuda is presented in the novel as a product of thought remoulding, and he is used by Yu Hua as a means to achieve a satiric goal: the presentation of the Party’s rural policy as absurd and of Mao’s rhetoric as empty. When Zheng Yuda asks Sun Kwangtsai about the People’s Commune, he is expecting some glorified words from Sun that describe how much village labourers have benefited from the commune and how great are the gains that have been made in agricultural and hydroelectric production since the formation of the commune. Sun’s simple and direct answer – ‘meals are free’ – simply points out that, for him, the only tangible benefits villagers have received from the collective unit are free meals. Instead of attesting to the correctness of the Party policies that established the People’s Communes and launched the Great Leap Forward, Sun Kwangtsai’s practical response exposes the gap between official rhetoric and grass-roots perspective, and the idealistic absurdity of Party policies. It reveals the great discrepancy between the Party’s high-flown ideological fantasies and the gritty realities of village life. It also indicates that, for village labourers, the major concern is having enough food to eat. The CCP, despite all its promises of a better life, had failed to lift Chinese villagers from dire poverty. In fact, when the Great Leap Forward turned out to be a collective disaster, many villagers lost everything.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0920203X11432536">49</xref></sup> Sun Kwangtsai’s answer subverts the power of Party propaganda. The village labourers are no longer conceived of as embodiments or carriers of ideology. As a matter of fact, farmers such as Kwangtsai and his fellow villagers are not able to comprehend the Party’s policies in the countryside, even though these policies have been carried out in their name and are supposed to have redounded to their benefit.</p>
<p>After hearing Sun Kwangtsai’s down-to-earth reply to his question, Zheng Yuda could only respond, ‘What a thing to say.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0920203X11432536">50</xref></sup> Many years later, when Zheng Yuda recalled his odd conversation with Sun Kwangtsai, he sighs, ‘What can you do? That’s peasants for you.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0920203X11432536">51</xref></sup> Zheng’s seemingly tolerant and understanding attitude implies that village labourers’ political consciousness needs to be raised. Whatever problems or disasters that Party policies cause can be remedied by an increase in this consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0920203X11432536">52</xref></sup> However, ideological education is just another means of manipulating language in order to gloss over the errors the Party has made. The more errors the Party commits, the more important the work of ideological education becomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Unlike earlier ‘peasant’ writers such as Zhao Shuli, a village labourer writing about villagers and for villagers of the Mao era, or Gao Xiaosheng, who claimed to have become a villager after being declared a rightist and sentenced to 20 years of remoulding through labour in the Jiangsu countryside, Yu Hua has never been a village labourer. Born into a doctor’s family, he has lived in towns and cities his entire life. His fictional representation of village labourers is drastically different from that of Zhao Shuli and Gao Xiaosheng. Zhao Shuli’s village labourer characters in works such as ‘Blackie Gets Married’ (小二黑结婚), ‘Meng Xiangying Stands Up’ (孟祥英翻身), and ‘Sanliwan Village’ (三里湾) are tailored and conceptualized to fit into the Party’s ideological mould. They are instruments to prove the correctness of Mao’s revolutionary and communist ideology. Unlike Zhao Shuli’s ‘progressive village labourers’, those of Gao Xiaosheng – such as Li Shunda in ‘Li Shunda Builds a House’ (李顺大造屋) and Chen Huansheng in ‘Chen Huansheng Goes to Town’ (陈奂生上城) – are victims of the Party’s rural policy. They are honest and good, and understand and follow CCP policies in their literal sense. It turns out, however, that the Party does not really help to improve their lives at all. Li Shunda is never able to realize his dream of building his own house, though he has unquestioningly accepted the Party’s instructions over many years. Gao Xiaosheng’s exploitation of Party language and Li Shunda’s failure to build his own house in the story help ‘deflate’ and ‘expose the inherent absurdity’ of the Party’s claim that ‘it has always represented the peasants and their interest’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0920203X11432536">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Yu Hua, though the countryside is still the locale of the fictional events in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, it is no longer the site of a time-specific, class-based struggle. Yu Hua’s village labourers are not the heroic and noble figures of the Party-directed fiction of the past. On the contrary, they are telling examples of, and metaphors for, the victimization brought about by Mao’s revolutionary discourse and radical rural policy. Like Gao Xiaosheng, Yu Hua weaves the Party’s political and ideological language into his narrative and applies it to the characters’ frustrated struggles. Yu Hua’s village labourers, however, differ from those of Gao Xiaosheng in that they are sometimes aware of the emptiness of the Party’s rhetoric, and adroitly use that rhetoric for their own benefit at an opportune time. Unlike Gao Xiaosheng’s naive, trusting, and submissive village labourers who genuinely believe what the Party says and follow the Party’s instructions without hesitation, Yu Hua’s village labourers are not so easily deluded by Party language, though they too cannot avoid being victimized by the Party’s rural policy. Through the village labourers’ matter-of-fact albeit out-of-context use of Party language and the public narrator’s self-conscious exploitation of double-voiced Maoist terminology, Yu Hua questions the role and power of language throughout the history of China under communist rule, and reveals the bankruptcy of Maoist revolutionary discourse utilized during the Mao era.</p>
<p>Yu Hua, in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, exploits communist ideological statements and political jargon in four different ways. His village labourers imitate the Party in their attempt ‘to do things right with words’. Sun Kwangtsai uses the slogan ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’ to characterize his young son’s death in the hope of elevating his family’s political status. His and his older son’s adroit application of ‘remembering past bitterness to think of present-day sweetness’ proves the instability of Party language, language that can be put to both constructive and destructive uses. Yu Hua also has his village labourers seriously apply the class labels of ‘model worker’ and ‘intellectual’ to their fellow villagers and neighbours. The villagers’ matter-of-fact appropriation of Party language and the public narrator’s playful tone result in derision that challenges the authority and authenticity of that language, thereby mocking the CCP’s preoccupation with language formularization. The shrewish wife’s bold exploitation of political jargon and methods to control her husband parodies CCP ideological control of the docile subjects of its authoritarian rule. In her speech, she demonstrates that language can be used as an effective weapon to intimidate and subdue others. The hilarious and twisted conversation about the People’s Commune between the communist cadre Zheng Yuda and the peasant Sun Kwangtsai illustrates the gap between how the Party promoted its rural policy and how village labourers actually understood that policy. It also reveals the discrepancy between the Party’s claim that it is improving village labourers’ material lives and the actual poverty imposed on villagers by the Party. More importantly, the conversation discloses the contrast between the Party’s rhapsodic intoxication by its own political rhetoric and village labourers’ sober recognition of the emptiness and absurdity of that rhetoric.</p>
<p>At the linguistic level, the four episodes exemplify Yu Hua’s use of double-voiced discourse in his post-Mao writing. Social attitudes towards Mao’s authority, towards the CCP, and towards received past ‘truths’ changed in the post-Mao era, and in Yu Hua’s novel, these changes in social attitude reflected by the perspective of the public narrator generate new varieties of double-voiced discourse which themselves document the changes. Hence, throughout the story, the reader is always aware of the existence of two forms of discourse – Mao’s revolutionary discourse and the public narrator’s sardonic criticism of Mao’s discourse. Aside from the political and ideological implications that double-voiced discourse reveals, this discourse is also of linguistic and thematic significance. It is noteworthy that the story’s diction is generally poetic and lyrical. In most parts of the narrative, the adult Guanglin recalls his childhood and adolescence in a melancholic and lyrical tone. When the public narrator describes the life of Guanglin and his young friends, there is no utilization of Maoist rhetoric either in the narrative or the dialogue. Maoist rhetoric is confined to the utterances of various adult villagers. Linguistically, the story’s serene and poetic diction serves as a foil to the invective-laden and harshly judgemental thrust of Maoist rhetoric. Thematically, Yu Hua is trying to conjure forth a world in which children have not yet been contaminated by Maoist ideology – a world that forms a sharp contrast with the degenerate and chaotic world of adults during the Mao era. This contrast is consistent with the general theme of <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>: coming of age in a time of trouble.</p>
<p>Yu Hua, in <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic>, makes extensive use of double-voiced discourse to call into question the ideological language and political tag phrases of the Mao era. His degree of concern with this issue is a reflection of the great impact that political jargon had on the whole of Chinese society in the Mao era. In Bourdieu’s framework of language and symbolic power, ideological and political jargon is a product of the communist linguistic marketplace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0920203X11432536">54</xref></sup> Jargon is valued more highly than the lay expressions and phrases people use in daily life. By using the Party’s language, the village labourers try to accumulate capital and achieve the practical competence they require to survive in the linguistic marketplace. They consciously and routinely euphemize their language by embedding in it such phraseology as ‘remembering past bitterness to think of present-day sweetness’, ‘sacrificing oneself to save others’, and ‘model worker’. They are quite aware of Party receptivity and of the potential benefits that may accrue if they concur with dominant norms. The village labourers’ adoption in daily conversation of the articulatory style of the Communist Party and of heavy-handed Maoist neologisms comes, however, at the cost of renouncing their traditional linguistic habitus. It is an attempt to climb the social ladder in the established hierarchies of the Maoist era.</p>
<p>In addition, the sharp contrast between the overtly political and rhetorical CCP statements and slogans and the practical applications of those statements and slogans by ordinary subjects of CCP rule amounts to both a mockery and sarcasm of Mao’s revolutionary and political discourse and to a parody of the language used in the literary works of the Mao era. More importantly, the manner in which Yu Hua incorporates into <italic>Cries in the Drizzle</italic> slogans, formulas, and the stock phrases of propaganda shows, in effect, how Party language, as understood in practical terms and utilized out of context by the village labourers, turns against itself. Yu Hua thus not only questions Mao’s revolutionary discourse and linguistic hegemony, but also questions the relationship between language and reality. The CCP has skilfully employed empty political language to gloss over the bleak realities of village labourers’ existence and to compensate for the lack of concrete and effective action to improve villagers’ lives. By means of double-voiced discourse resulting from varying perspectives of the public narrator and focalizers, however, Yu Hua’s fiction challenges the applicability, authenticity, and ideological hegemony of Maoist discourse.</p>

<p>During the Rectification Movement of 1942, the progressive writers Ding Ling and Wang Shiwei both composed short stories and essays critical of male dominance and sexism in Yan’an society, and of the Party’s unequal treatment of highly placed officials and ordinary soldiers. In the essay ‘Wild Lilies’, Wang Shiwei specifically criticized the system of rank in Yan’an and the inequalities it produced. This piece had a powerful impact in Yan’an and incurred the wrath of Mao Zedong. Both Ding Ling and Wang Shiwei suffered because they exposed realities of the pronounced hierarchy within the Party system. A campaign was carried out to eradicate their influence, and, in fact, Wang Shiwei was executed by the Maoists following a few years of incarceration in Yan’an.

<p>In Mao Zedong’s concluding speech on that day to the Second National Congress of Workers’ and Peasants’ Representatives held at Ruijin, Jiangsu Province, he spoke as follows: ‘The comrades in Hsingkuo have done first-rate work and deserve our praise as model workers. Similarly, the comrades in northeastern Kiangsi have done good work and are also model workers…. They are working conscientiously, solving problems with minute care and shouldering their revolutionary responsibilities in earnest; they are good organizers and leaders both of revolutionary war and of the well-being of the masses.’ See Mao Zedong, Be concerned with the well-being of the masses, pay attention to methods of work, The Róbinson Rojas Archive, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/mao9.htm">http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/mao9.htm</ext-link>, accessed 2 February <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0920203X11432536">2009</xref>.</p>

<p>The tragic death of Wang Shiwei betrays ‘Mao’s use and abuse of intellectuals’. As Apter and Saich assert, Wang Shiwei was one of the few genuine intellectuals in Yan’an who ‘rejected subordination’ and who inherited Lu Xun’s legacy of the ‘independent and critical’ intellectual, see Apter and Saich, <italic>Revolutionary Discourse in Mao’s Republic</italic>, 60. In Mao’s view, however, the existence of independent and liberal intellectuals such as Wang Shiwei posed a threat to Party unity. It is thus not surprising that Wang was ruthlessly denounced, persecuted, and executed by the Party. For details, see Apter and Saich, <italic>Revolutionary Discourse in Mao’s Republic</italic>, 59–60.</p>

<p>When discussing the performative effect of language, Judith Butler argues: ‘The force and meaning of an utterance are not exclusively determined by prior contexts or “positions”; an utterance may gain its force precisely by virtue of the break with context that it performs. Such breaks with prior context, or, indeed, with ordinary usage, are crucial to the political operation of the performative. Language takes on a non-ordinary meaning in order precisely to contest what has become sedimented in and as the ordinary.’ Judith Butler, <italic>Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative</italic>, New York and London: Routledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0920203X11432536">1997</xref>, 145.</p>

<p>The sociologists and historians Friedman, Pickowicz, and Selden, in their book <italic>Chinese Village, Socialist State</italic>, present a case study of the communal dining halls in Wugong County, Hebei Province. This case study reveals the problems inherent in the communes. Friedman and his colleagues demonstrate that the free-food policy with ‘few restrictions and little bookkeeping’ resulted directly in food wastage (p. 239). According to their investigation, villagers in Wugong ‘consumed a year’s supply of grain in three months’ because some villagers ate until ‘the skin on their bellies was tight’ (p. 239). Just as important, the practices associated with collective dining violated ‘the habits, customs and level of consciousness of rural people…. To the frugal older people, eating free and eating as much as you wanted seemed immoral … [the public kitchens] never became places with which people identified’ (p. 239). Very soon, because of bad harvests and excessive waste, the public kitchens turned into ‘soup kitchens’, and closed in the ensuing famine years. Friedman, Pickowicz, and Selden justly claim that Mao’s policy of public kitchens was a ‘communism of state-imposed poverty’ (p. 239).</p>

<p>The famine that lasted from 1960 to 1963 demonstrated that the Communist Party had become the victim of its own faith in political rhetoric. Feuerwerker points out that, ‘had the Party not been carried away by its own slogans and stories about fantastic increases in agricultural production’ during the Great Leap Forward, the ensuing famine ‘could have at least been somewhat alleviated’ (p. 42). And if the Party had not taken so much grain away from the village labourers, as Liu Shaoqi, one time vice-president of the PRC, privately acknowledged, or if the little grain the villagers had hidden away had not been ferreted out and confiscated by village cadres, many lives lost to starvation could have been saved.

<p>In fact, Party Central gave instructions to local cadres on how to explain the famine to the village labourer. Bad weather combined with the withdrawal of Soviet aid in 1960 were embraced as scapegoats by the Party to cover up Mao’s policy blunders of the late 1950s. The Party used propaganda to cover the truth that the peasants were actually ‘trapped and killed by a system promoting rapid progress toward communism’.
