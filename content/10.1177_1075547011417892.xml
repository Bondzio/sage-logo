<abstract>
<p>Nanotechnology cannot be directly experienced and observed—all that people know about it and their interpretations and opinions are mainly based on information from the mass media. Therefore, this first systematic study of the German media coverage about nanotechnology aims to analyse the media frames of this emerging technology. It comprises a standardized content analysis of nine print media from 2000 to 2008, which shows that the German media framing is predominantly very positive, specifically emphasizing the medical and economic benefits of nanotechnology. There is hardly any critical coverage opposing this one-sided perspective of progress. This result corresponds to the international media coverage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nanotechnology arguably constitutes both a scientific and economic area of growth and progress. In the United States, the National Nanotechnology Initiative 2011 will be funded with 1.8 billion dollars. Furthermore, an extensive infrastructure of over 60 major research and education centers has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011417892">National Nanotechnology Initiative, 2010</xref>). In Britain as well, 23 laboratories specifically funded for research in nanotechnology have been set up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011417892">Bontoux &amp; Warwick, 2010</xref>). The German government is promoting nanotechnology as a promising technology for the future and has founded a nanotechnology initiative for 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011417892">Bundesregierung, 2010</xref>). According to the nanotechnology initiative, public funding of nanotechnology in Germany has increased from 210 to 330 million euros between 2001 and 2006.</p>
<p>Despite all these political and scientific initiatives, nanotechnology is still an emerging technology. It has not yet been accepted by the public, although there are now many products that are manufactured using nanotechnology or nanomaterials. Public opinion of nanotechnology is still nascent—just as genetic engineering in the 1970s—and it is uncertain as to how it will emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547011417892">Marcinkowski, Kohring, Friedemann, &amp; Donk, 2008</xref>, p. 108). Indeed, public opinion of nanotechnology is ambivalent. Initial studies demonstrate that although 50% of U.S. citizens think that nanotechnology will improve their lives; the majority of Europeans (53%) are not convinced of such positive consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011417892">Gaskell, Eyck, Jackson, &amp; Veltri, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547011417892">1</xref></sup> According to a survey conducted in Germany, approximately half of the 1,000 survey respondents are unable to relate meaningfully to the terms <italic>nanotechnology</italic> or <italic>nanomaterials</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1075547011417892">Vierboom, Härlen, &amp; Simons, 2008</xref>). This result can be found in other countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547011417892">Bainbridge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547011417892">Macoubrie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011417892">Pense &amp; Cutcliffe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011417892">Waldron, Spencer, &amp; Batt, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nanotechnology is invisible to the naked eye because one nanometer has a length of 10<sup>−9</sup> meters. This invisibility constitutes another similarity to genetic engineering. What people know about nanotechnology and how they perceive and form an opinion about it is, therefore, highly dependent on mass media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011417892">Anderson, Petersen, Wilkinson, &amp; Allan, 2009</xref>, pp. 67-68). But what image do the media create of nanotechnology? In this article, we consider the coverage of nine German print media between 2000 and 2008, focusing specifically on the framing of this new and emerging technology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1075547011417892">
<title>Current State of Research: Nanotechnology and the Media</title>
<p>The media coverage of nanotechnology and its consequences have been increasingly researched in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547011417892">Lewenstein, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547011417892">Dalrymple, Scheufele, and Corley (2009)</xref>, for example, compare public opinion with expert opinion on nanotechnology with respect to their media use. They show that public opinion on the benefits of nanotechnology generally aligns with the expert opinion, if the public use online scientific media.</p>
<p>The findings of a survey of British nanotechnology researchers demonstrate that scientific experts themselves are often unsatisfied with the media coverage, because they believe it covers the topic inaccurately from a scientific perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547011417892">Petersen, Anderson, Allan, &amp; Wilkinson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011417892">Burri (2009)</xref> studied focus groups and observed that the media are an important source of communication about nanotechnology and a formative instrument of public understanding on the issue. In a U.S.-based survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011417892">Lee, Scheufele, and Lewenstein (2005)</xref> show that the use of scientifically oriented media in particular fosters support for nanotechnology. Moreover, they point out that people who think critically of nanotechnology perceive more of the risks than the benefits conveyed by the media. A second representative survey in 2007 similarly demonstrates that the use of scientific media correlates positively with support for the public funding of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547011417892">Ho, Scheufele, &amp; Corley, 2010</xref>, p. 2709). With reference to the framing concept, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011417892">D. A. Scheufele and Lewenstein (2005)</xref> illustrate that media frames serve as heuristics for readers or those in the audience who have little or no experience with nanotechnology. In an experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011417892">Schütz and Wiedemann (2008)</xref> find some evidence that the variation in media framing regarding the economic context of nanotechnology influences participant risk perceptions. Negative consequences of nanotechnology are more often anticipated if a “multinational corporation” is used as a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011417892">Schütz &amp; Wiedemann, 2008</xref>, p. 377).</p>
<p>In the above studies, media coverage is regarded as a relevant factor influencing public perceptions of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011417892">D. A. Scheufele &amp; Lewenstein, 2005</xref>). However, there is, as yet, no systematic empirical analysis of the German media. Statements on media coverage in Germany, so far, are either hypothetical or rely on rather cursory and unsystematic observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011417892">Siegrist, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011417892">Kulinowski’s (2004)</xref> study serves as an example. On the basis of a nonsystematic analysis of media coverage and scientific papers, she claims that the public discourse about nanotechnology has evolved from enthusiasm to criticism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011417892">Grobe, Eberhard, and Hutterli (2005)</xref> randomly analyzed perceptions of nanotechnology in high-quality German newspapers. During the period from 2001 to 2005, they found primarily positive coverage that focuses on the benefits of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011417892">Grobe et al., 2005</xref>). Some studies analyze the media coverage of nanotechnology in North America and selected European countries (the Netherlands, Denmark, and Great Britain). These also detected a consistently positive coverage of nanotechnology, focusing on economic and medical benefits significantly more often than on the risks. Additionally, the media cover nanotechnology from a scientific point of view and, thus, scientists are often the protagonists in media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011417892">Anderson, Allan, Petersen, &amp; Wilkinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547011417892">Fitzgerald &amp; Rubin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011417892">Friedman &amp; Egolf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547011417892">Gorss, Lewenstein, &amp; Radin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547011417892">Kjolberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011417892">Laing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547011417892">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1075547011417892">Stephens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011417892">te Kulve, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547011417892">Kanerva (2009)</xref> studied the coverage of risks of nanotechnology in India, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Kenya. She found that risks are barely presented in the media. One of the latest studies of the American media coverage of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011417892">Weaver, Lively, &amp; Bimber, 2009</xref>) indicated a shift from the positive framing of progress to coverage addressing issues of regulation and responsibility. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1075547011417892">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of previous international studies on media coverage of nanotechnology.</p>

<p>Some conclusions can be drawn from these studies. The lack of clarity about nanotechnology, its complexity, as well as the general public’s lack of actual experience with it, lead to a wide range of media reconstructions of what is understood as nanotechnology. These media interpretations and the priming of certain attributes of nanotechnology can substantially influence the formation of public opinion of nanotechnology. Thus, we use the framing concept, which is an appropriate method in the communication sciences, for accessing media interpretations.</p>

<title>The Framing Approach</title>
<p>Since the 1990s, the framing approach has been used increasingly for the empirical analysis of mainly journalistic texts. It is evident that the theoretical reflection of the framing concept has not yet been as thoroughly developed as its empirical implementation. However, there is a common definition of frames as being selective and complex descriptions and interpretations of situations or concepts. These descriptions and interpretations can be identified in the context of strategic communicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011417892">Benford &amp; Snow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1075547011417892">Snow &amp; Benford, 1988</xref>), journalists (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011417892">Scheufele, 2006</xref>), (journalistic) texts (media frames; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547011417892">De Vreese, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011417892">Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011417892">Matthes &amp; Kohring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547011417892">Semetko &amp; Valkenburg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011417892">Shah, Watts, Domke, &amp; Fan, 2002</xref>), as well as for recipients of media content (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547011417892">Iyengar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547011417892">Price &amp; Tewksbury, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1075547011417892">D. A. Scheufele, 1999</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011417892">Entman (1993)</xref>, culture-specific frames can also be identified. The concept of media frames has replaced the analysis of isolated single variables, which are only connected in a final interpretation. However, there are many different methodological approaches for the analysis of frames, and these entail various reliability and validity problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011417892">Matthes &amp; Kohring, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011417892">Entman (1993)</xref>, the analysis of journalistic texts should always be conducted as a frame analysis because only this approach prevents a quantitatively equal treatment of all text elements, such as positive and negative statements: “Unguided by a framing paradigm, content analysis may often yield data that misrepresent the media messages that most audience members are actually picking up” (p. 57).</p>

<title>Operationalization of Media Frames</title>
<p>The present analysis operationalizes media frames as suggested by Kohring and Matthes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417892">Kohring &amp; Matthes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011417892">Matthes &amp; Kohring, 2008</xref>), which has been established in several studies as consistent and convincing. The method attempts to ensure the content validity of frames, and it also allows for an objective analysis of frames. A frame is understood as a specific, unique pattern of a text that is composed of several elements. The point of this approach, therefore, is not to code the entire frame directly, but to code its elements. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011417892">Entman’s (1993</xref>, p. 52) operational definition, a frame consists of the following elements: (a) problem definition, (b) causal attribution of responsibility, (c) moral judgment of the protagonists and their actions, and (d) treatment recommendations. These four components are operationalized through content analysis variables. During the content analysis, the affiliation of the frame elements to a specific frame remains unknown. This increases the reliability of the analysis and enables the identification of new and modified frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417892">Kohring &amp; Matthes, 2002</xref>). The identification of frames is conducted subsequently using cluster analysis.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The aim of the present study is to show the variety of perspectives on nanotechnology by revealing the way nanotechnology is framed. The current state of research has demonstrated that the media coverage in European countries as well as the United States is predominantly positive and still very much determined by the scientific community because scientists are cited frequently. Only lately, a slight tendency toward a less positive framing was apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011417892">Weaver et al., 2009</xref>). However, as the media coverage of other formerly emerging technologies such as biotechnology differed in each country, it is not certain that the German media coverage of nanotechnology will also be positive and focused on scientific research. Therefore, we analyze whether the German media coverage about nanotechnology is as positive as the international literature suggests or whether there are periods of critical coverage as observed with the discourse about biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417892">Kohring &amp; Matthes, 2002</xref>). We approach the topic in an explorative way and pose research questions. The results will be interpreted with regard to findings of international research on media coverage of nanotechnology. Similarities and differences will be named and explained.</p>
<p>While a technology is still emerging, the number of protagonists dealing with it and publicly commenting on it usually increases. It is, therefore, necessary to conduct a longitudinal study of media coverage. Accordingly, the key research questions are,</p>

<title>Methodological Approach</title>
<p>A content analysis of media coverage of nanotechnology in the German daily newspapers <italic>Financial Times Deutschland, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau, Süddeutsche Zeitung, taz, Die Welt</italic>, as well as in the weekly news magazines <italic>Focus</italic> and <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> and in the weekly newspaper <italic>Die Zeit</italic>, was conducted for the period 2000 to 2008. The sample comprised quality papers of various political leanings, which can also be expected to tackle a public discourse that is only just emerging, as media coverage on science is mainly restricted to quality newspapers and magazines in Germany. The population was identified by searching the database Genios GBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbi.de">http://www.gbi.de</ext-link>) for articles including the word “nano*”. These articles were then gathered either from online or press archives. As the aim of the study is to investigate articles that cover nanotechnology as their main topic, only those articles were analyzed in which nanotechnology comprised at least 50% of the article or which contained substantial statements about nanotechnology. The articles could be news articles, features, editorials, or op-eds. Only special supplements, recommendations of events, or articles from the local sections were excluded. A total of 1,807 articles formed the population of the analysis (as it is a full-sample survey).</p>
<p>The four frame elements were operationalized as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1075547011417892">Table 2</xref>. The main topic of the article in question and the evaluation of risks and benefits constitute the frame element of <italic>problem definition</italic>. Protagonists responsible for the benefits or risks mentioned in the article were used as indicators of <italic>causal attribution of responsibility</italic>. The specific way the article evaluates nanotechnology constitutes the frame element <italic>moral judgment</italic>. The call for regulation or support of nanotechnology and its future that are mentioned in the article served as indicators of <italic>treatment recommendations</italic>. The analysis contained only variables that occurred with a frequency of 5% or more (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1075547011417892">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1075547011417892">2</xref></sup> Each of these variables was dichotomized for the cluster analysis.</p>

<p>To determine the frames in the media coverage of nanotechnology, a two-step cluster analysis was conducted (distance measure: log-likelihood, automatic determination of the number of clusters using Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion [BIC]). This type of cluster analysis is a combination of hierarchical clustering and <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. It was the most appropriate for our study, because it determines the optimal number of clusters and is able to process a large amount of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011417892">Kaufman &amp; Rousseeuw, 2005</xref>). We chose the automatic determination of the number of clusters for this analysis, because neither the descriptive analysis of the data nor the theoretical background provided a foundation on which it was reasonable to anticipate a specific number of clusters about nanotechnology.</p>
<p>As cluster analysis is an exploratory procedure, a discriminant analysis was conducted subsequently to validate the cluster solution. Discriminant analysis is a procedure for validating structures or patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011417892">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>, p. 375) and is therefore suitable for assessing the quality of a cluster solution. For our analysis, it yielded a rate of 96.1% of correctly identified cases, which indicates a good cluster solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011417892">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>t</italic> values were calculated to validate the cluster solution. <italic>F</italic> values are a measure of homogeneity within each cluster and represent the quotient of variance of the variable in one cluster and the variance of the variable in the sample. If an <italic>F</italic> value is smaller than 1, it means that, with respect to this variable, the cluster is more homogeneous than the total sample. By contrast, <italic>t</italic> values are statistical indicators of the heterogeneity between clusters. To calculate <italic>t</italic> values, the mean of each variable in the sample is subtracted from the mean of the variable in the cluster. The result is then divided by the standard deviation of the variable in the sample. A positive <italic>t</italic> value indicates that the variable is overrepresented in the respective cluster, compared with the entire sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011417892">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Dynamics of the Media Coverage</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1075547011417892">Figure 1</xref> shows how the articles are distributed over time. In Germany, a more intensive public discourse about nanotechnology only began with the so-called “Bill Joy Debate.” On June 6, 2000, the American software engineer Joy called for a research moratorium in the <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic>, on the basis that the risks of nanotechnology are unforeseeable. Subsequently, responses to Joy’s statements were published until December 2000. The rise of media coverage in 2001 may then be due to the increased awareness of nanotechnology caused by Joy’s debate. The subsequent years, however, reveal a decline in coverage—only in 2004 (<italic>n</italic> = 248) there was a peak, and in 2006 (<italic>n</italic> = 215) the coverage remained steady. In 2004, the German parliament established a German initiative on nanotechnology (“Deutsche Zukunftsoffensive Nanotechnologie”). In 2006, cases of contamination through the use of specific polish and care sprays from a German company (“Magic Nano”) were published, although it later became apparent that these sprays did not in fact contain nanoparticles. Then in 2008, the media coverage declined to below even the 2000 level.</p>

<p>The <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic> is the newspaper that, both in total (<italic>n</italic> = 589) and in each year, published the highest number of articles (<italic>M</italic> = 65.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 19.7). On average, one article on nanotechnology was published in every fifth edition. By contrast, the <italic>taz</italic> only published 43 articles (<italic>M</italic> = 4.8; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.9) in total, which were scattered quite evenly over the entire period. Thus, the German press can be divided roughly into two groups. Two newspapers (<italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic> and <italic>Welt; M</italic> = 44.7; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.6) dominate the public discourse on nanotechnology, with more than 50% of the articles. Another two newspapers, <italic>Frankfurter Rundschau</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 14; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.5) and <italic>Süddeutsche Zeitung</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 19.6; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.6), cover nanotechnology on a moderate level, although still regularly over the 9 years analyzed. The <italic>Financial Times Deutschland</italic> (M = 33.6; SD = 25.4) belonged to the last group until 2003, after which it became part of the media that paid considerable attention to nanotechnology. The weekly magazines and newspapers, <italic>Spiegel</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 5.7; <italic>SD</italic> = 3), <italic>Focus</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 5.4; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.7), and <italic>Zeit</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 7.7; <italic>SD</italic> = 3.1), seem considerably less interested in the subject. On average, only every 10<sup>th</sup> edition contains an article on this emerging technology.</p>

<title>Frame I: “Research &amp; Development.”</title> <p>The first cluster or frame, which, appearing in 45.5% of the articles, is also the most prominent one, is called “Research &amp; Development” (<italic>n</italic> = 823). In articles belonging to this cluster, the topic of scientific research is the focus. Indications of benefits are the scientific gain of knowledge through nanotechnology, whereby mainly scientists are presented as responsible. Risks and calls for regulation regarding the use of nanotechnology do not appear in this frame. The protagonists of the frame evaluate nanotechnology in 54.9% of the cases as very or fairly positive. In the other cases, they do not give any evaluation. Generally, this frame presents scientific-oriented media coverage, which points exclusively at research progress without or barely presenting nanotechnology in any social context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1075547011417892">
<title>Frame II: “Economic Benefits.”</title> <p>In articles covering this frame (28.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 508), the benefits of nanotechnology are seen in economic improvements (59.9%), such as the creation of new job opportunities and an increase in sales. This frame therefore, is, called “Economic Benefits.” Businessmen and managers (36.4%), as well as nanotechnology itself (32.7%), are viewed as responsible for these benefits. Almost half of the articles (48.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 508) focus on the implementation of nanotechnology in information and communication technology (ICT), which is presented as a high-profit field of application. Similar to Frame 1, hardly any risks or calls for regulation are mentioned. General evaluations of nanotechnology and assessments of its future are positive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1075547011417892">
<title>Frame III: “Medical Benefits.”</title> <p>In 62.1% of all articles belonging to the third frame (11.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 214), the medical implementation of nanotechnology is the focus. Furthermore, some benefit of nanotechnology is mentioned in every single article, which is nearly always (97.2%) a medical benefit. These positive prospects are ascribed to the actions of scientific protagonists (59.8%) and to the potential of “nanotechnology itself” (25.7%). The risks of nanotechnology as well as calls for risk regulation are of no relevance in this frame. Overall, the frame is quite positively oriented. About 66.4% of the general evaluations by the protagonists are very or rather positive and also the prospects, which are mentioned in 21.5% of the articles, are positive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1075547011417892">
<title>Frame IV: “Ambivalence.”</title> <p>The fourth and last frame (14.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 262) differs quite significantly from the other three. Of importance in this frame are articles providing an overview of the risks and benefits of nanotechnology (22.1%) and covering the ethical aspects. This consists mainly of reflecting on the extent to which the risks of applying nanotechnology are worth taking. Also, in contrast to the preceding frames, the economic (24.4%) and medical (19.5%) benefits of nanotechnology are juxtaposed to the medical risks (34.3%). The ambivalence of the topic is tackled explicitly here. However, the debate remains rather hypothetical, as hardly any specific protagonists or groups are addressed. The risks are thus generally ascribed to “nanotechnology itself” and not to individual protagonists. Half of the articles framing nanotechnology in this manner also ask for risk regulations (51.9%). However, there are also a fair number of positive evaluations (35.5%). Therefore, this frame does not present a one-sided rejection of nanotechnology, but aims at balanced reporting. In this frame, the second highest number of positive prospects can also be found.</p>

<title>Framing Dynamics of Nanotechnology in the Media Coverage</title>
<p>In our second research question, we asked if the frequency of the four frames of nanotechnology had changed between 2000 and 2008, and if so, how can these changes be described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1075547011417892">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The frame “Research &amp; Development” (<italic>M</italic> = 45.5; <italic>SD</italic> = 49.8) is also dominant in almost each year within the period. Only in 2006 did it decrease from 47.2% to 34.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 215), but then increased again by 2008 to 56.8% of all articles. This decrease corresponds to a short but conspicuous increase in the “Economic Benefits” frame (<italic>M</italic> = 28.1; <italic>SD</italic> = 45.0) to 38.1% in 2006. In 2008, only 11.7% of all articles contained this frame, indicating a strong decrease. Such recursive phases of shifts between research and its implementation are understandable, because nanotechnology is still in the developmental stage. The development of the frames “Medical Benefits” (<italic>M</italic> = 11.8; <italic>SD</italic> = 32.3) and “Ambivalence” (<italic>M</italic> = 14.5; <italic>SD</italic> = 35.2) can generally be described as more or less consistent. It is striking, though, that the “Ambivalence” frame had one of its peaks in 2006 with 18.1%. This was the year in which the economic benefits were also often mentioned (and the scandal about the polish and care sprays, which occurred in 2006, see “Dynamics of the Media Coverage” section). The “Ambivalence” frame had its highest peak, though, in 2000, which was the year in which Bill Joy initiated the fundamental debate about nanotechnology (see “Dynamics of the Media Coverage” section).</p>

<p>Most of the media differ only in their coverage of the frames “Research &amp; Development” and “Economic Benefits,” which constitute about three quarters of the entire media coverage on nanotechnology. While the <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic> (54.5%) and the <italic>Süddeutsche Zeitung</italic> (46.6%) emphasize the frame “Research &amp; Development,” the <italic>Welt</italic> (34.8%), <italic>Financial Times Deutschland</italic> (35.8%), <italic>Focus</italic> (30.6%), and also the <italic>Frankfurter Rundschau</italic> (32.5%) cover the economic frame more frequently than other newspapers. The media that cover nanotechnology also most frequently present it in a very positive manner, by highlighting scientific progress and opportunities for economic use and application. In the <italic>Spiegel</italic>, the “Medical Benefits” frame has its highest share of coverage, with 23.5%. In this news magazine (19.6%), as well as in the <italic>Frankfurter Rundschau</italic> (21.4%), the “Ambivalence” frame also plays an important role. A significant difference can be observed with respect to the <italic>Zeit</italic> and the <italic>taz</italic>. Both newspapers cover the “Ambivalence” frame more frequently than the other media, that is, in more than one third of their articles. Nevertheless, the articles in these newspapers constitute only a small share of the total coverage of nanotechnology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this first systematic content analysis of the German media coverage of nanotechnology was to analyze the media framing of this emerging technology. The results show that the framing is mainly positive and focuses on the medical or economic benefits. These benefits will most likely be achieved through research and development. Possible reasons for this positive depiction of nanotechnology may be that there have not yet been any major events of damage caused by nanotechnology. Also, the political and economical protagonists have high expectations of the benefits of nanotechnology, which become apparent through political activities, such as the German government’s nanotechnology initiative.</p>
<p>Only a few media outlets (<italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Welt, Financial Times Deutschland</italic>) cover the entire public discourse on nanotechnology. These newspapers, which also present critical views, only occasionally intervene in the debate. The German news coverage does not differ significantly from the results of other international studies. Similar to countries such as the United Kingdom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011417892">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>) or the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547011417892">Fitzgerald &amp; Rubin, 2007</xref>), the German media reveal a positive and benefit-oriented coverage.</p>
<p>Compared with the frames <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011417892">Anderson et al. (2005)</xref> found, the German nanotechnology coverage lacks the notion of nanotechnology as science fiction. However, the two key frames comprising scientific research and economic benefits are quite similar in the British media coverage. Also Danish newspapers focus the scientific side of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547011417892">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011417892">Weaver et al. (2009)</xref> take a slightly different approach and ask how questions of responsibility regarding nanotechnology are covered by U.S. newspapers, they find that the “progress” frame that focuses on scientific progress and leaves responsibility to scientists used to be a key frame at the beginning of the 21st century. As frames tapping scientific research and economic benefits appear in the media coverage of many different countries, we can certainly assume them to be two key perspectives that journalists share worldwide.</p>
<p>The “Ambivalence” frame, on the other hand, seems to have its counterpart in the North American media coverage and the frame “societal risk/benefit discussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011417892">Laing, 2006</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011417892">Weaver et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrate that American media coverage has lately been more concerned with risks of nanotechnology and, thus, covered the topic of regulation more intensively. Therefore, we can conclude that the debate about the risks of nanotechnology has not yet supplanted the idea of progress through scientific research. Journalistic awareness of risks does exist, but we can only speculate whether the public call for regulation will increase in the future and exceed the focus on scientific research.</p>
<p>In attempting to understand current public debate about nanotechnology, a comparison with another formerly emerging technology, namely modern biotechnology, proves useful. Between the early 1970s and the early 1980s, media coverage of biotechnology focused consistently on the progress achieved through this technology, without referring to the social implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547011417892">Hampel, Pfenning, Kohring, Görke, &amp; Ruhrmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547011417892">Hampel, Ruhrmann, Kohring, &amp; Görke, 1998</xref>). However, in the mid-1980s, a highly critical public debate about modern biotechnology arose as a result, among others, of the birth of the first (West) German test-tube baby. Since the 1990s, the initial economic success and the absence of any evident damages caused by biotechnology have led to more benefit-oriented media coverage. This coverage has been accompanied with a lively ethical debate due to the birth of Dolly, the cloned sheep, in 1997. Above all, the coverage in the German press can be described as critically benefit-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011417892">Kohring &amp; Matthes, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>At present, nanotechnology is in an early stage of development, in which public debate takes place only sporadically and rarely in a critical manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011417892">Lewenstein (1998)</xref> differentiated four periods in the development of environmental journalism. The last period describes the turn from journalism as a mere mediator of scientific findings to an advocate of the environment. It could be debated if the results of our study indicate a new period in which journalism is becoming a promoter of scientific progress and the economic perspective on science and technology. The comparison with modern biotechnology indicates that nanotechnology does not have as many cultural implications as biotechnology. At least in Germany, biotechnology is often associated with National Socialism and its ideology of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. If it is true that nanotechnology does not imply such cultural characteristics, it seems likely to become a topic of public debate only in the case of severe and substantial damages. However, we must wait and see whether the positive media framing of nanotechnology also leads to a positive public image. Nonetheless, public opinion on modern biotechnology was also more critical than the benefit-oriented media coverage suggested at the time. The positive media coverage of nanotechnology involves the risk that as soon as severe damage occurs, caused by such a promising technology, the disappointment will be bitter.</p>
