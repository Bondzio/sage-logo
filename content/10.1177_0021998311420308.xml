<abstract>
<p>Intermediate restorative material (IRM®) is the most commonly used temporary filling material. This research mixed IRM with Polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) fibers, forming the Nylon/IRM tooth root composite filling materials. Tests such as setting time, degree of solubility, compressing strength, and micro-leakage were carried out to examine the properties of the Nylon 6/IRM® composite material. The result showed that there was no significant difference in the setting time and degree of solubility after adding the Nylon 6 fibers. The loading after the yielding point of the Nylon 6/IRM® was more than 250 N; micro-leakage was found on the 13th day.</p>

<p>Coming after cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the dental caries has been identified as the third non-infection disease by the WHO, which also confirmed that there were more than five billion people bothered by the tooth decay problems. Because of the development of the sweets and delicate food, many patients are merely children living in the city. Oral cavities are common in Asia and South America.</p>
<p>The tooth root surgery is a medical treatment dealing with the dental pulp. It includes diagnoses and restoration. Diagnoses are to surgically find the sources of pain, pathological changes, the inflammation, and infections of the root end tissues. X-ray images are also examined for further prescriptions. The tooth root surgery is to cut the infected tissue when the pathological change is found in the root and canine tooth tissues. After the pathological changes are removed, the tooth root is hold open by a reamer which is later applied to clean the inner and lateral side of the root. Rinsed by chloramine and perhydrol interchangeably, the root is then coated by the formalin cresol solution, the chloromycetin solution, and camphor, a common dental prescription. After sterilization, the root is filled with the temporary filling material. With the invention of convenient medical tools and the enlightenment of people’s understanding over this matter, the surgical tooth root treatments nowadays is rare in the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311420308">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A perfect filling material must meet certain requirements. Foremost, it should be physical stable to prevent shrinkage or swelling; furthermore, it must fit the cavity completely to block out microorganisms and toxicants. An ideal filling material, besides requiring sufficient working time, is an anti-carcinogen with characteristics like radio-resistance, bio-compatibility, antibacterial activity, moisture resistant and insolubility. Many <italic>vivo</italic> studies have been done to examine various filling materials, techniques, and other factors such as hand dexterity. The root-end micro-leakage is frequently used. It involves (1) the dye leakage method, (2) the fluid filtration method, (3) the electrochemical method, (4) the microorganism penetration method, and (5) the radioisotope labeling method. Methods of the dye leakage, the fluid filtration, and microorganism penetration are popular. Having a long history, the dye leakage method is the easiest. None of those methods can replicate the complicated root-end infection mechanism, so it is hard to tell which one is better.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311420308">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311420308">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The application of fibers has made a breakthrough in conventional attire manufacture. Nowadays, fibers are used to strengthen the mechanical property of production and enrich the functions of the composite. From 2004 to 2008, Lin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311420308">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311420308">26</xref></sup> have utilized fiber materials in electromagnetic shielding effective products and medical dressings. Fibers are frequently used to manufacture a multi-functional composite material. In the textile industry, this blending aims to expand the production line. In the dental treatment, the quality of the temporary filling material is primary. If the material fails to sustain occlusion, bacteria will make inroads into the tooth root and cause the secondary infection which will prolong the treatment. As a result, the temporary filling material must have high compressive strength. In this study, the polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) fibers were added into the temporary filling material to better the mechanical property of the material and prevent cavities caused by occlusion and bacteria crises. Finally, the influence of the addition of Nylon 6 fibers on the micro-leakage in temporary filling material was subsequently evaluated.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311420308"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>Zinc-eugenol intermediate restorative material (IRM®) was offered by Dentsply American and the high-strength Nylon 6 fiber was purchased by Formosa chemical and Fiber corporation. The Nylon 6 fibers were 64 mm in length, 10 gf/D in strength, 24.7% in elongation, and 6.0 denier in fineness. Nylon 6 fiber was trimmed to different lengths (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mm), after which it was mixed with IRM® to form the Nylon 6/IRM® composite material. The Nylon 6/IRM® composite materials were prepared by mixing the IRM® with the 2 mm Nylon 6 fibers which were added in different weight ratios: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 wt%. This mixed gluey substance later was put in a mold of simulate tube and put to test its setting time (American Dental Association; ADA no. 30), degree of solubility, compressing strength, micro-leakage to find out the best adding ratio. Besides, different lengths of the Nylon 6 fibers (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm) were also examined to have an appropriate fibers length with minimal micro-leakage.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311420308"><title>Solubility measurement</title>
<p>The degree of solubility of test materials was determined by a modification method of the ADA specification no. 30.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311420308">7</xref></sup> The materials were prepared in line with manufacturers’ recommendations. After mixing, each substance was made into a small disc with a size of 20 × 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> by the use of a metal mold and two glass plates. Mixing and weighing of the samples were performed by a single operator at 23 ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 5–50%. Six discs of each material were fabricated and tested. After fabrication, they were placed in 100% humidity for 21 h and then stored individually in glass bottles containing 50 mL of distilled water at 37°C. The specimens were removed from the water after 1 day. All discs were desiccated for 1 h at 37°C. Each disc was then weighed to the nearest microgram. After weighing, each disc was replaced in the same glass bottle. The water in the bottles was neither changed nor added to during the test periods. The desiccation and weighing procedure was performed at 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 13th days.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311420308"><title>Micro-leakage measurement</title>
<p>The micro-leakage test materials were determined according to the method recommended the ADA no. 30. It was putting in the dye solution of setting complete specimen. After picked up the specimen and cut it. And then used the stereoscope to observation the cross-section dyeing leakage in the specimen or not.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311420308"><title>Compressive strength measurement</title>
<p>The specimen, 6 mm thick with 4 mm diameter, was first put in a distilled water, whose temperate was set at 37 ± 1°C, for 24 h in the water base, and then in another distilled water set at 23 ± 1°C for 15 min before the experiment. On the basis of ADA no. 30, this experiment used Instron5566 to run the test.</p></sec></sec>

<p>As it shows in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311420308">Table 1</xref>, more Nylon 6 fibers lead to lesser setting time. The amount of fibers determined all. The Nylon 6/IRM® composite material consists of zinc powder, eugenol solvent, and the Nylon 6 fibers. The surface of the Nylon 6 fibers absorbs solvent in the mixture; thus, the eugenol solvent, used as reactive with the zinc powder, was decreased simultaneously. Consequently, the volume of the eugenol solvent is lessened; the setting rate of Nylon 6/IRM® was more quickly; and the setting time came sooner.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311420308">Table 2</xref>, the longer the Nylon 6 fibers, the shorter the setting time. This was ascribed to the longer length of the Nylon 6 fiber, which caused higher capillarity, resulting in a greater amount of solvent attached onto the fibers’ surface. Hence, the eugenol that interacted with zinc-oxide was on the decrease, reducing the setting time comparatively.

<p>The setting time was decreased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311420308">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311420308">2</xref>) regardless of weight ratios and fibers lengths.

As the loading became heavier, the flaws were born to bear the increased burdens.

<p>The interface bonding between the Nylon 6 fibers and the filling material was good so that the Nylon 6 fibers were capable of dispersing the stress for the filling material.

<p>According to the setting time test, the adding weight ratios and fiber lengths of the Nylon 6 fibers were efficient to shorter the setting time. The more the adding weights or the lengthier the fibers, the shorter the setting times were. This diminution did not affect the working time; thus, high tensile Nylon 6 fibers works.</p>
<p>The degree of solubility test exhibited that the high tensile Nylon 6 fibers did not change the IRM®’s solubility. In the compressing strength test, the strain of the IRM® material was 20.1842 N. In the strain curve, the best adding weight ratio was 1.25 wt%. When the loadings reached the yielding point, the strain of the Nylon 6/IRM® material, consisting of 4 mm long fibers, was higher than 250 N, twice than that of the 2 mm fibers.</p>
<p>Micro-leakage was seen in the Nylon 6/IRM® composite material; thus, the 4 mm fibers was the perfect fibers length. In the test, there was a noticeable micro-leakage of the Nylon 6/IRM®composite tooth root filling material on the 13th day. It suggested that the Nylon 6/IRM® composite material would be micro-leakaged in a long term; however, this composite material certainly bettered the IRM®’s compressive strain quickly.</p>
<p>This study successfully strengthened a material by adding fibers. This method is widely applied to enforce the tooth root or the tooth base. The comporessive strength and the strain of the tooth root filling material, IRM®, were improved because of the Nylon 6 fibers.</p></sec>
