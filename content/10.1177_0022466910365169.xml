<abstract>
<p>The effect of parental involvement on achievement has received a significant amount of research attention in the general student population, but surprisingly very little research has been conducted in this area for students with disabilities. This study investigated the association between parental involvement (both at home and at school) and mathematics achievement for students with visual impairments. The samples used for the study (<italic>N</italic> = 341 and <italic>N</italic> = 324) were taken from the nationally representative Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study. Multilevel modeling for longitudinal data was used to investigate the research questions. Parental involvement at school was positively associated with mathematics achievement for students who began the study in elementary school, and parental involvement at home was negatively associated with mathematics achievement for students without a cognitive disability. However, there was a strong positive association between mathematics achievement and parental involvement at home for students who also had a cognitive disability.</p>

<body>
<p>Blindness and low-vision stakeholders (e.g., parents, consumers, educators) have long been concerned about the apparent mathematics achievement gap between students who are visually impaired (i.e., those who are blind or have low vision) and their sighted peers. Furthermore, specialized teachers of students with visual impairments (VI) have consistently expressed concerns about their ability to provide students quality instruction in the Braille mathematics code (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910365169">DeMario, Lang, &amp; Lian, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022466910365169">Rosenblum &amp; Amato, 2004</xref>). Although there has been much anecdotal information indicating that students with VI lag behind their sighted peers in mathematics achievement, only recently have empirical studies confirmed this. Analyses of the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS) revealed that students with a primary disability of VI (ages 7 through 12 when entering the longitudinal study) were approximately one half year behind grade level in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910365169">Blackorby &amp; Cameto, 2004</xref>). Analyses of the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 revealed that older students with a primary disability of VI (ages 13 through 16 when entering the study) were even further behind—almost 3 years below grade level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466910365169">Blackorby, Chorost, Garza, &amp; Guzman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although data on statewide accountability tests are limited, available information does show that students with VI score lower than nondisabled students. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466910365169">Winford (2003)</xref> found that students with a VI but no secondary disabilities performed below their sighted peers on a statewide assessment of mathematics. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466910365169">North Carolina State Board of Education (n.d.)</xref> is one of the few states that report student assessment data disaggregated by federally defined disability categories. In the 2007–2008 school year, 56% of students with a primary disability of VI or blindness in third through eighth grade scored at or above grade level in mathematics, compared to 74% of students without disabilities.</p>
<p>One factor that is thought to have a positive impact on school achievement, including mathematics achievement, for the general population is parental involvement. In fact, it is considered to be so important to educational achievement that one of the six targeted areas for reform of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022466910365169">No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (2002)</xref> is increasing parental involvement. Educational reforms in several states also include efforts to increase parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz, Moorman, &amp; Litwack, 2007</xref>). Parental involvement has received a considerable amount of research attention, which for the most part has supported its importance. However, despite the considerable attention parental involvement has received among the general population of students, a surprisingly limited amount of research has been conducted with students with disabilities or students in special education. In fact, no published research on the effects of parental involvement on achievement of students with VI could be located.</p>
<p>Parental involvement can be defined in several ways. For the purposes of this article, parental involvement is differentiated by where if occurs: either in school or outside of school, which is referred to as “at home.” Parental involvement at school (PIS) involves activities that require contact with the school and can include such things as meeting with a teacher or administrator, attending general school meetings, attending school events, and volunteering at the school. Parental involvement at home (PIH) can include such things as assistance with homework, talking to the child about school experiences, reading the newspaper or other material to the child, and taking the child to the library or a museum.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022466910365169">
<title>PIH</title>
<p>A recent systematic review of PIH concluded that parental involvement has a positive and significant effect on children’s overall academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466910365169">Nye, Turner, &amp; Schwartz, 2006</xref>). This review included only experimental studies that used a randomized controlled design (i.e., interventions meant to increase parental involvement, with one group serving as a control to the experimental group). The 18 studies resulted in an overall average effect size of <italic>d</italic> = 0.45, which was considered important in practical terms. Of the 18 studies, 5 specifically investigated mathematics achievement; the average effect size in this area was <italic>d</italic> = 0.54. Although this effect was large, it was not very precise because one of those studies reported an extremely large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.50).</p>
<p>The association between parental involvement and student achievement has also been investigated by measuring the amount of naturally occurring parental involvement (according to the parent, the child, or a teacher) and evaluating its relationship to achievement. This research has involved both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Findings from this type of research are less clear as to the benefits of parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). Some of the research has supported the positive effects of PIH on student achievement, particularly for activities that are not directly related to school but rather to general academic enrichment. Findings on the effects of parental involvement in activities that are directly related to school have been mixed, with some results indicating a negative relationship between involvement and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall, Cooper, and Robinson (2008)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of parental involvement in homework, a common type of PIH. They reviewed research that involved both experimental designs and naturally occurring involvement. The overall effect of parental involvement in homework across all types of designs was small and usually not significant. However, results did differ based on the child’s age (more effective for younger students) and subject matter (e.g., experimental studies exhibited a positive relationship for mathematics, but correlational studies exhibited a negative relationship for mathematics). Another recent meta-analysis focusing on middle-school students supported these findings: Parental involvement was positively associated with achievement, with the exception of parental help with homework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022466910365169">
<title>PIS</title>
<p>Findings on the positive benefits of involvement at school have been more consistent. A report from the U.S. Department of Education documented that a high percentage of parents participate in school activities, such as attending a general school meeting (89%), attending a parent–teacher conference (78%), attending a school event (74%), and volunteering at school (46%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022466910365169">Herrold &amp; O’Donnell, 2008</xref>). These percentages are highest when students are in elementary school and decrease as students advance to higher grades. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal research has documented an association between naturally occurring parental involvement in school and higher achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466910365169">Fan &amp; Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). This involvement in early grades has been shown to predict later achievement—even achievement in high school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910365169">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022466910365169">Izzo, Weissberg, Kasprow, &amp; Fendrich, 1999</xref>). However, intervention research meant to promote parental involvement in school activities has not provided as much support for its benefit to achievement as the correlational research has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0022466910365169">
<title>The Mechanisms by Which Parental Involvement Influences Achievement</title>
<p>Explanations for why and how parental involvement influences achievement have been proposed by several authors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910365169">Hill and Taylor (2004)</xref> suggested two mechanisms for this relationship: <italic>increasing social capital</italic> and <italic>social control</italic>. Parental involvement—such as through their interactions with school personnel—is thought to increase parents’ skills and information (social capital), making them better prepared to assist their children with school-related activities. Social control occurs when parents and schools work together to provide the same message to children about appropriate behavior. If this message is the same across both settings, it is expected to reduce problem behaviors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al. (2007)</xref> described two sets of models by which parental involvement can effect achievement: <italic>skill development models</italic> and <italic>motivational development models</italic>. Skill development models suggest that parents’ involvement in school activities provides children with skill-related resources such as cognitive skills and metacognitive skills. Motivational development models suggest that parental involvement benefits children’s achievement because it provides them with a number of motivational resources that encourage their engagement in school. In general, the idea is that parental involvement can have a direct effect on achievement by improving children’s skills (e.g., by helping with homework) or an indirect effect by increasing motivation for school or improving student behavior.</p>

<title>Differential Effects of Parental Involvement by Grade Level</title>
<p>Parental involvement tends to decrease as children get older, and the majority of parental involvement research has focused on elementary-age children. However, the effects of parental involvement at different grade levels have been the subject of more recent research. Some of this research involving middle school and high school students has documented little or no relationship between parental involvement and achievement for these students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910365169">Bronstein, Ginsberg, &amp; Herrara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466910365169">Fan, 2001</xref>), whereas other studies have found a positive relationship between parental involvement and adolescents’ achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022466910365169">Grolnick, Kurowski, Dunlap, &amp; Hevey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022466910365169">Hill et al., 2004</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of the relationship between parental involvement and academic outcomes for middle school students documented a positive relationship for involvement at school and academic socialization but not for involvement at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall et al. (2008)</xref>, in their meta-analysis of the relationship between parental involvement with homework and achievement, found that involvement is effective for elementary-age students but not for middle school students.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022466910365169">
<title>Research Involving Students With Disabilities</title>
<p>Research concerning parental involvement of students with disabilities is surprisingly limited, particularly given the fact that parental involvement is obviously considered important for this population: Involvement is mandated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466910365169">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004</xref> for planning the child’s individualized education program. Much of the research that has been conducted in this area has been descriptive in nature, measuring levels of parental involvement for various subgroups of students with disabilities, or has involved a comparison of the levels of parental involvement of students in the general population and special education students. A few research studies have documented similar levels of involvement for parents of students with disabilities and parents of students without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910365169">Gerstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466910365169">McKinney &amp; Hocutt, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022466910365169">Yanok &amp; Derubertis, 1989</xref>), but two studies found general education students to have higher levels of parental involvement in certain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910365169">Deslandes, Royer, Potvin, &amp; Leclerc, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466910365169">Rogers, Wiener, Marton, &amp; Tannock, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although no published research relating parental involvement to achievement for students with disabilities could be found, two unpublished dissertations that addressed this topic were located. One of these studies investigated the relationship between parental involvement and achievement for students with learning disabilities and serious emotional disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466910365169">Woika, 1993</xref>). Parental involvement was measured by school-initiated home–school contact, parent-initiated home–school contact, and other involvement such as parent–teacher organizations and volunteer activities. Results indicated that the three parent-involvement factors combined were a significant predictor of achievement but that both types of home–school contact tended to be associated with lower achievement whereas other involvement tended to be associated with higher achievement. A more recent study also evaluated the benefits of parental involvement for a group of students with learning disabilities, including its relationship with grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910365169">Gerstein, 2006</xref>). Results indicated that higher grades were correlated with both parents’ involvement, particularly school-related involvement for mothers and fathers’ involvement in personal activities.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Given the documented disparity in mathematics achievement for youth with VI, it is important to consider alterable factors that could result in improved mathematics achievement for this population. One such factor is parental involvement, yet the relationship between parental involvement and achievement for youth with VI has not been studied. It is possible that the relationship for this population may differ from the relationship exhibited in the general population. Parental involvement may not be capable of affecting the difficulties students with VI face with mathematics. For example, if difficulty seeing the board and difficulty following along during class cause decreased performance, PIH may not be able to compensate for these problems. On the other hand, PIS may assist the student in receiving the assistive technology and supports he or she needs to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910365169">Kelly, 2009</xref>) and might exhibit a stronger relationship with achievement. Achievement levels tend to be lower for students with cognitive impairments, and parental involvement may not have the same effect for them. Therefore, we also thought it important to consider whether this relationship differs based on the presence of a cognitive impairment or grade level (as documented in other research).</p>
<p>The following research questions were investigated in the current study:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0022466910365169">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>The database used to investigate our research questions was the SEELS. Funding was received from the Institute of Education Sciences (Grant R324K0600009) to conduct this research. SEELS, conducted by SRI International and funded by the Office of Special Education Programs, produced a nationally representative database of school-age students between 2000 and 2005. A two-stage process was used to identify the sample: First, a stratified sample (based on geographic region, district size, and district and community wealth) of local education agencies (LEAs) and state-supported schools for students with disabilities was identified. Next, students were randomly selected for participation from rosters of special education students in the schools in these LEAs and the special schools.</p>
<p>SEELS is a comprehensive study, documenting the achievement, personal characteristics, and educational experiences of a sample of elementary special education students as they move through the school system, up to high school. Data collection from several sources (i.e., parents, teachers, and school administrators) occurred up to three times for each student. This data collection occurred in three waves, during 2000–2001, 2002, and 2004. Data were collected about the students’ family characteristics and nonschool activities, classroom experiences, instructional goals, accommodations, and school programs, policies, and practices. Students were directly assessed on achievement, self-concept, and attitudes toward school.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022466910365169">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The population of interest to this study was students with VI. These students were identified by having VI designated as their primary disability by the school. VI is one of the 13 special education disability categories and is defined as “an impairment in vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child’s educational performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022466910365169">Department of Education, 2006</xref>). All students with a primary disability of VI who had scores available on the Calculations subtest of the <italic>Woodcock–Johnson III Tests of Achievement</italic> (WJ-III ACH) and parental involvement data (for at least one of the two variables) were included in the sample (<italic>N</italic> = 341). Several of these students had a cognitive disability in addition to their VI (<italic>n</italic> = 21).</p>

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section11-0022466910365169">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The Calculations subtest of the WJ-III ACH measures mathematics computational skills, ranging in difficulty from simple to advanced. The easiest problems require the student to perform single-digit addition, whereas the most difficult involve calculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910365169">Blackorby, Chorost, Garza, &amp; Guzman, 2004</xref>). This is a written test. The W scores available in the WJ-III ACH are Rasch-scaled scores that have the quality of equal interval units. They are centered on a value of 500, which has been set to approximate the average performance of students beginning the fifth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022466910365169">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>). Because of its fixed setting to fifth grade student performance, the W score is ideal for use in longitudinal analyses.</p>
<p>The WJ-III ACH is a well-developed and thoroughly evaluated instrument. Reviewers in the <italic>Fifteenth Mental Measurements Yearbook</italic> gave it the highest praise, both considering it the best available instrument to measure achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022466910365169">Cizek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022466910365169">Sandoval, 2003</xref>). It was developed based on the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory of cognitive abilities and educational core curricular areas and domains specified in federal legislation. The WJ-III ACH exhibits good to excellent reliability; the reported split-half reliability coefficients for the two tests are .86 and .93, respectively. It is based on several sources of empirically sound validity evidence. Construct validity has been supported with confirmatory factor analytic models, whereas concurrent validity is supported by the test’s correlations with other established achievement tests, such as the <italic>Wechsler Individual Achievement Test</italic> and the <italic>Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910365169">Schrank, McGrew, &amp; Woodcock, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0022466910365169">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>PIS was a scale available in the SEELS database that consisted of three items measuring the frequency of parent attendance at the school for the following reasons: (a) a general school meeting, (b) a school or class event, and (c) volunteered at school. Responses were on a 5-point scale from <italic>none</italic> to <italic>more than 6 times</italic>, with scores ranging from 0 to 4. Total scores ranged from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating a greater amount of involvement at school. A score of 0 would indicate that the parents never attended their child’s school for any of these reasons, and a score of 12 would indicate that the parents attended the school more than 6 times for <italic>each</italic> of these reasons. Prior to entering this variable in the model, it was centered around its approximate mean of 4. This variable was modeled as time variant, meaning that its value could change at each wave. PIS and mathematics achievement data were available for 341 students. The total number of observations used in the analyses was 642, with the following number of observations available per person: 120 had one observation, 141 had two observations, and 80 had all three observations.</p>
<p>PIH was a scale available in the SEELS database that consisted of three items measuring the frequency of parental interaction with the child in the following areas: (a) spoke with about experiences in school, (b) helped with homework, and (c) read to. Responses were on a scale from <italic>not at all</italic>, assigned a value of 1, to <italic>every day</italic>, assigned a value of 4. Total scores ranged from 3 to 12, with higher scores indicating a greater amount of involvement at home. Therefore, a score of 3 indicates no parental involvement in these areas and a score of 12 indicates everyday involvement in all three areas. Prior to entering this variable in the model, it was centered around its approximate mean of 9. This variable was modeled as time variant, meaning that its value could change at each wave. A total of 324 students had PIH and mathematics achievement data available. (Note that this sample represents a subset of the 341 students available for the PIS analyses.) The total number of observations used in the analyses was 595, with the following number of observations available per person: 125 had one observation, 127 had two observations, and 72 had all three observations.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022466910365169">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Several variables that are known to be related to mathematics achievement, and possibly to parental involvement, were included in the models to control for their effects. The control variables included in the models were primarily demographic or disability related: family socioeconomic status (SES), gender, initial grade level, level of VI, being a Braille user, and presence of a cognitive disability. In addition to these control variables, a variable to indicate elementary school attendance was created to determine if there was an interaction with parental involvement. All of these variables were time invariant, meaning that their values remained the same at each time point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022466910365169">
<title>Family SES</title>
<p>SES of the family was evaluated with two variables: mother’s highest level of education and an index of income (whether the student’s family lives in poverty). Mother’s highest level of education was centered around its mean prior to entry into the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022466910365169">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>An overview of the SEELS data from Wave I reported that girls performed more poorly on the mathematics calculations test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910365169">Blackorby et al., 2004</xref>); therefore, gender was included in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022466910365169">
<title>Initial grade level</title>
<p>The grade the student was in at Wave 1 was included in the model as a control variable. Controlling for initial grade was necessary as there was a wide range of grades for the students in the sample (i.e., first to ninth grade) and as achievement is closely related to grade level. This variable was centered around its mean before entering it into the model. This variable was used to create a dichotomous variable that indicated whether the student was in elementary school (first to fifth grade) at the start of the study. This elementary school indicator was used to test for an interaction with parental involvement, as previous research has indicated that the effects of parental involvement can differ based on grade level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022466910365169">
<title>Level of VI</title>
<p>The schools did not identify the level of vision loss of students, but parents were asked to state whether their child’s disability was complete blindness. This dichotomous variable was used to differentiate level of VI impairment of students in the sample (i.e., blind or visually impaired).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022466910365169">
<title>Braille user</title>
<p>Several variables were available in the teacher, parent, and assessment data that indicate whether the student uses Braille. It is important to realize that many students in elementary school may use a combination of Braille and large print and that not all students who use Braille use it exclusively. Parents were directly asked if their child uses Braille, a variable in the direct assessment data indicated whether the student used Braille for the assessments, and teachers reported how frequently a student received Braille instruction. Responses to these variables were combined to create a variable identifying students as Braille users. This variable, in addition to the variable indicating Braille was used for the WJ-III tests, was tested in the models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022466910365169">
<title>Cognitive disability</title>
<p>Students with cognitive disabilities were expected to have lower mathematics achievement; therefore, presence of a cognitive disability was included as a control variable in our analyses. A dichotomous cognitive disability variable was created based on data from two variables present in the database: teacher report of disabilities the student has and parent report of disabilities the student has if the teacher report was missing. Students in our sample were identified with a cognitive disability if they had mental retardation (<italic>n</italic> = 8), developmental delay (<italic>n</italic> = 8), autism (<italic>n</italic> = 2), or traumatic brain injury (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022466910365169">
<title>Demographics of Sample</title>
<p>The PIS sample (<italic>N</italic> = 341) was used to report these demographic characteristics, as it included 17 additional students. The majority of the sample was male (58%). The race/ethnicity breakdown was as follows: 56.0% White, 25.2% African American, 14.4% Hispanic, 3.2% Asian or Pacific Islander, and the remaining 1.2% another race or multiracial. The majority of students (65.4%) were in elementary school at the beginning of the study (first to fifth grade), and the remainder were in middle school (sixth to eighth grade; 34.0%) or in ninth grade (0.6%). Almost 30.0% of the students were Braille users, and 18.2% of the students’ parents reported that their child was totally blind. Mother’s level of education varied from less than high school (13.2%) to high school (32.0%), to some college (31.1%), to a bachelor’s degree or higher (23.8%). Of the students’ families, 23.0% lived in poverty. Approximately one third of the sample had one or more disabilities in addition to the VI. The most commonly reported disabilities were (a) health impairment (17.0%), (b) attention deficit disorder (14.4%), (c) physical or orthopedic impairment (7.9%), and (d) learning disability (7.0%). A small percentage (6.1%) had a cognitive disability in addition to their VI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0022466910365169">
<title>Statistical Technique</title>
<p>The statistical technique used to analyze the data was multilevel modeling. Two primary advantages to this method are that it allows for an estimation of individual change trajectories as a function of person-specific parameters and random error and that it allows for the number and timing of observations to vary randomly across participants. In other words, with multilevel modeling the researcher can determine the average rate of change and individual variability in change over time and can utilize all observations in the estimation of parameters, even if they include only one time point.</p>
<p>The statistical models have two levels: (a) the Level 1 model, referred to as the individual growth model, represents the change in the outcome measure experienced by each respondent over time, and (b) the Level 2 model represents differences in changes in the outcome measure across respondents. SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and specifically the PROC MIXED procedure with full maximum likelihood estimation, was used for the analyses. Prior to analyzing the data, the SEELS data set was converted from its current person-level format to a person-period format.</p>
<p>Two separate models were fit, one for each independent variable (PIS and PIH). The model-fitting method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466910365169">Singer and Willett (2003)</xref> was followed. The unconditional means model and the unconditional growth model were examined first. Time was modeled as both a fixed and a random effect in both models. The independent variable and its interaction with time was entered into each model next, followed by the control variables. Interactions between parental involvement and elementary school attendance and cognitive disability were entered into the models next. Variables representing fixed effects that were not significant at the <italic>p</italic> = .05 level were removed to obtain the final models, whereas random effects (variance components) were retained at the <italic>p</italic> = .10 level.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section23-0022466910365169">
<title>Levels of Parental Involvement</title>
<p>Levels of PIS were low for most students, but there was a significant amount of variability. The average level of PIS across all time points was 4.05 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.98), and the full range of 0 to 12 was reported. This level did vary by wave, with greater levels of PIS reported in the earlier waves, when students were younger. Means at each wave were 4.61 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.11), 3.97 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.98), and 3.64 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.78).</p>
<p>Levels of PIH were high for most students. The average level of PIH across all time points was 9.38 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.81), and the full range of 3 to 12 was reported. As with PIS, the level of PIH varied by wave, with successively lower levels reported at each wave. Means at each wave were 10.05 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.70), 9.36 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.74), and 8.72 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.75).</p>
<p>Although average levels of each variable were different (one at the high end of its scale and one at the low end of its scale), there was a correlation of .28 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) between the variables. This significant correlation indicates that the two parental involvement scores tended to vary together, but the relationship was only moderate in size. Therefore, some parents who reported a high level of involvement at home reported limited, or no, involvement at school, whereas some who reported a below average level of involvement at home reported a high level of involvement at school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022466910365169">
<title>PIS</title>
<p>The unconditional means and growth models were examined first. Because these two models were almost identical for both the PIS and PIH models (the only difference being an additional 17 students in the PIS models), results for both are reported here. Results indicated that almost two thirds of the variation in math achievement was attributable to differences between students (PIS ρ = .647, PIH ρ = .639). Just less than half of the variation in math achievement was associated with time (49.4% for PIS and 46.0% for PIH).</p>
<p>Parental involvement was entered into the model first, followed by the control variables and interaction terms. Gender, being a Braille user, and level of VI were the only control variables that were not significant and were therefore dropped from both final models. PIS had a positive effect on mathematics achievement over time, but only for those students who were attending elementary school during Wave 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466910365169">Table 1</xref> for full results). The variables in the final model explained 56.5% of the variation in initial math achievement and 43.0% of the variation in growth of math achievement. The effect of PIS did not differ based on the presence of a cognitive disability. The results of the model are graphically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022466910365169">Figure 1</xref> for students in elementary school. Three levels of PIS (<italic>low</italic> = 1, <italic>average</italic> = 4, and <italic>high</italic> = 9) are displayed. Note that all graphs assume the same level of parental involvement at each time point, although this variable was time variant and could change over time.</p>

<title>PIH</title>
<p>PIH significantly predicted mathematics achievement. However, the direction of the relationship differed by the presence of a cognitive disability. The relationship was negative for students without a cognitive disability and positive for students with a cognitive disability. The effect did not differ based on grade attended at Wave 1. The variables in the final model explained 59.1% of the variation in initial math achievement and 26.9% of the variation in growth of math achievement. The results of the model are graphically displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022466910365169">Figure 2</xref> for illustration purposes. Three levels of PIH (<italic>low</italic> = 6, <italic>average</italic> = 9, and <italic>high</italic> = 12) are displayed for students with and without a cognitive disability.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first published research on the relationship between parental involvement and achievement of youth with VI. A significant relationship between both PIS and PIH was documented in this study. An interesting finding was the differential effect of PIH based on the presence of a cognitive disability. Parental involvement in each area is discussed separately, as the results were in different directions.</p>
<sec id="section27-0022466910365169">
<title>PIS</title>
<p>As documented in research with the general population, a positive relationship between PIS and mathematics achievement was found, but only for students who started the study in first through fifth grade. This relationship was significant over time, meaning that PIS had a positive effect on the growth of math achievement over time for children who started the study in elementary school. Because this effect involved an interaction with time, the effect was strongest at the last wave, when many of these students were in middle school. PIS did not have an effect on achievement for students who started the study in middle school and progressed to high school during the study. These findings indicate that PIS is important for students with VI while in late elementary and middle school but not in high school. These results differ slightly from previous research in which PIS had a positive, but weaker, relationship with achievement for students in middle school than in elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>). In our study the largest effect of PIS was seen in Wave 3, when students were in fourth to eighth grade.</p>
<p>PIS has been theorized to affect achievement by increasing motivation for school in students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). This may be one of the reasons for the positive relationship exhibited here. For this population, there may also be an alternative explanation. Students with VI are usually educated in general education classrooms—unless they have significant additional disabilities—and are expected to keep up with the other students in their classes. This is possible <italic>if</italic> they are given the accommodations and supports they need. High levels of continued PIS may help students with VI get the appropriate accommodations and supports they need to function better and therefore perform better academically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910365169">Kelly, 2009</xref>). In some schools, it is possible that students will not receive the accommodations and supports they need without the advocacy of a parent. Perhaps it is for these students that PIS is most important, but this is not something we can assess with the available data. That the effect was seen in growth over time, not in initial scores, may be associated with the fact that at higher grades with increasing math complexity the problems become more difficult to solve without accessible materials and appropriate supports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0022466910365169">
<title>PIH</title>
<p>A negative relationship between PIH and achievement has been found in some studies of the general population, particularly those focusing on homework help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, students without cognitive deficits in this study who received the most assistance from their parents were more likely to have lower math achievement. One explanation that has been suggested for this relationship is an achievement–involvement link: Those students who are doing poorly receive more help and attention at home as a reaction to their low achievement. This may explain the negative relationship exhibited in the present study.</p>
<p>There are also several possible explanations for this finding specific to students with VI. For the population in this study, the availability of accessible materials and appropriate supports may be an issue. One potential explanation of the findings is that students may be having more difficulty in math because of a lack of accessible materials, which would require more assistance at home from parents to help them complete their homework and to “catch up” on the material covered daily in class. However, despite extra parental attention at home, lack of accessible materials would likely be associated with lower achievement scores. Unfortunately, students who require Braille or large-print textbooks and other school materials often do not receive them, receive them much later than the other students, (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910365169">Corn &amp; Wall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466910365169">Smith, Geruschat, &amp; Huebner, 2004</xref>), or receive material of inferior quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022466910365169">Herzberg &amp; Stough, 2009</xref>). If the student with a VI cannot independently access his or her homework or mathematics book, parents will be required to assist with homework. Those students without accessible materials could be expected both to perform more poorly and to require a significant amount of PIH, resulting in the negative association exhibited in this study.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation is that lack of accessible materials and the amount of help required may cause parents to become frustrated, resulting in interactions marked by negative affect. Parental involvement characterized by negative affect is thought to result in negative outcomes for the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910365169">Pomerantz et al., 2007</xref>). It is also possible that even if the student does have accessible materials, he or she is not doing well in school and the parents do not understand why. Rather than recognizing the difficulty the child is facing caused by the VI, the parent may think the poor performance is solely associated with lack of effort or motivation. This scenario could result in the interactions between the parent and child being characterized by negative affect. It is also possible that assisting children with mathematics homework is more difficult for most parents than providing assistance in other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential explanation should be considered for these findings: that students with VI who receive a great amount of assistance at home have more difficulty performing well independently at school. Overprotection of parents, including attempting to do too much for their children with VI, has long been a concern of professionals who work with this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910365169">Bishop, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, data are not available to support or refute any of these potential explanations.</p>
<p>Given the number of plausible explanations for why PIH and achievement were negatively related for this population, why was there a strong <italic>positive</italic> relationship between these variables for students with cognitive impairments? Perhaps it is because students with both a VI and a cognitive disability are more likely to <italic>require</italic> some assistance and encouragement at home to succeed academically, regardless of accessibility of materials and supports. Therefore, if all of these students generally need parental assistance, those who do not get as much will do worse, which is what was found. For students with two (and possibly more) significant disabilities including one that affects cognition, parents will likely expect that there is a need to be involved in their schoolwork at home and also may have realistic expectations as to their performance. This may result in a more pleasant experience, characterized by positive affect, for both the student and the parent when parents provide assistance and encouragement at home. Perhaps results for those students with combined vision and cognitive disabilities were more consistent with results for all students with a cognitive disability. However, because no research on this population is available, we cannot confirm or deny this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0022466910365169">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations of this study should be mentioned. Although the longitudinal nature of the study is a strength, the data are from naturally occurring situations and thus are essentially correlational. As has been suggested, it is possible that other factors (e.g., cognitive disability) may affect both parental involvement and achievement. Thus, our inferences as to the “effects” of parental involvement must be approached with caution and with attention to findings from previous research. A small number of students with a primary disability of VI and a cognitive disability were present in the data. Therefore, the results associated with cognitive disability should be interpreted with caution, and additional research in this area to confirm these findings is warranted.</p>

<title>Implications and Recommendations</title>
<sec id="section31-0022466910365169">
<title>Parents should strive for continued high levels of involvement at school as students with VI get older</title>
<p>The key finding of a positive association between PIS and mathematics achievement for students who started in elementary school showed the greatest effect in fourth through eighth grades. However, levels of PIS decreased with age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0022466910365169">
<title>Teachers and administrators should encourage more PIS for parents of students with VI</title>
<p>Study findings confirmed the importance of PIS for youth with VI (at least those who were in elementary school at the beginning of the study), but levels of PIS tended to be low. Encouragement for participation from schools and teachers may make a difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0022466910365169">
<title>Schools should ensure that they offer a number of opportunities and flexibility for organized parental involvement and should increase their advertisement and encouragement of these opportunities</title>
<p>Research supports the potential benefits of policies and programs aimed at increasing parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>). All parents need to be informed about their opportunities to contribute, and some parents need to be encouraged that they have something to offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022466910365169">Long, 2007</xref>). Providing flexible options for involvement is also important to allow more parents to participate.</p>
</sec>

<title>Teachers of students with VI need enhanced training on (a) how to encourage involvement and (b) how to effectively involve parents</title>
<p>Teachers can play an important role in increasing parental involvement in school and home but may not have the resources or knowledge of how to promote parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>). Research supports the idea that parents want and will respond to information about assisting their children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910365169">Hill &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910365169">LaParo, Kraft-Sayre, &amp; Pianta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910365169">Minner, 1989</xref>). Including material about effectively involving parents in training curriculums for teachers of students with VI could help increase the interaction between teachers and parents and increase parental involvement.</p>

<sec id="section35-0022466910365169">
<title>Parents of students with a combined VI and cognitive disability should be provided with encouragement and support for assisting their children at home</title>
<p>The finding of a strong positive relationship between PIH and math achievement for these students provides support for this recommendation. Teachers of students with VI could provide this encouragement and support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0022466910365169">
<title>Students with VI who are low achieving in mathematics may benefit from interventions designed to increased PIH</title>
<p>For students with a cognitive disability, more PIH was clearly beneficial. The negative relationship between PIH and math achievement (for students without a cognitive disability) does not mean that an intervention aimed at increasing PIH could not be beneficial for this population. This is supported by experimental studies of students in the general population documenting a positive relationship between parental involvement in homework and math achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466910365169">Nye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall et al., 2008</xref>), despite the negative relationship documented in correlational studies and findings from a successful math intervention involving parents of students in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910365169">Minner, 1989</xref>). The results from this study indicate that parents may need assistance with <italic>how</italic> to provide help to their children with VI at home. Many parents may not be comfortable helping their children with mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910365169">Patall et al., 2008</xref>) and more so for parents of students with VI. Complications such as possible need for Braille (and therefore Nemeth code) or absence of appropriate accommodations may further decrease parental comfort. For effective parental help, the need for assistance from a teacher for students with VI is clear. An intervention could include components shown to be successful for the general population (e.g., interactive homework assignments) as well as components specific to teaching parents about mathematics instruction for students with VI.</p>
