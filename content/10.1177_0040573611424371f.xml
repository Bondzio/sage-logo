<p><italic>To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World</italic></p>
<p>James Davison Hunter</p>
<p>New York: Oxford, 2010. 358 pp. $27.95</p>
<p>James Hunter, who directs the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia, offers in this book three provocative “essays” that challenge attitudes and activities widespread among America’s conservative Christian believers. The first attacks facile notions of cultural authority. Speaking from his expertise as a sociologist, Hunter offers a primer on the meaning and operation of culture. His definition emphasizes the largely subconscious mental habits that flow from well funded networks of established elite institutions. In an argument aimed most obviously at evangelical Protestants who aspire to influence the moral direction of contemporary American life, Hunter points to sobering realities. A rapid survey of the United States’ large foundations shows that only one out of the ten largest (the Lilly Endowment) makes substantial grants for religious purposes and that, compared to the leading foundations, self-defined evangelical and Catholic philanthropies provide miniscule support for either cultural activities or cultural institutions. For those who want “to change the world,” mistaken conceptions are, according to Hunter, even more problematic than insufficient funds. In particular, “market populism” (30) that looks for change from individual actions thrust haphazardly into a supposedly free market of ideas almost completely misunderstands where cultural authority comes from and how it actually functions.</p>
<p>In the second essay, where the sociologist gives way to the theologian, Hunter challenges the very desire to exercise cultural authority. Here, his sobering conclusion is that recent efforts by religious groups to influence political culture have resulted in political culture shaping them. As a non-discriminating critic, Hunter thinks that “the whole-hearted and uncritical embrace of politics by Christians”—whether by the religious Right, religious Left, or neo-Anabaptist separatists—has all too often meant accepting “a culture that privileges injury and grievance, valorizes speech-acts of negation, and legitimates the will to power” (172–73). For Christian believers, this cultural captivity is tragic precisely because it abandons the cross. Following in a long line of prophetic voices, Hunter insists that Christian cultural aspirations, of whatever form, betray their essential character when they neglect the self-giving, sacrifice, and powerlessness that defined the salvific heart of the faith itself.</p>
<p>Hunter’s third essay proposes “a theology of faithful presence” (195) as an antidote for misconceptions about culture and misdirected aspirations for power. Although Hunter illustrates his ideal with a number of illustrations, this third essay lacks some of the specificity that made the earlier critiques so effective. He has, nonetheless, set out a path of realistic hope. If leaders could act with humility and keep their guard up against abuses of power, if relationships to others and to institutions could be marked with covenantal faithfulness, if the delusion could be given up that the world can be managed simply by combining proper attitudes with efficient techniques—then, even in the absence of dramatic world change, things might be better.</p>
<p>Hunter’s essays are effective as good sermons are effective. They challenge thoughtless assumptions about how the world works, concentrate on problems within instead of mistakes that others make, illustrate main assertions with examples close to home, and point to the heart of the faith as the place of resolution. Most importantly, they leave readers with the insistence that the path that God chose in becoming incarnate for humanity in Jesus Christ is the only path to follow if those who are in Christ want to act and organize faithfully in the world of late modernity.</p>
