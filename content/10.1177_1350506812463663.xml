<title>Prologue</title>
<p>We are delighted that the editors of the <italic>European Journal of Women’s Studies</italic> have agreed to let the <italic>Feminist Review</italic> Collective review its own 100th issue, and will return the favour at the relevant moment! In itself, feminist publishing is an immense achievement in these times of increasing bureaucratization and rolling back of funds, and with a collective endeavour such as <italic>Feminist Review</italic> sustaining feminist practice is both increasingly important and increasingly hard. We are proud of what <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has achieved since its emergence in 1979 and keen to use this opportunity to share our celebrations with the wider feminist community. The review below is made up of three different voices from within the current collective, each one identifying slightly different but overlapping themes emerging from ‘Recalling the Scent of Memory’ (Issue 100) and using these as a springboard for exploring their resonances across <italic>Feminist Review</italic>’s history (of publishing and collective practice). We certainly speak on behalf of the rest of the collective when we ask you to celebrate 100 issues with us…</p>
<p>Carrie Hamilton, Clare Hemmings and Nadje Al-Ali, on behalf of the <italic>Feminist Review</italic> Collective</p>

<title>Collective challenges (Clare)</title>
<p>What are we celebrating when we celebrate 100 issues of <italic>Feminist Review</italic>? Why did the collective decide to ‘Recall… the Scent of Memory’ for its 100th issue? What does it mean to try to practise feminism in and through a thrice-yearly journal based in London at this point in the 21st century? These are questions we try to ask ourselves as collective editors of the journal, and that have also been asked of us by readers of the journal. In engaging these questions through ‘Recalling …’ I want to insist that thinking through gendered power relations in contemporary social contexts is a complex task that requires the following: attention to process as well as outcome; an interdisciplinary understanding of what constitutes knowledge; and a challenge to any certainty that we know who the proper subject (or object) of feminism is, much as we might nostalgically long for certainty in these grim times. That <italic>Feminist Review</italic> remains a place and space for this kind of hard work is enormously important, and that it may fail to please everyone an inevitability: to engage gender politically is always to risk something, and that is as it should be.</p>
<p>As Nadje and Carrie both make clear here too, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> is a space through which one can read the history of British feminism. Begun in 1979 as a socialist feminist project, the challenges to that theoretical and political trajectory in terms of what it does not and cannot account for have been reflected in the pages of the journal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812463663">Amos and Parmar, 1984</xref>). Typically for <italic>Feminist Review</italic>, debates about race and ethnicity in particular did not only happen in the published text but arose within the collective. Avtar Brah – whose piece ‘The scent of memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812463663">1999</xref>) was the inspiration for this 100th issue – was one of the three black members of the collective who resigned in the late 1980s, indicating they would return only at the point that the journal was clearly taking intersections of difference seriously. That some of the original members who resigned did return – Avtar among them – is testimony to the power of collective action and to a collective’s capacity to grow (see both the Editorial discussing the process in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812463663">1992</xref>; and the collective roundtable reflecting on the journal’s history of negotiating difference, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812463663">2005</xref>). Questions of how gender, race, ethnicity and indeed sexuality and class combine to inflect power have remained at the centre of <italic>Feminist Review</italic>’s political project. They require ongoing attention to these intersections in the world and among ourselves, and necessitate a challenge both to the certainty of a final political answer to the problem of unequal gender relations, and to the best way to investigate or represent those intersections.</p>
<p>Over the years, then, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has sustained its commitment to interdisciplinary approaches to feminist knowledge and representation, believing that this creates a journal that is exciting to read and one that keeps open the question of how and where inequality becomes manifest. We wanted to do justice to this complexity – of power and of ways of responding to it – in Issue 100, and so foregrounded the importance of ethnography, autobiography, creativity and collaborative production in our responses to Avtar’s piece. That no clear heroic subject or object emerges to resolve our current political problematics is also no accident: who, we wonder, should we have privileged? Instead, we wanted to open up the collective’s reflexive, interdisciplinary practice as a way of addressing complexity and increasing accountability. We also wanted to honour the journal’s capacity to reinvent itself and bounce back through repeated possibilities of annihilation: Avtar’s continued participation in the collective as well as her thinking in ‘The scent of memory’ resonates.</p>
<p>In imagining Issue 100, the collective wanted to stimulate work by as many current members of the collective as possible, to make this a conversation among us as well as a way of opening up new ways of thinking politics 100 issues later. Not all members of the collective could contribute and importantly the process of considering why this might be brought up other thorny issues. In particular, discussions around Issue 100 raised difficult questions about institutional location and participation, and our relative ability to prioritize <italic>Feminist Review</italic> work over other forms of academic production. I am proud that while we briefly considered moving away from unpaid collective participation towards paid posts to provide ways of recognizing otherwise hidden labour, this was roundly rejected. Instead, we reaffirmed – in a changed mission statement as well as among ourselves – the importance of providing a non-aligned intellectual and political space for feminist work in the present time of austerity, a space that affirms our way of being feminist even as this presents ongoing challenges (note too that this question of how to participate in an intellectual feminist project during austerity is not a new issue, as the Issue 31 ‘Editorial’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812463663">1989</xref>] attests).</p>
<p>Today, the collective and the journal continue to struggle with questions of inclusion and participation, as they always have done. The debates about institutional location occurred in tandem with seven collective members resigning and – after the crisis – seven more joining. At our recent annual meeting in summer 2012, we had a painful but essential conversation about power and exclusion with respect to South Asian representation and participation at the 100th issue celebration party. That the conversation resisted an easy mode of blame, engaged questions of historical and contemporary power relations and their concomitant effects, enabled open reflection on the importance of process among ourselves and – most importantly of all – remains unresolved and ongoing, is for me, one of the reasons why <italic>Feminist Review</italic> is so precious and so worth celebrating.</p>

<title>Processing intersectionality (Nadje)</title>
<p>By the time myself and other current collective members joined <italic>Feminist Review</italic> over the past years, intersectionality had become part of its fabric, whether in relation to the content of the journal or the specific positionalities and politics of collective members. Issue 100 is reflective of the conviction that it is our task as researchers, thinkers and activists to examine the complex relationship between different categories of power, hierarchies and difference. The historical transformation from a journal that privileged class to a journal that equally recognizes the significance of race and ethnicity, mirrors wider shifts and transformations within British feminism, as well as more global feminist debates. A post-colonial critique has been central to the journal’s identity for many years now. In fact, some of <italic>Feminist Review</italic>’s collective members, prominently Avtar Brah herself, as well as a number of articles published within the journal, have pushed and altered the debates around what constitutes Black feminism in Britain, and how we think about difference and diversity more broadly. The implications of neo-colonialism and a range of historical and current imperialist policies and interventions have also been recurring preoccupations of the journal.</p>
<p><italic>Feminist Review</italic> is deeply political, and many of us collective members straddle various forms of academic and activist engagements. As a journal, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> is rejecting the depoliticization of gender studies as it has emerged in some academic and policy contexts. Yet, the journal also challenges conventional notions of what constitutes the political in general, and feminist politics more specifically. Not only does the personal continue to be political, but so are cultural formations, discursive practices, identity constructions and (mis)representations, as we have tried to show in Issue 100. The question of what is political or not relates to another dichotomy <italic>Feminist Review</italic> puts into question: without wanting to gloss over institutional, organizational and individual constraints and limitations, the journal and its collective work across academia and activism in different ways and contexts.</p>
<p>Constructions of ‘otherness’, anxieties about migrants, questions of home and belonging, racialization and racism are as acute now as they were when ‘The scent of memory’ was originally published in 1999. The articles in Issue 100 focus on different aspects of Avtar’s original article and write back, as she had invited them to do. Yet, I would argue, individual articles and authors and some special themes published in the intervening years, have been types and modes of writing back too. Personally, I have followed closely how we had to rethink race and racism over the past years, given contemporary political constellations and anxieties in many western contexts that pit Islam and gender equality against each other. To my mind, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has played an important role in challenging prevailing discourses about Islam and Muslims, as well as contestations revolving around multiculturalism and citizenship. Articles published within the journal have provided original empirical insights and innovative theoretical approaches to understanding complex processes of governmentalizing Islam, subject formations and bodily practices of Muslims, constructions of Islam and Muslims as ‘the other’, and different understandings of feminism and gender justice. In this context, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has been contributing to the wider effort to challenge racism and Islamophobia, without falling into the trap of becoming apologetic and culturally relativist vis-a-vis oppressive practices and gender norms.</p>
<p>At the same time, and as Clare already alluded to above, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has a role to play in responding to wider political and economic configurations, nowadays linked to neoliberalism, economic downturn and widespread austerity measures. The economic and political context in which Issue 100 has been conceived and produced is in many ways much harsher and difficult than when ‘The scent of memory’ was first published. While we were thinking about and working on ‘recalling the scent of memory’, many of the higher education institutions we are working in were going through severe restructuring, cuts and compulsory redundancies. We have added to our mission statement to explicitly stress that we distance ourselves from and challenge the instrumentalization of scholarship within British and international higher education. Increasingly, government-led research funding bodies and educational policies reflect national security concerns, economic interests and narrow views on what constitutes education. <italic>Feminist Review</italic> endeavours to offer an alternative academic and political space to feminist and gender studies scholars and activists from across the globe. We are interested in both content and process, and value debates about what constitutes education, particularly feminist higher education and feminist pedagogies while continuing our commitment to other political struggles.</p>
<p>For us collective members, intersectionality as interpreted and practised within <italic>Feminist Review</italic>, allows for a specific yet sufficiently vast common ground to accommodate differences and diversity without exoticizing or fetishizing them. It is not only in terms of recognizing a range of positionalities and the significance of other intersecting political struggles that we try to address diversity constructively and creatively. We, on the collective, appreciate and aspire to produce a journal that rigorously refuses dichotomies in terms of materialist and poststructuralist approaches. Our practices as collective members, and the content of <italic>Feminist Review</italic>, show and reflect that both are equally important and can be integrated. Or at least coexist peacefully!</p>
<p>Commemorating the 100th issue, and 100 issues of the journal, we are also celebrating the collective that has kept the journal alive, dynamic and continuously changing while keeping a level of continuity. The collective is never a given, but an ever transforming organism that shelters, accommodates, fosters, absorbs, creates and three times a year, gives birth to a new issue of <italic>Feminist Review</italic>. It is hard work, involving time, labour and effort, as well as a willingness to open up, share and learn from other members and contributors. It is not a utopian tension-free zone – we argue, contest and negotiate – but the collective has become a safe space in which we can feel at home. It is also a space where we have formed friendships and take care of each other. A well-known secret is that collective members enjoy eating together, and some of us are engaging in a friendly contest over restaurant choices and foodie recommendations. A future issue on food is on the menu some years down the line. We have fun and laugh, and on the occasion of celebrating Issue No. 100, dance and party.</p>

<title>Open spaces (Carrie)</title>
<p>From the outset, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> has provided a place for reflection upon the relationship between activism and academia. In its earliest days, many collective members were based outside universities; but even as the collective has become more and more ‘academic’ (in the sense that all current members have positions in London-area universities) our engagement with activism outside as well as inside the academy has continued. As Nadje points out above, several collective members are involved with feminist, anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-poverty, community-based and other activist projects. Additionally, from its first issue <italic>Feminist Review</italic> explored the relationship between intellectual feminist analysis, activism and artistic expression in its pages and beyond in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Issue 100 encapsulates this ongoing project, closing with a number of creative contributions to the journal’s ‘Open Space’ section. The interview with Mohinder Kaur Bharma by sociologist Navtej Purewal, long-time <italic>Feminist Review</italic> contributor Nira Yuval-Davis’s discussion of ‘autochthony’ in relation to ‘The scent of memory’, the short story by Catherine O’Flynn, the poem and autobiographical fragments by, respectively, current collective members Laleh Khalili and Joan Anim-Addo defy any easy distinction between politics and poetry, academic and creative writing, criticism and art. Like the more recognizably ‘academic’ articles earlier in the issue, these pieces ‘speak (back) to’ Brah’s ‘The scent of memory’ in their own ways. At the same time, and as the close of Anim-Addo’s auto/biographical fragments suggests – ‘This is not an essay. It is graffiti’ (p. 171) – these ‘Open Space’ entries remind us of the ways in which what typically passes as ‘real’ academic writing in refereed journals is weighed down and restricted by the multiple exclusions of colonialism, patriarchy and capitalism.</p>
<p>A journey through the other 99 issues of <italic>Feminist Review</italic> gives a taste of how the journal has tried to challenge these exclusions. In its first years, the collective organized a range of events, including readers’ meetings and talks on themes pertinent to the Women’s Liberation Movement. The ‘Notice Board’ at the back of each issue advertised political gatherings, publications, etc. Editorials in each issue reflected ongoing commitments to moving beyond the constraints of the traditional ‘academic article’ format. Some articles directly addressed the relationship between ‘theory’ and ‘praxis’. Over the years different fora have provided places for political, intellectual and creative forms of writing and representation that blend the academic with the activist and artistic, and focus as much on collective communication and debate as individual analysis.</p>
<p>Early issues featured collective contributions, often focusing on topical campaigns and issues, such as the ongoing struggle for abortion rights. Others featured responses to individual articles, sometimes generating ongoing discussion/debate across a number of issues. And the ‘Letters’ section at the end of each issue allowed individuals and groups of women to write in with comments, concerns and criticisms of the journal and its contents. It was precisely there that in the early 1980s interventions by Black British feminists directly challenged the lack of attention to Black women and racism in the early years of the journal, leading the following year to a special issue on Black British Feminism, the first issue (<italic>Feminist Review</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812463663">1984</xref>) edited by an outside collective.</p>
<p>This was also the first issue with a separate section of <italic>Feminist Review</italic> dedicated to poetry. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, poems were published in the journal along with photo essays, reports from conferences and discussion about current national/international events, such as the collapse of state socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1990. <italic>Feminist Review</italic> not only reflected developments, debates and schisms within British and international feminism, but also provided a place for reflections on these. As the years have gone by, a number of authors – academics, artists, activists – have written about their perceptions of the changes in British feminism since the late 1970s when the journal was founded. The editorials, usually written by a group within the collective, sometimes with/or by outside editors, have similarly reflected upon the journal and its relationship to a wider set of political and intellectual projects called ‘feminism’, and the relationship of these to other social and political movements.</p>
<p>From the late 1990s, a ‘Dialogue’ section began to contain a number of short, intervention-style pieces, and in 2006 the current ‘Open Space’ section was initiated. Issue 84 that year was produced in the context of the war in Lebanon. As the editorial from that issue stated: ‘The need to respond to the immediacy of events in the world has prompted Feminist Review to create an online space where members of the collective present their engaged interventions. These pieces will also be printed in pages of the journal. Readers’ responses to them are welcomed and we hope to publish some of the resulting conversations in our new “Open Space”. … Our aim is to emphasize the experimental nature and openness of this section of the journal. In “Open Space” we welcome writing which does not necessarily conform to academic conventions, as well as creative writing and visual work’ (<italic>Feminist Review</italic> Collective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812463663">2006</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>For the past six years, ‘Open Space’ has continued to play this dual role of offering the opportunity for immediate reflections on the emergencies of the moment (an ongoing challenge for academic journals, which often take years between the time of submission to publication of individual articles) and work that might not pass the stringent tests applied to ‘the academic article’ in the humanities and social sciences, especially in these days of the highly competitive and overtly neoliberal Research Excellent Framework which determines funding for research activity in UK universities. Issue 100, building on, complementing and engaging with the themes introduced in Avtar Brah’s ‘The scent of memory’ and the articles responding to it, highlights the power and potential of ‘Open Space’.</p>
<p>At the same time, the collective remains alert to the risk that by providing a space for shorter, more ‘creative’ and ‘activist’ pieces, we reproduce precisely the hierarchy we aim to subvert, between ‘proper academic writing’ and its supposedly more political and less overtly theoretical ‘other’ forms. Feminist research has always been open to the accusation of unserious intellectual engagement, as has all intellectual work that challenges dominant paradigms, forms of knowledge and regimes of power. <italic>Feminist Review</italic> reflects as well, then, ongoing concerns – anxieties, even – among feminists inside and outside universities over issues of rigour and accessibility, the challenges of and responsibilities to the demands of our academic institutions, colleagues and, crucially, our own commitments to complex thinking – and to our multiple communities beyond and within the academy. It would be foolish to claim that we always strike the right balance, or avoid the traps of competition, individualism and hierarchy that characterize our contemporary capitalist world. Feminist intellectual production echoes, even as it contests, dominant ideologies. Our divergence from most other academic journals lies in our ongoing refusal to ignore these challenges, to bring them to the heart of our work as a collective, and to reflect (upon) them in the pages of the journal itself, inviting others to communicate, debate and disagree with us, as we often do among ourselves. By revisiting ‘The scent of memory’ in the political present of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812463663">2012</xref>, Issue 100 highlights once again the ongoing centrality to <italic>Feminist Review</italic> of difference – with its multiple meanings for the journal and for feminism and feminists – hoping to open new spaces within which such discussion can continue.</p>
