<abstract>
<p>As instrumental world music ensembles such as steel pan, mariachi, gamelan and West African drums are becoming more the norm than the exception in North American school music programs, there are other world music ensembles just starting to gain popularity in particular parts of the United States. The kulintang ensemble, a drum and gong ensemble that originated in the Philippines, is one example of such an ensemble. Kulintang ensembles are easily accessible to general music students because of the percussion instrumentation and repetitive patterns of melodic contour. Such ensembles may be particularly successful in areas with large Filipino American populations.</p>

<p>Many North American general music teachers are adding instrumental world music ensembles to their curricular offerings in order to enrich their students’ school music experiences. Steel pan, mariachi, gamelan, and West African drum ensembles are just a few examples of world music ensemble traditions that have become popular in United States’ school music programs.</p>
<p>Another instrumental ensemble that is gaining more popularity, particularly in areas with large Filipino American populations, is the kulintang ensemble. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311434143">Trimillos (1986)</xref> identified “Maintaining traditional musical ensembles” as one of six strategies used by Filipino Americans to maintain ethnic identity. Music teachers who serve Filipino American students may consider starting a kulintang ensemble. This gong and drum ensemble music can also be enjoyed by those who simply want to learn more about culture and music from the Philippines.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311434143">
<title>Brief History of Kulintang in the Philippines and the United States</title>
<p>The <italic>kulintang</italic> is found in the Philippines among groups of southern Muslims such as the Maranao, the Maguindanao, the Tausog, and the Manobo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311434143">Trimillos, 1986</xref>). Many of these groups traditionally considered kulintang a women’s instrument, but now both men and women play. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311434143">Posner (1980)</xref> discussed the process by which Maguindanaon children learn kulintang, “There are no teachers; the music is learned by imitation. Children in rural Cotabato hear Kulintang performances frequently as they grow up. When they are big enough to begin playing, they will attempt to imitate music they have heard” (p. 39). At the University of the Philippines today, students can major in Asian music and take kulin-tang lessons from a master kulintang performer.</p>
<p>Kulintang music was introduced to music educators in the Northwestern United States in 1976, when Danongan “Danny” Kalanduyan was brought to the University of Washington as an artist in residence. He is a master musician on kulintang who was born in the fishing village of Datu Piang in the Cotabato area of Mindanao. Kalanduyan taught a university kulintang lab performance class at the University of Washington, which was a functional performing group from 1976 through the late 1980s, when he moved to California. The instruments stayed at the university, but the program was discontinued until Pamela Costes, another native of the Philippines, arrived in 2000 to study ethnomusicology and teach another kulintang ensemble lab course. Pamela also instituted and facilitated an after-school kulintang ensemble program for Filipino American children and adolescents in the Tacoma, Washington community.</p>

<title>Kulintang Instruments</title>
<p>The instruments will be referred to by their Maguindanaoan names, which are spelled a little differently from their Maranaoan counterparts. At the front of the stage, we see the <italic>kulintang</italic>, which is the main musical instrument played in a kulintang ensemble. This instrument consists of a horizontal arrangement of a row of eight bronze or brass graduated pot gongs (each 7 to 10 inches in diameter) supported by two ropes tied end-to-end on a frame. In the southern Philippines, it is played as the main melodic instrument, usually supported by an ensemble of hanging gongs and a drum. It is played with soft but thick wooden sticks striking the boss (raised part of the gang) or just off of the boss. The gongs are not tuned to specific pitches, but rather to similar interval relationships between each of the gongs. The melodic contour is much more important than specific pitches.</p>
<p>Next to the kulintang, on the right as one faces the stage, is a chair facing a goblet-shaped drum about 2½ feet high and 12 inches in diameter. This is the <italic>dabakan</italic> that is played with long, curved rattan sticks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434143">Otto (1976)</xref> calls attention to the need for flexibility “required of the stick in order to achieve the proper ‘slapping’ technique” in which contact is make with the “underside of the sticks rather than with the ends . . . Drumming essentially involves keeping up a running patter by a rapid alternating of the sticks, with the right hand taking the lead” (p. 21).</p>
<p>Behind the kulintang and to the right, two large bossed hanging gongs are suspended by ropes on a tall crossbeam rack. These two gongs, one lower in pitch than the other, form one instrument called the <italic>agung</italic>, which may be played by one or two people. Short sticks with padding on one end are used to strike and dampen the gongs, which provide a short, repetitive rhythmic part that often follows the left hand rhythm being played by the kulintang.</p>
<p>Similar to the agung is the <italic>gandingan</italic> in that the gongs are suspended by rope on a frame. However, the gundingan consists of four thinner gongs that hang parallel to each other with the bosses facing inward in pairs to facilitate the left hand playing two gongs and the right hand playing the other two by placing each mallet between two gongs. The mallets are similar to the agung mallets. These gongs also support the kulintang through playing repetitive short rhythmic patterns.</p>
<p>A <italic>babandil</italic> is a moderate sized gong about 13 inches across (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434143">Otto, 1976</xref>, p. 22). It is the only instrument that is not essential in the ensemble and it is “unique among Moslem Filipinos, who . . . have the bubundir part in the kolintang ensembles, but no separate bubundir gong on which to render it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434143">Otto, 1976</xref>, p. 22). If the ensemble does not have this instrument available, the bubandil part can be played on the edge of one of the gundingan gongs.</p>

<title>The Music of the Filipino Kulintang</title>
<p>Kulintang melodies generally consist of a string of patterns that can be played from three to five times each. There are short transitional patterns as well that can be added between the larger melodic patterns. The role of the supporting instruments in the Maranao tradition is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311434143">Cadar and Garfias (1974)</xref>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Throughout the Maranao repertoire short Dabakan, Babandir and Agung patterns are employed, most often corresponding to one or two metric units of four beats of the Kolintang, . . . This means that, unlike the gong music of the high cultures of Indonesia, Maranao music does not rely on long or complex metric patterns for unity. It is the melody of the Kolintang which joins together the short patterns of the other instruments. (p. 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311434143">Posner (1980)</xref> provides a view of the ensemble from a Maguindanaon perspective:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An accomplished musician on kulintang, agung, or gandingan is expected to imitate other musicians and preceding performances within his own unique playing style, all while improvising new versions of the piece being played. (p. 40)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Posner also notes that children in Magnuindanaon villages learn kulintang playing through imitation of the music that they hear as part of village life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311434143">Susilo (1972)</xref> asserts that kulintang music is traditionally transmitted aurally without much verbal instruction. This aural transmission process carries over into rehearsal and performance when the leader of the ensemble plays an instrument to set the tempo (Susilo, p. 36).</p>
<p>This aural transmission process, as well as the use of percussive instruments and repeated melodic patterns, lends itself well to a general music setting. In an area where Filipino Americans reside, a music teacher could certainly reach out to the local community to discover if there is anyone who might have access to a kulintang instrument or a local musician who may be willing to help facilitate a kulintang ensemble class.</p>
