<abstract>
<p>The recent Francis report has spotlighted poor standard of care at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. It asks how this could have happened in a hospital with internal governance mechanisms and regular review from a plethora of external regulators. It further asks who is responsible and accountable for this failure.</p>
<p>The report also underscores a widely held anxiety that “mid Staffs” is not unique and such catastrophic failures in care could, and will happen again despite more enhanced regulation and scrutiny.</p>
<p>The unasked question in the report is fundamental and revealing. <bold>WHY</bold> did this happen?</p>
<p>This does not require a detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms which were designed to detect fault, but rather what was the underlying cause of these often basic care failures.</p>
<p>The thesis of this article is that four fundamental changes - 3 in the elements of service delivery and 1 in the requirements for care - have conflated to create a major problem and a service which is unable to face the demands that will increasingly be placed on it.</p>
<p>The solutions to this current dilemma require acknowledgement of these issues and transformational changes in the way we think, work and deliver healthcare.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The publication of the Francis reports reveals details surrounding the failings at a Mid-Staffordshire hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474651413486161">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474651413486161">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The report highlights deficiencies in the provision of care to patients, the failure of internal governance mechanisms within the trust to identify these failures and the lack of action to address the problems identified.</p>
<p>The report also focuses on the failure of external regulators (monitor, CQC or SHA) to recognise, communicate, or take heed of warning signs which included clear hard healthcare outcomes, such as significantly elevated standardised mortality rates) and softer intelligent information from staff, patients and the public.</p>
<p>This clear systematic failure is described as the greatest catastrophe faced by the NHS since its inception.</p>
<p>The report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474651413486161">2</xref></sup> and subsequent discussion, has focused on the how the failure of the complex, multi-layered, regulation mechanisms occurred and the apparent inability to attribute individual, corporate or system accountability for these failings.</p>
<p>There is also an implicit assumption that Mid-Staffs is a totally unique situation that only arose because of specific, local issues and failings and therefore could not be replicated in other healthcare organisations across the country. Those involved in day to day healthcare delivery however, know that this is unfortunately not the case.</p>
<p>The announcement that five, and now 14,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474651413486161">3</xref></sup> further Acute Trusts were to be immediately investigated because of abnormally high mortality rates, seamlessly followed the second Francis publication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474651413486161">2</xref></sup> giving heightened currency to the idea that the situation described at Mid-Staffs can, and will, happen again.</p>
<p>The debate so far has focused predominantly on <bold>HOW</bold> the crises happened (regulatory failings, inappropriate focus and unresponsive systems) but seems to have ignored the fundamental, and potentially much more important question of <bold>WHY</bold> it has happened.</p>
<p>The NHS, and more importantly the people who work in it, have <bold>NOT</bold> suddenly become evil, uncaring, malicious individuals impervious to suffering, and devoid of empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The NHS has <bold>NOT</bold> been transformed overnight from the index service extolled worldwide to a service that would shame any country in the developed world.</p>
<p>Many will speak, and hold responsible, the pressures of structural change and a target mentality placing the onus on access, length of stay, numbers of patients “processed” and financial sustainability. The blame for “why” has already been placed at the door of the NHS managers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474651413486161">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no doubt that these pressures have presented real challenges, placed incredible stress on the system and individuals and created an environment which could be seen as primarily focused on the efficiency of the system rather than the quality of individual patient care. However, it can also be argued that the very significant reduction in rates of hospital acquired infection, the reduction in waiting lists times to less than 18 weeks and the aspiration to reduce waiting times in A&amp;E are real achievements with a focus on improving outcomes for the patient.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the labelling of these system and process changes as the genesis of all that is currently wrong with the direct delivery of patient care is over simplistic and misses, or ignores, the significance of 4 seismic, seemingly unconnected changes, which have fundamentally altered, and potentially fatally wounded, the very essence of UK healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>Although these initiatives, individually, had laudable intent, together they have conflated to produce a problem that is much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>This situation may in fact be one of the most dramatic societal exemplars of the law of unintentional consequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474651413486161">5</xref></sup> where four changes have aligned to create a “high risk” black hole into which the NHS has fallen and is currently trapped.</p>
<p>Identifying, and discussing these changes, is not intended as a lament for a halcyon time for healthcare, which has never really existed. Nor is it a rallying call for a return to the old days, or a nihilistic pronouncement on the irredeemable nature of the present position. It is an attempt to recognise the causes of the wide spread problems that we now face. These will not be cured by wishing them away, ignoring them or simply increasing the surveillance and penalty for failure.</p>
<p>A more radical change is needed to address these issues and create a healthcare system where these failings cannot occur and where good, consistent and compassionate care is hardwired into the system, the culture of all organisations and individuals. The ingredients for such a utopia are well described by Fred Lee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474651413486161">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Historical changes</title>
<p>To contextualise the impact of these four changes we must briefly consider the historical perspective.</p>
<p>The “past” system had faults, was open to abuse and took a considerable personal toll. There is also little doubt that this was a system, which by today’s standards, would not be considered patient focused.</p>
<p>It was however a system that encompassed essential elements of care that have been lost in the iterative process of change, unintentionally resulting in a weaker not stronger whole.</p>
<p><bold>Primary care (GPs)</bold> provided care with a cradle-to-grave continuity. There was 24/7 care provide by GPs who were clear that they were responsible for the patients overall care and who embraced their role as gatekeepers of the NHS service.</p>
<p><bold>Hospital consultants</bold> were general physicians with a specialist interest. They were responsible for all patients admitted under their care throughout their stay in hospital. The consultant provided leadership and support to a ‘<bold>FIRM’</bold> of junior doctors. The FIRM delivered continuity of care to” their” patients on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>J<bold>unior doctors</bold> were integral members of a clearly defined medical FIRM. The FIRM was “operationally” led, on a day to day basis, by a highly experienced <bold>Senior Registrar</bold>, which was a highly effective sub/junior consultant grade. The FIRM provided 24/7 medical care, from admission to discharge, to all patients admitted under the firm.</p>
<p><bold>Experienced nurses</bold>, led by “<bold>Sister</bold>”, were accountable for the care of all patients on a ward. Patients were commonly located on one ward for their entire medical stay in hospital. The nursing team provided a high continuity of care, taking responsibility for the patient 24/7. Ward Sisters were directly accountable to the <bold>Hospital Matron</bold> who was in turn responsible for all nursing care in the hospital.</p>
<p><bold>Patients</bold> were most commonly between 50-70 years of age, predominantly suffering from acute medical problems (renal, cardiac, respiratory or gastroenterological) that required specific medical interventions and well defined nursing needs.</p>

<title>The four horsemen of the apocalypse: “What have they changed?</title>
<sec id="section6-1474651413486161">
<title>Death: Changes in nursing</title>
<p>Project 2000 was a project designed to improve nursing standards in the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474651413486161">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It sought to increase the academic base of nursing, converting it to a degree qualification profession. It removed student nurses from hospital wards, where it was argued that they had been used for service delivery rather than expanding on an educational experience. Teaching was now delivered as part of structured, classroom based learning. Nurse training had consciously moved from an apprenticeship model to a process of academic certification.</p>
<p>The disappearance of student nurses dramatically reduced the number of “nursing staff” on the ward, increasing pressure on qualified staff. Newly qualified nurses, although more academically qualified, lacked the direct experience of clinical practise, and required more support and supervision, placing further pressure on existing staff.</p>
<p>The historical post of SEN - staff that had focused on the direct delivery of patient care - was disbanded. Incumbent SENs undertook a conversion course to become SRNs, or became healthcare assistants, or left the nursing profession completely. This generated an experience drain and further reduced “qualified” manpower.</p>
<p>The situation was further exacerbated by the increased demand on nurses to shoulder an increasing share of technical, administrative and regulatory duties on the ward. This further eroded the time available for nurses to deliver direct patient care.</p>
<p>Project 2000, which was designed to improve nursing standards, actually undermined the ability and resilience of the nursing work force by removing both expertise and manpower. This created a capacity and capability gap, which impacted on patient care and was the first step in the creation of the new “‘Care Gap’”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1474651413486161">
<title>Famine: The junior doctors</title>
<p>The historical structure of medical training resulted in young doctors working very long hours. The average junior doctor usually worked in excess of 80 hours per week, but often up to 120 hours. This was understandably recognised as unsafe, unacceptable and unsustainable.</p>
<p>It was also argued that a focus on service delivery, although consistent with an apprentice model of training, was not consistent with a skill-based, modern learning approach. Junior doctors were to be considered as “doctors in training” and only exposed to tasks with demonstrable “learning” value.</p>
<p>The EWTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474651413486161">9</xref></sup> dictated that no junior doctor should work for more than 48 hours per week. The number of hours worked, and rest period required, in any particular “session” were clearly defined. Although the introduction of EWTD was staggered over a number of years, the overall effect was to substantially reduce the capacity of the medical workforce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474651413486161">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compliance with EWTD required the introduction of full shift working for junior doctors, and effectively destroyed the traditional medical FIRM structure. This had a number of significant consequences which are recorded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474651413486161">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The reduced reliance on junior doctors for service provision (capacity gap), combined with their reduced experience (capability gap) further widened the “‘Care Gap’” that had already appeared as a consequence of the changes in nursing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1474651413486161">
<title>War: Consultants and GPs</title>
<sec id="section9-1474651413486161">
<title>Consultants</title>
<p>The change in nursing and junior doctor working (capacity and capability gaps), have made a generally poorly recognised, or acknowledged, demands for a change in the traditional model of consultant working to avoid further widening of the patient “‘Care Gap’”. This is particularly, but not exclusively, related to the provision of emergency (unscheduled) medical, and in-patient, care.</p>
<p>This has prompted a call for a move from the traditional consultant-<bold>led</bold> healthcare to a more innovative, but challenging, consultant-<bold>delivered</bold> service model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474651413486161">11</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1474651413486161">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1474651413486161">7</xref>).</p>
<p>The momentum for this change has been precipitated by the changes in the working practise of others. Although the initiative was initially in the hands of the profession, response has been slow or even absent. Mid- Staffs has now placed the initiative in the powerful hands of growing public and political expectation.</p>
<p>Increased consultant specialisation also represented a growing professional force which has significantly affected the traditional consultant role and impacted on service delivery. There has been an understandable general enthusiasm (professional, public and political) for consultants to increase their level of specialisation and expertise to enable high quality specialist services.</p>
<p>This was initially manifest by consultants being appointed as general physicians with “a specific” interest, but has rapidly morphed into a professional landslide with consultants increasingly becoming singularly accredited in one specific area of medicine (e.g. cardiology) and not in general medicine. This has created a number of predicted problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474651413486161">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst specialists have increased competency and expertise in some areas, they have inevitably become de-skilled and less confident in other areas of general medicine. This has resulted in an increase in consultant-to-consultant referral rates of patients, determined not to have a problem related to a particular consultant’s speciality. Conversely, non-specialists have become de-skilled in certain areas of specialist medicine and therefore have increased rates of consultant-to-consultant referral of patients for specialist review. This has increased consultant-to-consultant referrals. Outpatient activity generated by internal referrals ranges from the national average of 21% up to 60% in some trusts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474651413486161">13</xref></sup> This practice has decreased the continuity of care and obscured the lines of professional responsibility for individual patients.</p>
<p>There is also a reduction in the number of consultants capable, and willing, to provide acute general medical care. Many argue that their particular skill set does not add value to the patients now most commonly seen on the acute medical service (see 4th Horseman).</p>
<p>The pressure of acute medicine therefore falls on a shrinking population of doctors. The recognition of this issue has resulted in a national initiative to develop a new speciality of “acute medicine”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474651413486161">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a clear disconnect between the direction of development of the profession, the expectation of the wider public and the actual needs of a majority of patients now presenting to acute district general hospitals. This has made a further contribution to the now very wide ‘‘Care Gap’’.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474651413486161">
<title>GPs</title>
<p>The world of Primary Care has undergone numerous and radical changes. Arguably the most significant was the renegotiation of the employment contract that allowed GPs to opt out of the provision of 24/7 care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474651413486161">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474651413486161">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The option of “opt out” was taken by a majority of GP practices. Emergency (out-of-hours) care is now provided by out-of-hours companies and contracted GPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474651413486161">17</xref></sup> These doctors have no relationship with the patients they are asked to see, poor sight of their past medical histories or social context. The decisions made on further care, in the acute situation, are therefore often based on incomplete information, and the adopted default position is understandably referral to the Acute Trust. Furthermore, the out-of-hours doctors have no on-going contact with, or clear responsibility for, the patient that they see or the decisions they make.</p>
<p>The essence and spirit of primary care has changed. The intrinsic connection between the community, the GP and the patients has been weakened (or lost). This is manifest by the marked reduction in the number of GP partners and a move in many practices towards salaried GPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474651413486161">18</xref></sup> This may well be a metaphor for the move from vocation to occupation.</p>
<p>For patients, this has had a dramatic effect on the continuity of care and has obscured the attribution of on-going professional responsibility and accountability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474651413486161">
<title>Plague: The population</title>
<p>The change in the population demographic is well known, with a rapid rise in the number of older people, particularly those over 75. This change has unsurprisingly been transferred into the healthcare setting. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of older patients admitted as emergency admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474651413486161">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a medium-sized DGH there may be 30-50 unscheduled medical admissions per day. In large metropolitan hospitals there may be as many as 100-200 patients admitted in a 24hr period. The demographics of the population and their medical complaints have also changed considerably in recent years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474651413486161">Table 3</xref>). The most common admission (and re-admission) diagnoses are for heart failure and COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474651413486161">20</xref></sup> The third most common admission diagnosis is UTI, but this diagnosis often used in an acute setting to explain the presentation of elderly patients with confusion and non-specific symptoms.</p>

<p>Older patients understandably exhibit high levels of frailty, with complex co-morbidities being the norm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474651413486161">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474651413486161">20</xref></sup> While the nursing care required by these patients is often very high, the actual medical conditions, and their treatment, are often less complex. Many patients’ prime need is for social services support.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that an acute medical setting is not the most appropriate environment for a majority of these older patients and alternative environments, which are able to focus on the delivery of appropriate care, must be developed with some urgency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474651413486161">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474651413486161">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>The creation of the apocalypse</title>
<p>The four horsemen have, albeit unwittingly, conspired to create the ingredients for the apocalypse (<bold>‘Care Gap</bold>’).</p>
<p>A changing population demographic, with an increasingly aged and frail population, who present with conditions that would in the most part be best served by a community based healthcare model. The care in this setting would be directed by appropriate and agreed “care plans” with support and timely medical interventions delivered, with a high level of continuity, by primary and social care. However, at the very time of increasing need, primary care finds itself unable to rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>GP-led primary care is fragmented, lacking the essential element of continuity of patient care and with obscured lines of professional responsibility. The essential health service “gatekeeper” function of GPs, that was previously implicit and is now imperative, has been lost.</p>
<p>This “tension” between the demand on primary care and its inability to deliver, has by default increased the referral of patients to, and the pressure on, Acute Trusts.</p>
<p>There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of unscheduled admission of older patients to acute hospitals. This includes an increase in the number of patients being admitted on a recurrent basis (re-admissions)| and also being referred from nursing and care homes. The most common reasons for admission relate to a decline in a long term chronic conditions, conditions complicating dementia, and end of life care issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474651413486161">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474651413486161">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acute hospitals should have been able to provide the care needed by older and frailer patients, but the magnitude of demand and changes in both medical and nursing professions conspired to prevent this challenge being successfully addressed.</p>
<p>Changes in nursing training have exposed deficiencies in the skills of providing basic care and blunted the elements of compassion and empathy. Ironically it is these elements of basic care that have become the prime, and most essential, requirement of the increasingly dependent patient population. Nursing re-structure has also obscured the line of accountability and diluted the concept of professional and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Junior doctors increasingly work in relative isolation, often as part of a “virtual” team. Their main focus has become the solving of the immediate medical problem, which is often non-specific and only a symptom of a more profound and far reaching societal malady. The full shift-working pattern of junior doctors has undermined continuity of care and obscured the issue of professional and personal accountability and responsibility.</p>
<p>Consultants have undertaken more specialist functions generating a gap in the provision of general acute medical care. There is an increased trend for patients to be referred between consultants, to obtain specialist inputs. This has had a marked effect on the continuity of care, and has generated a focus on solving the “immediate problem”, diminishing the provision of true holistic care. Furthermore, the involvement of a number of consultants in a patients’ care makes the direct line of consultant responsibility and accountability difficult to follow and attribute.</p>
<p>The change in junior doctors’ working hours has created an implicit requirement for a 24/7 consultant-delivered service. This has not been universally recognised or acknowledged. Although there have been changes in consultant working patterns in some areas, there remains a <bold>‘Care Gap’</bold> in which patient care is seriously at risk.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses have suffered a profound loss of the sense of belonging, challenges to professional pride and sense of purpose.</p>
<p>The very real impact on the morale and spirit of essential frontline staff further, and perhaps most significantly, jeopardises the provision of effective and safe patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474651413486161">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although it is tempting to speculate that increased regulation may prevent another Mid-Staffs occurring, in truth all that it will ensure is that the inevitable failure will potentially be spotted earlier and someone will be held to account.
