<title>United States</title>
<p>The recent economic indicators emanating from the United States have been mixed. Labour market indicators have generally been more favourable than output measures. According to the advance estimate, GDP increased at an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, following growth of 3 per cent in the final quarter of last year. Over this same period, the unemployment rate dropped by 0.8 percentage points, reaching 8.2 per cent in March. Inflation, as measured by the consumer expenditure deflator, remains relatively moderate, at 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, despite the recent rise in the oil price. Imported inflation has been partly offset by the recent appreciation of the dollar, which has risen by 4.8 per cent in effective terms since the first half of 2011. Share prices have continued their upward trajectory, but the housing market remains a significant drag on the economy and fiscal tightening acts as a further restraint on growth prospects. The budget for 2012 includes fiscal tightening measures worth 1 1/2 per cent of GDP. This is expected to restrain growth to 2.1 per cent this year, just below our estimate of trend growth in the US of about 2 1/4 per cent per annum. We expect GDP growth to rise above capacity rates from 2013, allowing a gradual narrowing of the output gap over the medium-term horizon.</p>
<p>Fiscal uncertainty remains a risk to the outlook, which is unlikely to be resolved before the presidential election in November. Our forecast is based on the assumption that ‘temporary’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-002795011222000105">2</xref></sup> tax cuts due to expire in 2013 are extended, but are withdrawn gradually over the next ten years. If policymakers fail to agree to an extension of these tax cuts, this would raise the tax burden by 0.7-1.2 per cent of GDP according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, and significantly dampen the prospects for growth next year. Just prior to the downgrade of US sovereign debt in August of last year, a bipartisan ‘Super Committee’ was set up with a mandate to agree a fiscal programme that would save at least $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. The committee failed to come to an agreement by the specified date last November, which triggers automatic spending cuts in 2013. The automatic cuts are intended to be binding regardless of the outcome of the presidential election in November 2012. However, we assume that the automatic spending cuts will be eased in as gradually as possible, with $20 billion (about 1/2 per cent of GDP) in spending cuts per annum expected over the next ten years. A more rapid adjustment would again have consequences for growth prospects in the short term.</p>
<p>At the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on 25 April, the FOMC reaffirmed its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy, with exceptionally low interest rates anticipated until at least late 2014. The summary of projections by committee members points to a 1/4 point rise in interest rates in early 2013, but the federal fund rate is not expected to reach 1 per cent until the second half of 2014. In line with this, long-term nominal and real interest rates remain exceptionally low. However, the household sector has not benefited from the low rate of interest in the US due to the severe difficulties in the US housing market.</p>
<p>The US mortgage market is dominated by fixed-rate mortgages, so mortgage payments have not come down as much as in countries such as the UK, where floating rate mortgages are more common, in response to the ultra-loose monetary stance. Nationwide house prices have fallen by at least 20 per cent since their peak in 2006, which has pushed the average loan-to-value ratio towards 70 per cent, well above its historical average since 1970.</p>
<p>Currently about 12 million homeowners (roughly 1 in 5 homes with a mortgage) are suffering from negative equity or underwater mortgages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-002795011222000105">BGRFS, 2012</xref>). This has been associated with a sharp rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and a further tightening of bank lending conditions. The overhang of foreclosed homes may push average house prices down even further. In addition, negative equity impinges on labour mobility, a key factor that has supported the flexibility of the US labour market. This can be expected to restrain the recovery in the labour market, and we do not expect the unemployment rate to fall much below 6 per cent over our medium-term horizon. Prior to the financial crisis, an unemployment rate of not more than 5 per cent was generally viewed as sustainable.</p>
<p>The high rate of mortgage default has forced some internal rebalancing in the US, and real household debt has declined steadily since the onset of recession in 2008. This is in contrast to developments in most other major economies.</p>

<sec id="section2-002795011222000105">
<title>Canada</title>
<p>Recovery of the Canadian economy from the recession and the financial crisis is relatively advanced compared to most other economies, and Canadian policymakers retain a relatively broad range of instruments to respond to adverse economic conditions should the outlook deteriorate. The United States is Canada's largest trading partner by far, and the moderate expansion forecast for the US offers stability to the Canadian outlook. In addition, increasing commodity prices will act as a boost to growth prospects.</p>
<p>Internally, the economy is in need of some rebalancing of demand, which will moderate the pace of economic expansion to some extent in the near term. A substantial fiscal stimulus in the crisis years came at the price of a budget deficit that reached 5 1/2 per cent of GDP in 2010. Tightening measures and the cyclical recovery reduced the deficit by 1 per cent of GDP last year, and we expect the deficit to narrow further to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2012. Despite its strong resource and energy exports, Canada has persistently exhibited a trade balance deficit since the economic crisis in 2009. However, our forecast sees a decline in the current account deficit, from 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2011 towards 1 per cent of GDP by 2014.</p>
<p>We forecast GDP growth of about 2 per cent this year, with an acceleration to an average of 2 1/2 per cent per annum from 2013. The national growth rates, however, conceal the fact that Canada's economic development is very uneven across the regions. Higher commodity prices have accelerated growth in the oil producing and mining regions in the West while the most populous province, Ontario, traditionally a manufacturing region, is growing at about half the pace. The unemployment rate is expected to remain flat at about 7.3 per cent in 2012–13, but again the pattern is uneven across regions.</p>
<p>The key downside risks to the Canadian forecast include an exacerbation of the Euro Area crisis and a collapse of the housing boom. While Canada is not directly exposed to the Euro Area banking system to a significant degree, it is closely intertwined with the financial system of the US and so indirectly exposed to developments in Europe. The housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver in particular have been partly driven by foreign speculation and may be vulnerable to a downturn in sentiment. A sharp drop in house prices would weigh on consumer spending and put pressure on the banking system.</p>

<sec id="section3-002795011222000105">
<title>Brazil</title>
<p>Growth in Brazil has been highly volatile since the onset of the financial crisis. Following a decline of 0.3 per cent in 2009, the economy expanded by 7.5 per cent in 2010, before slowing sharply to 2.7 per cent last year. Looking ahead, we forecast GDP growth to stabilise at a more sustainable rate, with GDP expected to rise by about 3 1/2 per cent this year and 4–4 1/4 per cent per annum over the forecast horizon to 2018.</p>
<p>Commodity exports remain vulnerable to a slowdown in China, but the recent depreciation of the real will help regain competitiveness and support export demand. A more worrying development is the rise in protectionist policies in Brazil, through higher import tariffs and taxes on foreign investment, in an attempt to combat the widening of the trade and current account deficit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-002795011222000105">figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In response to the slowdown in growth, the central bank decided to cut its key interest rate, the Selic rate, for a sixth consecutive time since August 2011, to 9 per cent. The committee has signalled that it may consider further interest rate cuts given the right conditions, allowing the key interest rate to fall below the historic low of 8.75 per cent. Following a spike of inflation in the second half of 2011, inflationary pressures are receding. Our forecast incorporates a moderation in inflation to 5 1/2 per cent in 2012 and 4 1/2 per cent in 2013 and 2014, from 6.6 per cent in 2011.</p>

<sec id="section4-002795011222000105">
<title>Japan</title>
<p>After a disappointing outturn for GDP growth in the last quarter of 2011, which saw the economy contract by 0.2 per cent, the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be more favourable. Output is expected to grow, with all the components of domestic demand supported by the reconstruction programme after the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<p>The trade balance recorded a deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP last year, which was the first deficit on an annual basis since 1980. The current account balance, however, remained in surplus, as 30 years of running trade surpluses has allowed Japan to accumulate a significant stock of foreign assets that far exceeds the economy's external liabilities. In addition, the positive differential between the average rate of return received on external assets relative to that paid on liabilities allowed net external interest income to reach 3 per cent of GDP last year. Nonetheless, the trade deficit focuses attention on Japan's current account balance, and makes us ask under what conditions this could translate into a current account deficit.</p>
<p>A permanent current account deficit in Japan could have serious consequences for the economy. Japan would need to seek overseas funding to service the nation's extreme debt burden, which in turn could lead to an increase in bond yields and sharply raise the cost of servicing this debt. Although foreign investors currently hold only a very small proportion of Japanese government bonds (around 6.7 per cent at the end of 2011), they account for a share in the secondary trading market that is sufficient to have an impact on interest rate formation in the market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-002795011222000105">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Up to the mid 1990s, trade and current account balances in Japan exhibited very close co-movements, but over the past fifteen years their pattern started to diverge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-002795011222000105">Figure 7</xref> plots the difference between the current account and trade balances as a per cent of GDP since 1965, and indicates around a 3 percentage point gap in the past few years. The steady rise in this gap since the late 1990s reflects the increase in net interest income.</p>
<fig id="fig7-002795011222000105" position="float">
<label>Figure 7.</label>
<caption><p>Gap between Japanese current account and trade balances</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000105-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The current Japanese trade deficit is driven by the simultaneous contraction in export volumes and increase in import penetration. The slowdown in global demand and appreciation of the yen reduced demand for Japanese exports, while floods in Thailand caused a disruption in the supply chain that exacerbated the negative effect on exports. At the same time, shutting down all but one of its nuclear reactors increased Japan's dependency on imported energy and hence substantially increased its import volumes. It is not yet clear whether some of the nuclear power stations will eventually be restarted, or whether the government will seek alternative energy sources (which could take years to put into place).</p>
<p>Our baseline scenario for this year envisages that import volumes will remain high. Exports are expected to improve this year from the lows in 2011, but to grow by less than imports. As a result, we project the trade balance to remain in deficit this year, but expect the current account balance to stay in surplus, supported by the positive contribution from net income.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the potential risks around our central projections for Japan's current account, we undertook a series of simulations using the National Institute's model, NiGEM. We look at the expected impacts from a permanent increase of $20 per barrel in oil prices, a permanent appreciation of the Japanese yen of about 5 per cent and a permanent increase in import volumes of about 8 per cent. The yen appreciation is driven by monetary loosening in the rest of the world, while the increase in import volumes is based on the assumption that the energy supply that was previously generated by the nuclear power stations has to be imported on a permanent basis. This accounts for a quarter of total energy use in Japan. We run each component separately before combining the three elements to examine the potential effects in aggregate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-002795011222000105">Figure 8</xref> illustrates projections for the current account balance as a per cent of GDP under these different scenarios, including our baseline projection. The appreciation of the yen and increase in oil prices on their own would not be expected to lead to a significant current account deficit in Japan, but would push the balance close to zero this year and next. In the case of a yen appreciation, the stimulus from expansionary monetary policy in the rest of the world has a positive effect on Japanese exports through the demand channel, largely offsetting the loss of competitiveness from the rising yen.</p>

<caption><p>Japanese current account balance under alternative scenarios</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000105-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>An increase in oil prices has a negative effect on output in oil consuming countries. As Japan's primary trading partners are generally oil importing nations, this leads to a loss of external demand, compounding the direct impact of an increase in oil prices on the Japanese economy. A rise in the oil price also induces a negative terms of trade shock, which has an additional transitory negative impact on the current account balance. In response to both the 5 per cent yen appreciation and $20 rise in the oil price, we would expect Japan's current account balance to worsen by 1/4-1/2 per cent of GDP in the first year relative to the baseline.</p>
<p>In the third scenario, the increase in imports initially causes the trade balance to fall significantly, and we would expect the current account balance to fall into deficit for at least three years. Over the longer term, we would expect some degree of exchange rate adjustment in Japan to offset the decline in output, allowing part of the current account deterioration to be reversed.</p>
<p>If all three of the above scenarios were to materialise simultaneously, we would expect Japan's current account balance to deteriorate by at least 2 per cent of GDP relative to our baseline, with a sizeable deficit persisting over the medium-term horizon.</p>
<p>In the medium term, the Japanese economy faces many challenges: energy shortages, deflation, an appreciating currency, a widening fiscal deficit and the highest government debt to GDP ratio in the world. The speed of fiscal adjustment will be an important determinant of short- to medium-term growth prospects. Our forecast allows for a gradual fiscal tightening, which will restrain domestic demand growth over the next several years. The economy is unlikely to grow by more than 1 1/2 per cent per annum over the period 2013–18.</p>

<title>China and India</title>
<p>The deceleration in the rate of growth of Chinese production observed over the past year continued into the first quarter of 2012, with GDP recording 8.1 per cent year-on-year growth, compared with annual growth of 9.3 per cent in 2011 and 10.4 per cent in 2010. The slowdown has been driven by both external and domestic factors. The Chinese government has recently lowered its medium-term target for GDP growth to 7.5 per cent per annum, reflecting a moderation in underlying potential growth and acknowledging the need for rebalancing of the economy, allowing the rate of investment to stabilise at more sustainable levels while supporting the expansion of consumption.</p>
<p>The ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP in China was around 45 per cent in 2010, the second highest in the world according to World Bank estimates. In general, during a period of economic catch-up we should expect a significantly higher rate of investment compared to that in advanced economies. However, a comparison of the Chinese investment ratio in 2010 to that of South Korea and Japan in 1990 — when rapid economic catchup more or less came to an end in the latter two countries — shows that it is still much greater than expected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-002795011222000105">figure 9</xref>). If China were to reach the investment to GDP ratio observed in the developed economies it would need to roughly halve the current ratio, which will require an extended period of adjustment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Heavy reliance on investment and particularly on real estate investment increases the vulnerability of the economy. It is estimated that 30–45 per cent of loans in the five major banks in China have property in collateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-002795011222000105">IMF, 2011</xref>). A big drop in real estate prices will reduce collateral values and could lead to a rise in default and non-performing loans. This in turn poses a danger for the economy as a whole, as both bank assets and loans have increased significantly over the past several years. The asset to GDP ratio in the four major banks reached 150 per cent in 2011, from 85 per cent in 2005, with half of the rise attributed to an increase in loans.</p>
<p>In order to assess the sensitivity of the Chinese economy to a tightening of bank lending conditions, we ran a simulation using the National Institute's model, NiGEM, in which we raise the effective cost of private sector borrowing by 1 percentage point permanently. We recognise that China's banking system does not react to price signals alone, but this forms the basis for comparison. We apply a similar shock to India and the USA as a comparison. The estimate effects are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-002795011222000105">figure 10</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig10-002795011222000105" position="float">
<label>Figure 10.</label>
<caption><p>Effect of tightening of bank lending conditions on GDP</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000105-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The results of our simulation suggest that a 1 percentage point rise in borrowing costs (or an equivalent tightening of lending conditions) would reduce the level of potential output in China by 0.6 per cent in the medium term. The magnitude of the effect is about triple that in the US in the medium term, and about twice that in India. To a large extent, this reflects differences in the investment to GDP ratios in the three countries, which make China more vulnerable to investment shocks.</p>
<p>Output growth in India is expected to decelerate marginally this year, to just less than 7 per cent. The rise in the oil price can be expected to restrain growth prospects this year, and the economy has limited scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus as it operates with twin fiscal and current account deficits. In addition, the economy suffers from a lack of economic reforms due to deadlocks in government.</p>
<p>Oil prices play an important role in the Indian economy, although it has a relatively low oil intensity of output (about half that of China). India's high import dependency for energy leads to a widening current account deficit every time the oil price rises. On the fiscal front, rising oil prices present a problem to the government, as they push up the cost of fuel subsidies, leading to a further deterioration of the fiscal deficit. On the other hand, introducing a cap on fuel subsidies during periods of high and rising oil prices is politically difficult to implement, due to the burden it would place on households. Further rises in oil prices and a depreciation of the rupee create an upside risk to inflation, limiting the scope for monetary easing to stimulate demand.</p>

<sec id="section6-002795011222000105">
<title>Russia</title>
<p>Although Russia's economic growth remains driven mainly by its energy exports, a transformation of the economy towards more internally driven growth has started to emerge. We expect a substantial trend towards import substitution and thus higher domestic demand in the long run. We forecast a narrowing of the trade surplus from an estimated 9 per cent of GDP in 2012 towards 7 1/2 per cent of GDP in 2014.</p>
<p>According to a recent report of the International Energy Agency, Russia became the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas in 2010. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-002795011222000105">Figure 11</xref> shows our forecast for GDP growth in 2012–16, and the share that can be attributed to the rise in the oil price since January. This contribution is derived from a scenario study using the National Institute's model, NiGEM. The $10 rise in the oil price since January is expected to add 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth in Russia both this year and next.</p>

</fig>
<p>Russia, which saw its GDP contract by over 7 1/2 per cent in 2009, regained pre-crisis levels of output in the last quarter of 2011. Despite a significant fiscal stimulus prior to the presidential elections in March of this year, 2012 will see a cooling of economic activity due to weak domestic demand. We estimate that the Russian economy will expand by 3.9 per cent in 2012. Over the longer term, Russia has the capacity to expand by about 4 per cent per annum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-002795011222000105">
<title>European Union</title>
<p>We continue to expect a recession in the Euro Area this year. Real GDP growth should then slowly improve, to about 1 per cent in 2013 and 1.6 per cent in 2014.</p>
<p>Several factors shape the macro situation in Europe at present. On the one hand, momentum has weakened; the final quarter of last year saw GDP in the Euro Area contract by 0.3 per cent due to uncertainty regarding a possible credit crunch and the limited ability of banks to issue bonds, especially in crisis countries. In addition, the global economy has softened. The interplay between the fragile banking sector, difficulties in the sovereign bond markets and a decline in competitiveness continues to weigh on the outlook.</p>
<p>The current strategy of front-loaded fiscal consolidation being pursued in peripheral Euro Area countries does not appear to have been successful in any of its key objectives — restoring financial market confidence, putting countries on a sustainable fiscal path, or laying the foundations for sustained growth and recovery. Particularly in Spain there must be significant questions about the economic and political viability of current policies, which in turn pose a significant downside risk to the forecast. As discussed in the <italic>World Overview</italic>, the empirical links between fiscal balances and government borrowing premia are not strong enough to warrant the current fiscal stance in Europe. Nonetheless, financial markets have started to display some initial signs of stabilisation. The equity markets have strengthened and the liquidity measures introduced by the ECB have provided some temporary relief.</p>
<p>The growth among individual members of the Euro Area remain exceptionally wide, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-002795011222000105">figure 12</xref>, providing a major challenge for policy. The Southern European economies continue to contract sharply. We forecast that the Greek economy will decline by 5 3/4 per cent this year, which will mark the fourth consecutive year of contraction. Portugal is expected to contract by 3 1/2 per cent. The recessions in Spain and Italy will be slightly shallower, at 1.8 and 1.5 per cent, respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the other hand, Germany, Austria, Finland, Ireland and the new members of the Euro Area, Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia, are forecast to perform somewhat better. In particular, we expect Germany to continue to be the driver of the European economy, with growth this year of 0.6 per cent. Economic activity in the Netherlands, Belgium and France is expected to be broadly flat.</p>
<p>Funding conditions at European banks have improved following special policy measures introduced by the ECB. The provision of liquidity with a maturity of three years (LTRO)and the broadening of eligible collateral, as well as the swap line agreement with the US, have eased the funding pressures on banks and helped to avoid a credit crunch.</p>
<p>Despite initial concerns, bank recapitalisation as required by the European Banking Authority has been progressing smoothly and with only limited recourse to deleveraging. Bank strategies to close capital shortfalls and reach the target ratio of 9 per cent core Tier 1 capital by June 2012 have relied predominantly on capital measures rather than asset shedding. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, 77 per cent of planned capital measures rely on new capital and reserves, conversion of hybrids and issuance of convertible bonds, and retained earnings, while only the remaining 23 per cent rely on risk weighted asset (RWA) adjustments and the shedding of assets.</p>
<p>The negative consequences for growth, therefore, have not been as severe as suggested, for example, in the scenarios of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-002795011222000105">Euroframe (2012)</xref>. Although credit conditions have tightened, credit supply is not perceived as a major drag on growth, as demand for credit remains relatively weak. However, credit supply conditions and credit growth differ strongly across member states. Credit to the non-financial sector has been rising in Germany and the Netherlands, and declining in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-002795011222000105">ECB, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As a part of the ‘Six-Pack’, a comprehensive set of rules reinforcing the monitoring and surveillance of macroeconomic and fiscal policies in the EU-27, the European Commission has adopted the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. It is based on a scoreboard and aims to identify “countries for which an in-depth review is necessary”. One of the monitored indicators is a 3-year average of the current account balance as a per cent of GDP, which has an asymmetrical threshold of +6 and −4 per cent of GDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-002795011222000105">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>While current account differences may be attributed to natural catching-up processes and demographic determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000105">ECB, 2005</xref>), they may also reflect the path of capital inflows from the more mature economies. In some cases current account imbalances have reached rather unsustainable levels, reflecting divergences in competitiveness and productivity. In a monetary union, when the automatic stabilising mechanism of the exchange rate channel is absent, an internal adjustment in relative unit labour costs to reflect productivity differentials is needed in order to maintain stable current account balances or adjust imbalances. However, with largely national labour markets this process of adjustment may take a long time.</p>
<p>An internal devaluation can be effected through adjustments in wages and prices in the current account deficit countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-002795011222000105">5</xref></sup> However, price competitiveness explains only a part of current account developments. Export flows are increasingly affected by globalisation of production and rapid technological advances, with foreign consumers becoming more discerning with regard to quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000105">ECB, 2005</xref>). Technological innovation (measured by R&amp;D intensity and patents) has been an important factor in boosting export demand. This suggests that adjustments in intra Euro Area current accounts should also be effected via improvements in technological competitiveness and structural deregulation of the current account deficit countries.</p>
<p>The structural competitiveness of an economy is defined through a set of characteristics that may determine its export performance, including the stock of human capital, infrastructure, and the legal and institutional framework, notably of labour markets and taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000105">ECB, 2005</xref>). The business environment in which firms operate may partly explain current account balances for some of the Euro Area countries. The Southern European countries have started implementing various structural reforms, such as the rationalisation of public enterprises, that may help rebalance current accounts in Europe over the medium term. Not every deficit country requires the same reforms, and country-specific programmes should be designed.</p>
<p>The European Commission's exercise of monitoring current accounts within the Euro Area is very welcome. However, it is important to avoid imposing limits on improvements to individual countries' competitiveness. Therefore, we should be very cautious when setting an upper threshold on the current account balance. This could discourage innovation and growth and shift global market share away from Europe.</p>

<title>Germany</title>
<p>Domestic demand in Germany expanded by 2.4 per cent in 2011, supported by a strong rise in private consumption, and robust growth in both housing and business investment. Household consumption grew by 1.4 per cent, the largest increase since 2006, supported by a strong labour market, with the unemployment rate reaching 5.7 per cent, its lowest level since German unification in 1991.</p>
<p>However, the German economy slowed down significantly at the turn of the year. The final quarter of last year saw GDP contracting by 0.2 per cent in quarterly terms. We maintain our January forecast for German GDP growth for this year and next and forecast that, in light of the slowdown in global trade growth, the highly export-oriented German economy will expand by just 0.6 per cent in 2012. An acceleration to 1.5 per cent growth is forecast for 2013.</p>
<p>While the external environment will act as a drag on the German economy, domestic demand is expected to continue to drive the expansion. One of the key factors behind the strength of domestic demand is the extraordinarily low interest rates, which are expected to stimulate private investment. The low interest rates in conjunction with an unprecedentedly favourable situation in the labour market should continue to fuel consumption growth.</p>
<p>The labour market remains resilient and the unemployment rate continues to decline. Employment has expanded by at least 0.3 per cent per quarter since early 2010. As discussed in the July 2011 and January 2012 <italic>Reviews</italic>, the economy has already started showing some labour force shortages, especially for highly skilled workers. The demand for engineers, nurses and carers has been met by foreign workers to some extent. Strong employment growth has been accompanied by increased immigration from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Southern European countries. Most of the new foreign workers have arrived from the eight countries that gained full access to the German labour market in May 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-002795011222000105">6</xref></sup> Mobile workers from Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal also accounted for about 10 per cent of net immigration. The free mobility of labour within the European Union has the potential to smooth the process of rebalancing European growth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-002795011222000105">Figure 14</xref> shows unemployment rates in Germany and the four Southern European countries. The relative positions may be interpreted as an indication of the space for intra-Euro Area labour force movement.</p>

<p>The resilient labour market situation is reflected in rising earnings and wages. In combination with higher oil prices, this poses inflationary pressures. Inflation is on the rise and in the first quarter it stood at 2.4 per cent. We forecast that inflation will remain above 2 per cent this year and next.</p>

<title>France</title>
<p>On the eve of the second round of the presidential elections, France is at a crossroad, facing the choice between austerity and growth. So far, the French economy has shown greater resilience than expected. Output slowed in the past two quarters but did not contract as in many of its main European trading partners. Preliminary data on the public deficit are also positive. The French government surpassed its official budget deficit target, and reduced the deficit from 7.1 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 5.2 per cent of GDP last year. Output is expected to stagnate in the next two quarters and we forecast growth of 0.4 per cent for the year as a whole. High unemployment, fiscal tightening, and financial tensions in the Euro Area continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence. Consumption will remain sluggish and both housing and business investment are expected to contract, while the broader European downturn will weigh on French exports.</p>
<p>The first round of the elections confirmed incumbent candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and the Socialist party candidate François Hollande as the two front-runners in the presidential election. Whilst both candidates have made the reduction of the fiscal deficit and debts a clear commitment, the split between tax- and spending-based adjustment differs significantly, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-002795011222000105">figure 15</xref>. If elected, M. Hollande plans to present additional clauses on growth and employment for the fiscal compact at the next European Council meeting in June.</p>

<title>Italy</title>
<p>Economic conditions in Italy worsened in the second half of 2011, with output contracting by 0.7 per cent in the final quarter. In 2012, output is expected to contract by 1.5 per cent on an annual basis.</p>
<p>As the prospects for the Italian economy deteriorate, unemployment has started to rise. The unemployment rate reached 8.7 per cent in the last quarter of 2011, compared with 8.2 per cent a year earlier. While the level of unemployment remains moderate if we compare it with other periphery countries, youth unemployment in Italy has increased rapidly since 2008. The rise in youth unemployment suggests that new graduates are facing difficulties in finding jobs and competition is quite intense. Although the government has recently introduced a series of labour market reforms, such as greater flexibility in hiring and firing, reforming unemployment benefits and encouraging women's participation in the labour force, experience from other countries, such as the UK in the 1980s, suggests that it may take some time for the reforms to have a significant effect on the overall performance of the labour market.</p>
<p>The fiscal position in Italy was on track for 2011, although as the economy is struggling with recession we do not expect the government to achieve the targeted deficit of 1.7 per cent of GDP this year, and project a deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2012 and 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2013.</p>
<p>Government bond yields declined from around 7 per cent at the beginning of the year to just above 5 per cent recently, owing <italic>inter alia</italic> to the ECB's liquidity policies as well as an ebbing of concerns regarding an imminent banking crisis in the Euro Area. In the <italic>World Overview</italic> section of this chapter we consider the links between government bond yields and government finances, and show that fiscal austerity is unlikely to bring significant short-term relief to government borrowing premia.</p>
<p>According to Banca d'Italia, the balance sheet of credit institutions in Italy indicates a steady increase in the level of doubtful loans since 2008, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-002795011222000105">figure 16</xref>, although this is not unusual during a recession. The figure also suggests that, since joining EMU in 1999, Italian banks have improved the quality of their assets and diminished exposure to impaired loans.</p>

<title>Spain</title>
<p>The Spanish economy stagnated in the third quarter of 2011 and prospects continue to deteriorate. The sovereign debt crisis and banking stress in Europe weigh heavily on the Spanish economy. The Spanish economy has fallen back into recession for the second time since 2009.</p>
<p>Recession will challenge the newly elected government's plans for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The Spanish government missed its fiscal consolidation target for 2011 by 2.5 per cent of GDP. The new government has introduced an ambitious plan to reduce the deficit to 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2012 from 8.5 per cent in 2011. As output is projected to contract by 1.8 per cent this year, it is unlikely that the government can achieve this target. We forecast a deficit of closer to 7 per cent of GDP this year.</p>
<p>The Spanish economy is suffering from crises in its sovereign, banking, housing and labour markets. The combination of these factors has put pressure on government bond yields in Spain, despite a much lower debt to GDP ratio and better economic prospects than in Greece. The housing sector has still not fully adjusted. According to the Bank of Spain, the banking sector balance sheet contains a sharply rising share of doubtful assets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-002795011222000105">figure 16</xref>) and the process of deleveraging is quite slow.</p>

<title>New Member States</title>
<p>We forecast that Central and Eastern European countries on average will expand by about 2 1/4 and 3 per cent in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Growth rates across individual countries vary, with Poland and the Baltic economies expected to expand by 3 to 4 per cent this year, and Hungary and the Czech Republic practically stagnating. Looking back, the Baltic economies have been catching up quickly from their 2009 trough; however, given the colossal scale of the recession (predominantly due to their very high degree of openness, and the effects of the bursting of pre-crisis house price booms), they have not yet reached their pre-crisis level of output — see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-002795011222000105">figure 17</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The projected slowdown in the Euro Area will negatively affect Central and Eastern European trade. For some countries, this effect will be exacerbated by the relatively strong exchange rate (for example, relative to other currencies of the region the exchange rate of the Czech koruna is strong). As a result, the relative weight of net exports will decrease. It is expected that the smallest and most open Baltic economies, as well as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, will be affected most.</p>
<p>Inflationary pressures remain relatively high in Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Hungary, all of which are inflation targeters, and remain a matter of concern. At present inflation is expected to exceed the targets set by the respective central banks by about 1.5 percentage points on average, partly reflecting the rise in commodity prices. Rising inflation requires careful monitoring among this set of countries. In countries with a long history of high inflation — and all EU8+2 countries have suffered from hyperinflation in the memorable past — the probability of second-round effects is higher than in the countries with securely anchored inflation expectations, such as Germany.</p>
