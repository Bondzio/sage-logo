<p>What is, or should be, the role of ethics in giftedness? In this article, I consider why ethical behavior is much harder to come by than one would expect. Ethical behavior requires completion of a series of eight steps to action, the failure of any one of which may result in a person, even one who is ethically well trained, to act in a manner that lacks the translation of ethical knowledge into action. Many people identified as gifted through traditional means are nevertheless lacking in ethics, in part because socialization may not reward them for the development of ethical patterns of behavior. The result has been catastrophic for the world.</p>

<body>
<p>There are now many books on the financial meltdown of 2008 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411435050">Farrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435050">McLean and Nocera, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411435050">Taibbi, 2010</xref>). Although their accounts differ, they agree on three things. First, the people who created the meltdown were very smart, often having prestigious degrees from well-known institutions of higher learning. Second, those people made genuinely poor decisions that could have been avoided. Third, the basis of the decisions was, in large part, greed and a lack of an ethical compass.</p>
<p>Unbridled greed on Wall Street is nothing new. It has a long history in the United States and in other financial markets. What is new, in the United States, is the extent to which productivity in other sectors is being lost while Wall Street barons enrich themselves at others’ expense. The financial manipulations that led to the meltdown in many cases had no useful purpose other than to enrich the few who could afford to be a part of them, at the expense of others who could not be. It brought to a halt productive use of the billions of dollars that were lost in the crisis.</p>
<p>The number of banks that failed in the last few years is absolutely staggering, with one bank after another falling in a chain reaction from bad investments (see www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html).</p>
<p>The financial meltdown, which spread around the world, is scarcely the first scandal that has rocked the United States in recent years. We have seen political scandals of Congress people enriching themselves at their constituents’ expense, organizational scandals where companies such as Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom cost shareholders uncounted millions of dollars as well as lost jobs for employees, and church scandals where religiously trained individuals, some of them in very high positions within their churches, abused children.</p>
<p>Ethical scandals occur in many domains, of course, including ones that are supposed to report on ethical scandals! In January 2011, the British Prime Minister’s media and communications chief, Andy Coulson, resigned over an ethical scandal at a publication he once edited, <italic>News of the World. </italic>A reporter at the publication, in his eagerness to expose ethical scandals among the highly placed, hacked phone calls of highly placed government officials. He thereby himself created an ethical scandal in the course of trying to expose the ethical scandals of others.</p>
<p>Those interested in giftedness perhaps need to ask the question of whether we are defining giftedness in quite the right way. Recently, my colleagues and I have proposed a broader definition of giftedness than that typically used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435050">Sternberg et al., 2011</xref>). I have also suggested that we need more seriously to entertain the concept of ethical giftedness and deal with the consequences of definitions of giftedness that omit the ethical component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435050">Sternberg, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411435050">b</xref>). Is it possible that the various models of giftedness that educators are using (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411435050">Sternberg and Davidson, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411435050">2005</xref>) are somehow inadequate to the task of identification? Or at the very least, that they are leaving us open to identifying people whose gifts leave them accruing resources to themselves at the expense of others?</p>
<p>The idea of some kind of moral or ethical giftedness is hardly unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411435050">Ambrose and Cross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435050">Coles, 1998</xref>). Where theorists and researchers differ is in how they conceive of the role of ethics in giftedness.</p>
<p>Typically, giftedness is viewed as trait-like—people have it or they don’t. For example, they have an IQ over a certain point or they do not, where IQ is viewed as relatively fixed. I would suggest, however, that trait-like conceptions of ethical giftedness simply have no evidence to support them. Depressingly, neither do accounts that rely on superior moral training. Today, we find not only clergypersons who abuse children but also various religious leaders who issue proclamations encouraging murder and terrorism. For some readers, it might be depressing to contemplate on what value years of religious training had for such individuals. Did the training make them ethically more bankrupt or were they inclined toward ethical bankruptcy in the first place and the training was merely incidental?</p>
<p>I believe that the key to ethical decision-making is not necessarily in inborn gifts or in religious training—for many people religious training seems associated with a lack of ethical decision-making. Rather, it is in a series of steps in the ethical decision-making process. People who fail ethically fail because they do not complete one or more of eight steps required in ethical decision-making. My decision-making model draws in part on a model proposed earlier for bystander intervention.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411435050">Latané and Darley (1970</xref>) opened up a new field of research on bystander intervention. They showed that, contrary to expectations, bystanders intervene when someone is in trouble only in very limited circumstances. For example, if they think that someone else might intervene, the bystanders tend to stay out of the situation. Latané and Darley even showed that divinity students who were about to lecture on the parable of <italic>The Good Samaritan </italic>were no more likely than other bystanders to help a person in distress who was in need of—a good Samaritan! Drawing upon their model of bystander intervention, I propose here a model of ethical behavior that would seem to apply to a variety of ethical problems.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the model is that ethical behavior is far harder to emit than one would expect simply on the basis of what we learn from our parents, from school, and from our religious training. To intervene, individuals must go through a series of steps, and unless all of the steps are completed, they are not likely to behave in an ethical way, regardless of the amount of training they have received in ethics, and regardless of their levels of gifts in other types of skills.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261429411435050">
<title>A multi-phase model for ethical behavior</title>
<p>According to the proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429411435050">Sternberg, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411435050">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435050">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411435050">b</xref>), enacting ethical behavior is much harder than it would appear to be because it involves multiple, largely sequential, steps. To behave ethically, the individual has to:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>recognize that there is an event to which to react;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>define the event as having an ethical dimension;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>decide that the ethical dimension is of sufficient significance to merit an ethics-guided response;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>take responsibility for generating an ethical solution to the problem;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>figure out what abstract ethical rule(s) might apply to the problem;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>decide how these abstract ethical rules actually apply to the problem so as to suggest a concrete solution;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>prepare for possibly counteracting contextual forces that might lead one not to act in an ethical manner;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>act.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Seen from this standpoint, it is rather challenging to respond to problems in an ethical manner. Consider, for example, Amy, a student who believes she observes another student, Barb, copy words from an Internet source almost word for word in a paper without citing the source.</p>
<sec id="section2-0261429411435050">
<title>Recognize that there is an event to which to react</title>
<p>Recognizing that there is an event to which to react would seem to be straightforward, but often it is not. Amy is not sure whether anything really happened that is worthy of her attention. Did Barb really copy the words into her paper or did Amy just think she did? Is it possible that Amy misperceived what happened?</p>
<p>When people hear their political, educational, or religious leaders talk, they may not believe there is any reason to question what they hear. After all, they are listening to authority figures. In this way, leaders, including cynical and corrupt leaders, may lead their flocks to accept and even commit unethical acts.</p>
<p>Consider the Nazi or Rwandan genocide or any other genocide. The ruling classes go to great pains to hide what is going on from the outside world, and sometimes even from people on the inside. The idea is to obfuscate the fact that there is an event that merits some kind of reaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261429411435050">
<title>Define the event as having an ethical dimension</title>
<p>Suppose Amy decides that Barb did indeed copy material without attribution from the Internet. For many students today, copying from the Internet hardly has an ethical dimension at all. They look at it as routine. The teacher might view it as an ethical lapse, but will Amy? Does Barb?</p>
<p>Cynical leaders may flaunt their unethical behavior—one is reminded today of Robert Mugabe, but there are other world leaders who might equally be relevant here. When Mugabe and his henchmen seized the farms of white farmers, the seizure was presented as one of compensating alleged war heroes for their accomplishments. Why should it be unethical to compensate war heroes?</p>
<p>The Chinese government attempted to manipulate media to downplay the dimensions of an event with a huge ethical component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435050">Atlas, 2008</xref>). On 12 May 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan province killed an estimated 10,000 school children. But there was an irregularity in the buildings that imploded during the earthquake. Schools for children of well-connected party leaders as well as government buildings withstood the earthquake with no problem. In contrast, schools housing poor children crumbled to dust. It turned out that the schools had been built in ways that could only poorly withstand an earthquake. Presumably, the money that was supposed to have supported better construction went to line the pockets of party functionaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435050">Atlas, 2008</xref>). The government is doing what it can to suppress these basic facts.</p>
<p>The extent to which cheating is tolerated varies by culture. In at least some cultures, when students cheat, they often do not define their cheating as an ethical event. They view it simply as what everyone does in order to succeed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429411435050">
<title>Decide that the ethical dimension is significant</title>
<p>Suppose that Amy decides that Barb has cheated and that it is unethical to cheat. Is the event important enough to pay attention to or pursue any further? Or are so many students cheating these days that it is scarcely worth the bother? And how serious was it if Barb just copied a few paragraphs of a longer paper?</p>
<p>In my experience as a professor and administrator, when students cheat and are caught, even if they admit to an ethical lapse, they often minimize the ethical dimension of what they have done. Students, like many adult college administrators or authors who have been caught, often define the event as one of carelessness or as unawareness that the behavior engaged in constitutes cheating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429411435050">
<title>Take responsibility for generating an ethical solution to the problem</title>
<p>Amy decides that Barb has cheated and that it is significant. But now Amy has to decide whether it is her responsibility to turn Barb in. Is it her responsibility? Why not leave the responsibility to the teacher to catch cheaters?</p>
<p>People may allow leaders to commit wretched acts because they figure it is the leaders’ responsibility to determine the ethical dimensions of their actions. Isn’t that why they are leaders in the first place? Or people may assume that the leaders, especially if they are religious leaders, are in a uniquely good position to determine what is ethical. If a religious leader encourages someone to become a suicide bomber, that “someone” may feel that being such a bomber must be ethical. Why else would a religious leader suggest it?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411435050">
<title>Figure out what abstract ethical rule(s) might apply to the problem</title>
<p>Amy decides that she does indeed have a responsibility in the situation. Now Amy is trying to remember whether plagiarism is specifically forbidden or simply not recommended. Even if Barb did plagiarize, is that the same as cheating? After all, she did not cheat on a test.</p>
<p>Most of us have learned, in one way or another, ethical rules that we are supposed to apply to our lives. For example, we are supposed to be honest. But who among us can say he or she has not lied at some time, perhaps with the excuse that we were protecting someone else’s feelings? By doing so, we insulate ourselves from the effects of our behavior. Perhaps, we can argue, that the principle that we should not hurt someone else’s feelings takes precedence over not lying. Of course, as the lies grow larger, we can continue to use the same excuse. Or politicians may argue that they should provide generous tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy, on the theory that the benefits will “trickle down” to the rest of the population. So perhaps one is treating all people well, as we learn to do—but some people are treated better than others with the rationalization that eventually the effects will reach all the others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411435050">
<title>Decide how these abstract ethical rules actually apply to the problem so as to suggest a concrete solution</title>
<p>Amy is pretty sure that Barb changed some of the words. Is it okay then? Does that still count as plagiarism? Maybe she did not copy enough words for the rules against plagiarism to apply.</p>
<p>In our work on practical intelligence, some of which was summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411435050">Sternberg et al. (2000</xref>), we found that there is, at best, a modest correlation between the more academic and abstract aspects of intelligence and its more practical and concrete aspects. Both aspects, though, predicted behavior in everyday life. People may have skills that shine brightly in a classroom, but which they are unable to translate into real-world consequential behavior. For example, someone may be able to pass a written drivers’ test with flying colors, but not be able to drive. Or someone may be able to get an A in a French class, but not speak French to passers-by in Paris. Or a teacher may get an A in a classroom management course, but be unable to manage a classroom. Translation of abstract skills into concrete ones is difficult, and may leave people knowing a lot of ethical rules that they are nevertheless unable to translate into their everyday lives.</p>
<p>If one follows reports in the media, there are any number of instances in which pastors who are highly trained in religion and ethics act in unethical and unscrupulous ways. They may be able to teach classes on ethics, but they fail to translate what they teach into their own behavior. One may tend to be quick to blame them, but, as a psychologist, I know that there are many competent psychologists who are unable to apply what they do in therapy to their own lives. Being a psychologist is no protection against personal strife, any more than being an ethicist is protection against unethical behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429411435050">
<title>Prepare for possibly counteracting contextual forces that might lead one not to act in an ethical manner</title>
<p>Amy is convinced that Barb has cheated and that her cheating is reportable. But what if she tells the teacher? Will Barb retaliate if, or when, she finds out Amy told? Will all the other students label Amy a “tattletale”? Will she be socially ostracized or bullied?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the problem is not that other people seem oblivious to the ethical implications of the situation, but that they actively encourage you to behave in ways you define as unethical. In the Rwandan genocides, Hutus were encouraged to hate Tutsis and to kill them, even if they were within their own family (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429411435050">Sternberg and Sternberg, 2008</xref>). Those who were not willing to participate in the massacres risked becoming victims themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411435050">Gourevitch, 1998</xref>). The same applied in Hitler’s Germany. Those who tried to save Jews from concentration camps themselves risked going to such camps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429411435050">Totten et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One may hesitate to act because of possible repercussions. Perhaps students in my class saw me as grossly unethical, but did not want to risk challenging me openly and thereby potentially lowering their grade. In genocides, opposing the perpetrators may make one a victim. Or one may look foolish acting in an ethical way when others are taking advantage of a situation in a way to foster their personal good. Even before one acts, one may be hesitant because of the aftermath one anticipates, whether real or merely imagined.</p>
<p>We would like to think that the pressure to behave ethically will lead people to resist internal temptations to act poorly. But, often, exactly the opposite is the case. In the Enron case, when Sherron Watkins blew the whistle on unethical behavior, she was punished and made to feel like an “outcast” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429411435050">
<italic>Time</italic>, 2002</xref>). In general, whistleblowers are treated poorly, despite the protections they are supposed to receive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261429411435050">
<title>Act</title>
<p>Amy is prepared psychologically to accept the consequences of turning Barb in. But now she finds herself having difficulty actually acting on her thoughts. She knows she should turn Barb in, but it is one thing to know what to do and another to do it.</p>
<p>In the end, the hardest step is simply to act. People often get close to the point of action but then, for lack of courage or lack of energy or fear for their future, stop. So the ethical action remains in their head, but is never actually realized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429411435050">
<title>Is there an ethical giftedness?</title>
<p>Gardner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411435050">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-0261429411435050">1999</xref>) has wrestled with the question of whether there is some kind of existential or even spiritual intelligence that guides people through challenging life dilemmas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435050">Coles (1998</xref>) is one of many who have argued for a moral intelligence in children as well as adults. Is there some kind of moral or spiritual intelligence in which some children are inherently superior to others? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435050">Kohlberg (1984</xref>) believed that there are stages of moral reasoning, and that as children grow older, they advance in these stages. Some will advance faster and further than others, creating individual differences in levels of moral development.</p>
<p>The perspective of this essay is perhaps a bit different. People can certainly differ in their moral reasoning and moral development, but we can teach children as well as adults to enhance their ethical reasoning and behavior simply by instructing them regarding the challenges of thinking and acting in an ethical way. It is not enough to teach religion or values or ethics. One needs to teach children about the steps leading to ethical behavior, as described above, so that they can recognize for and in themselves how and why it is that ethical behavior presents such a challenge. They need education and they need inoculation against the forces that are likely to lead them to fail to behave ethically because they do not make it through all eight of the steps as described above.</p>
<p>From this point of view, ethical giftedness is not some kind of inherent characteristic, but something we can develop in virtually all children (assuming they are not psychopathic). But such development is difficult because, as we have seen, thinking and acting ethically is more of a challenge than would appear. Merely going to religion or ethics classes will not, in and of themselves, produce ethical behavior.</p>
<p>In speaking of the challenges of leadership, and particularly of leaders who become foolish, I have spoken of the risk of ethical disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435050">Sternberg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethical disengagement (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435050">Bandura, 1999</xref>) is the dissociation of oneself from ethical values. One may believe that ethical values should apply to the actions of others, but one becomes disengaged from them as they apply to oneself. One may believe that one is above or beyond ethics, or simply not see its relevance to one’s own life.</p>
<p>Leaders fail to be ethical for many reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435050">Sternberg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is egocentrism, as in the case of Tyco chief executive officer Dennis Kozlowski, currently in prison for tax evasion. Kozlowski ran the company as though it was his own personal piggybank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429411435050">
<italic>USA Today</italic>, 2005</xref>). Ethics took the back seat to Kozlowski’s desire to enrich himself and his family.</p>
<p>Perhaps Eliot Spitzer, as governor of New York state, felt himself not only extremely powerful, but invulnerable. He must have felt pretty close to invulnerable, because, as a former prosecutor, he must have known that police agencies had multiple ways of tracking patrons of prostitutes. He nevertheless engaged in a pattern of repeated reckless behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411435050">
<italic>New York Times</italic>, 2008</xref>), which eventually cost him the governorship. Somewhere along the line, he abandoned in his own life the ethics he had applied as a prosecutor. He is now trying to make a comeback with a television show.</p>

<title>The role of wisdom</title>
<p>If we want to nurture ethical giftedness, or at least behavior that is ethically gifted, then we have to value wisdom. Tests created to measure factual knowledge and analysis of such knowledge often bypass wisdom altogether.</p>
<p>A leader can have all of the above skills and dispositions and still lack an additional quality that, arguably, is the most important quality a leader can have, but, perhaps, also the rarest. This additional quality is wisdom. Wisdom is viewed here according to a proposed balance theory of wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411435050">Sternberg, 2003</xref>), according to which an individual is wise to the extent he or she uses successful intelligence, creativity, and knowledge as moderated by positive ethical values to seek to reach a common good and balance intrapersonal (one’s own), interpersonal (others’), and extrapersonal (organizational/institutional/spiritual) interests over the short and long term to adapt to, shape, and select environments. Wisdom is in large part a decision to use one’s intelligence, creativity, and experience for a common good.</p>
<p>Wise individuals do not look out just for their own interests, nor do they ignore these interests. Rather, they skillfully balance interests of varying kinds, including their own, those of others, and those of the communities of which they are a part. They also recognize that they need to align the interests of their group or organization with those of other groups or organizations because no group operates within a vacuum. Wise people realize that what may appear to be a prudent course of action over the short term does not necessarily appear so over the long term.</p>
<p>Leaders who have been less than fully successful often have been so because they have ignored one or another set of interests. For example, in the United States, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, in their respective cover-ups, not only failed to fulfill the interests of the country they led, but also failed to fulfill their own interests. Their cover-ups ended up bogging down their administrations in scandals rather than allowing them to make the positive accomplishments they had hoped to make. George Bush became the most unpopular US president since polls measuring popularity began because he appeared to care more about the enhancement of his own power than the good of the world, or even the country he was elected to lead. Freud was a great leader in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, but his insistence that his followers (disciples) conform quite exactly to his own system of psychoanalysis led him to lose those disciples and the support they might have continued to lend to his efforts. He was an expert in interpersonal interests, but not as applied to his own life. Napoleon lost sight of the extrapersonal interests that would have been best for his own country. His disastrous invasion of Russia, which appears to have been motivated more by hubris than by France’s need to have Russia in its empire, partially destroyed his reputation as a successful military leader, and paved the way for his later downfall.</p>
<p>Leaders can be intelligent in various ways and creative in various ways; it does not guarantee that they are wise. Indeed, probably relatively few leaders at any level are particularly wise. Yet the few leaders who are notably so—perhaps Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa—leave an indelible mark on the people they lead and, potentially, on history. It is important to note that wise leaders are probably usually charismatic, but charismatic leaders are not necessarily wise, as Hitler, Stalin, and many other charismatic leaders have demonstrated over the course of time. In the end, wisdom is the use of intelligence, creativity, and knowledge in a positively ethical way that is directed toward the common good.</p>

<title>Teaching for ethical reasoning and decision-making</title>
<p>How can we teach children to reason ethically? We as educators have to give them problems of the kinds they face in their everyday lives and then teach them the steps they need to go through not only to think, but also to act, ethically. Ethical decision-making is best taught using a case-study approach. The focus of the instruction should be not on the content of the decisions but on the process. In the end, students must learn to make their own choices. Religious schools teach “morality.” Secular schools need to teach decision-making for positive ethical values.</p>
<p>What are examples of case studies? The Amy–Barb example above is one that teachers could use. Here are five other examples. In the end, teachers will want to construct their own examples that are relevant to their classrooms.</p>
<p>
<italic>Bullying.</italic> John is walking to school when he notices a notorious bully, Sammy, confronting Jimmy, who is quite small in size and relatively timid. John is pretty sure that Sammy is bullying Jimmy. John knows that Sammy is stronger than he is and also that many of his classmates are scared of Sammy. John is uncertain as to what to do.</p>
<p>
<italic>Drug use. </italic>Samantha tells Jane that she is hooked on downers and that she is worried her mother will find out. Samantha is obviously not interested in Jane’s telling her to stop using the drugs. Rather, she wants advice on how not to get caught. Jane is very worried about Samantha because Samantha’s work in school and social relationships are suffering. Jane has tried in the past without success to convince Samantha to stop taking drugs. Jane is wondering what to do.</p>
<p>
<italic>Found money.</italic> Bill is leaving school when he finds a $100 bill on the school grounds. He has no idea whose it is. No one else is around so it is not obvious to whom the bill belongs. He picks it up and is trying to decide what to do with the bill.</p>
<p>
<italic>Lying.</italic> Lisa forgot to do her homework. Now the teacher, Mr Smith, is collecting the homework. Seeing that Lisa has not turned in her homework, Mr Smith asks Lisa in front of the entire class whether she did the homework and left it at home or whether she just failed to do it. Lisa realizes that if she says she left her homework at home, she may be able to avoid, or at least minimize, a penalty. She is not sure what to do.</p>
<p>
<italic>Miscall.</italic> Jack hits the baseball and it is a grounder. He runs toward second base. No one is on first. As Jack is running, the pitcher, Tom, throws the ball to the second baseman, Al. Jack reaches second base and Al touches him with the ball. To his amazement, the referee calls him safe nevertheless. Jack is not sure whether to say anything.</p>
<p>These examples are only a few of the many that could be used for students to consider the ethical implications of everyday situations. A teacher evaluating students would want to look for evidence that the students used the eight steps in the model to generate their proposed ethical solution. This scoring method would work best if students are explicitly taught about the eight steps.</p>
<p>Some might argue that the ethical reasoning of the kind that the students would use to address these problems does not appear on any state-wide mastery test. But that kind of ethical reasoning will be crucial to their lives and to how they make use of the knowledge and skills they have. Can we afford to develop gifts without also developing their ethical utilization?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>People may differ in their ability to behave ethically, but, to my knowledge, there is no evidence of intrinsic differences in “ethical giftedness” or “moral intelligence.” The difference in people’s behavior appears rather to be in their skill in completing a set of eight steps that, conjointly, produce ethical behavior. Failure of an earlier step is likely to lead to failure to execute the later steps. Teaching children abstract principles of ethical behavior or ethical rules is unlikely, in itself, to produce ethical behavior. Rather, children need to be taught the sequence of processes leading to ethical thinking, and to inoculate themselves against pressures—both external and internal—to behave in unethical ways. If we want to produce ethical giftedness, we have to develop it, not hope that it will be a given in some group of intrinsically gifted children.</p>
<p>As educators of the gifted, we perhaps, more than anyone, have a responsibility to develop a strong ethical compass in the children we serve. Presumably, we are working with the children who will be the leaders of the next generation. What kinds of leaders do we want? Do we want leaders who are smart and then use their smartness for their own ends at the expense of others? Is it sufficient to define giftedness in a way that rewards people who are selfish or even morally bankrupt? Can our society afford to continue doing so? This is a question we all must address as we face challenges that threaten our world in a way that is unprecedented. Will some future race of beings wonder how a civilization could have identified as gifted those who were responsible for the destruction of their civilization? Is it possible that, as a field, we have come bearing false gifts?</p>
