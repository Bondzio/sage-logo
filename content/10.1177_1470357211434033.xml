<p>Multimodality explores how the individual and combined meaning- making potential of different semiotic resources defines and is defined through communication. To date, <italic>The Routledge Handbook of Multimodal Analysis</italic> is the richest collection of papers in this young yet rapidly expanding area of research. As many of its chapters raise important questions or offer useful conceptual and methodological tools, it constitutes a noteworthy attempt at meeting the high and diverse expectations for a handbook. It also succeeds in bringing together cutting-edge explorations from different perspectives, while ensuring their accessibility for newcomers. This can be attributed to Jewitt’s critical understanding of multimodality as ‘a field of application’ that invites ‘a variety of disciplines and theoretical perspectives’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>Densely printed, the book consists of an introduction, 22 chapters organised into four parts (each with a preface), an extensive glossary of key terms, a list of references for the whole volume, and an index (with glossary terms in bold). With up to six black-and-white figures per chapter, the volume is more generously illustrated than other collections in the field.</p>
<p>The introduction describes the book as ‘a response to increasing interest in multimodal research [and to] the need to further develop the field of multimodality, its theoretical and methodological tools and processes’ (p. 4), and calls for reflection on the ways social, cultural and historical factors – which include but are not coextensive with new technologies – simultaneously transform and are influenced by the use of different communication modes.</p>
<p>Part I, ‘Theoretical and Methodological Tools for Multimodal Analysis’ fulfils the promise of offering ‘a ‘research toolkit’ for multimodal analysis’ (p. 11). The first two chapters, by Jewitt, present a wide-reaching overview of the field as they establish useful connections across contributions to the collection and parallels between them and multimodality research more widely. Chapter 1 introduces the key assumptions behind multimodality: that meaning-making always involves (co)deploying different modes in accordance with each mode’s unique semiotic potential and that multimodal communication and semiotic resources simultaneously shape and are shaped by the social contexts in which they operate. It also outlines five key foci in multimodality research, all of which are represented in the book: (i) the semiotic potential and use of individual modes; (ii) intersemiotic relations; (iii) multimodality and technology; (iv) knowledge, pedagogy and literacy; and (v) identity. Jewitt then proceeds to present a list of working, yet lucid definitions of concepts like ‘mode’, ‘semiotic resource’, ‘metafunctions’, ‘modal affordance/meaning potential/materiality’ and ‘intersemiotic relations’, which could be productively extended by adding definitions of similarly important concepts like ‘discourse’, ‘text’ and ‘genre’. Jewitt also mentions the limitations of multimodal analysis that the volume seeks to address: the impressionistic nature of multimodal analysis; lack of stable analytical frameworks; strong reliance on linguistic categories (‘linguistic imperialism’/‘logocentrism’); and risk of failing to relate detailed descriptions of multimodal texts or interactions to broader theoretical, methodological and socio-cultural issues.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 presents a comparison of what Jewitt identifies as the three main approaches to multimodality. The social semiotic approach and (systemic functional) multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) originate from Halliday’s theory of language as a social semiotic, whereas multimodal interactional analysis draws on Scollon and Scollon’s mediated discourse analysis and the work of sociolinguists like Goffman, Gumperz and Tannen. This subdivision provides a helpful orientation to multimodality, even though the distinctions between the first two approaches may need to be refined following more recent advances in SF-MDA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434033">Bednarek and Martin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357211434033">Dreyfus et al., 2011</xref>) inspired by the Sydney School of discourse and genre analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357211434033">Martin and Rose, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Flewitt, Hampel, Hauck and Lancaster discuss key issues in transcribing multimodal data across different approaches (e.g. applied linguistics, visual ethnography, multimodal discourse analysis) as well as the theories and the technologies for multimodal data generation, collection, transcription, analysis and presentation behind these approaches. In ‘What is Mode?’ (Chapter 4), Kress builds on his previous theorising of the relation between mode, media and social context, an essential step towards improving the robustness of multimodal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357211434033">Bateman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434033">2011</xref>). The chapter unfolds as a richly exemplified argument that modes are material resources that a community uses ‘with discernible regularity, consistency and shared assumptions about their meaning-potential’ (p. 59). Their potential rests on the logic of time and/or space, on the one hand, and the ability of modes to meet different communicative needs, on the other. This understanding promotes greater awareness of modes as ‘socially and culturally specific’ (p. 60) and highlights the need to develop ‘labels apt for specific modes and labels for the functions and purposes [e.g. framing, salience] common to all modes’ (p. 67). Van Leeuwen (Chapter 5) problematises distinctions between modes and media, culture and nature, using voice quality as an example and extending his work on sound and typography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434033">Van Leeuwen, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434033">2006</xref>). He offers a framework for modelling the meaning potential of material resources, which relies both on cultural associations (e.g. with the voices of iconic figures), and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357211434033">Lakoff and Johnson (1980)</xref> have proposed for metaphors, on bodily experience. The latter Van Leeuwen maps using ‘parametric systems’, or systems of gradable qualities (e.g. pitch range, loudness, breathiness, etc. for voice quality), where each quality adds a layer of meaning to a signifier and all qualities combine to distinguish one signifier from another. Norris’s contribution (Chapter 6) presents a clear and critical introduction to her framework for analysing the complex structure of multimodal interaction, which seeks to explain how modes and media enable people to perform mediated actions in specific situations. Her focus is on two concepts: (i) modal density, which is a product of the number and types of modes involved in a certain action (modal complexity) and the degree of significance each has for the action (modal intensity); and (ii) modal configuration, the hierarchical relations between modes within a given action.</p>
<p>Part II fosters engagement with time, technologies, literacy, identity and other social and cultural factors for multimodality. O’Halloran (Chapter 7) demonstrates that ‘[t]he historical view of the semiotic landscape in mathematics reveals how mathematical knowledge evolves and materialises as multimodal and semiotic objects, activities and events constructed using semiotic resources which are shaped by social and scientific technologies’ (p. 113). Jones (Chapter 8) discusses the convergence of modes and technologies in social practices at a specific time and place (‘sites of display’). His analysis of a gay social networking website, which allowed its users to display their bodies by selecting from built-in descriptors (e.g. ‘average built’) and uploading images, exposes software’s role in constraining identity construction and user interaction, and thereby evidences the value of multimodal analysis for the recently established field of software studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357211434033">Fuller, 2008</xref>), even though Jones himself does not emphasise this value. Leander and Vasudevan (Chapter 9) describe exchanges (e.g. a 13-year-old’s IM interaction with an online friend) that raise questions about the interaction between multimodality, mobile culture, and identity. Beyond brief references to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434033">Kress and Van Leeuwen’s (2001)</xref> strata of multimodal discourse, however, the chapter offers no ideas for addressing these questions. Lemke (Chapter 10) proposes phenomenology as a complementary perspective to semiotics, useful for explaining the effects of ‘time and pacing, space and place, affect and emotion, felt movement and participatory action’ (p. 142) on meaning making. Understanding these effects for him holds the promise of unveiling the ways identities are performed, constructed, marketed and consumed through transmedia franchises like <italic>Harry Potter</italic>, where identification with characters and fan communities trespasses ‘the boundaries between works, media, genres, sites, institutional contexts, activities, etc.’ (p. 145). This chapter incorporates some of Lemke’s most influential ideas developed over the past decade, and calls to mind relevant work such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434033">Van Leeuwen’s (2005)</xref> on lifestyles as marketable identity configurations and Stenglin’s on Bonding as a tool for building communities around shared values (Chapter 21). In Chapter 11, Unsworth and Cléirigh take an important step towards theorising visual–verbal relations as they illustrate with examples from school science textbooks and an exam question, that written text and image mutually identify each other. A theory of intermodal relations, they argue, is key to predicting where comprehension difficulties may arise and developing literacy pedagogy from a multimodal perspective, particularly in school science, where ‘if the text does not gloss unfamiliar image segments or unfamiliar language is not visualized in images, inexperienced readers in the field can face significant difficulty’ (p. 163).</p>
<p>Part III opens the floor to approaches to multimodality beyond social semiotics and systemic functional and interactional discourse analysis. Scollon and Scollon (Chapter 12) look back to sociolinguistic studies that sought to account for non-verbal and multimodal communication, yet supported the dominance of language, such as those of Pike, Goffman and Hall. Looking forward, they offer directions for research on language and multimodality, such as exploring how broad semantic principles such as modality (i.e. perspectives on and degrees of truth) are realised across modes (echoing ideas from Kress’s chapter) and addressing issues like materiality and embodiment, the role of physical sites and timescales in communication (also highlighted in Van Leeuwen’s, Jones’s and Lemke’s contributions). Chapter 13 is a highly thought-provoking contribution by Machin, who considers still unresolved problems that visual studies highlight in linguistics-based visual and multimodal analysis, such as logocentrism and the strong reliance of interpretations on contextual knowledge rather than on visual structure. Street, Pahl and Rowsell (Chapter 14) trace the history of new literacy studies (which focus on literacy practices in specific settings and share ethnography as a methodology) and multimodality/multiliteracies (where texts are the usual point of departure), and overview studies that productively combine the two traditions to explore literacy practices in home, community and school contexts. In Chapter 15, adopting a socio-cultural approach, Ivarsson, Linderoth and Säljö explore specific practices – two young girls playing computer games and an interaction between an architecture student and teacher – pointing to findings that will not surprise multimodal analysts: that the interpretation of representations varies across contexts; that engagement with visual objects may ‘provoke linguistic innovation and <italic>vice versa</italic>’ (p. 210); and that language is an indispensable tool for concept creation and reasoning. Again prioritising situated practice, Luff, Heath and Pitsch (Chapter 16) evaluate the suitability of multimodal analysis for workplace studies, which combine various analytical frameworks (e.g. activity theory, conversation analysis, ethnomethodology) yet share a ‘concern with the practical accomplishment of organisational activities’ (p. 214). The chapter employs a thick description of two short excerpts from an interaction between interior designers to support the argument that artefacts and embodied modes interact in complex ways and that parsing multimodal interactions into individual modes may obscure this complexity, resonating with the motivation behind Kress’s contribution. In Chapter 17, David Howes turns to fascinating research on the relation between culture and sense perception in anthropology, and, inspired by cognitive neuroscience and sensory anthropology, proposes a cross-cultural theory of sense perception. Such a theory may offer insights for understanding synaesthesia from a social semiotic perspective, where it is defined as ‘meaning which can be materially realised and recognised in different modes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434033">Kress and Van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>In Part IV, ‘Multimodal Case Studies’, Björkvall (Chapter 18) maps the parameters that affect the meaning of IKEA tables as practical objects, including their structure (height and tabletop shape) and materials (e.g. wood, glass, plastic), and, like Van Leeuwen (Chapter 5), contests the division between function and meaning. Jaworski and Thurlow (Chapter 19) review frameworks for analysing gesture, and exemplify, through examples of pointing, posture, placement and posing during sightseeing, the role that gesture and movement play in maintaining the power relations and corresponding ‘ideology of conquest, of control and of possession’ (p. 255) characteristic of tourism. Mavers (Chapter 20) discusses snippets from a social semiotic analysis of mind-maps drawn by children in response to specific questions. She shows how interpreting the mind-maps in light of children’s reasoning about them and the researcher’s observations of their drawing can provide insights into children’s knowledge and ability to represent it by drawing on written text, image and visual–verbal relations in principled ways. Much more than a case-study paper, Chapter 21 is an exemplary contribution to a handbook, as Stenglin both introduces her framework for analysing the representational, interpersonal and compositional meanings of three-dimensional space and applies it to the analysis of an art exhibition – Ella Dreyfus’s <italic>Scumbag</italic>. The final contribution (Chapter 22) by West opens with numerous examples of designed sound (e.g. a car horn) and music (e.g. elevator music) in everyday life and calls for developing tools for accounting for the role sound and music play, in interplay with other semiotic resources, in specific contexts. West then presents a dense overview of a multilayered framework for multimodal transcription and analysis, developed to explain the role of music, gesture and speech at different levels (individual, interpersonal, institutional and societal) in music education interactions at secondary and tertiary level.</p>
<p>The collection undeniably captures the state of the art in multimodal analysis at the time of its publication. It paints a very rich picture of the field as almost every chapter adds a new perspective, turns to a different mode, and/or considers intersemiotic interaction in context/s different to those considered in the other contributions. It also provides a solid orientation to this research area by presenting the latest in the work and ideas of leading figures in multimodality such as Kress, Lemke, Norris, O’Halloran, Unsworth and Van Leeuwen. And, although a basic knowledge of semiotics is taken for granted, Jewitt’s introductory chapters and section prefaces, the glossary, and the notes on further reading and related topics accompanying many of the chapters are invaluable for newcomers to multimodality. The book provokes critical thought, too, by explicitly discussing the limitations of (specific approaches to) multimodal analysis and so takes an essential step towards improving multimodal research.</p>
<p>The collection’s richness is its major forte, but may also explain some of its weaker aspects. The large number of chapters included limits their length, potentially explaining why a small number of contributions don’t go far beyond giving examples of multimodal interactions and social practices that illustrate points obvious to multimodal researchers. Lack of space may be the reason why the volume hints at solutions for overcoming the limitations of multimodal analysis, rather than capitalising on ideas developed in chapters, such as Kress’s, of crucial relevance to efforts towards avoiding linguistic imperialism or impressionistic interpretations and constructing more stable analytical frameworks. Admittedly, few solutions have been proposed elsewhere; an example is the framework developed by Bateman and his colleagues for analysing page-based documents, which features principles for identifying modes, relating concrete features to a document’s rhetorical structure, building multimodal corpora and mapping multimodal genres (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357211434033">Bateman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434033">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While the handbook presents a very wide range of studies on multimodality and many useful conceptual and analytical tools from a variety of theoretical perspectives, there are areas and perspectives that are yet to receive more attention in multimodal research. Tools for analysing challenging practices such as classroom interactions or texts like websites, theatrical performances and films, or the interaction between the design and use of software supporting multimodal text composition and communication, for example, have not found their way into the handbook. Additionally, many chapters, especially those in Part II, touch upon issues of power and social change and highlight a burning need of methods for revealing the role multimodal communication plays in concealing and supporting, or drawing attention to and subverting, social boundaries and inequality, political or commercial agendas; combining multimodal with critical discourse analysis holds much promise for addressing this need (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434033">Chouriaraki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434033">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>). Perspectives from multimodal genre and corpus studies and practice-based research on multimodality in the arts, architecture, and sound, graphic, software and hypermedia design, too, hold much value for multimodal analysis. These uncovered areas evidence the shifting ground that multimodal research explores as it deals with constant transformations in the roles that different modes and their relations play in ever-changing social practices.</p>
<p>Finally, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434033">Jewitt and Van Leeuwen’s (2001)</xref> <italic>Handbook of Visual Communication</italic>, the volume’s focus is not on presenting neatly delineated theoretical and methodological approaches that its readers can then apply to multimodal analysis, even though Part I and several other contributions (e.g. Unsworth and Cléirigh; Stenglin) do introduce readily applicable analytical concepts and frameworks. Such delineation would produce a map of multimodal analysis suitable for an even broader audience, including undergraduate students, but would risk limiting its appeal for more advanced students and researchers (including those new to multimodal analysis), who are bound to appreciate its current strengths. These lie in presenting multimodality as a complex and dynamic yet productive ground for reflexive and multidisciplinary collaboration and in immersing readers in a multitude of theoretical perspectives, challenging research questions and real-world communication problems pertinent to multimodality.</p>
