<title>Helen Rehr, MSW, PhD, 1919–2013</title>
<p>Helen Rehr, Emerita Professor at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, died in her New York home on February 13, 2013. She was a remarkable woman who made enormous contributions as a clinician, program innovator, mentor, teacher, administrator, policy advocate, practice researcher, and benefactor to social work in health and mental health settings both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>A native New Yorker, her focus was always “global.” Among other international efforts, in 1991, she established an innovative International Enhancement of Leadership Program at Mt. Sinai whereby senior health and mental health social workers from Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand, and Singapore honed their clinical, managerial, practice research, and policy skills and shared their experience with each other as well as their Mt. Sinai colleagues. Several went on to get PhDs and to join the academy, while others assumed significant leadership positions in their home countries within their chosen fields.</p>
<p>Dr. Rehr was instrumental in establishing a triennial International Conference on Social Work in Health and Mental Health in which social work practitioners and academics meet on an equal footing to share ideas, research findings, and program innovations. Starting at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the conference has since been held at universities in Melbourne, Tampere, Quebec, Hong Kong, and Dublin. This year it will be hosted by the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Receiving her bachelor’s degree from Hunter College in 1940, she completed her master of social work in 1945 and her doctorate in social work in 1970 from Columbia University School of Social Work. She joined the staff at Mt. Sinai Hospital’s Department of Social Work Services in 1954 rising to the position of Director and taking the program to national and international prominence with its emphasis on practitioner research as integral to quality social work practice. Though she officially retired in 1986, she remained an indefatigable advocate for social work practice and practice-based research in health and mental health until her death. She authored more than 100 articles, books, and invited chapters on social work practice, research, and policy. In her capacity as director of the Academic Division of Social Work at Mt. Sinai, she mentored and taught generations of social workers and medical students psychosocial perspectives on health and mental health.</p>
<p>Dr. Rehr’s contributions to the field were recognized in her receipt of the Ida M. Cannon award from the Society of Hospital Social Work Directors, election to the Hunter College Hall of Fame and the Columbia University School of Social Work Hall of Fame. Two professorships are funded in her name: one at Columbia University and the other at the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College. The National Association of Social Workers recognized her as a “social work pioneer” and she was elected a fellow in the New York Academy of Medicine.</p>
<p>Always insistent on the parity between the academy and the agency, she was a persistent gadfly to academic pomposity. Until the end, she was as well an ardent cultural ambassador to the diverse charms of New York City. Her intellect, creativity, courage, personal warmth, and generosity of spirit will be greatly missed by social workers throughout the world.</p>
