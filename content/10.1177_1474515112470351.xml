<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is very often used during procedures performed in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL) to provide pain relief and to reduce feelings of discomfort and anxiety. When an anaesthetist is not assigned to the CCL, it is common for nurses to administer sedative and analgesic medication via the intravenous route, according to direction from the cardiologist performing the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112470351">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As recommended in guidelines developed by anaesthetic professional organisations, if there is no anaesthetist present, the nurse administering PSA must focus particular attention on monitoring respiratory function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112470351">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112470351">3</xref></sup> This is because side effects of intravenous sedative and analgesic medications can cause respiratory depression and partial obstruction of the patient’s airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112470351">4</xref></sup> Depression of respiratory drive manifests clinically as hypopnoeic hypoventilation, bradypnoea or periods of apnoea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112470351">5</xref></sup> Relaxation and consequent displacement of the pharyngeal musculature is the mechanism by which the sedated patient’s airway becomes obstructed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112470351">4</xref></sup> For convenience, respiratory depression and partial airway obstruction will be defined in this paper using the collective term ‘impaired respiratory function’.</p>
<p>Impaired respiratory function is a problem because it causes inadequate ventilation. As a consequence of inadequate ventilation, the amount of oxygen inhaled and the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled are reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112470351">5</xref></sup> If inadequate ventilation is undetected, and corrective interventions are not actioned, within a short space of time oxygenation can become inadequate for physiological requirements. In the most severe of consequences, the failure to identify inadequate ventilation and oxygenation leads to serious adverse events, such as disability or death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112470351">6</xref></sup> As a result of the iatrogenic and preventable nature of PSA-related adverse events, timely identification of impaired respiratory function facilitating the swift implementation of corrective interventions is essential whenever nurse-administered PSA is used in the CCL setting. In this context, the identification of specific factors that are associated with impaired respiratory function would be of considerable assistance in clinical practice, because it would aid nurses to identify groups of patients who would potentially benefit from even closer observation of respiration than is typically applied.</p>
<p>The incidence of impaired respiratory function related to nurse-administered PSA in the CCL is reported to range between 2.4% and 9.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112470351">7</xref></sup> However, in previous research only a few factors associated with impaired respiratory function during PSA have been identified. These include induction of deep sedation during defibrillation threshold testing or cardioversion, administration of propofol, and high doses of benzodiazepines and opioids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112470351">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112470351"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112470351">10</xref></sup> However, it is important to note that these factors only become apparent after a procedure has commenced. Demographic and clinical risk factors, which potentially can be screened by CCL nurses prior to commencement of the procedure, have not yet been identified. Advance indication of those at risk of impaired respiratory function would provide nurses with the opportunity to devise a plan of care that ensures intensive respiratory monitoring can be applied from the onset of the procedure.</p>
<p>In other clinical areas that also frequently utilise PSA, such as the emergency department and endoscopy unit, studies have identified that certain demographic and clinical risk factors potentiate the effects of sedative and analgesic medications on respiratory function. In these studies, to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for impaired respiratory function during PSA, comprehensive lists of potential factors were investigated, typically using multivariable logistic regression models. For example, in previous research investigators have examined whether age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Classification scores (indicator of the patient’s present health status and comorbidities), and smoking history are significantly associated with PSA-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112470351">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112470351">12</xref></sup> The previous research conducted in the CCL setting has not utilised multivariate statistics to investigate these potential demographic and clinical risk factors for impaired respiratory function during PSA. Therefore, further research is required to gain a better understanding of the conditions that are related or contribute to the onset of impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL.</p>
<sec id="section8-1474515112470351">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify pre-procedural demographic and clinical risk factors for impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL setting.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-1474515112470351">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A retrospective matched case–control design was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112470351">
<title>Sample and setting</title>
<p>The sample consisted of consecutive patients over 18 years of age who underwent a procedure in any one of the three CCLs within one private hospital and electrophysiology procedures in the Cardiac Investigation Unit of a public hospital. The study hospitals are both situated in the same metropolitan region of Australia, each servicing over 500 in-patients. In both hospitals, during procedures when anaesthetic services are not deemed necessary, nurses administer and monitor PSA. It is important to note, though, that there may be differences in nursing roles, staffing ratios and regulatory frameworks internationally. Nevertheless, the literature suggests similar practices to those described in this paper are most commonly employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112470351">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data from 573 procedures were analysed. These included 194 electrophysiology procedures and 379 coronary, vascular or structural heart procedures. Most of the procedures took place in the private hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 473). Data were excluded from four procedures performed in the private hospital because of patient age (&lt; 18 years). No data were excluded from procedures performed in the public hospital. Nurses administered PSA during 169/473 (36%) procedures at the private hospital and 80/100 (80%) procedures at the public hospital (total <italic>n</italic> = 249).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112470351">
<title>Matching procedure</title>
<p>Cases for matching were specified as patients who experienced impaired respiratory function, classified as SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 95%; eight respirations or less per minute; or intervention to maintain a patent airway. These criteria were chosen because they have been used to define respiratory complications in other studies, are readily available in the patient medical records and also because SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 95%, corresponds to a PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 80 mmHg (generally accepted as the cut-off point for hypoxia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112470351">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112470351">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112470351">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also, it is suggested to match as many controls per case as possible, even though there is only incremental benefit to matching more than four controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112470351">15</xref></sup> Therefore, we matched as many controls as possible to the 21 cases of impaired respiratory function that were identified in this study. As a result, some of the cases have more controls than others.</p>
<p>Controlling known intra-procedural confounders was a central concern for this study. Therefore, cases were matched with controls who did not have impaired respiratory function from the consecutive cohort based on the type of procedure, age (± 5 years) and gender. Age was controlled because, during initial analysis of the data, a significant inverse correlation was found between age and the total amount of sedative and analgesic medications used during the procedures. This indicated that cardiologists prescribed fewer medications for older patients than younger patients. Similarly, gender was controlled because previous research has shown that females require higher medication doses to induce sedation and analgesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112470351">16</xref></sup> By controlling for the type of procedure performed, this also controls for other intra-procedural confounders, such as the requirement for defibrillation threshold testing or cardioversion during the procedure, the use of supplemental oxygen and the duration of the procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1474515112470351">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Retrospective data were retrieved from a 2-month period (1 May–30 June 2010) at the private hospital and for a 1-month period at the public hospital (1 August–31 August 2011), using an electronic database to identify subjects. A data extraction tool was developed specifically for this study for the researchers to manually abstract data from the medical records. This tool was pilot tested on five medical records. Minimal changes were required and the tool was found to be efficient and easy to use. One researcher audited all the medical records to ensure data collection was consistent. The following data were retrieved: demographics, patient characteristics, procedural and sedation characteristics, nursing practices associated with PSA, and patient outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1474515112470351">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were transferred from the data extraction tool into SPSS v19 for analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to summarise categorical data, whereas means and standard deviations or median and inter-quartile range were calculated to describe the continuous data. Demographics, admission status, health status, physiological data and risk factors known to predict sedation-related complications in other populations were compared between matched cases and controls in order to identify potential risk factors to include in a multivariable model. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for univariate and multivariate analysis. In order to avoid unnecessary deletion of potentially important factors from the multivariate regression model, variables with statistical significance of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10 on univariate analysis were selected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112470351">17</xref></sup> It is also important to note that matching a different number of controls to cases did not influence the results because paired rather than independent statistical tests were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112470351">18</xref></sup> Multicollinearity was assessed by regressing each factor in the model on each other and considered present if <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.6. Principal component analysis was conducted to determine whether the factors that showed evidence of multicollinearity were measuring the same construct. Factors with Eigenvalue over 1 were combined into an overall score for further multivariate analysis. Backward stepwise multivariate conditional logistic regression based on the likelihood ratio was used. The final model was determined using an entry probability of 0.5 and removal probability of 0.10. As there was only a small amount of missing data, specifically related to the baseline blood pressure and baseline heart rate variables, no attempt was made to account for this missing data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Impaired respiratory function occurred during 8.3% (95% CI 4.9–11.7) of the procedures (<italic>n</italic> = 21) in which nurses administered PSA. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112470351">Table 1</xref> summarises the demographic characteristics of the cases of impaired respiratory function that were identified in this study. Only two of the cases could not be matched successfully for age within 5 years. Despite this, none of the potential intra-procedural confounders was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112470351">Table 2</xref>). Five of the 15 potential risk factors were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112470351">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Multivariate analysis found that only one risk factor was independently associated with impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA. According to the multivariable model, patients with impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL were 5.8 times more likely than their controls to have been admitted to the hospital as an emergency (OR 5.8; 95% CI 1.6–21.0; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1474515112470351">Table 4</xref>). However, there was evidence of multicollinearity between the emergency admission (patients admitted to hospital through the emergency department), transfer from the critical care unit for the procedure, requirement for respiratory support prior to the procedure and requirement for haemodynamic support prior to the procedure factors (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.6). Principal component analysis revealed that these four factors were in fact measuring the same construct (one component with Eigenvalue&gt;1). The new factor, ‘acute illness’, was input into a further multivariable regression model with the remaining factor with statistical significance <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10, ‘smoking history’, and backward stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis was again performed. According to the regression model, with each additional indicator of acute illness, patients were 78% more likely than their controls to experience impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.19–2.67; <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1474515112470351">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify pre-procedural demographic and clinical risk factors for impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL setting. Results indicate that with each additional indicator of acute illness, patients were nearly two times more likely to experience impaired respiratory function. These results have considerable face validity, as it is probable that patients with acute illness had underlying conditions that impacted on their cardiopulmonary function, which could have mediated impaired respiratory function.</p>
<p>The incidence of impaired respiratory function in the present study (8.3%; 95% CI 4.9–11.7) is in line with previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112470351">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112470351">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112470351"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112470351">22</xref></sup> As such, the results are likely to be applicable also to other CCLs in Australia and in overseas institutions that employ similar processes for the administration and monitoring of PSA. Although evidence in this area is limited, the finding that patients with acute illness were most likely to experience impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL is consistent with previous research. In the endoscopy setting, patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112470351">2</xref></sup> scores (indicating poorer health status and greater comorbidities) were at greater risk of PSA-related cardiopulmonary complications during procedures, and in-patients were more likely to have unforeseen cardiopulmonary events when PSA was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112470351">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the results from our study are valid from a clinical viewpoint and are consistent with previous research, we recommend that further studies be conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of interventions to improve patient outcomes. There are many potential areas on which to focus this research. For example, although guidelines for monitoring respiratory function during PSA without an anaesthetist present recommend that one practitioner’s primary responsibility must be to perform patient monitoring, in real-world practice it is most common for the nurse who administers PSA to also be responsible for acquiring equipment during the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112470351">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112470351"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112470351">3</xref></sup> Therefore, in many circumstances, especially for patients with acute illness who often undergo interventional rather than diagnostic procedures, the nurse may be absent from the procedure room for short periods of time. One potential alternative course of action would be to allocate two nurses to the procedure for patients with acute illness. This would permit one nurse to continually monitor respiratory function with another nurse available to organise any equipment that may be required during the procedure. This may result in earlier detection and treatment of impaired respiratory function. However, it would be particularly important for the effectiveness of this intervention to be evaluated both in terms of patient outcomes and the extra costs associated with utilising greater nursing resources.</p>
<p>Another intervention that could potentially improve outcomes for patients at risk of impaired respiratory function is to use capnography to monitor ventilation. Capnography may be of particular benefit when used for these patients because previous research has shown that practitioners are 18 times more likely to detect respiratory depression when utilising this technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112470351">24</xref></sup> As such, we recommend that further studies be conducted to ascertain the added benefit of using capnography during PSA for patients with acute illness.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>A strength of this study is the methods used to address multicollinearity between potential risk factors. The first backward stepwise conditional logistic regression model identified only one independent risk factor for impaired respiratory function: emergency admission. As a result of multicollinearity, the impact of being transferred from the critical care unit and requiring respiratory or haemodynamic support was not appreciated statistically. Various methods have been employed in epidemiological studies to address issues associated with multicollinearity in logistic regression models. Using principal component analysis to combine factors is a preferred method to deal with multicollinearity, rather than deleting factors that are intercollinear from the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112470351">25</xref></sup> Although using principal component analysis to combine factors did not improve the goodness-of-fit of the model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.12 compared with 0.13), the final model is stronger than the first presented in this paper from a clinical viewpoint, as the implications for clinical practice are greater. The final model identifies considerably more people who are at risk of impaired respiratory function. For example, the patients who were not an emergency admission, yet deteriorated during their stay, were admitted to a critical care unit, and required either respiratory or haemodynamic support.</p>
<p>There are limitations, though, that should be considered in the interpretation of results. First of all, although intra-procedural confounders can be controlled using multivariate statistics, a matched case–control design was utilised because the sample size was relatively small. Using a matched case–control design permitted greater power to examine the effect of pre-procedural risk factors than if multivariate statistics had been used to control the intra-procedural confounders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112470351">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also, the accuracy and consistency of the information about practices and patient data associated with the use of nurse-administered PSA in the CCL could not be checked due to the retrospective nature of the data. Therefore, further prospective studies in this field are recommended, so that a researcher can directly observe impaired respiratory function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112470351">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify pre-procedural demographic and clinical risk factors for impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered PSA in the CCL. We found that patients with acute illness were more likely to experience impaired respiratory function. These results have considerable face validity, as it is probable that patients with acute illness had underlying conditions that impacted on their cardiopulmonary function, which could have triggered impaired respiratory function. Also, the results are consistent with previous research in this field. As such, the results from this study could be used to inform prospective studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions for impaired respiratory function during nurse-administered procedural sedation and analgesia in the CCL.</p>
