<abstract>
<p>This response focuses on the significance of ethnic minority psychology organizations and other related membership structures to early career psychologists (ECPs) and counseling psychology students. We discuss not only reasons for why students and ECPs may not be joining professional organizations, but also strategies for recruiting, supporting, and mentoring them through organizations which are focused on diversity.</p>

<p>In his intriguing article entitled <italic>Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011432755">Robert Putnam (1995)</xref> proposed that starting in late 1980s and through 1990s, Americans’ participation in civic organizations, whether professional, religious, or social, declined considerably. He noted that there were examples that contradicted such global assessment: In the 1990s Americans were more eager to join tertiary groups, such as non-profit environmental groups, to which they could write a check without ever directly engaging with a community of others. In addition, 1990s in the United States saw the proliferation of various types of support groups. Despite these counter-trends, Putnam submitted a now famous précis on American civic engagement: Americans were bowling more than ever, but their membership in bowling leagues had significantly dropped. They bowled alone.</p>
<p>American professional organizations, including the American Psychological Association (APA) and its divisions, are facing similar dilemmas in the early 21st century. Students who join the organizations are often required or strongly encouraged by their faculty members to gain entrance into professional organizations. Many of these students do not renew their dues and become full members when they are early career professionals (ECPs). Moreover, there are other trends that are curious and possibly alarming that APA and its many affiliate organizations are facing. For example, ECPs who do join the larger organizations do not join divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011432755">Westefield, 2011</xref>). Indeed, the current data show that of all the APA membership in 2001, more than half belonged to a division, whereas in 2010, only 40% belonged to a division. This number dropped drastically for ECPs: In 2010 less than 12% of early career members (defined as those within 7 years of receiving their doctoral degree), had a division membership.</p>
<p>The APA is actively seeking to explore the causes and consequences of these trends. As a former chair and a division representative of the APA’s Committee on Early Career Psychologists (CECP), the first author has been actively involved in exploring the roots of and solution to this drop in membership by ECPs. One of the possibilities that has been held out is that both students and ECPs, like other Americans, are finding other ways of creating their communities within APA. It is possible that they are creating communities that provide them with opportunities to be within smaller groups of others with whom they share similar experiences and those who can truly support them. We argue that this is where we see the benefits and power of the ethnic minority psychological associations (EMPAs) within the APA.</p>
<p>Ethnic minority associations are likely to have a greater appeal to students and ECPs than a large, general organization. These organizations foster connections across varied divisional or professional interests. Many of them provide a way of engaging with other professionals not just within the United States, but internationally. For example, as shown in this contribution, the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA) draws a great number of Asian international students and early career scholars. As this contribution highlights, EMPAs become safe havens inside of which issues of marginalization and discrimination can be addressed. Lastly, whereas one of the main functions of professional organizations is to provide opportunities for networking and development, such opportunities may be limited for ECPs and students of color unless they seek these within more intimate groups such as offered by EMPA. These same arguments could be made for divisional membership for many students and ECPs: finding a home within Divisions 17 and/or 45 could further foster creation of needed communities. In an age in which it is increasingly difficult to establish meaningful professional relationships with colleagues because of hugeness of organizational membership and the fast pace of communication, such smaller organizations serve a vital function.</p>
<p>Another reason why ethnic minority organizations may be especially perceived by students and ECPs as welcoming spaces is that they better mirror their own ethnic and racial backgrounds and related lived experiences. In fact, a far greater percentage of students and ECPs are ethnic and racial minority individuals in contrast to the rest of APA membership. Thus, it is likely that these students and ECPs will seek and find mentorship and support in such smaller organizations.</p>
<p>In addition, those involved in student and ECP affairs in APA have long argued that most governance and leadership positions have been traditionally closed to newer members. Being simply an organizational consumer without an opportunity for advancement and involvement, especially through leadership, is likely to result in devaluing of membership in that organization. We want to suggest that organizations, such as ethnic minority psychological associations, offer far more opportunities for members to get directly involved and to gain leadership positions. Within smaller structures, more hands are needed for running an organization, and students as well as ECPs can offer insights, interests, skills, and backgrounds needed to move organizations forward. Such leadership and involvement opportunities are often limited or perceived as limited by students and ECPs within larger organizational structures such as APA as a whole.</p>
<p>Our above arguments are in no way an indictment of overall APA membership or divisional membership. In fact, in our experience, belonging to multiple organizations such as divisions (e.g., Society of Counseling Psychology), which further support and foster the vitality of ethnic minority organizations and its members, is tremendously important. In fact, many of us have found that it was through much smaller organizations within organizations (e.g., sections within Division 17) that we established our roots within APA and found our way toward EMPAs. Thus, the relationship of the APA or divisions with ethnic minority organizations may foster a cross-collaboration and development that is vital for a deeper, more meaningful engagement of ECPs and students within APA.</p>
<p>As students, the second and third authors want to acknowledge that many ethnically diverse students do not join EMPAs simply because they lack information. They may not know about the existence of these groups, much less about their purpose. Thus, we are delighted about this contribution and its potential to educate students.</p>
<p>A misconception about EMPAs among students and ECPs is that they only exist to serve as educational outlets to educate others about specific ethnic communities, or to serve as a spokesgroup for those communities. Thus, ethnic minority students may not be as interested in being with each other based solely on their ethnic/racial characteristics. What may be more salient in their academic journeys are their research and clinical interests, or perhaps a shared vision for their future goals in the field. Thus, students may opt to join groups that are more specifically oriented toward a particular field, as opposed to those that center around an ethnic minority group. For this reason, it is important for EMPAs to better advertise their mission so that students with a less salient racial/ethnic identity can also feel attracted to the purpose of the organization. For example, if it is better known that students can engage in research and clinical training related to ethnic minority mental health, they may feel that there are more reasons to join the group other than their ethnic minority status. Our hope is that this Major Contribution will serve such an advertising function.</p>
<p>The purpose of these professional organizations may be lost in translation from undergraduate school to graduate school and then to early career stage. As an undergraduate, the message can be portrayed as showing initiative on student’s part or an attempt at improving one’s academic and career development. This emphasis may be promoted as a noticeable membership on a curriculum vitae that enhances the possible acceptance into a graduate program.</p>
<p>In graduate school, the message to join may include an emphasis on the pressures of being a psychologist-in-training. However, encouragement of participation may appear to be a requirement without regard to the personal goals of the student (i.e., if we identify as ethnic minority students, not belonging to an EMPA may be perceived as a lack of personal cultural awareness). Furthermore, when we enter an early career professional stage, local, smaller organizations with a similar mission to the professional organization may appear more intriguing and worthwhile. Thus, because the purpose of the membership can be misconstrued, the bridge between the goals of the trainee and the goals of the organization may be weak or nonexistent. An approach to alleviating such disparities in the membership may include more active and informative e-mail lists or online matching services that connect members based on personal interests. Because connection between membership and personal goals can be a struggle, providing such specific content may create a foundation for membership of students or early career professionals that is based on guiding philosophies and personal missions of psychologists with similar interests. This service may also enhance the membership through mentorship and guidance, which may also be provided through the connection of similar interests, therefore, creating the smaller organization experience while still experiencing a benefit of a larger organization such as the APA.</p>
<p>Lastly, another reason why ethnic minority students and ECPs may choose not to participate in ethnic minority organizations may be related to the fact that they are already minorities in their programs and they do not want to continue to draw attention their minority status. The culture and climate of the student’s program is important to consider, given the potential for negative backlash that can result from joining an organization. For instance, we know a graduate counseling psychology student, a member of an ethnic minority group, who described experiencing a racial microaggression from an ethnic majority colleague because of her membership in a well-known ethnic minority professional organization. This student shared with us that on different occasions, her colleagues jokingly addressed her as “Ms. Minority” to bring attention to supposed resources she was getting because of her active involvement in the ethnic minority organization. As a result, the minority student often felt uncomfortable around this colleague; she also felt attacked for her involvement in the group.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of us have experienced that returning to academic programs after participation in EMPAs can be intensely jarring, given that students may resume being minorities and be surrounded by peers and colleagues who have misconceptions about them and their organizations. Thus, we wish to strongly recommend that EMPAs provide greater knowledge and awareness about their purposes to broader psychological community. There needs to be greater visibility of ethnic minority organizations, not only to attract ethnic minority students, but to also influence the climate of academic programs and departments that are less culturally sensitive. We applaud this contribution, and hope that it serves these functions.</p>
<p>In summary, belonging to EMPAs and divisions, such as 17 and 45, that are committed to diversity and justice can be profoundly validating for both students and ECPs. Sharing familiar experience with other students and ECPs, who face similar challenges because of continued racism and discrimination within a dominant society, may increase sense of community. Furthermore, such organizations can also become places, in which students and ECPs’ leadership skills are fostered and appreciated, ensuring the future of our organizations. Possibly, ethnic minority students and ECPs do and will continue to join these “leagues” to “bowl” together because it is more fun, fair, encouraging, and rewarding to belong to a community of similar-minded others. Possibly, because of these groups, they will not bowl alone.</p>
