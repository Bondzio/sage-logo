<abstract>
<p>Young women who carry BRCA1/2 mutations face difficult decisions in managing their hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk. Through this National Cancer Institute study, we sought to understand the process by which some young women choose risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) instead of alternative risk-management options. Data indicate that electing to undergo RRBM, although difficult, is experienced as a way to sidestep potentially devastating outcomes, such as stressful and costly high-risk screening, chemotherapy or radiation, or putting loved ones through the challenges of a cancer diagnosis. The decision to pursue RRBM is often the product of screening fatigue, encouragement from loved ones, and/or a sense of urgency to put one’s high-risk period behind one. By understanding how young carriers make decisions about surgical risk reduction, providers can better guide, counsel, and support patients in the important tasks surrounding this life-changing medical decision, thereby helping to increase the duration and quality of their lives.</p>

<body>
<p>Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were implicated in hereditary beast/ovarian cancer in 1994 and 1995, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312458182">Miki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312458182">Wooster et al., 1995</xref>). Female carriers who inherit a deleterious mutation in either of these genes have a significantly elevated lifetime risk of cancer. Breast cancer risk by age 70 is currently estimated to be 60% to 70% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 45% to 55% for BRCA2 mutation carriers; risk for ovarian cancer is estimated at 40% and 20% for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312458182">Clark &amp; Domchek, 2011</xref>). Although most mutation carriers who eventually develop cancer will do so after the young adulthood stage, a large clinic- and population-based study and a meta-analysis suggested that by age 30, 3.4% of BRCA1 mutation carriers and 1.5% of BRCA2 mutation carriers will develop breast cancer, and 1% to 2% of carriers of either mutation will develop ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312458182">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458182">Chen &amp; Parmigiani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312458182">Evans, Skrzynia, Susswein, &amp; Harlan, 2005/2006</xref>). Thus, both short- and long-term cancer risk are relevant considerations for young female mutation carriers.</p>
<p>For women who have completed testing and learned that they carry a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, breast cancer risk-management options are limited to surveillance, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing surgery. No strategy provides complete protection against cancer at this time. Current breast surveillance recommendations include monthly breast self-examination beginning at age 18; annual or semiannual clinical breast exam beginning at age 25; and annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning at age 25, or 5 to 10 years prior to the earliest diagnosis in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312458182">Pruthi, Gostout, &amp; Lindor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312458182">Robson &amp; Offit, 2007</xref>). Chemoprevention options include the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators, which have limited efficacy and can only be used for 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312458182">Pruthi et al., 2010</xref>), and oral contraceptives, although they are more effective in reducing ovarian cancer risk and their efficacy in reducing breast cancer risk is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312458182">Iodice et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) has become an increasingly utilized option among cancer-unaffected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312458182">Frost et al., 2000</xref>). Uptake rates exceeded 40% of BRCA1 and 30% of BRCA2 carriers within 5 years of learning their mutation statuses in a United Kingdom study, with most undergoing surgery within 2 years of genetic testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312458182">Evans et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, a Danish study found a 50% uptake rate within 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312458182">Skytte et al., 2010</xref>), and a recent United States study identified a 23% rate over 3.7 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458182">Beattie, Crawford, Lin, Vittinghoff, &amp; Ziegler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research demonstrated that most women benefit from predictive genetic testing for BRCA1/2 via reduced cancer worry and the ability to make definitive decisions about their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312458182">Watson et al., 2004</xref>). However, symptoms of depression and anxiety might increase in mutation-positive women over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312458182">van Oostrom et al., 2003</xref>), and hypervigilance about minor physical symptoms that are thought to be related to a possible cancer diagnosis have been identified as burdensome by some carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458182">Hoskins, Roy, Peters, Loud, &amp; Greene, 2008</xref>), although it also propels them to adhere to management recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458182">Hamilton, Williams, Skirton, &amp; Bowers, 2009</xref>). Postmastectomy, carriers tend to report significant reduction in cancer worry, but might struggle with issues related to body image and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458182">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>; van Oostrom et al.).</p>
<p>Although a good deal of previous research has been focused on the psychosocial implications of knowing one’s positive BRCA1/2 mutation status in general, less is known about the specific experiences of young women, defined here as those aged 18 to 35 years. These women might face a different set of challenges surrounding their cancer risk, because the tasks that characterize this phase of the life course include individuating from family of origin, completing education, solidifying oneself in a career, identifying a permanent partner, and commencing and/or completing family formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312458182">Arnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458182">Werner-Lin, 2008</xref>). Thus, the factors related to the decision to undergo RRBM are complex and have implications for timing of these tasks in general, as well as for romantic relationships, body image, and family formation and breastfeeding that are qualitatively different than those faced by their older counterparts, who are more likely to have completed these life course tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458182">Hoskins et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312458182">
<title>Anticipatory Loss</title>
<p>Coping with anticipatory loss, defined as “the experience of living with possible, probable, or inevitable future loss” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312458182">Rolland, 2006</xref>, p. 140), is a major task for BRCA1/2-positive women and those with whom they have close relationships. Anticipatory loss is characterized by feelings of uncertainty and fear, which can be managed through effective coping and adaptation (Rolland). For women who carry BRCA1/2 gene mutations, the specific stressors underlying anticipatory loss must be considered against the backdrop of both the family life cycle and individual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312458182">McDaniel, Rolland, Feetham, &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). Movement through and across the life cycle “arises from particular history and it is guided toward the future by shared values and goals . . . [including] the maintenance of health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312458182">Weihs &amp; Reiss, 2000</xref>, p. 19), with the latter being a primary focus for BRCA1/2<italic>-</italic>positive young women.</p>
<p>We define risk management as efforts to control the ambiguity inherent within predictive genetic testing information by assessing and selecting strategies—such as surveillance, chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery, or lifestyle modifications—to mitigate the threat that cancer poses to one’s physical well-being and life plans. Young mutation carriers make ongoing decisions about cancer risk management. This process requires weighing the complex, incompletely quantified potential for developing a life-threatening malignancy, and choosing a strategy aimed at maximizing risk reduction, survival, and the quality of personal and family life. This effort is a primary focus for young previvors (i.e., those who have not been diagnosed with cancer, but are living with knowledge of increased cancer risk), especially when strategies for managing risk conflict with other life goals relevant at this stage.</p>
<p>In many ways, living with a BRCA1/2 mutation is an illness experience. Although young breast and ovarian cancer previvors generally do not face an immediate health threat, they must cope with the likelihood of severe future illness (perhaps tomorrow, perhaps in one or several decades), which of necessity forces contemplation of the psychosocial and relationship implications of illness. Such experience might have important implications for women’s navigation of intimate relationships, including exposure to body image and sexuality issues. Additionally, levels of need between partners might be perceived as unequal during the early years of relationships, when partners might otherwise expect the dynamic to be more equitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312458182">Hamilton &amp; Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458182">Hoskins et al., 2008</xref>). Experiencing either a cancer diagnosis or a risk-reducing surgery during young adulthood might require previvors to depend on parents during a time when they might otherwise be working toward or achieving self-sufficiency (Hamilton &amp; Hurley; Hoskins et al.).</p>
<p>Anticipatory loss plays heavily into the experience of being BRCA1/2 positive, largely via the family illness narratives present in cancer-affected families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312458182">Werner-Lin &amp; Gardner, 2009</xref>). Living with this sense of impending significant loss appears to be managed through behaviors that demonstrate agency (self-efficacy), such as seeking and assimilating information from various sources, anticipating and preparing for how complex family dynamics are likely to play out in the future, and developing/negotiating concrete, timeline-based plans for reducing cancer risk while struggling to live a normal life.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined women’s decision making about risk-reducing surgery in the general BRCA1/2 population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312458182">Howard, Balneaves, Bottorff, &amp; Rodney, 2011</xref>). In our previous research, many young BRCA previvors contemplated both RRBM and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) as potential cancer risk-management strategies, but few considered RRSO prior to age 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458182">Hoskins, 2010</xref>). Many viewed ovarian cancer as a less-immediate threat, especially those whose family histories did not include cancer at this site. Young BRCA1/2 mutation carriers often thought of ovarian cancer as a risk in their 40s and 50s, rather than in their 20s and 30s. Because RRSO definitively ends the ability to bear children naturally<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312458182">1</xref></sup> (another potential loss), women who wished to have (additional) children did not seriously contemplate RRSO prior to completion of their families. Therefore, women who desired an active, definitive risk-reducing strategy prior to completion of childbearing often chose RRBM, because of its effectiveness in reducing breast cancer risk and in mitigating the threat of various types of losses during this stage of the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458182">Hoskins, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312458182">Rolland (2006)</xref> identified “grief over possible loss of future hopes and dreams” (p. 160) as one of the inherent challenges to coping with knowledge that one is genetically predisposed to illness or disease. Although BRCA1/2-positive women can reasonably hope for a relatively normal lifespan with regular screening and care during early adulthood, they might also grieve for what they believed would be a natural and carefree process of relationship and family formation. This process is potentially tainted by the task of communicating about cancer risk and worrying about (or possibly trying to prevent) passing a BRCA mutation to one’s children. Rolland listed hope for medical advances and meaning making as useful antidotes to this grief, and both of these have been observed frequently in the BRCA1/2 population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458182">Hoskins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458182">Hoskins et al., 2008</xref>). Young women’s choice of early mastectomy is another useful coping strategy, and the way that they create meaning from this experience warrants focused exploration.</p>

<p>The methods related to the current analysis have been described in full elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312458182">Werner-Lin, Hoskins, Doyle, &amp; Greene, 2012</xref>). In brief, these data emerged as part of the larger National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) qualitative study of young female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, which was completed as a doctoral dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458182">Hoskins, 2010</xref>). The researcher’s goal was to understand the various ways in which young women’s life course decisions and relationships were shaped by their knowledge of their mutation-related cancer risk. The study evolved from the ongoing 200-participant CGB Breast Imaging (BI) study of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, which is investigating novel screening strategies and a new psychosocial instrument (the Colored Ecogenetic Relationship Map, or CEGRM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312458182">Peters, Hoskins, Prindiville, Kenen, &amp; Greene, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312458182">Peters et al., 2004</xref>). Our involvement in the psychosocial component of this study included contact over time with many mutation carriers of various ages and backgrounds. Young participants seemed to face particularly challenging dilemmas in reconciling their mutation status with life course goals, and were eager to discuss these issues in an open-ended format. Participants were recruited from three sources: 14 from the existing BI participant population; 44 from the membership of Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE), an online education, support, and advocacy group for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families; and 2 through snowball sampling.</p>
<p>Telephone interviews lasted between 30 and 160 minutes. All were conducted by the first author (Hoskins), who had had at least one previous clinical encounter with each of the women recruited through the BI study during the CEGRM sessions. Six BI participants had also previously participated in a qualitative pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458182">Hoskins et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, Hoskins met several of the FORCE and snowball participants during the 2009 FORCE annual conference, which took place during the data collection period. These prior encounters might have facilitated participants discussing personal relationship information in the context of their experiences as mutation carriers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312458182">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>All participants provided verbal consent via telephone to participate in a brief telephone screening interview to ascertain their eligibility for the qualitative interview. Those who qualified and were enrolled provided verification of their BRCA1/2 mutation status, along with written informed consent between the screening and qualitative interviews; verbal consent was also obtained at the start of the qualitative interview. We informed participants that pseudonyms would be used in any published material based on these interviews, and invited them to choose their own pseudonyms. We explained that participation was completely voluntary, that they could withdraw from the study at any time or refuse to answer any question(s), and that their decision regarding participation would not affect their ability to participate in the BI study or any future studies conducted through CGB. Each agreed to have her interview digitally recorded and transcribed, and we promised a summary of findings. A professional transcription service transcribed each interview, and we proofread each transcript.</p>
<p>Interview questions were open ended, semistructured, and guided by a prepared outline. Because these data were part of a larger study, the scope of questions reached far beyond the scope of this article, to include topics such as family history of cancer, experience of genetic counseling and testing, history of intimate relationships and disclosure of mutations therein, and family formation experience and plans. Probes were used to elicit additional information, as prompted by the interviews.</p>
<p>The small quantity of existing research on this specific population required in-depth qualitative analysis to identify and describe the most pertinent issues and characterize the complex ways in which BRCA1/2<italic>-</italic>positive young women think, behave, and create meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458182">Daly, 2007</xref>). Qualitative research and grounded theory allowed for the discovery, identification, and pursuit of new variables as they emerged, aided by the modification or supplementation of interview questions throughout the study process and our suspension of preconceived notions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312458182">Ambert, Adler, Adler, &amp; Dentzner, 1995</xref>; Daly; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312458182">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). Open-ended questions were used to elicit participants’ thoughts and ideas regarding sensitizing concepts, with awareness that other concepts might emerge that would contribute to a more complete understanding of the topic and population being examined. This permitted development of a substantive theory unique to a specific area of inquiry, rather than a higher level formal theory (Daly). Finally, theoretical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312458182">Glaser, 1978</xref>) was facilitated by our continued involvement in the context of the BI study and ongoing work with FORCE.</p>
<p>We applied open coding to interview transcript segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312458182">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). We focused on repeated use of words, phrases, and ideas by multiple participants, coded purely on content, and grouped into categories. In the next wave of axial coding, we searched across and within cases for relationships between coding categories to broaden our understanding of broader phenomena; for example, themes related to the impact of a cancer diagnosis on children emerged in response to various questions throughout the interview. We reassembled the data based on emergent themes, and recoded based on higher-order concepts until we reached theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312458182">Patton, 2002</xref>). A final wave of selective coding brought together the most illustrative data to tell a core story about the concept of cancer risk for these participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458182">Daly, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To maximize the trustworthiness of the data, we evaluated its credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312458182">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). We attended to credibility through the use of a specific focus, and through peer review and debriefing throughout the research process. We facilitated transferability by providing a thorough contextual description to frame this research, as well as its central assumptions, which will allow others to make their own judgments regarding transferability of findings. Our accounting for changes in research context, when applicable, served to increase the dependability of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312458182">Trochim &amp; Donnelly, 2006</xref>). We increased confirmability by using a stance of “empathic neutrality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312458182">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 50), being empathic toward participants but neutral toward the findings. We conducted a confirmability audit to examine data collection and analysis, allowing for recognition of potential bias (Trochim &amp; Donnelly).</p>

<title>Participant Demographics</title>
<p>Participants ranged from 21 to 36 years of age, with an average age of 29.6. They had known about their BRCA mutations for as little as 1 month and as long as 9 years at the time of their interviews. Sixty-five percent carried mutations in BRCA1, and 35% were BRCA2 positive. The vast majority (97%) of participants were White, with 20% of those describing themselves as Ashkenazi Jewish. Twenty percent were single or in noncommitted relationships, 16.7% were unmarried but in committed relationships, 6.7% were engaged, and 56.7% were married at the time of their interviews. About half (48.3%) had at least one child, whereas the other half (51.7%) had not yet commenced childbearing or did not plan to have children.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732312458182">
<title>Viewing RRBM as an Alternative to Cancer</title>
<p>Participants consistently reported very high levels of perceived cancer risk; this was one of the most prominent themes to emerge from our analysis. Many women believed that breast cancer was not only likely, but inevitable, unless they took active steps to prevent it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312458182">2</xref></sup> For these women, risk-reducing mastectomy was seen as the “lesser of two evils.” Although they understood that choosing to have this major surgery would present significant challenges, these were seen as less daunting than dealing with a cancer diagnosis. For example, Rylan (age 34) had given careful thought to her risk before changing her management strategy from surveillance to surgery:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just decided I was not worrying, but waiting to get cancer. . . . I have up to an eighty-seven percent chance, and if I don’t get it, I might win the lottery, too, but chances are I won’t. And chances are I won’t not get cancer. To me it sort of became more a matter of when am I going to get it. I mean, I realize I have a chance of not getting it ever, but the risk statistically was so high that it made sense to try to avoid the risk.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Chris (33) recalled having felt psychologically burdened by the threat of cancer, and reported that making the decision to proceed with RRBM was a relief:
<disp-quote>
<p>You just kind of feel like you’re underneath a black cloud all the time, and I just felt like it was coming, and you just want to beat it before it gets you. . . . I mean, you kind of forget about the thirteen to twenty percent chance that you won’t get it and focus on “I am going to get it.” And so, you just feel like you’re waiting for it. And knowing that I already had two lumps that were giving me trouble, you just kind of think, “Well, this is stupid. It’s stupid to sit here and dwell on that and think it’s going to happen. Might as well just have the surgery.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Rylan and Chris described a trajectory whereby they lived with knowledge of their cancer risk for several years before deciding that the risk was not worthwhile, and that proceeding with surgery felt like a more reasonable course of action.</p>
<p>For many participants, an intense desire to avoid breast cancer originated from intimate knowledge of the cancer diagnosis and/or treatment experiences of a close relative. Having learned of her mutation just 2 months prior to her interview, Isabelle (22) was already contemplating RRBM. She and her sister Lilly both believed their breast cancer risk to be very high, because their mother had been diagnosed at age 25. Although this had occurred before their birth, both sisters grew up knowing that their mother had “fake boobs,” and had learned the details of her experience during their early adulthood. Isabelle reported that soon after testing positive for a BRCA mutation, she thought of RRBM as too extreme:
<disp-quote>
<p>I definitely had a warped sense of the results of breast cancer . . . not everybody turns out alive from it. And, even if you do, even if you find it early, you still have to go through cancer treatment and you still have to have this changed body when you’re finished with it. Even if I do surveillance for twenty years, if they do find something I still get cancer, and I might have to go through chemo [chemotherapy] and radiation and surgery, so maybe my sister isn’t so crazy for thinking about prophylactic mastectomy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the 2 months since she had received her genetic test results, Isabelle’s evaluation of RRBM had shifted significantly. Understanding that early onset breast cancer was a real threat, she imagined more vividly the experience of a cancer diagnosis, and early RRBM seemed like a more reasonable option and a desirable alternative to the more negative experience of cancer.</p>
<p>Whereas Isabelle used her mother’s experience with cancer as a model, Annie (32) related strongly to her cousin’s experiences. She shared how watching her cousin battle breast cancer in her early 30s had motivated her to pursue an early RRBM:
<disp-quote>
<p>I saw my cousin go through [a mastectomy], so I’m very aware of how invasive it is. And, I guess for me, I’ve seen what she’s had to go through on top of the mastectomy that she had to have, and that’s what I don’t want to have to deal with. I mean, I would do ten bilateral mastectomies versus what she’s had to go through with chemo and everything. So I think for me just trying to keep in perspective with that. . . . [My surgeon] didn’t minimize it, but it’s definitely not as dramatic as it would be if I actually had breast cancer and they were working away to try to get all the breast tissue out that they could.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ellen (34) had long assumed that she would meet the same fate as her mother, a bitter legacy of her mother’s breast cancer diagnosis and resulting death. At the time of her interview, she had recently made the decision to pursue RRBM:
<disp-quote>
<p>One way that I think my mom’s death directly impacted me was that for a long time, I sort of assumed I would die early. Unconsciously. I mean, I wouldn’t have said it, but . . . it was just underneath it all. I assumed I would get cancer and die early. And when I realized in my mid-20s that that was my assumption, it really startled me. And so, I feel very lucky that I’ve been able to do all these things and have all these connections and do something about the risk. I think I’ll probably have the surgery within the next year, because of the issues that—well, if I wait and something happens, then [I] can’t go back. Then I have cancer, and then I have to be treated, and it becomes a different ball game. So I think I’m going to go ahead with it sooner rather than later.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, the desire to avoid what was seen as a very negative experience in a cancer diagnosis was a powerful motivator toward surgery, despite the latter’s many disadvantages. Those who chose early mastectomies often reported that they were opting for mastectomy instead of cancer; they believed one or the other must happen. Individual perceptions of vulnerability to cancer in the 20s and 30s, based largely on each mutation carrier’s knowledge of family cancer history, were important determinants of whether surgery was pursued during young adulthood or delayed into the fifth decade; the latter comprised a deliberate choice to extend the period during which one lives with elevated risk and, in most cases, frequent screening (with all its challenges and stresses).</p>

<sec id="section8-1049732312458182">
<title>Urgency to Complete Surgery</title>
<p>Although many participants reported that they had not yet given serious thought to pursuing RRSO, almost all had either already undergone RRBM or planned to do so eventually. The sense of urgency they felt to complete this surgery emerged as a second powerful theme in our analysis; for those who had not yet achieved their relationship and family formation goals, the urgency often extended to these related endeavors. For example, Charlotte (26) believed that she needed “to get married, have babies, so [she could] do this [surgery] and not have to worry about it.” Living with the knowledge that a mastectomy was looming in her future was very uncomfortable; she looked forward to putting it behind her, and had given careful thought to how she could move her surgery to an earlier point in her life.</p>
<p>We did not anticipate encountering the sizable group of participants who were either contemplating or had completed RRBM at a very early age, defined for our purposes as those completed by age 30. Although mutation-positive women at this age often rightly cited their very high lifetime risk of breast cancer (as high as 85% by some estimates), their near-term risk was much, much lower; in fact, the incidence of breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation carriers under the age of 30 is thought to be as low as 1% to 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458182">Chen &amp; Parmigiani, 2007</xref>). Women pursuing mastectomy at this stage were often unmarried, and many had not yet commenced childbearing; their decisions to undergo early RRBM were frequently the result of very high perceived risk of breast cancer, and/or low tolerance for cancer risk in general. Often, this was also a product of their family history of cancer. For example, Lilly (25) had been aware all her life that her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 25. She stated that after she found out that she carried a BRCA mutation,
<disp-quote>
<p>I gave myself an arbitrary year, year-and-a-half timeframe. My mom . . . got breast cancer at 25. I had my first real post-BRCA [testing] appointment on my [25th] birthday. So, it was pretty ironic . . . I feel like I’m treading on thin [ice], because I’m the same age as my mom when she had it. So, I would like to get it done sooner rather than later.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Having undergone genetic testing so close to the age at which her mother was diagnosed, Lilly’s sense of immediate vulnerability to breast cancer was elevated, and early mastectomy felt like a reasonable intervention.</p>
<p>Some participants with very little information about family cancer history also chose early mastectomy, precisely because they believed that they had no way to gauge when they might be at risk. Pauline (30), recently married and without children, decided to proceed with RRBM, because
<disp-quote>
<p>I have absolutely no idea what cancer looks like. I have no idea what cancer feels like. How it affects people, who it takes, who it spares. I’ve got nothing. I’ve got just this big fat number that the geneticist flopped in front of me when she gave me my status that says eighty-seven percent. And so, I know it’s irrational to think that I have an eighty-seven percent chance today, but that’s sort of how I feel to a certain extent because I have no sense how else to gauge it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pauline seemed to suggest that although she knew on an intellectual level that her near-term breast cancer risk was relatively low, her knowledge that cancer could occur during that interval was enough to motivate her to complete the surgery early. As she looked ahead to a potentially years-long period of regular surveillance and the anxiety that would come along with it, Pauline acutely anticipated the loss of her comfortable, carefree lifestyle and good health.</p>
<p>Like Pauline, Charlotte (26) was moving toward early mastectomy. She explained that her perceived risk of breast cancer was elevated because of what she had learned from her health care providers, and she felt more vulnerable as she entered her late 20s:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first got [my genetic test results], I would probably rate [my risk] pretty low, but because my cousin had it at thirty-seven, I guess there are some people that say ten years out is when I should really start worrying and considering prophylactic surgery. And so, as I get closer to twenty-seven, I’m definitely getting more and more worried that, that it could become a reality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charlotte went on to state that her exposure to the previvor community had increased her awareness that her mutation made her vulnerable to more aggressive cancers and made the threat of cancer seem more frightening, even though she had seen her mother survive and do well; this new perception was closely tied to her motivation for pursuing early mastectomies.</p>
<p>A belief that completing surgery while life is relatively uncomplicated (i.e., before they make commitments to a partner and children) is a wise choice increased some participants’ health-related sense of urgency to complete risk-reducing surgeries. Several women identified their single, child-free status as a motivator for the timing of their RRBM. Linda (24) illustrated both motivations nicely when she stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was planning on having [RRBM] at some point and . . . the onset age on my dad’s side of breast cancer is actually pretty young. Several women had breast cancer in their late twenties and early thirties. And I kind of thought that it’s inevitable that I’m going to have it and I’ll probably have it sooner than later, so I need to act very quickly. . . . As well as a sense of urgency, I also just kind of thought, there’s never going to be a convenient time in anyone’s life to go through something like this, to have a major surgery like this. I’m not married right now; I have no children right now. I have a flexible job that’s going to be awesome about this, let me go ahead and get it taken care of now . . . so I was kind of of the mindset that as soon as I can get these things off of me, then the more days I’ll be waking up ready for the rest of my life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, many participants reported feeling a sense of urgency to proceed quickly with surgery once they had made the decision to do so, preferring to minimize the time between decision making and surgery date. This was the case for Heather (35), who was looking forward to putting the experience of surgery behind her as quickly as possible:
<disp-quote>
<p>I started the process pretty much a year ago in terms of making that phone call to see the genetic counselor. And I just want to be done. Not done, because once it’s done it won’t be done. It will definitely be a process, but it’s like, I want to be on the other side of it. I want to be on the healing side and on the process of knowing what I’m feeling and figuring out life from here rather than right now, it just feels like a limbo stage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Heather sought to keep the time during which she had to look forward to the unpleasant experience of surgery as short as possible, another way of mitigating anticipatory loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312458182">
<title>Screening Fatigue</title>
<p>Participants who knew that they carried BRCA1/2 mutations but were not yet ready to pursue surgical risk reduction often relied on intensive screening/surveillance to manage their cancer risk. This strategy was attractive because it allowed young women to maintain full functionality of their breasts and reproductive organs in the period during which they were most likely to be focused on sexuality, physical attractiveness, and family formation. However, even when participants chose to rely on this method of risk management, they often remained skeptical of its efficacy; over time, the cumulative effects of participants’ doubt that screening was effective and the morbidity associated with frequent cancer screening led them to abandon surveillance and elect to undergo risk-reducing surgery. Rachel (33) began to doubt her ability to tolerate the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in screening as she moved from her 20s to her 30s:
<disp-quote>
<p>All the doctors kept telling me, “You’re at risk in the neighborhood of ten years before your mom had it.” So, here I was, Mom was forty, I was twenty-nine or thirty, just shy of my thirtieth birthday. . . . There was definitely a reality of the fact that this could be happening. Nobody tests a thirty-year-old woman for anything like that. So what’s to say it’s not already growing? Do you really think when you go in to the typical OB/GYN [obstetrician/gynecologist] that she’s very intent and closely watching the breast tissue when she’s doing a hand examination on a thirty-year-old? I am not sold on that. So I definitely had, I think, almost an undue fear because of knowing that information.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rachel was not alone in having chosen to pursue early mastectomy after several years’ experience participating in intensive surveillance. For many women, repeated cycles of mammograms, MRIs, clinical breast exams, and so forth, resulted in screening fatigue, an inability to continue to tolerate all the aggravation, stress, worry, and fear that accompanied scheduling, anticipating, undergoing, and waiting for test results, as well as following up on abnormalities (most of which were false positives). Those whose screening tests revealed suspicious findings that required follow up (repeat tests after a waiting period, biopsies, and occasionally significant surgery), with an unavoidable increase in the frequency of visits and health care costs, often came to believe that the price they were paying for their surveillance strategy was just too high. Among the participants, some were just starting to experience screening fatigue when interviewed, and were beginning to contemplate RRBM sooner than they had previously planned. Charlotte (26) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I go twice a year and I have a routine of tests done that’s not all done in one day. So, it seems like I’m constantly going to get different tests and waiting for results, and even though it’s only been a couple years, it’s already to the point where I’m like, “How much of this do I feel like doing?” . . . Every time I go, it stresses me out a little bit, even though I try to stay calm, and I haven’t had too many scares or anything like that. And so at this point I am already considering surgery younger than I thought I would, or perhaps before I get married, just because I’m . . . sick of dealing with the testing all the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others had already undergone early RRBM, and recalled the role of screening fatigue in their decision making. Kristy (29) completed RRBM 2 years prior to her interview, and remembered,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was really sort of traumatic . . . having the irregular [screening] results, and I had that a couple times. And I kind of got to the point where I was like, this is great that I’m able to get screened high-risk and the doctors are extra careful with it, but it’s kind of to the point where it’s just making me uncomfortable, because everything is a red flag, and everything they want to explore more, and everything is just sort of scary, because you never know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Grace (31) recalled the years during which she was being screened as
<disp-quote>
<p>terrifying, because every time you get an abnormal [test result] you think, “Is this the time it’s cancer?” So you start mentally preparing for it. If it is [cancer], then what surgery option would I do, and what kind of treatment would I need? . . . You take it to the next level.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trixie (27) was recovering from her recent RRBM at the time of her interview. The youngest of four sisters, she recalled having met some resistance from members of her family, and how her determination to eliminate the stress of frequent screening allayed their fears about her plans:
<disp-quote>
<p>By the time I went to the doctor, I had my mind made up about what kind of surgery I wanted, so it was funny, my sister, who’s negative, went to all of my appointments with me and she’s like, “I was worried about you doing this, but once I saw you talking to doctors, I knew that you knew what you were talking about.” So, I went in with my own plan and thankfully the doctors agreed. And I was ready to do it. I was just focused on no more bad MRIs, no more surveillance . . . actually when I got my pathology back from the doctor [after] surgery, from the breast tissue that they removed, there wasn’t cancer in either breast, but in both of them there were some suspicious cells that they suspect were precancerous. They said, “We don’t know what these cells are, but in somebody high risk, they were there, and that’s not good.” So, there was some validation for my surgery.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As she neared the end of her breast reconstruction process, Trixie reported that completing the surgery had indeed given her an enormous sense of relief from the worry she had experienced with each round of screening, including stress and anxiety about the timing of her future surgery.</p>
<p>At the time of her interview, Ellie (27) was making the arrangements for her RRBM, which would take place a few months after her 28th birthday. Her powerful explanation of her rationale for transitioning from surveillance to surgical risk reduction at such a young age provided a perfect illustration of screening fatigue:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first found out about [the mutation], I felt like, okay, I know that my risks are higher, but I’m not going to deal with it for another ten years, I thought, so it’s nothing I’m even going to think about. I’m just going to do my surveillance. But little did I know that doing surveillance every few months really weighs on you, and it’s not like just a regular doctor exam. It’s a real heavy-duty thing, and every time you go in for surveillance, you start to realize that, “Oh, I’m not just going in to check on things, I’m going in to see if I got cancer.” You realize, “This isn’t me preventing cancer; this is me just finding it.” So, it started the past couple years to really sink in that I guess I’m not going to wait until I’m thirty-five, because I can’t continue this surveillance every six months and expect that I’m going to be cancer free. A lot of women who do get cancer in their thirties will say the cancer has been growing there for five or ten years. It just made me think, “You know what? I don’t want cancer to start growing at all.” That’s why I kind of decided this is much more of an issue in the present than I thought it was.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each of these examples nicely illustrates a thoughtfully crafted, highly individualized tradeoff; rather than continue to live with the anxiety and anticipated loss of time, confidence in one’s health, and so forth, these young women were choosing to go through the very intense, physically and emotionally difficult experience of surgery and reconstruction to be able to largely put these concerns behind them and move forward with their lives without the constant shadow of breast and ovarian cancer risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312458182">
<title>Timing of Surgery Relative to Family Formation</title>
<p>Another important theme emerged regarding the timing of RRBM relative to family formation goals. Many participants reported that they had struggled to find a risk-management strategy that would accommodate both their desire to utilize surgical risk reduction and their wish to have—and to breastfeed—children. For many, this resulted in contemplating and often choosing risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) prior to completion of childbearing. Forgoing the opportunity to breastfeed was described as a major loss and personal sacrifice by most women, but it was ultimately judged preferable to proceeding through the childbearing years under the constant shadow of cancer risk. Charlotte (26) exemplified these issues:
<disp-quote>
<p>Previously, I was set on wanting to have children and wanting to be able to breastfeed. . . . I’m pretty small-chested anyway, not a huge deal, [so] once I was able to [breastfeed my kids, I’d] go ahead and have the mastectomies. Now I’m thinking I’m definitely getting a little bit stressed and tired of all the testing and wondering how much longer I want to do this, [and I’m getting] a little bit of the pressure from my family. I’m considering doing it at a younger age and not necessarily having to breastfeed my children. I’ve talked about it with my good friend who lost her mom to cancer. . . . It comes down to what risks do I want to take, do I want to put myself at increasing the risk every day, every year, and not being there for my children? Or, getting rid of the risk now or reducing it, and for certain being there for my children and, you know, not having the breastfeeding experience, but, like I said, reducing the risk?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charlotte had come to this decision as a single person looking to her future, which she expected would include marriage and childbearing. Other participants were already married or actively moving toward childbearing, and expressed similar sentiments with regard to RRBM. Rose (30) reported that her motivation to get her RRBM out of the way before she and her husband started a family, and her skepticism about effective surveillance during pregnancy, were strong:
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband and I are thinking of having kids in the next couple years, and there are some issues with monitoring breast cancer and being pregnant. And, I didn’t like those risks and I didn’t also like the thought of having kids and then what if I got breast cancer when I had a kid or while I was pregnant? . . . The thought of having to do something like this in the future, like, what if I do put it off and then have kids, and do it in ten years? I don’t want to do it when I have little kids. If I could prevent that why wouldn’t I have the surgery now as opposed to later, when I have little kids running around?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly for Rose and her husband, the loss that they would incur in dealing with a cancer diagnosis or a risk-reducing surgery after starting family seemed much more significant than the loss they would contend with in coping with RRBM prior to having children, so they pursued RRBM before moving forward with any family formation plans.</p>
<p>For Grace (31), making the decision to try to conceive became a game changer in her risk-management plans. Through her late 20s, Grace and her husband had agreed that they would consider RRBM after they had had at least one child, but some abnormal test results during her final screening before they planned to conceive raised some doubts for her husband:
<disp-quote>
<p>He came to the decision before I did. He and my mom had gone to [a race] while I was out of town, and I guess being there without me it sort of hit them, the reality of . . . starting a family and what if something were to happen to me in the next nine months? So I got back from my trip and he sits me down and says, “We need to have a talk. I think the plan needs to change.” [A social worker at the hospital] helped me figure out how to just grieve about it and take the time to accept it, and know that it’s the right thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Coming to agreement on the timing of her surgery was a challenge for Grace and her husband, and having to consider delaying their plans for having their first baby was difficult for Grace. Ultimately, they chose to complete RRBM first, and Grace became pregnant with her son just a few months after her surgery. Looking back, she was glad to have the surgery behind her so she could focus on having a healthy, stress-free pregnancy without worrying that every change to her body was a potential source of worry, and was looking forward to being a happy, relaxed new mother.</p>
<p>Grace’s story demonstrates two important principles. First, it is an example of making a risk-management decision that trades a potential future loss for a real, current loss—it demonstrates her choice to let go of anticipatory loss and face a real one, so that she can put both behind her. Second, Grace’s story shows that partners of young BRCA1/2-positive women are sometimes very involved in decision making and planning for risk management; it was Grace’s husband who initiated their consideration of an earlier RRBM, and it was his genuine concern for her health and her ability to be an active and healthy mother to their future children that pushed them to consider changing their plans.</p>
<p>Ally (24) provided a final example of someone for whom the needs of her future children were paramount in the RRBM decision-making process. Her sense of anticipatory loss was largely focused on what her husband and future children might experience if a cancer diagnosis were to occur while she was raising her family—especially if she did not survive. Ally stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll be driving on the road . . . and I will literally have daydreams that I had two kids. I’m gone. I have two kids and my husband is older and in therapy and I’m not there. [It’s] pretty hard to think about those types of things . . . and I want to make sure that I’m around. Whatever that takes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although she had not yet made the decision to move forward with RRBM, Ally was in an active contemplation mode and felt that she would likely have the surgery within the next several years.</p>
<p>Several participants had already commenced childbearing when they learned that they were BRCA-positive. Women in this category seemed to fall into two distinct groups: those who were dedicated to breastfeeding all of their children no matter what, and who therefore preferred delaying mastectomy until childbearing was complete; and those who were ready to pursue RRBM before childbearing was complete, trading their ability to breastfeed subsequent children for their peace of mind and the increased likelihood that their health would not be threatened by cancer. Marie (28) provided an example of the former. A dedicated breastfeeder, she had decided that instead of having a mastectomy right away, she would alter her family formation timeline to have her second (and final) child sooner, so that she could proceed with the surgery on an accelerated schedule. This allowed her to keep her family formation goals and priorities intact, but also to avoid experiencing an extended period of anticipatory loss, as she would have had she gone forward with her original plan to wait several years before having her second child:
<disp-quote>
<p>The breast doctor . . . was saying once you turn thirty that your risk starts to go up with the breast cancer. And I’ve heard lots of cases of women getting breast cancer [in their] younger thirties. . . . I feel like I want to get them off as soon as possible. I would do it tomorrow if I already had a second child. But, I really want to have another baby and I really want to breastfeed. So, that’s kind of what’s holding me back. And then when I’m done breastfeeding, then I’m ready for it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, Heather (35) was not willing to delay her RRBM even though she was planning to have a third child. The possibility that a cancer diagnosis could occur during her pregnancy or while her new baby was very young had become intolerable. She stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>By the time I met with [the breast surgeon], which was mid-November, I had decided I’m not really going to wait on surgery. To wait to have another kid and breastfeed was crazy. God forbid I got sick while pregnant or while recently given birth, I would just be berserk. I wouldn’t want to be pregnant and thinking about what do you do with treatments, and this and that. And I didn’t want to think about managing an infant and two other kids while dealing with treatments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Heather’s sense of anticipatory loss influenced her risk–benefit decision making substantially. Rather than experience another pregnancy and the early months of her third child’s life under the specter of cancer risk, she chose to face the challenges of RRBM first, so that her third childbearing experience and her experience of mothering could be free of those worries.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As participants attempted to reconcile the myriad issues involved in deciding how to manage their cancer risk, many ultimately decided that risk-reducing surgery was the best course of action. Early RRBM was surprisingly frequent in this group, and our experience working with BRCA1/2 mutation carriers more broadly suggests that early surgical risk reduction via mastectomy is becoming an increasingly common choice. For many, this decision might be a response to experiences earlier in the life course that influence their perception of risk, or experiences of themselves as mutation-positive; for example, having lost a mother to cancer might lead some women to take definitive action to manage their own risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312458182">Hamilton, Williams, Bowers, &amp; Calzone, 2008</xref>). Participants frequently made decisions about surgical risk management having taken the opinions of their partners into consideration to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458182">Werner-Lin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants who had made the decision to proceed with risk-reducing mastectomy effectively found a way to minimize the sense of uncertainty surrounding their breast cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312458182">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). They also seemed to have done so in a way that made sense when considered in the context of anticipatory loss: finding the possibility of living every day knowing their cancer risk and viewing the potential losses created by a cancer diagnosis for themselves, their husbands, children, and relatives intolerable, they chose instead to endure a short, intense period of pain and loss (the surgical removal of their breasts and the short- and long-term changes that accompany the procedure). Even though they had been informed that the statistical risk of cancer during their 20s and early 30s was low and that they probably could wait until they were done with childbearing and survive with their breasts intact, living with the fear of cancer was simply not worth it. These brave women chose instead to face something that most would find it difficult to contemplate, and in doing so freed themselves from the emotional and physical constraints of their mutation-positive status and gained control over their genetic destiny.</p>
<p>Thus, women’s risk-management decisions during young adulthood significantly inform our understanding of anticipatory loss. A striking number of participants had completed or were actively contemplating risk-reducing mastectomy at the time of their interview; making this choice during one’s 20s or 30s is a courageous decision, and one for which many participants had no model in their families or broader social networks. Despite their knowledge of the potential negative effects of the surgery itself (i.e., pain, changes to body image and/or sexuality, inability to breastfeed), many participants chose to undergo this procedure because doing so seemed like a better alternative than living with the ongoing anxiety of not knowing whether and when breast cancer might occur. Although some risk and uncertainty always remains after surgery, both are greatly reduced relative to screening strategies which left the target organs intact.</p>
<p>Postsurgery, many women reported being able to put their cancer risk in perspective and not allow it to take over so much of their consciousness, time, and energy, freeing them to be more fully present as partners, mothers, daughters, and so forth. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that women in this population experience generally positive psychological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312458182">Frost et al., 2000</xref>) and high rates of satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312458182">Borgen et al., 1998</xref>; Frost et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312458182">Meijers-Heijboer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312458182">Stefanek, Hartmann, &amp; Nelson, 2001</xref>), as well as reductions in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312458182">Brandberg et al., 2008</xref>), low rates of regret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458182">Isern, Tengrup, Loman, Olsson, &amp; Ringberg, 2008</xref>), and healthy levels of psychosocial functioning long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312458182">Geiger et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, it is consistent with carriers’ attempts to preserve their sense of self as they cope with the implications of their BRCA1/2 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312458182">Howard et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that young BRCA1/2<italic>-</italic>positive women experience a broad range of intense feelings, and often struggle for extended periods of time to arrive at a comfortable decision with regard to cancer risk management, consistent with previous qualitative work highlighting the challenges of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312458182">Hamilton &amp; Hurley, 2010</xref>). These data also demonstrate the various ways in which partners, families, and relevant family health history (e.g., loss of mother; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458182">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>) are involved in the decision-making process for young BRCA mutation carriers. Therapy grounded in a systems orientation with high-risk women and their loved ones could be a useful addition to the current set of interventions and treatment modalities typically offered to this population. Family and couple therapists with specific training in medical family therapy are likely to be valuable members of health care teams that provide genetic counseling and testing, as well as long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312458182">McDaniel, Hepworth, &amp; Doherty, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Engaging in guided discussions about the meaning of risk, fears and worries about taking a certain path, and the relationship implications of various outcomes would help to prepare these vulnerable couples and families to face the challenges that might arise at different points during their mutation-positive experience. An appropriately trained mental health professional could offer important therapeutic and preventive psychosocial services to women such as Isabelle and Lilly—who faced an immediate health threat and felt compelled to make a quick decision about how to manage their risk—by encouraging them to think through the potential implications of each of their choices and helping them to slow their decision-making processes, if appropriate. Although their mothers and other family members provide helpful counsel, working with an objective consultant who fully understands the gravity and complexity of their situations could well add an important and helpful element of support and aid, bolstering high-risk women’s confidence in their risk-management decision making.</p>
<p>Our article’s major strength is its in-depth, qualitative focus on the experiences of young women over time, as they progress through normative life tasks after learning that they are BRCA1/2 positive. Much of the existing psychosocial research on BRCA1/2-positive individuals has focused on psychological and emotional states immediately after genetic testing and in the period surrounding risk-reducing surgery, and on older mutation carriers rather than those in early adulthood. Our data represent unique and timely information for all health care providers who care for individuals at high genetic risk of cancer. Our relatively homogenous sample is a limitation of this study, and restricts the generalizability of our findings to larger, more heterogeneous groups. A different group of BRCA1/2-positive women might have produced a different set of qualitative data related to these issues that is no less objectively grounded.</p>
<p>Finally, as with all retrospective interview studies, it should be noted that participants’ very positive recollections of their surgical experiences and satisfaction with their postmastectomy experiences are likely, at least in part, an attempt to reduce the cognitive dissonance that might be present when one makes such a major decision so early in the life course; that is, participants might talk about their decision as undoubtedly the “right” one to avoid having to consider that a different decision might have been better. Nonetheless, the insights gleaned from the current analysis provide a novel and invaluable starting point for managing the challenges faced by high-risk women, their loved ones, and their health care providers.</p>
