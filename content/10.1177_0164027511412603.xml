<abstract>
<p>The present study investigated the factor structure invariance of the Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale–Short Form (CRES) using confirmatory factor analysis. Response data were collected from 177 participants across three time points. The analyses of the five-subscale, 25-item CRES at the individual time points indicated that the first-order and second-order models were acceptable. However, Perceptions of Dependence was not a reliable indicator for the higher order factor defined as Overall Care-Receiver Efficacy. The revised 20-item CRES without Perceptions of Dependence had adequate model fit. A series of progressively more constrained models revealed the higher order 20-item CRES can be used as a stable measure of health care self-efficacy for older care-receivers.</p>

<p>Self-efficacy plays an essential role in everyone’s life. However, for older people and those needing help in their daily living, maintaining a sense of self-efficacy with aging and increasing disability is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511412603">Cox, Dooley, Liston, &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>). Although the role of care-receivers is key in care dyads, few studies or programs have focused on the older care-receivers themselves, and we have lacked a reliable instrument to evaluate care-receivers’ efficacy. Based on years of studies of the care-receiver role, Cox and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511412603">Cox, Green, Hobart, Jang, &amp; Seo, 2007</xref>) designed a care-receiver efficacy intervention to assist older care-receivers in increasing their knowledge and skills for dealing with late-life challenges and improving their own care. They also developed the Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale (CRES) to measure care-receivers’ self-efficacy and assess the outcomes of the efficacy interventions (Cox, Green, Seo, Inaba, &amp; Quillen, 2006). Considering that the original 48-item CRES might cause undue fatigue for older care-receivers, Cox and her colleagues identified the five most effective items in each of five subscales. To date, no analysis of the stability of the CRES structure over time has been reported. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the longitudinal factor structure invariance of the CRES–Short Form (CRES-SF). We explored the CRES-SF structure with only five first-order factors and then a hierarchical model with a second-order factor, Overall Care-Receiver Efficacy, at individual time points. Finally, cross-sectional stability of the identified model was examined through a series of increasingly constrained models.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0164027511412603">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The data were from the care-receiver efficacy study conducted between January 2002 and August 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511412603">Cox et al., 2006</xref>). A total of 177 participants from the Denver, Colorado, metro area were recruited. The mean age was 78.42 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.78), with most participants female (76.3%) and Caucasian (78.5%). Due to death, illness, move, or no desire to be in the study, there were 153 and 130 participants 2 and 12 months following the efficacy interventions, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0164027511412603">
<title>Measure</title>
<p>The CRES-SF comprises 25 items and five subscales: Self-Care Strategies, Relational Coping With Caregivers, Perceptions of Dependence, Performance-Related Quality of Life, and Accepting Help (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511412603">appendix</xref>). All items used a 5-point response scale, from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Higher scores indicated higher self-efficacy on all subscales except Perceptions of Dependence. After reverse coding the scale items for Perceptions of Dependence, a mean score on the 25 items was calculated to measure overall care-receiver’s self-efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0164027511412603">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Response data were collected through one-on-one interviews administered by professionals in social work and gerontology. During the interviews, the interviewers read all instrument items and recorded participants’ answers. Participants’ self-efficacy before the interventions was assessed during January 2002 and July 2003 (Time 1). Then, participants received one of three interventions: a small-group or an individually provided care-receiver efficacy intervention and a case management intervention. Participants’ efficacy was retested 2 and 12 months later following the last treatment session (Times 2 and 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0164027511412603">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The factor structure of the CRES-SF was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with LISREL 8.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511412603">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006</xref>). To display the structure, the original response data were used for the tests at individual time points. Via listwise deletion, the sample sizes were 124, 143, and 122 for the three time points, respectively. In testing longitudinal factor structure invariance, a data set imputed through matching imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511412603">Jöreskog, 2005</xref>) was employed (<italic>n</italic> = 117) because only 77 participants had no missing data at all three time points.</p>
<p>Factorial invariance of the CRES-SF over time was analyzed implementing the procedures recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511412603">Jöreskog (2005)</xref> through four incrementally constrained models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511412603">Table 1</xref>). The baseline model had no constraints. Due to the limited sample size, each joint model included the models only for two time points. If two joint models had nonsignificant chi-square differences (<sub>Δ</sub>χ<sup>2</sup>) and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) difference (<italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>CFI) of .01 or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511412603">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>), it suggests that the CRES structure was stable and therefore the latent factors could be compared over time. The following model fit indices are reported: chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>), normed chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic>), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), Comparative Fit Index, goodness-of-fit (GFI), and adjusted GFI-hat recommended by Steiger when the degrees of freedom are large relative to the sample size (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511412603">Maydeu-Olivares &amp; McArdle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511412603">Steiger, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Factor Structure of the 25-Item CRES</title>
<p>CFA at three time points indicated that both the first- and second-order factor structures had acceptable model fit in terms of most indices: 1.12 ≤ χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ≤ 1.77, .03 ≤ RMSEA ≤ .08, .99 ≥ NNFI ≥ .92, .99 ≥ CFI ≥ .93, .75 ≥ GFI ≥ .71, .99 ≥ GFI-hat ≥ .94, and significant chi-squares. The CFI differences at all time points (<italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>CFI ≤ .007) and the chi-square differences at Time 2, <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 8.51, showed that no significant difference existed between the first-order and the second-order models. However, the first-order model was found to fit better than the second-order model at Times 1 and 3, <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 20.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 19.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The discrepant results regarding the CFI differences and chi-square differences suggested that no clear cutoff indicated that the first-order model was absolutely better than the second-order model, or vice versa. Considering that the second-order model was more parsimonious, we used a higher order construct, Overall Care-Receiver Efficacy, to represent the common underlying factor.</p>
<p>The 25 items loaded significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) on five subscales. Except for the Perceptions of Dependence (Subscale 3), all subscales were significantly and positively related to the second-order factor. The low and negative loadings (standardized b = .06, −.11, and −.11) and little variance explained by the second-order factor (≤ 1.3%) suggested that Subscale 3 would not be a reliable indicator for overall care-receiver efficacy. So, the revised model excluded Subscale 3 and retained the remaining four factors and 20 items.</p>

<sec id="section8-0164027511412603">
<title>Factor Structure Invariance of the 20-Item CRES</title>
<p>The tests at three time points indicated that the 20-item model with a higher order factor fit well with respect to the estimates of normed chi-square (&lt; 2.0), RMSEA (≤ .08), NNFI (≥ .93), CFI (≥ .94), and GFI-hat (≥ .95), but not the chi-square and GFI. The factor loadings ranged from .33 to .94 (standardized), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Four progressively more constrained models fit well regarding most fit indices, and all constrained models fit much better than the baseline model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511412603">Table 1</xref>). After correlating the same item errors and first-order factor disturbances at two time points (Model 2), the model fit was significantly improved, −379.95 ≤ <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(23) ≤ −100.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and .16 ≤ <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>CFI ≤ .26, implying that the same items or subfactors at two points shared systematic error in addition to the same first- or second-order factors. The more restricted models—Model 3 (with equal first-order factor loadings) and Model 4 (with equal first- and second-order factor loadings)—were not significantly worse than Model 2, 12.84 ≤ <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>χ<sup>2</sup>(16) ≤ 26.22, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and <italic><sub>Δ</sub></italic>CFI ≤ .003 between Models 3 and 2. The most constrained model—Model 4—had fit values similar to Model 3. The results indicated that the second-order CRES was structurally very stable across time.</p>
<p>The overall CRES with 20 indicators had high internal consistency reliability, Cronbach’s alpha = .85, .83, and .88 at the three time points, respectively. Accepting Help had low reliability, α ≤ .72, while the other three subscales had adequate reliability, .79 ≤ α ≤ .84.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provided context for better understanding and implementation of the CRES. Both the first-order and the second-order 25-item CRES and 20-item CRES had reasonable model fit. The 25-item CRES can be used as a multidimensional scale with five subscales. However, Subscale 3 was not a good indicator for a higher order factor, and it was excluded from the 20-item CRES. The items of Subscale 5 were reliable indicators of Accepting Help and overall efficacy. A series of analyses demonstrated that configural invariance and metric invariance were achieved, and the 20-item CRES can be used as a stable and unidimensional measure of health care self-efficacy for older care-receivers. The CRES-SF still needs to be further refined in terms of some unacceptable fit estimates and low reliability of Subscale 3.</p>
