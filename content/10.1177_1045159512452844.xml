<abstract>
<p>The rapid pace of social and technological change in the early 21st century leaves many adults scrambling to meet the complexities that characterize their daily lives. Adult learners are faced with multiple, often competing, demands from work, education, family, and leisure, which requires adult education graduate programs to carefully consider how best to meet these changing needs of today’s students. Using a developmental action inquiry approach, the authors collected data using multiple rounds of mutual inquiry from diverse groups of stakeholders in adult education. We asked each group to explore the question, “How does adult education as a profession, field, and practice help adults, organizations, and society meet the demands of 21st century life?” The combined results indicate that responsive, dynamic graduate programs in adult education for the 21st century should support the cultivation of critical and timely reflection, create online learning environments predicated on intentional community and mutuality, and foreground the relationship between adult learning and developmental capacity to prepare adult education facilitators who stand confidently in the face of complexity and ambiguity.</p>

<p>The early 21st century presents a wide range of interconnected phenomena—environmental uncertainties, globalization of the market economy, technological innovations and rapid innovation cycles, and an extended life span, to name a few—which leaves many adults scrambling to meet the complexities and address the ambiguities that characterize their daily lives. This <italic>hidden curriculum of life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159512452844">Kegan, 1994</xref>) causes many adults to experience a mismatch between their current realities and the mental models that have governed their meaning making in the past, requiring them to think in qualitatively different ways to live successfully in the present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452844">Edwards and Usher (2000)</xref> suggest, “Change and uncertainty require lifelong learning,” and if one of the central tenets of adult education is helping adults to develop the capacity for growth and learning across the life course, then graduate programs in adult education must explore these types of programmatic questions: What are the particular needs of adult learners in the early 21st century? How might a graduate curriculum in adult education best respond to these needs? In what ways might this curriculum respond to demands facing adult learners across the spheres of work, education, family, and leisure?</p>
<p>To respond to these questions, we undertook a study in an adult education graduate course in Program Planning and Development to explore the following question: <italic>How does adult education as a profession, field, and practice help adults, organizations, and society meet the demands of 21st century life?</italic> We used a developmental action inquiry (DAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>) approach to interview a range of stakeholders at our home institution, and we analyzed our findings using a complex adaptive conceptual framework. This manuscript’s purpose is to discuss the results of our study with respect to perceived learners’ needs in graduate programs, as well as the programmatic structure and delivery methods of these programs. We also offer some general recommendations for adult education programs and pose further questions that will, in our opinion, need continued attention as the new millennium unfolds.</p>
<sec id="section1-1045159512452844">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In conducting this study, we presumed the complexity underlying adults’ lives offers a propitious opportunity to unearth assumptions that inform present graduate programs in adult education and, in turn, to challenge these assumptions in ways that generate the emergence of a more responsive set of programmatic framing strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159512452844">Stacey and Griffin (2005)</xref> explain that adults find themselves increasingly in spaces that are “paradoxically stable and unstable, predictable and unpredictable, known and unknown, certain and uncertain all at the same time” (p. 7); hence, the traditional assumptions that have governed adults’ lives are increasingly losing traction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452844">Conley (2009)</xref> goes so far as to argue that adults’ social worlds no longer conform to modernist binaries such as <italic>home/work, public/private</italic>, and even <italic>self/other</italic>; as technological gadgets structure family life, workplace demands intrude on leisure, and boundaries between work and home continue to disappear. These dynamics, he suggests, have ushered in an <italic>Elsewhere Society</italic>, comprised of individuals convinced that they are in the right place only when they are on their way to the next destination. These collective disruptions in adults’ ways of knowing invite planners of adult education graduate programs to reconsider their goals and curricula so as to best help facilitators of adult learning create educative spaces that support this new reality.</p>
<p>Doing so, however, is fraught with challenges. Arguably, the very situations to which these graduate programs have previously responded—preparing community leaders for social change initiatives, developing trainers to facilitate organizational learning opportunities, and so forth—could best be described as technical or instrumental approaches to learning; in other words, the problems themselves to which graduate programs and curricula have responded seemed straightforward. Likewise, the curricula reflected this epistemic stance; courses in Program Planning and Development, for example, drew upon a rich range of invaluable scholarships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452844">Caffarella, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452844">Cervero &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159512452844">Tyler, 1949</xref>) that helped facilitators of adult learning design, conduct, and assess interventions that lent themselves to linear approaches and familiar contexts. These models—recursive and iterative—have served us well in addressing instrumental needs. Nonetheless, in light of the complexities adult learners now face in their lives, we argue that technical, instrumental approaches to adult learning seem inadequate with respect to the demands adults face in early 21st century life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452844">Antonacopoulou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452844">Jarvis, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159512452844">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In departing from this technical and instrumental approach to knowing and learning, we advocate a paradigm that instead places adaptation at the core of adult learning. This focus on adaptability will help adult learners cultivate the types of innovative thinking and critical reflection germane to personal, organizational, and systemic transformation. In their research on adaptive leadership, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159512452844">Heifetz (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159512452844">Heifetz and Linsky (2002)</xref> find that learners confronted with complex, ambiguous problems must have the capacity to frame tough questions, challenge their own and others’ ways of knowing, and help themselves and others discover possibilities for innovative problem solving. We find Heifetz’s distinctions between instrumental and adaptive problem solving highly useful, especially in ways that draw our attention to adults’ developmental capacities. Framing these demands as adaptive challenges also helps us address a thorny aspect of the profession of adult earning: specifically, developing a graduate curriculum in adult education that foregrounds adaptive learning transcends and includes the oft-discussed adult education and human resource development divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452844">Cunningham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452844">Finger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159512452844">Schied, Mulenga, &amp; Baptiste, 2005</xref>). Learning through ambiguity and complexity becomes, then, neither exclusively a <italic>workplace</italic> concern nor a <italic>community action</italic> concern; rather, learning becomes a way of knowing, inquiring, and being central to enacting change and transformation within a wide range of lived human experience.</p>
<p>Developing such graduate programs implies a series of assumptions that we would like to make explicit. First, a robust and responsive graduate program should provide learners with opportunities to develop and test their capacities for making timely, skillful decisions. Second, a graduate curriculum should focus explicit energies and attention on facilitation strategies, for graduates will be increasingly called to engage learners within an ambiguous reality in which—individually—we all bring only a partial understanding to learning encounters. Finally, a graduate curriculum should create spaces for learners to learn from within the adaptive challenges themselves, which may ultimately open spaces for transformative learning to occur.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To conduct our study, we used a DAI approach that we found beneficial for conducting action and inquiry in ways that broadened our effectiveness. DAI is a “way of simultaneously conducting action and inquiry as a disciplined leadership practice that increases the wider effectiveness of our actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>, p. 1). Fundamentally, DAI “listens into the developing situation. It accomplishes whatever tasks appear to have priority. And it invites a revisioning of the task (and of our own action!) if necessary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>, p. 13). DAI interweaves three types of data—subjective, intersubjective, and objective—in ways that help researchers attend to multiple perspectives with respect to a particular focus of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>). Subjective data reflect our integrity as we bring conscious attention to our intentions, paying attention to our first-person perspectives. Intersubjective data reflect our awareness of divergence with respect to others’ opinions, as we pay attention to the second-person perspective, the <italic>you</italic>. Objective data reflect our attentiveness to actions and is the third-person perspective, the <italic>they</italic>. By bringing this three-level awareness to our inquiry, we engaged in coinquiry with one another and participants at every phase of the study, recalibrating as needed along the way. Ultimately, our method of inquiry helped us <italic>mind the gaps</italic> of our inquiry and outcomes, in ourselves and our participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>). By grounding our study in DAI, we were able to preclude linear, prescribed paths to predetermined solutions and explore curricular possibilities for responsive and timely graduate programs. Here, we present and discuss the results of our DAI study of adult learners’ needs, programmatic structure, and delivery methods in adult education graduate programs.</p>

<title>Participants and Inquiry—Round 1</title>
<p>Our research team comprised four action inquiry groups within a graduate seminar in Program Planning and Development, a core course in our graduate program in adult education. Our course facilitator was also a coresearcher in this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study. For our first round of investigation, each inquiry group interviewed a subset of program stakeholders; these groups’ inquiries were grounded in different methodologies to reflect the particular theoretical interests of these graduate students. Two groups used a complex adaptive approach, meaning that participants were invited to cocreate our space of mutual inquiry and, in so doing, provide room for unanticipated questions and ideas to shape and inform our dialogic space and allow for emergence. The first of these groups interviewed faculty and students who are enrolled or teach in online settings. They also interviewed two alumni of the online program. In keeping with complex adaptive methodology, when one of the researchers found herself in a focus group discussing the pros and cons of online learning in another class, she sought permission to collect the findings from that discussion and include them in the group findings. In addition, using a complex adaptive methodology, our second inquiry group interviewed several College of Education deans with either direct or tangential relationships to our graduate program in adult education. Using an emancipatory framework, our third action inquiry group interviewed a group of faculty who presently teach in our graduate program in adult education. This particular framework allowed faculty to explore the ways in which power dynamics affected learners’ acquisition and understanding of knowledge. The final group interviewed current master’s degree students using a focus group format; that is, these students were provided with prompts and were then encouraged to build upon one another’s responses, in ways analogous to semistructured interviews.</p>
<p>We recognize in our choice of participants that we used convenience sampling; we are all participants in the program we were investigating, and we were interacting with our friends, colleagues, and supervisors throughout the process. Nevertheless, these four groups—students, faculty, deans, and alumni—represent the broad spectrum of stakeholders in a university’s adult education program, and as such could provide crucial information regarding the structure, approach, and outcomes of the program. Once our inquiry groups had completed their initial research, each group presented their provisional findings in our class seminar. We then collectively analyzed our results through mutual dialogue that allowed us to identify emergent themes across our data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1045159512452844">
<title>Participants and Inquiry—Rounds 2 and 3</title>
<p>For our second round of inquiry, we created opportunities for dialogue among “breakout” groups at our home institution’s annual research symposium for adult education graduate students. At this event, members of our class and our professor hosted roundtable discussions, for a total of 12 inquiry groups with five or six participants in each. The groups had paper and markers at their tables, allowing for drawing as well as writing in answer to the question, “How does adult education as a profession, field, and practice help adults, organizations, and society meet the demands of 21st century life?” Each table considered this question first as individuals, then as a small group, and finally as a profession, following the first-, second-, and third-person DAI approach. After the symposium, we collectively analyzed the results of the roundtable discussions and integrated the results into our first-round findings.</p>
<p>For our third round, we presented our first two rounds of findings at the 2011 American Association for Adult and Continuing Education conference. During this session, we invited attendees to engage in coinquiry with us as they responded to our research question and interacted with our previous findings. As with the symposium, we used the results from this session to inform our understanding of themes as they emerged from our data.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1045159512452844">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Not surprisingly, each group of stakeholders reflected concerns and desires that were to some degree specific to their varying situations. For example, faculty and students involved in online education reported similar views regarding this format. When asked what created meaningful online learning, and the degree to which online learning supported adults with respect to the complexities and demands they face, participants shared that collaboration, effective communication, courage, resilience, adaptability, and technical aptitude were all useful skills for learners to flourish in online learning environments. In addition, respondents suggested that online learning was attractive to them as part of their degree program. Still, respondents shared that not only could the orientation to e-learning platforms and the interface of the e-learning programs themselves be improved, but facilitators of online learning should also consider learners’ life stages in facilitating instruction online. For example, younger adults seemed less aware of the role of community in learning, taking community almost for granted. Instead, they spoke more of their need for immediate responsiveness. Conversely, older adults did not need as much immediate feedback but did feel the need to build a learning community. Regardless of age, respondents lauded e-learning’s merits and agreed that a sense of community is key to e-learning.</p>
<p>Deans also stressed the need for community. Several respondents spoke positively about online learning’s potential but shared that they felt limited in the criticality and expertise they brought to e-learning spaces. Still, they clearly identified—in a broad sense—community, be it in online or more traditional learning spaces, was central to learning. Perhaps, reflecting felt tensions and restraints in their own administrative roles, many respondents shared that they felt challenged in bringing their “best selves” to learning spaces, noting that numerous professional obligations restricted their time to reflect critically and, in one respondent’s words, to “go deep rather than go fast.” Finally, many respondents in this group spoke of cultivating mindfulness and critical reflection among learners, so these learners could not only meet the multiple obligations in their lives more aptly but also think more critically about the messages and assumptions that tacitly inform their lifeworld.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the themes that emerged from the faculty group reflected the themes expressed by administrators and deans. For example, faculty were interested in learning how to develop learners’ and their own capacities for “going deeper” in e-learning contexts and creating richer educative spaces. Many of these respondents appreciated the nimbleness online learning offered to more traditional graduate programs, but admitted nimbleness wasn’t a common characteristic of the academy. Moreover, respondents expressed a concern for developing adults’ critical consumption of messages that circulate around them perpetually. One respondent shared that adults should develop the capacity to attend to these types of questions: “Who are the brokers of knowledge? How can people become their own brokers?”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising findings of all came from the master’s degree students. Until they participated in the focus group, these students had not considered themselves as adult learners. When asked to define “adult education,” the participants asked for clarification about the term, initiating an unexpected discussion about what is meant by <italic>adult</italic>, what it means to be an adult learner, how the term <italic>adult education</italic> is perceived, and how the participants have changed their perception of adult education as a result of their graduate experience. Until this conversation, they had thought of themselves as preparing to work with adults older than themselves, but had neither recognized that their own enrollment in a master’s degree program classified them as adult learners nor had they thought to apply what they were learning in the program to themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159512452844">Merriam and Brockett (2007)</xref> note, “A real problem . . . is the fact that thousands of educators who work with adult learners are unaware of being <italic>adult educators</italic>, or choose not to identify themselves as such” (p. 80). In addition to adult educators who do not self-identify as such, our findings indicated that graduate-level learners may also fail to self-identify as such.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In exploring our research question, we were fortunate to engage in coinquiry with a wide range of stakeholders as we sought to identify tensions, gaps, and concerns with respect to the ways in which graduate programs in adult education could best serve adult learners in the early 21st century. Rather than focus on particular course offerings, we considered learning goals, learner capacities, and contextual needs to inform our recommendations for programs that best support adult learners who can, in turn, help other adults meet life’s demands across a range of contexts. Here, we tenuously set forth three broad-based suggestions to help colleagues and administrators design learning spaces and curricula in response to the complexities and ambiguities that largely define the emerging contexts in which we live and learn.</p>
<list id="list1-1045159512452844" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Provide opportunities across the entire curriculum and learning experience to support learners in cultivating capacities for critical reflection in the moment.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both reflection-on-action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452844">Kolb, 1984</xref>) and reflection-in-action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159512452844">Schon, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452844">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159512452844">1996</xref>) have received ample attention in the adult education literature, as has critical reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452844">Brookfield, 2004</xref>). However, the acceleration of innovation and our complex global interconnectedness beckons for a heightened criticality and consciousness, allowing adults to carry on with their lives in the midst of uncertainty. Numerous participants in our study spoke of the challenges they felt in thinking more critically about the tasks to which they attended in their daily lives, and they spoke of a desire to reflect while also “getting on with their lives.” Emerging neuroscience research can assist us as we revisit the ways that we think of reflection and create educative spaces for capacity building that will help adults transcend either/or modernist binaries (e.g., going fast vs. going deep) to engage more expansive—and even contradictory—ways of knowing.</p>
<list id="list2-1045159512452844" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Cocreate online learning environments that are predicated upon intentional community and mutuality, and provide learning opportunities for faculty and students to develop these capacities.</italic></p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Most of our participants spoke positively about online learning, lauding the flexibility and convenience it offers to adults responding to numerous demands in their lives. Although some expressed an interest in more sophisticated interfaces, the more substantive theme—and, we argue, the more important theme—that emerged addressed the ways in which learners and facilitators brought themselves to these online learning environments. Adults desire authentic community in these spaces, eschewing conventional discussion threads in favor of spaces in which all participants bring their most authentic selves to the fore, generating richer possibilities for personal transformation. Of course, learning how to create these spaces involves its own learning trajectory, one that students and faculty should embrace. Increasingly popular and sophisticated, online learning will continue to shape dramatically the academy’s structure; we ignore these developments at our peril. A responsive graduate program in adult education should therefore attend to constructing online learning opportunities in ways that foreground intentionality, authenticity, and mutuality.</p>

<p>
<italic>Foreground relationship between adult learning and developmental capacity to prepare facilitators who stand more confidently in relationship to complexity and ambiguity.</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Graduate students enrolled in adult education programs wish to create conditions for optimal learning across numerous contexts; a more robust knowledge of human development theory will help these students, in turn, help other adults make meaning in contexts that will continue to challenge mental models that no longer offer sufficient cognitive support. Participants across our inquiry groups spoke of the challenges of meeting demands in rapidly changing environments and, as was the case with the master’s degree students, developing a richer perspective of who they were as adult learners. Hence, we advocate for creating learning spaces in which emergence of a new vision and the possibility of articulating steps for proactive implementation may elicit a more inclusive set of voices, especially as we guide our own inquiry and help ourselves and one another stand more confidently in relationship to the unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159512452844">Nicolaides, 2008</xref>; Nicolaides &amp; McCallum, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452844">Torbert, 2004</xref>). Because we appreciate that adults challenged by life’s demands may find it more convenient to either ignore complexity or manage complexity in counterproductive ways, we suggest that studying developmental capacity will help graduates of adult education programs be better prepared to make conceptual bridges of understanding with adults who may feel overwhelmed by the hidden curriculum of life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We recognized from the study’s onset that our research question, with its attendant data collection and analysis, was daunting: “Who are we,” many of us asked ourselves, “to question the curriculum of a graduate program in adult education?” In numerous ways, we made ourselves vulnerable in pursuing this inquiry; however, our facilitator created a holding environment with appropriate supports and challenges that allowed us to pursue our research, even as more ambiguity emerged in the midst of our study.</p>
<p>By exploring the first-, second-, and third-person effects of our study, our intention was to create a heightened awareness and consider the impact of our findings on the personal, group, and systemic level. In closing, we offer several questions that surfaced as we considered the recommendations we have set forth: How does re-envisioning graduate programs in adult education matter as we take up our roles as facilitators of adult learning? Where could we apply these findings? In what ways must our practice change to respond to or accommodate these findings, especially given the academy’s current structure? Finally, as findings emerge and we recognize gaps between needs and practice, in what ways do we fill these gaps? We look forward to joining our colleagues in responding to and reflecting on these questions as we proceed, together, in the discipline.</p>

Her scholarship and teachings focus on leading adult learning and practicing a developmental action inquiry approach to creating conditions for adults to advance their capacity (complexity of knowing) and competencies (skillful means) to engage paradox, uncertainty, and the ambiguity generated by early 21st century demands in work, life, and society. In teaching and research, she is interested in generating conditions for adults, groups, and systems to learn, grow, and develop the skillful means for social inquiry, social action, and mutually transforming power.</p>
