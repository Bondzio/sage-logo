<p>Kathryn Bond Stockton has produced a provocative book, well-worth reading and debating. Her concept of ‘growing sideways’ is interesting but she never really clarifies it. As I note further on, she does use the term to mean a kind of development in which children explore and exhibit characteristics, which adults consider homosexual. She has the best and worst characteristics of literary critics. Certainly, her use of literature to explain social theory, or to construct it, is fascinating. However, it is not always convincing, for she picks and chooses examples to prove her theories. Thus, she has children from Hitchcock dramas mingling with Johnny Depp’s Willie Wonka and the <italic>Children’s Hour</italic>. Somehow all these characters prove that children are really homosexual.</p>
<p>Growing sideways, or being ‘strange’, somehow leads us to the queerness or gayness of children. It is a giant mental leap, to say the least. That children are sexual is no revelation to those who have read the least amount of Freud’s or Margaret Mead’s body of work. Indeed, Elsie Clews Parsons, someone not even mentioned in the work, went much farther along those lines than many scholars who came before her – or even after her groundbreaking work. Let me address Stockton’s views on Freud and then move on to her egregious neglect of anthropology.</p>
<p>Stockton does indeed grant that Freud recognized the sexuality of children. She does not mention the bloody battles he had to face to get his theory across to the Victorian society, which idealized the innocence of children. Nor do I find mention of his concept of polymorphs perversity. For Freud, sexuality could and did take many forms. He argued, in defending homosexuality and attacking those who punished people for it, that people should not be punished for their sexual inclinations. Stockton appears to attack Freud for not going far enough along this path. She disagrees with his terming homosexuality ‘arrested development’. Fair enough but she might be charged with not putting people into their appropriate historical settings, forgetting or neglecting the attacks Freud suffered for beginning down the road toward understanding and defending homosexual rights.</p>
<p>If we grant for the sake of argument that Freud did not go far enough in this area, then we must argue that Stockton goes too far in asserting that all children are queer and that society has gone too far in denying that fact. If all she means to argue is that what adults term homosexuality is not foreign to the child’s world, I have no argument with her. She notes that the term ‘growing sideways’ is a type of irregular growth involving the exploration of out of the way paths and odd desires. However, she also seems to note that this irregular path is really rather regular for all children. Not surprisingly, Stockton finds fictional work such as novels, trail blazers and movies as the best means for discussing these ideas and finding examples of growing sideways. She ranges far from the beaten path in a dazzling display of virtuosity citing works as different as those of Henry James and Willy Wonka. Freud discussed the role of culture in determining views on same-sex practices. Hence his concept of ‘polymorphous perversity’, which also includes heterosexual practices of all kinds. He did not use ‘perverse’ here in a negative sense. In my view, he used it to denote his culture’s denigration of sexuality as well as its fear of it. Americans in general appear to wish that children are asexual innocents. Freud noted that they were ‘polymorphously perverse’, open to many types of sexual growth, fastening onto one or another depending on the manner in which environmental factors worked on biology.</p>
<p>We mature within a cultural setting and are enculturated to its practices. Anthropologists such as Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, Elsie Clews Parson, and others, have examined the consequences for those who do not fit the dominant patterns and expectations of given culture. Some provide alternate paths for these individuals to follow; others tragically seek to force their members into a one-size fits all mode. The Plains Indians allowed for variation with their status of the Berdache, men who dressed and took on the work of women. The Hausa, about whom I have written, had the role of Yan Daudu in which males who viewed themselves as women could find refuge.</p>
<p>Certainly, Stockton has produced a work of literary criticism, which offers much material for thought. She is sensitive to the needs of young people coming to grips with their sexuality. Our American culture still has problems dealing maturely with the idea of sexuality. We are still stuck in an adolescent phase, finding the topic titillating and somewhat dangerous. Stockton is to be congratulated for discussing the still dangerous topic of childhood sexuality openly. That I think she has gone too far in making her case for the ‘sideways’ presence of homosexuality is not to overlook her contributions. However, in confounding ‘strangeness’ with ‘gayness’, she is making the very mistake of which she accuses Freud. As Marvin Opler, a psychiatric anthropologist and a former professor of mine, said, it is easy for little David to throw rocks at Goliath. That does not make Goliath less formidable. I would add that we have to commend the courage of any ‘David’ even if in killing Goliath a great force of Nature is destroyed.</p>
