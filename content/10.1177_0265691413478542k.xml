<p>The reputation of the first incarnation of Yugoslavia has not weathered the storm of twentieth-century history well, nor has the international system deemed to have created it. Harsher critics have even portrayed them both as failures from the outset. As in his previous works on interwar Yugoslavia Dejan Djokić re-addresses established perceptions through this highly readable yet comprehensive account centred on the relationship between the leaders of the Yugoslav delegation at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference – the former Serb Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and the Croatian politician and first Yugoslav foreign minister Ante Trumbić. Alongside securing the borders of their newly formed state, a far from simple task in itself, both men sought to achieve full international backing for the cause of south Slavic self-determination and official recognition of the new ‘Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes’ as it was initially known. Whilst this relationship was marred by sectarian interests and ethnic mistrust, it was a shared belief in the fundamental worth of the Yugoslav cause that still allowed them to achieve the majority of their aims despite the myriad of rival interests and diplomatic obstructions ranged against them.</p>
<p>The book itself is divided into three parts. In the first part Djokić introduces the reader to the South Slavic lands, outlining their ethnological, linguistic and historical development from ancient times up to 1918 with the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the formation of Yugoslavia and other successor states. At the same time he recounts the lives and political careers of Pašić and Trumbić prior to 1918. Both men came from humble origins and were the first in their families to receive university educations. However, they also personified the different political traditions of their respective homelands and subsequently clashed over the newly formed Kingdom’s internal political structure. This ongoing rivalry would continue to manifest itself throughout the peace conference, although, as Djokić correctly points out, historians have tended to accentuate these differences to the detriment of other factors.</p>
<p>The second and central part of the book deals with the Paris Peace Conference itself. Whilst the efforts of Pašić, Trumbić and their fellow delegates remain the central focus, Djokić places it within the broader context, examining the motives and actions of their fellow Allied countries. Throughout the entire peace negotiations the Yugoslavs were faced with an array of challenges far greater than their own internal divisions. Alongside refusing to officially recognize the new Kingdom or the unification of Serbia and Montenegro (the latter was granted a seat that remained empty throughout the entire conference), the delegation was forced to contend with outside national interests. Italian designs in the Adriatic presented the greatest threat, pitting the delegates against one of the ‘big four’ who dictated the agendas at the conference. Recognizing that division could jeopardize their gains from the war, both Pašić and Trumbić chose to put their agendas aside in favour of international <italic>realpolitik</italic>.</p>
<p>In the third and final section Djokić briefly assesses the legacy of the delegations’ efforts at the peace conference, as well as continuing to chart the careers of its leaders. Unlike many of his foreign counterparts at Versailles, Pašić, despite his age and poor relations with King Aleksander, would dominate the Kingdom’s parliamentary government in Belgrade until his death in 1926, cementing his reputation as ‘the grand old man’ of Serbian politics. No such fate would befall his one-time ally Trumbić. Despite retaining a degree of political influence, like many of Croatia’s bourgeois politicians, he quickly became marginalized by the populist Croatian Peasant Party of Stjepan Radić. As with the first section, Djokić also briefly outlines the rest of Yugoslavia’s interwar history, concluding with the 1941 invasion and dismemberment by the Axis Powers.</p>
<p>The traditional view of diplomatic history as dry and inaccessible cannot be applied in this case. In addition to never becoming aberrant, Djokić’s work remains lucid from beginning to end and is thus highly recommendable both for students and researchers unfamiliar with the Balkans or the interwar period. The book also includes two maps outlining the political borders of Europe on the eve of the Great War in 1914 and following the conclusion of the peace conferences with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. Additional maps of the contested areas in the Adriatic and the Banat region on Yugoslavia’s borders with Hungary and Romania would have helped to illustrate the highly complex territorial disputes that arose during the conference. More rigorous scrutiny of the role played by the Slovene delegates would also have been welcome. The high-political and diplomatic narrative may have also benefited from greater elaboration of the internal disruption and economic challenges facing the Yugoslav populace in the aftermath of the First World War. However, despite these minor criticisms, Djokić should be congratulated for drawing attention to a much neglected area of study that has unfairly come to be defined through more recent historical events, and for moving the debate forward.</p>
