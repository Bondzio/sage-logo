      <abstract>
        <p>The use and misuse of digital technologies among adolescents has been the focus of fiery
          debates among parents, educators, policy-makers and in the media. Recently, these debates
          have become shaped by emerging data from cognitive neuroscience on the development of the
          adolescent brain and cognition. “Neuroplasticity” has functioned as a powerful metaphor in
          arguments both for and against the pervasiveness of digital media cultures that
          increasingly characterize teenage life. In this paper, we propose that the debates
          concerning adolescents are the meeting point of two major social anxieties both of which
          are characterized by the threat of “abnormal” (social) behaviour: existing moral panics
          about adolescent behaviour in general and the growing alarm about intense, addictive, and
          widespread media consumption in modern societies. Neuroscience supports these fears but
          the same kinds of evidence are used to challenge these fears and reframe them in positive
          terms. Here, we analyze discourses about digital media, the Internet, and the adolescent
          brain in the scientific and lay literature. We argue that while the evidential basis is
          thin and ambiguous, it has immense social influence. We conclude by suggesting how we
          might move beyond the poles of neuro-alarmism and neuro-enthusiasm. By analyzing the
          neurological adolescent in the digital age as a socially extended mind, firstly, in the
          sense that adolescent cognition is distributed across the brain, body, and digital media
          tools and secondly, by viewing adolescent cognition as enabled and transformed by the
          institution of neuroscience, we aim to displace the normative terms of current
          debates.</p>

    <p>Baroness Susan Greenfield, a prominent UK neuroscientist and public intellectual, recently
      warned the public against the dangers of Internet and digital technology for children and
      teenagers, cautioning us about the “unprecedented changes” brought about by young people’s
      interaction with digital technology and urging us to recognize that the issue is “almost as
      important as climate change” (“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461512474623">Baroness
        Susan Greenfield,” 2010</xref>). Major national newspapers reported on Greenfield’s
      “chilling warning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461512474623">Derbyshire,
        2009</xref>) in which she advised that “society should wake up to the harmful effects of the
      Internet” (“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461512474623">Baroness Susan Greenfield,”
        2010</xref>), as “technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children
      who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights, who have a small attention span and who
      live for the moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461512474623">Derbyshire,
        2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>Her argument, articulated in terms of the developing brain, swept across newspapers,
      scientific magazines, and blogs, and contributed to a growing debate about the effects of the
      Internet on the brain. This debate is characterized by questions such as whether we—in
      digitalized societies—are permanently altering our minds, cultivating certain cognitive
      capacities at the expense of important others because of our dependence on digital media
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr, 2010</xref>). Underlying this
      idea is the now popularized “use-it-or-lose-it” phenomenon of neuroplasticity, demonstrated
      best in neuroimaging studies of taxi drivers, pianists, and jugglers which show that processes
      of learning and memory can stimulate the growth of new neurons and stabilize synaptic
      connections in areas of the brain frequently used (“use it”) while eliminating connections
      that are rarely used (“lose it”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461512474623">Maguire
        et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1363461512474623">Pantev et al.,
        1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1363461512474623">Pascual-Leone et al.,
        1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>Of major concern in these debates is whether young people in particular are becoming
      unempathic, passive, intellectually shallow and uncritical, desensitized, depressed, and
      attention deficient because of cyber technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461512474623">Derbyshire, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>). From a historical
      perspective, anxieties such as these are nothing new, as emergent media technologies have long
      generated collective fears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr,
        2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461512474623">Kittler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363461512474623">McLuhan 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363461512474623">Pinker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1363461512474623">Shirky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1363461512474623">Starker, 1990</xref>). A rich body of work in communication,
      media, history, and literature studies traces media anxiety as far back as 2,500 years ago
      when Socrates contested the institutionalization of writing, about which he argued that
      written “words…can never speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1363461512474623">Plato, 2008</xref>). The pursuit of wisdom,
      for Socrates, was not through reading and writing but through real time and space dialogue
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr, 2010</xref>). In the 18th
      century, the novel was perceived as a cause of female depravity and literacy was considered
      threatening to women’s safety and moral purity, while both women and young people were
      considered vulnerable to the corrupting influences of the “vivid details and heightened
      emotional scenes” in realistic novels, and the possibility that “[f]antasy and even madness
      would replace rationality and conscience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1363461512474623">Starker, 1990</xref>, p. 44). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461512474623">Kittler’s
        classic <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> (1999)</xref> identified a radical
      shift with the invention of those respective technologies in regard to signification,
      referentiality, and human historical agency. Marshall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363461512474623">McLuhan’s influential <italic>The Gutenberg Galaxy</italic>
        (1962)</xref> traced the social and cognitive impacts of mass print media. Common to these
      studies is an underlying concern about how different media technologies remake human
      consciousness, perception, and cognition—reorganizing sociality, raising questions about what
      is at stake in our moral worlds, and reframing the ontology of the human. Thus our
      contemporary fears about digital technologies can be understood as part of a larger historical
      pattern of technologically related anxiety.</p>
    <p>Given the lessons of history, we could at the very least be reassured that our minds have
      managed to continually adapt to new media technologies and that “civilization” has not
      crumbled in their wake, or, as some would suggest we could take it a step further and embrace
      the digital awesomeness that allows us new and unprecedented opportunities for social
      connection, political mobilization, and the production and dissemination of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363461512474623">Papathanassopolous, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1363461512474623">Shirky, 2010</xref>). From this view, digital
      technologies are enhancing cognitive capacities such as multitasking, enabling us to live
      successfully in the accelerated space–time compression of our postmodern world. In fact, some
      have claimed that younger generations growing up with digital technologies are developing the
      skills to parallel-process and encode information quickly enough to be at a distinct advantage
      to adapt to the high-tech revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>). Moreover, they argue that our institutions, particularly
      educational ones, should articulate themselves with the digital revolution rather than oppose
      it and undergo significant reforms to meet changing brains and social, political, and economic
      realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461512474623">Davidson, 2011</xref>).</p>
    <p>Much of the discourse on digital media addresses the potential societal changes wrought by
      digital technology. The claim that the brain is changing in response to digital media,
      however, can be understood at many levels. Because of neuroplasticity, we can say that the
      brain and nervous system are constantly changing in response to environmental stimuli as well
      as the brain’s own activity. Such changes, for example, cellular changes in response to a
      stimulus or a learning process, are normal functions of a healthy brain. More remarkable are
      the kinds of changes seen in cortical remapping after intensive training in an activity or
      after brain injury in some cases, when a region in the brain acquires a new function or
      specialization. The claim that digital technology is leading to societal transformations
      through cerebral changes evokes a much deeper collective emotional response, not only because
      of the association of the biological to the “real” and “indelible.” The idea that the use of
      digital media may be leading to evolutionary adaptations of the human brain more broadly
      deserves serious debate. However, to date these debates—the fears, enthusiasm, and subsequent
      recommendations—are shaped by small-scale cognitive neuroscience studies.</p>
    <p>In this paper, then, we are less concerned with whether we really are being wired for
      distraction, superficiality, and unsociability (although certainly some of these fears may
      indeed be well founded), and more with whether existing neuroscientific evidence derived
      largely from neuroimaging studies can indeed resolve these questions as the media suggests. We
      are interested in how brain-based arguments rhetorically function in these debates,
      particularly when cerebral language and neuro-discourses increasingly assume a privileged
      explanatory status in explaining and intervening in human behaviour. With anxieties about
      digital media centering on adolescents, who are the heaviest users and often the first
      adopters of these media, we hope our analysis will provide needed critical perspective that
      can clarify, if not shift, the terms of the debate.</p>
    <p>We will propose here that the debates concerning adolescents are the meeting point of two
      major social anxieties, both of which are characterized by the threat of “abnormal” (social)
      behaviour: existing moral panic about adolescent behaviour in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1363461512474623">Sullivan &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>) and growing alarm about
      intense, addictive, and widespread media consumption in modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr, 2010</xref>). Neuroscience weighs in and
      supports these fears but notably, the same kinds of evidence it produces are used to challenge
      these fears and reframe them in positive terms. In this discussion, we will analyze discourses
      about digital media, the Internet and the adolescent brain in the scientific and lay
      literature, and describe the role of neuroscience in paradoxically substantiating and
      alleviating the anxieties about the shallow, frenzied, distracted, and antisocial futures of
      compulsive teenage media users. Our aim is not to furnish a comprehensive review of cognitive
      neuroscience studies in this area, but to identify some of the key claims of cognitive
      neuroscience and to argue that the evidential basis for these claims is often thin and/or
      ambiguous. Despite their limitations, these preliminary neuroscientific claims are immensely
      influential in the popular press and currently underpinning policy-making in the UK and other
      places. Our task is to consider whether the existing data in neuroscience that we surveyed are
      robust and nuanced enough at this point to warrant the explanatory authority that media,
      medicine, and policy makers confer to them. We conclude by suggesting how we might move beyond
      the poles of neuro-alarmism and neuro-enthusiasm. By analyzing the neurological adolescent in
      the digital age as a socially extended mind, firstly, in the sense that adolescent cognition
      is distributed across the brain, body, and digital media tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461512474623">Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998</xref>) and secondly, by viewing
      adolescent cognition as enabled and transformed by the institution of neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461512474623">Gallagher &amp; Crisafi, 2009</xref>), we aim
      to reshape the contours of current discussions.</p>
    <sec id="sec1-1363461512474623">
      <title>Neurocultures, plasticity, and the cyber-brain</title>
      <p>New forms of neuroscientific expertise providing advice on how to conduct one’s life have
        begun to pervade almost all domains of everyday social life in Europe and North America.
        Reaching beyond medicine and policy, neuroimaging evidence constitutes the backbone of a new
        genre of self-help guides, educational technologies, advertising campaigns, and parenting
        manuals. This growing neurological reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1363461512474623">Rowson, 2010</xref>)—that is, the ways in which we are
        constructing and using information about the activities of the brain to condition and
        reshape it—hinges on notions of neuroplasticity. Today, policy makers are using
        neuroscientific knowledge to guide the development of social interventions in the name of
        public health and enhancement of “mental capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461512474623">Beddington et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363461512474623">Fricke &amp; Choudhury, 2011</xref>), and neuroscientists,
        through public engagement activities, are distributing forms of “expertise” through which
        lay people can develop self-mastery and sort out the good from the bad, the healthy from the
        unhealthy. On the one hand, neuroplasticity suggests that there is a certain degree of brain
        malleability and reversibility over the lifespan, which resonates with the optimistic notion
        that it is never too late to train the mind, whether through meditation, musical practice,
        psychotherapy, reading, or crossword puzzles. This positive “training the mind” dimension of
        neuroplasticity more often than not is used to discuss the potentials of adults, not
        children and teenagers. On the other hand, the clinical and academic literature on
        neuroplasticity suggests that during certain developmental periods, such as adolescence, the
        brain is especially susceptible and vulnerable to environmental input and to the formation
        of irreversible pathways and networks. Importantly, as we will show, this second aspect of
        neuroplasticity tends to characterize discourses about children and adolescents. Not only
        does this second dimension of neuroplasticity produce contradictions with the first, but it
        also foments fears and anxieties that underpin decisions, desires, and interventions.</p>
      <p>With statistics indicating that adult Americans spend an average of 33 hours<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363461512474623">1</xref></sup> a week surfing the Internet,
        text messaging, sifting through emails, tweeting and social networking, questions about the
        way in which mental abilities are shaped through these activities have become a new
        imperative for neuroscience. Increasingly, neuroscience is called upon to answer questions
        about how Internet cultures are shaping our minds: How are reading skills, memory,
        sociality, attention and focus being transformed? Is Google making us stupider? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr, 2010</xref>). Does the replacement of
        reading novels with Internet consumption contribute to an increasing lack of empathy in
        society? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1363461512474623">Zaki, 2011</xref>). What
        kinds of minds are being produced by the “cacophony of stimuli” and the demands to shift
        attention, skim-read, and make decisions at the click of a mouse?</p>
      <p>In his book <italic>The Shallows</italic>, Nicholas Carr laments the rise of “pancake
        people,” those who think widely but superficially and skim-read headlines, at the expense of
        “cathedral-like” people, that is, classics-reading literary types able to think with rigour
        and depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461512474623">Carr, 2010</xref>). In
        asserting that excessive Internet and media immersion is dangerous, Carr explains the risks
        in terms of adult neuroplasticity, the dynamic state of the brain through which its cellular
        connections are altered in interaction with environmental stimuli. Carr and others (cf.
          “<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461512474623">Baroness Susan Greenfield,”
          2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan,
          2008</xref>) have promoted the idea that “the Internet is altering our brains,” using
        neurological phenomena to legitimize health warnings about digital media. These authors
        allude to studies suggestive of the negative effects of habitual digital technology use on
        adult brains, including fatigue, impaired learning, and performance. Assertions that media
        multitasking rewires the brain are built on behavioural studies as well as much widely
        popularized anecdotal evidence. For example, a study at the University of Michigan found
        that research subjects learned better after taking a walk in a natural environment rather
        than after walking in a busy and crowded urban setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1363461512474623">Richtel, 2010</xref>). The researchers concluded that this
        was because the urban context’s intense delivery of stimulation fatigued the mind and
        therefore impaired learning. Researchers have made an analogy between the busy urban
        environment and the experience of multitasking to suggest that multitasking and the constant
        bombardment of digital stimuli tires the brain and prevents periods of rest or “downtime”
        necessary for processing and consolidating long-term memory and learning. Other studies
        suggest that with rapid multitasking, errors increase across the tasks performed, and that
        the time it takes to do those tasks increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461512474623">Anderson, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, with the exception of some positron emission tomography (PET) experiments (e.g.,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363461512474623">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>) that
        examine prefrontal cortical activity with task switching, the majority of this research is
        behavioural, and not brain-based, and involves measuring performance in, for example, math
        tasks from which researchers extrapolate to comment on multitasking across digital media
        (American Psychological Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461512474623">APA], 2001</xref>). Similarly, heavy media multitaskers have been shown to have reduced
        ability to filter out irrelevant information and to manifest “breadth-biased” rather than
        selective and focused cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1363461512474623">Ophir, Nassb’l, &amp; Wagner, 2009</xref>). Research also points to the neurotransmitter
        dopamine, frequently associated with reward-driven behaviours, as the culprit in compulsive
        digital media use. These studies have shown, using PET, that dopamine release correlates
        with video game play and is abnormally reduced among “computer game addicts” suggesting that
        they are dependent on the stimuli to elevate their dopamine levels to normal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461512474623">Koepp et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461512474623">Weinstein, 2010</xref>). The cravings we
        feel for our digital devices, the pleasure and euphoria we experience and the “withdrawal”
        we encounter when denied our fix, are attributed to the powerful hook of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>). Digital
        technology is thought to lend itself to dopamine-seeking behaviours, not unlike drugs,
        alcohol, gambling, or shopping, and can affect users to the degree that in one experiment,
        “nonaddicted” volunteers playing alluring videogames became impervious to multiple attempts
        to distract them. According to Small, the “dopamine system allows them to tolerate noise and
        discomfort extremely well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp;
          Vorgan, 2008</xref>, p. 49). These claims, however, are based on speculations and only a
        handful of empirical studies which, themselves, draw ambiguous, indirect conclusions, more
        often than not neglecting to study brain activity, cognitive control, and media use all in
        the same studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363461512474623">2</xref></sup> (we
        return to this below).</p>
      <p>While media multitasking is reported to drive “breadth-biased” thinking and the Internet is
        understood to elicit addictive neurotransmitter responses, considerable emphasis is given to
        the <italic>benefits</italic> of video games and Internet searching in adulthood as a way to
        “boost brain power” and drive plasticity. These activities are thought to delay cognitive
        decline of vision and memory associated with aging by generating new brain cells and
        reorganizing connections between existing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461512474623">Achtman, Green, &amp; Bavelier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363461512474623">Mishra, Zinni, Bavelier, &amp; Hillyard,
          2011</xref>). However, on closer analysis, many of these studies reveal the ambiguities
        and contradictions in current interpretations of functional neuroplasticity as investigated
        through neuroimaging techniques. For example, a highly publicized study entitled “Your Brain
        on Google” compared patterns of cerebral activation during an Internet searching task in a
        “Net savvy” group and “Net naïve” group, all aged between 55 and 76 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1363461512474623">Small, Moody, Siddarth, &amp; Bookheimer,
          2009</xref>). The premise of this study is that a relative decrease in intensity or lower
        extent of activity in a given brain area is indicative of expertise. Given that the savvy
        group showed increased extent of (rather than the expected decreased) activity, Small and
        colleagues suggest that Internet searching can alter the brain’s responsiveness by engaging
        certain brain areas to greater degrees. In other words, even experts, the authors claimed,
        can “rewire their brains,” reflected by the increase in spatial extent of brain activity
        during Internet searching compared with text reading. In this study, increased regional
        brain activity in the Net savvy group suggested that Internet searching had brought about
        plastic brain changes, with the increased extent of activity interpreted as “map expansion,”
        that is, the functional enlargement of an area devoted to a particular cognitive operation.
        Alternatively, however, the changes can be interpreted as the result of task interference
        and less specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363461512474623">Grafman,
          2000</xref>). In other words, increased spatial activation of brain regions may reflect
        both increased <italic>or</italic> decreased specialization of a brain region and ability in
        a skill.</p>
      <p>Importantly, this very lack of integrative models in cognitive neuroscience, pertaining to
        functional neuroplasticity, allows these data to be used to support a wide range of
        interpretations and ideological biases. This interpretive openness actually increases
        neuroscientific authority, uses, and applications rather than challenges it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1363461512474623">Slaby, Haueis, &amp; Choudhury,

      <title>Growing up digital: The developing brain in Generation M</title>
      <p>The debate about the pros and cons of digital technology is intensified in the case of
        adolescents. Teenagers—referred to variously in the literature as Generation M, Digital
        Natives, and “screenagers”—constitute the largest proportion of digital media users,
        interacting with cell phones, Smartphones, laptops, and gaming devices or the Internet often
        simultaneously. Studies from the Kaiser Foundation show that American youth, between the
        ages of 8 and 18, spend on average 7 hours and 38 minutes per day on entertainment media
        (including Youtube, Facebook, and games, but not cell phones and texting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461512474623">Lewin, 2010</xref>). Scientists concerned
        with teenage digital media usage fear that immersion in these technologies from early
        childhood has a particularly powerful impact on the brain because of experience-dependent
        developmental neuroplasticity that peaks around puberty. It has been hypothesized that this
        structural plasticity corresponds to a “sensitive period” for cognitive development, since
        postmortem histological studies together with structural MRI studies suggest that
        adolescence might be a time during which certain stimuli can dramatically alter cortical
        inputs and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461512474623">Blakemore &amp;
          Frith, 2005</xref>). The analogy often used in the literature to describe the brain during
        puberty is that of an overgrown garden bush in need of pruning; such a model represents the
        brain as especially sensitive to environmental stimuli while at the same time pointing to
        the need for developmental reshaping or “sculpting” by appropriate experiences.</p>
      <p>The neuroscience of “young, plastic minds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>) coupled with statistics on
        the intense media use by youth have provoked fears that the young brain is being
        “disturbingly reshaped” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461512474623">Derbyshire,
          2009</xref>), and research programs have begun to investigate the hypothesis that habits
        of Internet use among adolescents may lead to increased aggression and decreased empathy.
        Capturing the central idea in a recent media interview, neuroscientist Professor Susan
        Greenfield stated that: “if we were to scan the brains of young people who spend a lot of
        time playing computer games and in chatrooms, we would find that the prefrontal cortex is
        damaged, underdeveloped or underactive—just as it is in gamblers, schizophrenics or the
        obese” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461512474623">Derbyshire, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Similarly, neuroscientist Gary Small in his book with Gigi Vorgan starts from the premise
        that “scientists have pinpointed a specific region of the teenage brain that controls the
        tendency toward selfishness and a lack of empathy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>, p. 31). This premise, which
        is in fact a distortion of functional neuroimaging research on social cognitive development
        that they go on to describe (p. 31), leads Small and Vorgan to claim that Internet use
        exacerbates existing “natural” social cognitive deficits and proneness for instant
        gratification and risk-orientation in adolescents “impairing social and reasoning abilities”
        by “stunting development of the prefrontal cortex” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461512474623">Small &amp; Vorgan, 2008</xref>, p. 32). Small goes on to
        hypothesize that adolescents “could remain locked into a neural circuitry that stays at an
        immature and self-absorbed emotional level, right through adulthood” (p. 32).</p>
      <p>Although suggestions that online gaming, social networking, and online gambling correlate
        with aggressive behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363461512474623">Ko et al.,
          2009</xref>) remain contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461512474623">Ferguson, 2010</xref>), links between “Internet addiction” and the onset of aggressive
        behaviour are increasingly investigated. Teenagers are increasingly referred to as a
        “multitasking generation,” able to manage multiple online tasks simultaneously with apparent
        ease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1363461512474623">Wallis, 2006</xref>). However, the
        costs of developing these “hyperkinetic teenage minds” through chronic use of digital media
        are a serious concern; some psychologists fear that habitual multitasking can lead to
        symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461512474623">Carroll, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Debates about the effect of the Internet on the brain are part of a history of hopes and
        anxieties about external influences on the young, developing brain. Drawing on early
        experiments with rats, psychologists and neuroscientists have become involved in research on
        the impact of “enriched environments” on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363461512474623">Greenough, Black, &amp; Wallace, 1987</xref>) as well as the
        effects of emotional and sensory deprivation on educational attainment and cognitive
        development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1363461512474623">O’Connor, Bredenkamp, &amp;
          Rutter, 1999</xref>). Policy makers have looked for evidence from neuroscience to develop
        guidelines on the importance of play in early childhood education, best practices for
        teaching languages and mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461512474623">Beck,
          1996</xref>), and appropriate levels of exposure to television and other visual media
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461512474623">Courage &amp; Setliff, 2009</xref>).
        This information is passed on to educators and parents, who are seen as architects of the
        developing brain whose decisions about external stimuli and types of environment influence
        neurodevelopment during critical periods of child and adolescent development. Since the
        stakes of scientific evidence in this arena are so high, and the implications far-reaching,
        close scrutiny of the data and interpretations is crucial. In the past, oversimplification
        of the concept of critical and sensitive periods has led to misconceptions about cognitive
        interventions in the first 3 years of life, which, despite scientists’ attempts to clarify,
        have remained entrenched in debates about the role of visual and auditory stimulation in
        learning during early life. These earlier debates have demonstrated the ways in which
        “state-of-the-art” scientific evidence, political agendas, and social anxieties can converge
        to produce brain-based myths that go beyond the data on which they draw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461512474623">Bruer, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, most of these studies cited in current debates about the Internet and the
        brain do not directly investigate relationships between digital media, the developing brain,
        and cognitive processing. Rather, they examine behavioural data on multitasking during
        development, and use the construct of the developing adolescent brain rhetorically to lend
        weight to their speculations. We take a closer look at the experimental studies that do
        investigate the impact of digital media on the teen brain, and show that their findings
        leave open the possibility for multiple interpretations. In the next section, we will show
        that the interpretations are complicated by the fact that the teenage brain is understood to
        be already in a state of pronounced developmental plasticity. As such, the role of
        neuroscience in making normative claims about the Internet and teenagers is especially
        ambivalent: If the Internet is changing the adolescent brain, what is it changing
          <italic>from</italic> and <italic>to</italic>?</p>

      <title>Development of the “teen brain”: Vulnerabilities, opportunities and ambiguities</title>
      <p>In 2010, the journal <italic>Science</italic> published a compelling and high-profile study
        in which the authors reported a new “brain age index,” calculated using neuroimaging data
        from a large pool of subjects in the USA, aged between 7 and 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461512474623">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>). Analogous to a height or
        weight chart, the authors claim that the brain age curve they constructed from data gained
        from a 5-minute scan of individuals at rest, holds the clinical potential to differentiate
        normal from abnormal development. They argue that these brief scans could capture
        information about the extent of connectivity in neural circuits in the brain, which could be
        used to determine where a child or adolescent falls on the normal trajectory of brain
        development and to predict his/her cognitive maturity. Those who fall off the normal curve
        can be identified as “at risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461512474623">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>). The brain-age curve is especially powerful in capturing
        the promise of adolescent brain research, and in conveying the notion of a “normal”
        neurodevelopmental trajectory. However, data generated from task-based rather than at-rest
        studies demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in the findings of patterns of brain activity
        over developmental time.</p>
      <p>Certainly, neuroimaging experiments beginning in the 1990s that first showed ongoing brain
        development beyond childhood have, according to many neuroscientists, revolutionized
        biological models of child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461512474623">Dahl, 2004</xref>). That the prefrontal cortex is implicated in the most dramatic change
        during adolescence is of major significance. The prefrontal cortex is associated with
        capacities for behavioural control including decision-making, working memory and
        multi-tasking, and also with social cognitive skills including empathy, perspective-taking,
        and emotional recognition—the very capacities at stake in the debates about the impact of
        the Internet on the growing brain. This ongoing developmental period is frequently referred
        to as a period of “vulnerabilities and opportunities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461512474623">Dahl, 2004</xref>). Adolescent neuroplasticity is thought to
        be both a source of risk (for onset of mental illness as well as problem behaviours in the
        healthy population) and at the same time a resource that can be tapped to harness the
        brain’s potentiality through various behavioural interventions.</p>
      <p>In light of the recent expansion of this field and the availability of a large number of
        datasets, a handful of groups have recently attempted to integrate the data into models of
        adolescent neurodevelopment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461512474623">Burnett, Sebastian, Cohen-Kadosh, &amp; Blakemore, 2011</xref>). These characterize
        adolescent neuroplasticity and its relationship to cognitive development in two ways: (a)
        the imbalance between the affective/motivational system and the cognitive/regulatory system
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461512474623">Ernst &amp; Fudge, 2009</xref>); and
        (b) the increasing functional specialization of brain areas involved in social cognition,
        executive function, and emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461512474623">Johnson, 2010</xref>). The developmental lag between the
        systems associated with cognitive control and affect are hypothesized by some
        neuroscientists to dispose teenagers to risky behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461512474623">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>), including “experimentation with
        novel but risky behaviours such as use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1363461512474623">Romer, Duckworth, Sznitman, &amp; Park,
          2010</xref>, p. 319), as well as the high incidences of violence, unintended pregnancy,
        and sexually transmitted diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461512474623">Casey, Getz, &amp; Galvan, 2008</xref>). The redistribution of dopaminergic receptors in
        prefrontal and paralimbic areas accompanying these developmental changes are thought to
        relate to increased sensation seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461512474623">Ernst &amp; Spear, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Most other studies investigate maturational changes in mechanisms for cognitive control and
        social understanding, comparing functional activity and task performance between adolescents
        and adults. These experiments suggest that the development of social emotional processing
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461512474623">Burnett, Bird, Moll, Frith, &amp;

          Choudhury, &amp; Frith, 2007</xref>) all undergo development during adolescence in
        synchrony with the “remodeling” of the teenage brain. The results show differential neural
        activation patterns in the brain, with adolescents either activating areas implicated in
        social cognition to higher degrees than adults or recruiting different subsets of neural
        regions to adults when performing the same task. The results have been interpreted as
        reflecting possible changes in “neural strategies” with age as well as functional
        specialization over development. However, the brain activation pattern that correlates with
        age-related specialization remains unclear.</p>
      <p>The term <italic>executive function</italic> is used to describe the capacities that allow
        us to control and coordinate our thoughts and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363461512474623">Luria, 1966</xref>). Executive functions have a role in
        cognitive control, for example filtering out unimportant information, holding in mind a plan
        to carry out in the future, and inhibiting impulses. Difficulties in the interpretation of
        neuroimaging results are found in studies of executive function. Tasks administered to
        children, adolescents, and adults in the fMRI scanner have demonstrated age-dependent
        activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461512474623">Casey, Jones, &amp;
          Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1363461512474623">Tamm, Menon, &amp;
          Reiss, 2002</xref>). In some of these studies, adolescents were shown to activate the
        frontal cortex to a greater degree than adults. One interpretation of the decrease in the
        extent of activity with age has been that extensive and diffuse activation in the brains of
        children and adolescence is a compensatory strategy used when the brain is less efficient at
        integrating executive functions. However, other studies investigating similar executive
        functions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461512474623">Adleman et al.,
          2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461512474623">Kwon, Reiss, &amp; Menon,

          2007</xref>), have demonstrated age-related increases in activity in corresponding
        prefrontal, limbic, and fusiform regions. Changes in activation patterns (which are taken as
        a proxy for brain maturation) during periods of development thus need to be interpreted with
        caution. The inconsistencies in the group comparisons reported in the literature remind us
        that neuroplasticity renders the brain capable of compensatory strategies depending on an
        individual’s developmental history.</p>
      <p>There is a growing body of research that indicates <italic>functional change</italic> with
        age, reflecting forms of developmental neuroplasticity. However, despite the allure of the
        brain-age curve, uncertainties remain about how to interpret changes during normal brain
        development (e.g., is fine-tuning associated with increase or decrease in activity of a
        brain network with age?) and the microstructural properties underlying such changes (e.g.,
        are functional and structural changes with age attributable to changes in synaptic density,
        intracortical myelination, or glial cell development?; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461512474623">Burnett et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given these complexities, making sense of the data from studies of brain activity during
        Internet use or video gaming becomes all the more open to multiple interpretations. One
        study frequently cited to support anxieties about teenagers and the Internet used functional
        MRI to investigate brain activity during violent video game playing in a group of older
        adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363461512474623">Mathiak &amp; Weber,
          2006</xref>). The results demonstrated suppressed activation of the amygdala during
        violent frames compared to nonviolent frames. The authors speculate that the reduced
        activity of the amygdala may be linked to increased aggression in later life. They suggest
        that reduction of limbic activation may correlate with avoidance of fear or empathy
        responses, which would confer greater precision during violent game playing. Training the
        brain this way over time could lead to the development of aggressive problem-solving
        scripts. However, this study did not examine any causal or even correlational links to
        aggressive behaviour.</p>
      <p>Another frequently cited study used near infrared spectroscopy to compare changes in
        cerebral blood flow in children (mean age 8) and adults (mean age 23) while participants
        played on a Game Boy device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363461512474623">Nagamitsu,
          Nagano, Yamashita, Takashima, &amp; Matsuishi, 2006</xref>). The results showed
        age-related changes in the utilization of the brain after a short practice period. In
        children, cerebral blood flow was decreased in the prefrontal cortex during play, while,
        brain activity in this area was increased in adults. The authors speculate about possible
        reasons including differences in performance, and levels of interest and attention, that
        were not controlled for. There were only six subjects in each group (small sample sizes are
        common in cognitive neuroscience research) and there was considerable interindividual
        variation.</p>
      <p>Given the data on adolescent functional brain development discussed above, interpreting the
          <italic>meaning</italic> of the decrease in prefrontal cortex (PFC) or amygdala activation
        is the most notable difficulty in both of these studies of video game use, because there is
        no baseline against which we can compare this finding. Whether reduced activation indicates
        diminished abilities due to incomplete pruning and myelination of the neural circuitry, or
        instead, a cognitive advantage due to efficiency of a restructured and fine-tuned brain
        structure is still an open question. The effect of video games on the growing brain is
        therefore difficult to interpret in the absence of a “norm” in current functional
        neuroimaging studies of cognitive development in adolescence.</p>
      <p>While adolescents are reported to be adept at multitasking, the brain is understood to have
        limits to the “cognitive load” it can handle. The implication is that brain regions cannot
        process the various tasks to adequate accuracy. Lack of efficiency is reported to be most
        apparent in young children and adults over 60, as “toggling action” or switching attention
        across tasks, occurs in an area of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that is
        considered “one of the last regions to mature and one of the first to decline with aging”
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1363461512474623">Wallis, 2006</xref>, p. 5). However,
        once again, there is a noticeable discrepancy between the claims in these popular debates
        and results from empirical research. While studies have shown that young people do multitask
        more than do older generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363461512474623">Carrier,
          Cheever, Rosen, Benitez, &amp; Chang, 2009</xref>), we were unable to find data pertaining
        to the relationship between brain function and media multitasking. The claims made by
        journalists and scientists rest on the finding that the prefrontal cortex—the brain region
        associated with multitasking—is the last to develop to maturity during the lifespan. This
        leaves open the challenge of explaining how adolescents show relatively higher skills in
        multitasking in spite of the ongoing brain maturation of relevant areas.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the alarmist claims made in the media about the effect of the Internet on the
        developing brain omit existing data on their possible benefits for young people. For
        example, a training study with young adults demonstrated that 10 days of playing action
        video games such as Grand Theft Auto, Medal of Honor, or Spider-Man can enhance visual
        attention and that cognitive and perceptual boosts from gaming can be transferable to other
        domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363461512474623">Green &amp; Bavelier,
          2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>How should these findings be incorporated into the existing debate? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461512474623">Bavelier, Green, and Dye (2010)</xref> caution scientists and
        policy makers to differentiate types of technology and note differences in content rather
        than lumping together “video games” or “the Internet” into one category. In the same way
        that television viewing can give rise to a range of effects (e.g., viewing of <italic>Sesame
          Street</italic> by children has shown benefits for language skills while viewing of
          <italic>Teletubbies</italic> has shown the opposite effect), digital media include a wide
        variety of content, which will not all have similar effects on cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461512474623">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>). These studies
        that suggest possible benefits of digital media use are increasingly cited. However, the
        experimental designs of these studies require careful scrutiny, and it has recently been
        suggested that the model of the clinical trial would be a more adequate way to test existing
        claims about the effects of digital media. Most of the studies of Bevalier and colleagues do
        not take into account differential placebo effects on game skills in training studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461512474623">Boot, Blakely, &amp; Simons, 2011</xref>;
        see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461512474623">Costandi, 2011</xref>, for a
        review). Moreover, as Costandi reports, “many studies split their reports of different
        beneficial outcomes from the same groups of participants over multiple papers, making it
        unclear how many times the results have been independently replicated” (Design defects
        section, para. 5). The impact of Bevalier and Green’s 2003 study has been impressive—it has
        been cited more than 650 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461512474623">Costandi, 2011</xref>) in both media and in academic sources—and while its conclusions
        may not be wrong, the scientific evidence remains insufficient to support the strong claims
        made.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is important to note that existing studies on which media claims draw are
        based on correlational not causal paradigms. Technology use is also highly correlated with
        other factors such as household income and parents’ education, reminding us that the context
        of the child cannot easily be disentangled from the effects of digital media per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461512474623">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>). Studies are
        needed that examine how digital technologies affect other activities performed by
        adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363461512474623">Healy (1999)</xref>, for
        example, has examined the detrimental developmental effects when computer use replaces
        traditional physical playtime, and its impact on creativity. Thus, what is at issue is not
        necessarily the technology itself but the contexts of its use and the differential impact by
        age and other variables on users.</p>

      <title>Plastic reason: Metamorphosis and mutation</title>
      <p>We have tried to show that the polemical debates in the media about digital technologies
        and the teenage brain operate with a thin set of brain-based evidence and simplified
        theoretical accounts which fail to differentiate types of plasticity and kinds of media and
        technology, or to acknowledge alternative interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461512474623">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461512474623">Courage &amp; Setliff, 2009</xref>). In fact, it is unlikely
        that further functional neuroimaging experiments on adolescents in cyber environments can
        resolve the debate or be used as the evidence base for policy guidelines without taking into
        account behavioural findings. Certainly imaging data can be and should be used as part of
        triangulated approaches that include psychological and sociological data to make sense of
        the effects of digital media. However, brain imaging data produced in current studies tell
        us little about these issues. Nevertheless, this limited brain data is used to support
        normative claims about adolescents and digital media and, despite the absence of solid
        evidence, neuroscience occupies a privileged space in the debates. Compared with clinical
        and anecdotal reports of behaviours associated with heavy Internet and technology use, the
        notion of <italic>a developing brain with a high degree of malleability</italic> seems to be
        a powerful argument invoked both by those who critique teenage Internet use and those who
        encourage it. However, this notion of malleability or plasticity in itself has not clear
        implications for the impact of Internet use; the science merely suggests that the adolescent
        brain is particularly <italic>impressionable</italic> in response to environmental
        influences, whether they are good or bad.</p>
      <p>If brain research cannot answer the questions about the value of the Internet for
        adolescent well-being, how can we explain its appeal? Beyond the privilege we in
        contemporary Western society grant to the concept that we are our brains—<italic>homo
          cerebralis sumus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461512474623">Hagner,
          2000</xref>)—there are many reasons that the brain may hold a special status in this
        particular debate. First, there is a close correspondence between neuroscience and the
        Internet: the 21st-century model of the brain is no longer analogous to a hierarchical
        company, but rather to a vast decentralized network organized just like the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461512474623">Borck, 2011</xref>). The Internet has thus
        come to stand in as a metaphor in contemporary neuroscience for understanding how the brain
        works. (Interestingly, we might add, the same technologies allowing the screens,
        computations and images of neuroscience are those of digital media under question.) There is
        a second resonance between current characterizations of adolescence and the Internet as a
        medium. As Sherry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1363461512474623">Turkle (2011)</xref>
        points out, “online life is like an identity workshop”. Exploration of identity is also a
        defining feature of the adolescence. Beyond the fit between neuroscience and the Internet,
        and the Internet and adolescence, we suggest the notion of adolescents’ pronounced
        neuroplasticity is key to understanding the appeal and the function of the brain in these
        debates.</p>
      <p>In biomedicalized societies, the concept of brain plasticity has generated much excitement
        giving rise to a new style of thought, connected to a booming industry of brain-based
        self-improvement or “neuroascesis,” particularly since the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461512474623">Doidge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363461512474623">Ortega, 2011</xref>). The idea that the brain has the
        capacity to modify itself through experience-dependent processes has pushed neuroscience
        towards a less deterministic and more interactional discourse. Aside from genetic
        programming, neuroplasticity is after all dependent on environmental inputs, and, as
        popularized accounts emphasize, the enrichment of a given environment can bring about
        reorganization and genesis of neurons. In adulthood, plasticity has been celebrated as the
        means through which recovery can occur after trauma and injury, and the mechanism through
        which new skills can continue to be learned throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461512474623">Doidge, 2007</xref>). In contrast to the notion of the brain
        as a fixed organ, which determines certain behaviours or dispositions of a person, the
        plastic self is alterable, continually evolving and able to steer its own course into an
        open future by working on its material substrate, the metamorphosing brain. This plastic
        reason has radically recast visions of the brain giving it a sense of historicity,
        individuality, and situatedness, and assigning it the ability to respond to psychological
        experience as well as to generate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363461512474623">Malabou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1363461512474623">Pitts-Taylor,
          2010</xref>). In fact, it has become an ethical imperative to deploy one’s brain in ways
        that preserve its openness in order to maintain psychological health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1363461512474623">Rees, 2010</xref>). In this imperative, adult
        neuroplasticity articulates with individualizing formations of risk and responsibility.
        Plasticity in the adult brain is thus seen for the most part as a positive thing—a process
        that should be harnessed in order to learn, change or recover, and sustained in order to
        prevent mental illness and the negative effects of ageing.</p>
      <p>Plasticity in the case of adolescence is often framed differently—certainly in the debate
        about the effects of digital media. The adolescent brain, programmed to be in a much more
        pronounced state of synaptic plasticity compared to the adult brain, is rendered vulnerable
        and risky by virtue of its plasticity. The unsynchronized maturation of different brain
        systems, synaptic pruning, axonal myelination, and changes in connectivity and integration,
        all of which occur in concert with hormonal events, is thought to put the adolescent in a
        disequilibrated psychological state. This form of plasticity is not understood to be a
        positive metamorphosis steered by the adolescent, but rather a “work in progress” or a
        “remodeling stage” happening <italic>to</italic> the adolescent that leaves the brain at
        risk of being negatively changed by certain environmental influences. Of course, as
        mentioned earlier, adolescent brain development is not only referred to as a period of
        vulnerability but also as a period of opportunity. The opportunity refers to the sensitive
        window for reversibility and optimization through corrective or protective interventions
        provided by adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363461512474623">Fricke &amp;
          Choudhury, 2011</xref>). Further, the stakes and consequences of neuroplasticity for
        adolescents are interpreted differently than for adults, for whom opportunities for neural
        change entail responsibility and provide hope primarily as individualizing practices.
        However, while the actual locus of change rests within the brain of the individual
        adolescent, the risks or consequences of these changes are imagined to occur at a much
        broader level. The stakes are indeed quite high as changes in individual brains are seen to
        have the potential to collectively shape the future of society.</p>
      <p>Such a rendering of adolescent neuroplasticity seems far removed from the empowering
        reasoning behind adult neurogenesis. In contrast to the idea that neuroplasticity blurs the
        distinction of nature and nurture, we propose that it in fact reifies the boundary between
        “inside” and “outside,” defining the adult self <italic>in terms</italic> of this division,
        and viewing adolescents as incapable of sustaining this division, and thus as having
        compromised selves. Neuroscientist and historian of science, Laura Otis, has used the
        “membrane model” to analyze notions of selfhood that stem from germ theory in 19th-century
        science and literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1363461512474623">Otis,
          1999</xref>). She shows how, through the mingling of science and politics in imperialistic
        cultures in this period, cell theory was shaped by anxieties about the control of borders,
        nationhood, foreign invasion, and corruption. The membrane functions to absorb positive
        influence and filter out the unwanted, and in the case of selfhood to distinguish the “me”
        from the “not me.” This view has been used to approach the mind by scientists throughout the
        19th and 20th centuries, and to distinguish certain categories of people such as children,
        women, and colonial subjects as those who are unable to protect their mental barriers.
        Because of this, these categories of persons are imagined as weak-willed, suggestible, and
          <italic>permeable</italic>. In the discourse of plasticity, adult selfhood appears to rely
        on a “semipermeable” cortical boundary, or membrane, through which choices to resist or
        allow environmental stimuli can be articulated. Adolescence on the other hand is defined in
        terms of a “permeable” cortical boundary, open to environmental infiltration and subsequent
        neural changes. The teen brain is at risk of being penetrated by outside forces, such as the
        Internet and digital technology, which may steer the restructuring adolescent brain off
        track, reinforcing pathways that render the teenager inattentive and unsocial. However, as
        we have seen, a central question remains for cognitive neuroscience: to understand how
        development is steered “off track” requires an understanding of normal trajectories of
        functional brain development, which the field currently lacks.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The social construction of adolescence has been cocreated with moral panics about
        adolescents. Since the early 1900s with G. Stanley Hall’s now legendary description of
        adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461512474623">Hall, 1904)</xref>, Western
        society has viewed teenagers as both vulnerable and dangerous. New moral panics repeatedly
        have captured the attention of society, whether the issue be teenage pregnancy, drugs,
        predatory gangs, or “mean girls.” By providing commentary and expertise on the social
        problem, psychologists, sociologists, educators, and policy makers actually contribute to
        its construction as a social problem and enable the formation of categories, and of the
        embodiment of certain kinds of persons, such as the “teenage risk-taker” or the “mean girl.”
        Today, the Western media are filled with items reporting on digital technologies and youth,
        often with provocative and sensationalized headlines. As we have shown, the anxiety around
        these technologies engages the notions of neuroplasticity and the teen
        brain, thereby reproducing the category of adolescence as a distinct and demarcated period
        in the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461512474623">Choudhury, McKinney,
          &amp; Merten, 2012</xref>). In fact the logic of cerebral localization and the idea that
        the developing brain is made up of networks which are highly plastic are not new, but
        confirmed with new evidence “due to a cohabitation of new visualization techniques with old
        psychological parameters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461512474623">Hagner &amp;
          Borck, 2001</xref>, p. 508).</p>
      <p>In biomedicalized cultures, the “brain” exists as a vital metaphor for what is most true,
        durable, universal, and uncontestable about who we are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363461512474623">Dumit, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461512474623">Hagner, 2000</xref>). This compels us to look to the
        findings of neuroscience as the final authority in revealing the impact of digital
        technologies, and guiding any necessary moral and ethical action. Neuroscientific discourse
        is especially compelling as it provides a naturalistic construal of the person in terms of a
        stable biological substrate on which the influence of the “environment” is overlaid. This
        biological substrate is amenable to interventions from the educational to the pharmaceutical
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461512474623">Choudhury &amp; Slaby, 2012</xref>).
        Popularized representations of neuroplasticity obscure the complicated conceptual and
        ontological entanglement between natural, social, and cultural realms and offer simplified
        and contradictory support to debates about youth and digital media. As much as neuroscience
        attempts to overcome certain dichotomies such as external and internal through the notion of
        plasticity, it tends to reproduce these binaries through the ambiguities, interpretive
        uncertainty, and provisional status of its findings. Furthermore, despite the lack of
        consensus, scarcity of experimental data and imprecision about types of neuroplasticity,
        findings are selectively taken up in public debates and develop momentum by virtue of the
        authority and allure of the <italic>neuro-</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1363461512474623">Weisberg et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of the gap between
        empirical evidence and representation of these studies demonstrates how neuroscientific
        facts and fears emerge from a process of <italic>bricolage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461512474623">Young, 2006</xref>). For instance, the discourse on the
        Internet and the adolescent brain entirely omits a recent functional neuroimaging study
        pointing to the correlation between increased prefrontal cortex activity over age during
        adolescence and self-reported ability to resist risky, reward-oriented behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1363461512474623">Pfeiffer et al., 2011</xref>). How can the
        model of the “teen brain”—which separates motivational cognition from regulatory
        cognition—encompass increasing susceptibility at the same time as increasing
          <italic>resistance to</italic> susceptibilities, and how does this complicate the debates
        about the effect of the Internet on the growing brain?</p>
      <p>The idea of the extended, embedded, and enacted mind can offer a decentering alternative to
        the current debates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461512474623">Clark and Chalmers
          (1998)</xref> have proposed that “external” props or devices are in fact extensions of the
        mind insofar as they extend its functions and activities. The cellphone then is not “other”
        but exists as an extension of the mind’s capacity to store information or to communicate.
        Through feedback and feedforward loops that move across the boundaries of brain, body, and
        world, the distinction of brain and environment is collapsed. This view departs from the
        mentalist legacy of assuming strict dichotomies between mind and body, body and world, and
        one person’s mind and the minds of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461512474623">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363461512474623">Gallagher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1363461512474623">Thompson, 2007</xref>). The notion of extended mind stands
        in sharp contrast to conceptions of “cerebral subjectivity” that combine traditional
        Cartesian mentalism with the assumption that mental processes can be explained by neuronal
        processes alone, which culminate in the mainstream neuroscience view that “you are your
        brain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461512474623">Crick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363461512474623">Metzinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1363461512474623">Revonsuo, 2005</xref>). The extended-mind
        approach assumes that mental processes are constitutively embodied and environmentally
        embedded such that they cannot be properly characterized without reference to their bodily
        dimensions and relations to the physical and social environment. In using technologies like
        the Internet, Smartphones and so on, the capacities for adolescent thinking are
        reconfigured. Images of the “cyborg,” “cyberpunk,” “human-technology symbionts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461512474623">Clark, 2011</xref>) and the “screenager”
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1363461512474623">Rushkoff, 1996</xref>) displace the
        inside/outside dichotomy. Taken a step further, the view of the <italic>socially</italic>
        extended mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461512474623">Gallagher, 2011</xref>)
        pushes us to consider how the mind is also constituted in and is distributed across social
        processes and environments, and would thus include institutions, social structures, and
        discourses. By thinking with the notion of the socially extended mind, we can go beyond
        notions of neuro-reflexivity to imagine that the institution of neuroscience, as it shapes
        discourses about adolescents and their relationships to digital technology, is both
        constitutive and part of the mind’s distribution in contemporary society. Taking a view of
        neuroscience as an interpretive discipline shot through with cultural metaphors and motifs
        and of the adolescent mind/brain as socially extended forces us to rethink the popular
        anxieties about “Generation M” as well as the assumed boundaries between the brain and its
        environment, and between neuroscience and society.</p>

          <p>This statistic was recorded in 2008 by the US analysis group, IDC. The IDC claims that
            this amounts to almost half of the total time spent each week using all media (70.6
            hours), almost twice as much time as spent watching television (16.4 hours), and more
            than eight times as much time as spent reading newspapers and magazines (3.9 hours).</p>

          <p>For example, journalist and medical doctor, Ben Goldacre has publicly refuted Professor
            Greenfield’s claims on his Bad Science blog, arguing that they are based on her personal
            hypotheses and lack peer-reviewed published evidence to substantiate them. He also
            points out Greenfield’s simultaneous endorsement of a computer game called “MindFit”
            that is designed to enhance cognition. Many of the popular as well as scientific
            articles about multitasking, media and the brain, while making claims about the brain,
            draw on behavioural research or multiple existing studies with different methodologies
            but do not build on studies that directly examine brain, cognition and media
            correlations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363461512474623">Carrier et al.,
