<abstract>
<p>Since the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), there has been a growing focus on improving the quality of programs for children with disabilities and measuring the results/outcomes of those programs. Across the country, IDEA Part C Programs for Infants and Toddlers and IDEA Part B, Section 619 Preschool Programs have been developing, implementing, and improving their accountability systems, and in spite of significant fiscal limitations, the states have produced meaningful data demonstrating both program improvement and positive outcomes for the children and families being served. This article uses trend data reported by the states over the past 4 years to provide a national picture of the progress they have made, the challenges they have faced, and the improvement strategies they have undertaken. The lessons they have learned are relevant to the broader early childhood community. A discussion about implications for the future is included.</p>

<body>
<p>The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has always included oversight and monitoring requirements to ensure that states comply with the law and account for how they spend the funds they receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0271121411408119">Ramanathan, 2008</xref>). However, during recent reauthorizations, important changes were made to these requirements that began to shift the focus beyond compliance toward a greater focus on improved performance and results for children with disabilities. When the IDEA was reauthorized in 2004, Section 616 stated that the primary focus of federal and state monitoring activities should be on: “(A) improving educational results and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities; and (B) ensuring that states meet program requirements, with a particular emphasis on those requirements that are most closely related to improving educational results for children with disabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0271121411408119">IDEA, 2004</xref>). To this end, IDEA 2004 required each state to develop and submit to the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) a 6-year State Performance Plan (SPP) no later than 1 year after the date of enactment, evaluating its efforts to implement both the requirements and the purposes of the law and describing its plans for improving performance. As part of the SPP, each state had to collect and analyze baseline data on specified performance and compliance indicators. For the performance indicators, they were required to establish measurable and rigorous targets with stakeholder input, whereas the compliance indicators required targets of 100%. Each year, states must conduct improvement activities to ensure improved performance on these indicators and develop strategies to monitor the performance of local programs. The Part B SPP includes 20 indicators and the Part C SPP includes 14 indicators. In addition, IDEA 2004 requires each state to collect valid and reliable information as needed to report annually to OSEP and to the public on its progress in meeting the targets set in the SPP. This report is called the Annual Performance Report (APR).</p>
<p>States submitted their first 6-year SPPs in the December of 2005 and their first APRs on February 1, 2007, reporting data for federal fiscal year (FFY) 2005 (July 1, 2005–June 30, 2006). They submitted their fourth APRs on February 1, 2010, reporting data for FFY 2008 (July 1, 2008–June 30, 2009). Each year, these reports have been analyzed across all the states by several OSEP-funded Technical Assistance and Dissemination (TA&amp;D) Centers, and each year the results have been compiled into a summary report by indicator. The National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center (NECTAC) and the Early Childhood Outcomes (ECO) Center have been responsible for reviewing data on 10 indicators related to the IDEA Part C Program for Infants and Toddlers and the IDEA Part B, Section 619 Preschool Grants Program. These indicators can be grouped into four clusters that provide national information on early intervention (EI) and early childhood special education (ECSE) services and outcomes. They do not include Part C and Part B indicators dealing with general supervision or dispute resolution. The clusters are early identification, timely provision of services in natural environments, early childhood transition, and early childhood outcomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0271121411408119">Table 1</xref>). This article uses data from the APRs submitted to OSEP in February 2010 (reporting data for FFY 2008) as well as OSEP’s summary reports for those APRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0271121411408119">U.S. Department of Education, OSEP, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0271121411408119">2010b</xref>), to review the progress that states have made over the past 4 years on these early childhood indicators, the challenges they have faced along the way, and the improvement activities they have undertaken. A discussion about implications for the future is included.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A total of 56 Part C and 59 Part B SPPs/APRs from all the states and jurisdictions receiving federal grants for Part C and Part B, Section 619 programs under the IDEA were reviewed by NECTAC and ECO staff. Hereafter, use of the term <italic>states</italic> in this article refers all of these states and jurisdictions. Reviewers used a template developed by OSEP with the following common data elements for all indicators: past years’ actual performance (baseline FFY 2004, FFY 2005, FFY 2006, and FFY 2007), current year’s (FFY 2008) actual performance and target, a notation of target met or not met, and any change in performance, comparing current fiscal year to last fiscal year. Descriptive information from the states’ narrative reports included reasons for change in performance and featured improvement activities. Reviewers also added categories of specific interest for each indicator, such as data source, percentage of delays in timelines for justifiable family reasons, and method of analysis for child outcomes data.</p>
<p>After a primary reviewer read each report—entering data and descriptive information into the template—a second reviewer checked the accuracy of information entered, and all questions or disagreements between reviewers were reconciled by joint review. Other than the required categories of narrative information, no further guidance was provided to the states on how to collect information or how extensively to report, so there was much variation in the amount and type of information included. States used a variety of methods to collect information for reporting. For example, some states used a statewide data system, some sampled a percentage of child records for a record review, and others used a combination of monitoring methods, site visits, interviews, and local self-assessments.</p>

<sec id="section2-0271121411408119">
<title>Early Identification</title>
<p>Data related to the percentage of infants and toddlers with Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs) who receive EI services compared with national data (Part C Indicators C-5 and C-6) are an indication of the states’ performance on identifying and serving eligible children early. Part C allows states to define the eligible population, and both these indicators allow states to establish their own SPP targets. States annually collect and report data on the number of infants, birth to age 1 (for C-5) and birth to age 3 (for C-6), identified and served on a state-designated date between October 1 and December 1 of each year as per the requirements of Section 618 of the IDEA. In preparation for the APR, OSEP provides states with the national percentage of each age group served as well as state percentages. States measure their performance in comparison with the national percentage of children served, to their previous year’s performance, and in relation to the targets established on their SPPs.</p>
<sec id="section3-0271121411408119">
<title>National Trends</title>
<p>Nationally, the percentage of children birth to 1-year-old receiving EI services (Indicator C-5) in FFY 2008 was 1.04%; this percentage has increased slightly from FFY 2005 when it was 1.01%. Between FFY 2005 and FFY 2008, 35 states showed an increase and 21 states showed a decrease in percentage of the birth to 1-year-old population served. The decrease may be explained in part by the fact that since 2006, at least 20% of the states or territories have changed their eligibility criteria, generally by narrowing it, and additional states are considering similar changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0271121411408119">Ringwalt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0271121411408119">Shackelford, 2006</xref>). This has affected states’ performance on the child find/early identification indicators, although some states changed their SPP targets when they changed their criteria. Overall, the mean percentage served by the states changed little from FFY 2005 (1.16%) to FFY 2008 (1.15%), as the range of percentages served across the states expanded then shrunk. In FFY 2008, only 18 states met the SPP targets they set for this indicator.</p>
<p>The national percentage of children birth to age 3 receiving EI services in FFY 2008 was 2.66%, having increased from 2.40% in FFY 2005. It is important to note that an increase of 0.26% in the numbers of children with IFSPs age birth to age 3 over the last 4 years has come about despite changes in several states’ eligibility criteria. More states than not (31 compared with 25) met their SPP targets for serving birth to 3-year-olds for the first time in FFY 2008. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0271121411408119">Figure 1</xref> shows the trends for ranges and percentages of children birth to age 1 and birth to age 3 served in the 56 participating jurisdictions.

<title>Challenges</title>
<p>A total of nine states reported in their FFY 2008 APRs that the economic downturn and reduced state fiscal resources had a negative effect on their ability to identify and serve infants and toddlers. Fiscal issues identified included hiring freezes, state-required personnel furloughs, redirecting of funds toward service delivery and away from public awareness/child find activities, and the need to tighten eligibility in an attempt to serve fewer children. Several states mentioned using the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds allocated to the Part C program to fill some of these fiscal gaps, but they are concerned about what will happen when these funds are spent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0271121411408119">Benham, Ingraham, Jones, &amp; Schreier, 2010</xref>). Although there has been a slight trend upward in the percentages of children served by Part C, these percentages fall far short of the approximately 13% prevalence of young children with developmental delays projected in a national study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0271121411408119">Rosenberg, Zhang, and Robinson (2008)</xref>. Although analysis of the APRs reveals that narrowing eligibility does not correlate directly with reducing the numbers of children served, states have reported that the intent of tightening their eligibility is to assure the federally mandated maintenance of effort provision in the IDEA by serving fewer children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvement Activities</title>
<p>States have increased their focus on evaluating their child find systems at both the state and regional/local levels. They have identified child find/public awareness activities that were successful as well as those that were not. Local programs that met or exceeded the state’s target for these indicators have shared strategies they found to be successful with other programs. Programs that did not meet the target have developed local plans for identifying additional infants and toddlers. Some states report that they have used tools developed by the OSEP-funded TA&amp;D network, such as <italic>Evaluating SPP/APR Improvement Activities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0271121411408119">Kasprzak, D’Agord, Mullins, &amp; Mueller, 2009</xref>) and <italic>SPP/APR Improvement Activity Review Form</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0271121411408119">North Central Regional Resource Center, 2008</xref>) in these efforts.</p>
<p>For many states, improvement activities included developing, revising, or clarifying policies and procedures, including changes in eligibility criteria, promoting consistency in eligibility determinations, clarifying the use of informed clinical opinion in determining a child’s eligibility, adopting a universal referral form, adding the referral source to the IFSP, and clarifying protocols for referral of infants identified by the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program or Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act programs to Part C. States also report that they have improved collaboration across programs and agencies (hospital neonatal intensive care units, EHDI programs, child welfare agencies, and state chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics and their Autism “First Signs” work group), conducted outreach visits to homeless and domestic violence shelters, and translated public awareness materials into languages reflecting their diverse populations.</p>
<p>A number of states have changed and updated their state data systems, including adding referral sources and/or a mechanism to track noncompliance and its timely correction. States have evaluated not only their improvement activities but also included evaluation as an activity. They have examined trends in their data, including referral sources, progress in implementing improvement activities, local program performance on numbers of infants and toddlers identified and served, and gaps in their identification of and service to children with specified conditions. The results have been used to improve their child-find efforts, both locally and statewide.</p>

<title>Timely Services in Natural Environments</title>
<p>Data related to timely services in natural environments are an indication of how responsive EI programs are to families’ needs for timely entry and access to services provided in home and community settings, as opposed to clinics, hospitals, and other settings serving only children with disabilities. These are not only regulatory requirements of Part C but also supported by the evidence base on effective services for infants and toddlers with special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0271121411408119">Sandall, Hemmeter, Smith, &amp; McLean, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0271121411408119">Workgroup on Principles and Practices in Natural Environments, 2007</xref>). Part C Indicator 7 (C-7) requires that 100% of all eligible children and families have a timely evaluation and assessment and, if the child is eligible, an initial meeting to plan the IFSP within 45 days of referral to EI. Part C Indicator 1 (C-1) requires that 100% of families receive the services listed on their IFSP within a time frame that is consistent with the states’ definition of “timely services.” This definition can be either a specified number of days after the parent consents to the services on the IFSP (often 30 days) or a date specified on the IFSP and agreed on by the IFSP team, which includes the family. For both of these indicators, states must report reasons for delay. They have the option of differentiating between delays due to extenuating family circumstances and delays that are program related. If they use this option, instances of delay due to family circumstances can be counted as being in compliance with the timeline. Part C Indicator 2 (C-2) reports on the percentage of children who receive services primarily in natural environments. States set their own targets for this indicator. Although a majority of states have targets above 90%, they are not allowed to set a target of 100% because service delivery decisions must be individualized, and for some situations a specialized setting may be necessary for a period of time to achieve a child’s specified outcome.</p>
<sec id="section7-0271121411408119">
<title>National Trends</title>
<p>National trend data for the past 4 years show that states have made steady progress in meeting timelines for IFSP development and service provision as well as for providing services in natural environments. A total of 51 states showed improved or stable performance for meeting the 45-day timeline, 43 states for timely services, and 44 states for services in natural environments. The mean for meeting the 45-day timeline improved from 86% in FFY 2005 to 94% in FFY 2008. The mean for providing timely services improved from 82% to 92% across the 4 reporting years, and the mean for serving children primarily in natural environments also increased, going from 90% in FFY 2005 to 93% in FFY 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, for the same 4 years, the ranges from poorest to highest performing states steadily decreased, with more states performing at higher percentages. For the C-7 45-day timeline, the ranges were 39% to 100% in FFY 2005 and 70% to 100% in FFY 2008. For timely services (C-1), the ranges were 19% to 100% in FFY 2008 and 57% to 100% in FFY 2008. Increasing numbers of states also reported more than 90% of children and families receiving services in natural environments (36 states in FFY 2005 and 47 states in FFY 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0271121411408119">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>Common challenges across the states related to these indicators include assuring adequate numbers of qualified personnel, funding problems made worse by the current fiscal crisis, increasing referrals, inefficient service delivery approaches, and interagency issues around serving children and families who are homeless and/or involved in Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>Many locales experience shortages of therapists and difficulties in recruitment and retention due to a discrepancy in pay scales between Part C EI programs and hospitals or clinics that pay higher salaries. Moreover, many specialists do not have a pediatric background and are unfamiliar with the evidence that supports the efficacy of providing services in natural environments. This can contribute to their unwillingness to travel to families’ homes. In some rural areas, the only available therapists are clinic or hospital based. There are also shortages in developmental specialists (or infant–toddler specialists) and service coordinators, which greatly impact timely services, particularly when these personnel are relied on both to coordinate the process and serve as the primary service provider. Other personnel issues included having too few evaluators, difficulty finding interpreters, and losing private providers due to decreased Medicaid reimbursement rates and staff turnover. States also reported budget cuts, hiring freezes, furloughs, or reduced hours as factors that exacerbated personnel shortages. Travel costs were barriers to providing services in natural environments. Some states have not been able to negotiate Medicaid reimbursements for children served outside of medical settings.</p>
<p>Other common challenges for meeting the IDEA timelines included difficulties contacting families, missed appointments, insufficient referral information, delays in receiving evaluation or medical reports, difficulties getting information and parental consent for increasing numbers of children referred from Child Protective Services, and slower intake of children in foster care due to delays in assigning a surrogate parent. Some states have requirements for prior authorizations for EI services, which also slowed both evaluations/assessments and delivery of timely services.</p>
<p>Several states reported having an inefficient service delivery model and a lack of oversight for independent providers (a vendor system). For example, in programs with multiple providers acting separately to schedule evaluation/assessments, write and submit reports, and set service dates, difficulties in coordination and sharing of information have resulted in delays. These issues were difficult to correct when states and programs had inadequate or no funding for “team time” or the IFSP meeting, and no way of supporting the involvement of private providers in either teaming or training on improvement in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvement Activities</title>
<p>Many states reported improvement activities related to maintaining a continuous monitoring of local performance on the timeline indicators (C-1 and C-7) and providing regular performance reports to local Interagency Coordinating Councils (ICCs), the state ICC, regional administrative units, program managers, supervisors, service coordinators, and service providers. Some also supported the development of capacity at the regional or local level to improve the monitoring of their own performance by accessing the data system, using self-assessment systems or by record review. States also reported using monitoring data to target TA and training and using fiscal rewards and/or sanctions to improve performance on timelines. Improved data systems were common among strong performers on the timeline indicators.</p>
<p>Many states also reported comprehensive activities to increase the numbers of qualified personnel—such as creating ICC taskforces, studying recruitment and retention needs statewide, and securing funds or using ARRA funds to hire additional providers (especially therapists)—and to support training/TA activities related to services in natural environments, contracting with new vendors and increasing provider rates to pay more competitive salaries. Additional strategies included hiring staff by the state to cover areas of critical shortage, increasing travel allowances for services provided in natural environments, and using retired personnel and school or clinic-based personnel on nights, holidays, and weekends.</p>
<p>States are also taking steps to shift away from discipline-specific multidisciplinary approaches to a more integrated approach aimed at increasing effectiveness and extending the reach of scarce personnel. For example, in FFY 2008, 14 states reported that they were changing their service delivery system to a primary service provider, transdisciplinary or team-based model. States also provided training/TA, developed online modules, and supported pilot sites to better align their service approach and practices to the evidence base on effective services in natural environments. Some states reported using distance service delivery through technology (telemedicine and video conferencing) to get services to families in remote areas. Others reported the use of screening, streamlining evaluation and assessment procedures, revising IFSP forms and guidance documents, streamlining prior authorization processes and payments, and streamlining the provider enrollment process.</p>

<title>Transition From Part C to Part B</title>
<p>Both Part C and Part B, Section 619 programs are expected to demonstrate compliance at 100% with IDEA requirements concerning transition of children from EI to preschool special education at age 3. The Part C transition indicator (C-8) has three subindicators that focus on transition steps and services on IFSPs, notifying local education agencies (LEAs) of potentially eligible children, and conducting transition conferences between the sending and receiving agencies in a timely manner. The Part B transition indicator (B-12) is based on the number of children referred by Part C prior to age 3 who, if found to be eligible, have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) developed and implemented by their third birthday.</p>
<p>The process of moving from one program to another creates unique challenges for children, families, and program personnel. Support for effective transition practices has been a focus of OSEP discretionary funding for model demonstration and outreach projects, as well as a National Early Childhood Transition Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hdi.uky.edu/SF/NECTC/Home.aspx">http://www.hdi.uky.edu/SF/NECTC/Home.aspx</ext-link>), funded to conduct research, inform the field on evidence-based practices, and advance professional development efforts. Most recently, a national transition initiative supported by a collaboration of OSEP-funded TA&amp;D projects has developed resources on early childhood transition for state and local administrators (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nectac.org/topics/transition/ectransitionta.asp">http://www.nectac.org/topics/transition/ectransitionta.asp</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0271121411408119">
<title>National Trends</title>
<p>Most states have demonstrated progress for both of the transition indicators since FFY 2005. The majority of states reported performance of 80% to 100% on all the Part C transition subindicators in FFY 2008. State performance for IFSPs containing transition steps and services increased from a mean of 88% in FFY 2005 to 96% in FFY 2008. Only two states reported performance below 80% in FFY 2008. The mean state performance for notifying LEAs of children potentially eligible for Part B shows a 3% improvement over the four reporting periods. This slight increase reflects a higher performance by states at baseline, 94%, for this subindicator. Although convening timely transition conferences has been the most challenging subindicator for Part C programs, there was a 9% increase in mean performance from 83% at baseline to 92% in FFY 2008. Only five states reported performance below 80% in FFY 2008. States’ performance on developing and implementing IEPs for children referred before their third birthday has improved from 79% in FFY 2005 to 92% in FFY 2008. Concomitantly, the number of states reporting performance below 80% has decreased from 20 states in FFY 2005 to only five states in the last reporting period.</p>
<p>Prior to the institution of the SPP/APR reporting requirements, the majority of states were unable to collect valid and reliable data on these specific dimensions of transition. Many states had difficulty establishing baselines for the SPP. Reporting was often based on a review of a small number of records in a few local programs rather than a statewide approach for gathering data on all children transitioning from EI to ECSE. Most Part C programs continue to use record review as a primary data source for determining the documentation of transition steps and services on IFSPs. However, both Part C and Part B, Section 619 programs have improved their capacity to collect, share, and report child-specific data, such as referral information, relevant dates for specific timeline requirements, and reasons for delays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0271121411408119">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>Common challenges reported by the states related to early childhood transition included maintaining adequate numbers of qualified personnel to conduct timely evaluations and conferences, increasing numbers of children being referred and transitioned, conducting transition planning and development of an IEP for children with summer birthdays, late referrals to EI programs and LEAs, addressing family circumstances and parental refusals, sharing child-specific data across programs, maintaining local expertise on transition requirements due to staff turnover, and state funding reductions. Additional challenges frequently reported related to state and local interagency communication, coordination, and collaboration. Although states are increasing their use of electronic data systems, many continue to rely on monitoring mechanisms for reporting purposes. Very few states use unique child identifiers or have a means of tracking individual children from Part C to Part B.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvement Activities</title>
<p>States that demonstrated significant progress or maintained high performance in early childhood transition attributed that progress to a combination of improvement strategies, including promoting regular communication and collaboration between Part C and Part B programs at both the state and local level, analyzing and revising transition procedures, training and TA, and monitoring and data verification. Collaborative activities included the development of child identifiers and mechanisms to share data elements across programs as well as collaboration to clarify policies, evaluate programs, and conduct training across programs. The most frequently cited Part B improvement strategies were clarification of policies and procedures and the ability to collect needed data elements. For Part C, states reported improving the content and use of the IFSP form, refinements in collecting and sharing child notification data with Part B, and clarification of opt-out policies and strategies to improve the timeliness of the transition conference.</p>

<sec id="section14-0271121411408119">
<title>Early Childhood Outcomes</title>
<p>Although much of the SPP/APR process addresses service delivery and timelines, the indicators related to child and family outcomes require data on how children and families are actually benefiting from EI and ECSE services. The goals of the IDEA are no longer simply to make services available but also to ensure that the services provided lead to enhanced outcomes for the children and families they serve. In 2002, both the IDEA Part C and Part B, Section 619 programs underwent assessments from the Office of Management and Budget using the Program Assessment Rating Tool. At the time, there were no agreed-on performance measures or data available related to functional outcomes for infants, toddlers, and young children with disabilities and both programs received ratings of “results not demonstrated.” In 2003, OSEP funded the ECO Center to help define child and family outcomes and determine how they would be measured. ECO used a multitiered stakeholder process that allowed state and local administrators, teachers, service providers, families, and researchers to help shape the values underlying this new data requirement. Collecting and reporting outcomes data, stakeholders said, should promote recommended practices; reflect a holistic, authentic, functional approach to service delivery; and hold true for children from birth through age 5. To that end, they articulated this overarching goal for EI/ECSE services:
<disp-quote>
<p>Early intervention and ECSE support young children with disabilities and their families. For children, the ultimate goal of this support is to enable young children to be active and successful participants during the early childhood years and in the future in a variety of settings—in their homes with their families, in child care, preschool or school programs, and in the community. For families, the ultimate goal is to enable families to provide care for their child and have the resources they need to participate in their own desired family and community activities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0271121411408119">ECO Center, 2005b</xref>, p.2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further delineation of this overarching goal specified that EI/ECSE services should help children improve their social–emotional skills (including positive social relationships), acquire and use knowledge and skills, and use appropriate behaviors to meet their needs. EI stakeholders agreed that programs for infants and toddlers could also be evaluated by the extent to which families report that services helped them know their rights, effectively communicate their children’s needs, and help their children develop and learn. ECSE stakeholders said that programs for preschoolers (as well as for all of Part B programs, which include children 3–21 years of age) could be evaluated according to the extent to which families report that schools facilitated parent involvement as a means of improving services and results for children with disabilities. Based on stakeholder recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0271121411408119">ECO Center, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0271121411408119">2005b</xref>), OSEP adopted what are now the required SPP/APR indicators related to early childhood outcomes: Indicators C-3, C-4, B-7 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0271121411408119">Table 1</xref>), and B-8. Indicator B-8 provides data on family involvement that is reported and aggregated with all Part B data for children ages 3 to 21. Therefore, early childhood data for this indicator cannot be isolated and are not included in this article.</p>
<sec id="section15-0271121411408119">
<title>National Trends</title>
<p>States have made incredible efforts to generate data related to child and family outcomes in recent years. This review of their SPPs/APRs showed three notable trends: States have quickly developed statewide outcomes measurement systems, states’ data have shown improvements to child outcomes data, and states’ data have shown improvements to family outcomes data.</p>
<sec id="section16-0271121411408119">
<title>Development of state outcomes measurement systems</title>
<p>States began developing outcomes measurement systems at the same time that stakeholders were defining the outcomes to be measured. The work of the stakeholders began in 2004, OSEP announced the new SPP/APR outcomes data requirement in 2005, and in 2007, states were required to begin reporting the data for FFY 2005. Acknowledging that most states would need to develop systems for collecting outcomes data where none had previously existed, the first required child outcomes data were “entry status” only. Data showing progress require states to compare children’s levels of functioning at the beginning of services with their levels of functioning when they exit from services. The one-time requirement to report entry data for FFY 2005 was meant to show “a good faith effort” that, indeed, states were putting measurement systems in place. This immediate need to report data led some state administrators to compare the experience with “building a plane while flying it.”</p>
<p>During this time, states faced a daunting number of resource-intensive tasks. Most began by educating stakeholders about the data requirement and soliciting their recommendations for an approach to measuring outcomes that could be field tested in local programs. Results of these “pilots” helped state leaders refine the process, develop policies and procedures, and determine the amount and type of training needed. Some states received General Supervision Enhancement Grants from OSEP, and others reallocated scarce resources to support this work.</p>
<p>These efforts yielded a variety of approaches to measure child and family outcomes across the states. In FFY 2008, most state programs (73% Part C and 61% Part B, Section 619) used the Child Outcomes Summary Form process, a method developed by ECO for summarizing data from multiple assessment sources to rate each child’s level of functioning in each of the three outcome areas. Some state programs (13% Part C and 15% Part B, Section 619) mandated the use of one tool statewide. A smaller number of state programs (5% Part C and 10% Part B, Section 619) used publisher-developed systems to produce reports based on assessment data entered online. Finally, some states tried other, unique ways of collecting and reporting child outcomes data. The family outcomes indicator was measured by all states using surveys disseminated to families, although the items on the surveys and the methods for distribution, collection, and analyzing the data varied. Approximately, 45% of the states used a survey developed by the National Center for Special Education Accountability Monitoring, 45% used a survey developed by ECO, and 11% developed their own survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvements in child outcomes data</title>
<p>In spite of the quick turnaround time for both defining child and family outcomes and developing systems to measure them, most state programs (93% Part C and 90% Part B, Section 619) were able to report child outcomes data for FFY 2006. By FFY 2008, 100% of state Part C programs and all but one state Part B, Section 619 program reported child outcomes data to the federal government. Furthermore, over the 3 years of reporting on child outcomes, the number of children included in the reports per state has gradually increased. In FFY 2006, when states began reporting progress data, only 3 of the Part C APRs (5%) and 11 of the Part B APRs (19%) included data on more than 1000 children. By FFY 2008, that number had increased to 21 Part C APRs (38%) and 32 Part B APRs (54%) that included data on more than 1000 children.</p>
<p>The data states reported for FFY 2008 are considered baseline for the child outcomes indicators. Baselines were not established prior to FFY 2008 because outcomes measurement systems were not expected to be fully implemented up to that point. Waiting until FFY 2008 to establish baselines gave states time to implement outcomes measurement procedures consistently across all their local programs, statewide. Until data collection included all local programs in a state, the outcomes data could not represent all the children the state might serve. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0271121411408119">Table 1</xref>, therefore, presents only the data that establish baseline for the child outcomes indicator (FFY 2008).</p>
<p>Although states collect and report child outcomes data in five progress categories, they established baselines and set targets for two “summary statements” that combine data across categories. The five categories in which children are reported include (a) no progress, (b) progress—but not enough to move closer to age expectations, (c) progress in which children move closer to age expectations or “narrow the gap,” (d) progress in which children reach age expectations or “close the gap,” and (e) maintenance of age-expected functioning. In the years leading up to the establishment of baseline, OSEP received comments suggesting that setting targets for all five progress categories, for all three outcome areas, was excessive. The ECO Center therefore facilitated a stakeholder process to make recommendations for setting targets in a way that was reasonable, although also accurately reflecting the progress children made while in programs. The process yielded two “summary statements” on which to set targets: (a) Of those children who entered or exited services below age expectations in each outcome, the percentage that substantially increased their rate of growth by the time they exited the program and (b) the percentage of children that were functioning within age expectations in each outcome by the time they exited the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0271121411408119">Hebbeler &amp; Kahn, 2008</xref>). Summary Statement 1 combines data from the children who moved closer to age-expected functioning (progress category “c”) and those who reached age-expected functioning (progress category “d”). Summary Statement 2 combines data from children who reached age-expected functioning (progress category “d”) and those who maintained age-expected functioning (progress category “e”). National averages of the baselines for these two summary statements are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0271121411408119">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section18-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvements in family outcomes data</title>
<p>States began collecting data on family outcomes for the first time in FFY 2005, and the percentages of families reporting improved outcomes have increased slightly since that time. In FFY 2008, the national average percentages on the three family outcomes subindicators showed a greater percentage of families who understand their rights (from 80% in FFY 2005 to 84% in FFY 2008) can effectively communicate their children’s needs (from 80% in FFY 2005 to 85% in FFY 2008) and can better help their children develop and learn (from 86% in FFY 2005 to 90% in FFY 2008). Looking at individual state data, approximately two-thirds of all states have maintained high percentages or increased percentages across these subindicators. The percentage of states that have improved or stayed the same from baseline to the most recent reporting period is 75% for Indicator C-4 (A), 73% for C-4 (B), 77% for C-4 (C). In terms of response rates, the national average across states has increased slightly over the past 3 years, from 31.9% in FFY 2006 to 33.3% in FFY 2008.</p>

<sec id="section19-0271121411408119">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>States must now maintain and improve the systems for measuring child and family outcomes they so quickly established. This involves integrating outcomes measurement into the existing systems—personnel development system, data system, and use of data to drive decision making—and investing in ongoing professional development. Although many states have conducted training and TA to ensure that providers and administrators have the knowledge and skills needed for collecting data and reporting on outcomes, programs must build ongoing training and TA into their systems so that new staff are oriented and continuing staff have new opportunities for peer to peer supports and practical or situational learning. New training materials must be developed to address increasingly sophisticated questions, while allowing regular opportunities for feedback from providers to the state about how implementation is progressing and the revision of policies and procedures if necessary.</p>
<p>With the immediate need for data, another key challenge for states has been the concurrent development and implementation of quality assurance (QA) strategies. In FFY 2008, states were still in varying stages of finalizing their outcomes measurement systems and establishing procedures to assure the reliability and validity of the data. Although states now have child and family outcomes data to report, until those data are representative of the children and families they serve, it may be premature to fully interpret the numbers or to use them for program planning and improvement. Although the last 3 years have shown an increase in the numbers of children included in the data, states are still challenged with the issue of missing data and therefore not fully or accurately representing the progress children make while receiving services. For the family indicator, ensuring data quality is twofold. States are working to increase survey response rates as well as to ensure that the received responses represent the demographic characteristics of the families served.</p>
<p>Beyond data collection and reporting, states are also working to increase their capacity to analyze and understand child and family outcomes data for informed decision making and program improvement. Pioneering states have already established data systems to link outcomes data to child, family, and service characteristics to answer important questions about the type, amount and quality of services that leads to best results for children and families. Furthermore, these states have established processes for supporting local programs in the analysis, interpretation, and use of data for improving local program implementation. States are challenged with ensuring that the data and analyses are accessible to those who can benefit from their use. Interpreting the data is an essential activity involving stakeholders at all levels of the system. Ultimately, the data are intended to be used to for program improvement purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0271121411408119">
<title>Improvement Activities</title>
<p>Most of the improvement activities reported in FFY 2008 for the child and family outcomes indicators relate to the key challenges discussed above. States are conducting training, TA, and mentoring to improve the quality of the outcomes data, and a few are beginning to focus on improving actual child and family outcomes. States are increasingly using technology to reach more providers and to provide just-in-time information. In addition, states are clarifying policies, procedures, and guidance around their outcomes measurement systems. Many of the early policies and guidance materials were established prior to implementation, and with experience and actual data these materials can now be revised and improved.</p>
<p>States are also developing QA procedures and implementing QA processes to improve the quality of their data. Some are reviewing a random sample of local outcomes data to identify areas of concern or conducting data analysis for pattern checking as another way to identify data quality issues. These QA activities are then followed by contacting local programs to address potential data quality issues. For family outcomes, states are continuing to improve the response rate and representativeness of the data given the changing population and growing diversity of families. States are finding creative ways to distribute and collect survey data from families and building relationships with community leaders and trusted community members to reach culturally and linguistically diverse families.</p>

<title>Implications for the Future</title>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing focus in the federal government on collecting meaningful data, both for accountability and program improvement purposes. Policymakers are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to allocate limited resources and both the IDEA Part C and Part B, Section 619 programs need to demonstrate that they are not only complying with the requirements of the law but also achieving its intended purposes. For this reason, it is important that states continue to build their capacity for continuous monitoring, reporting, and data collection. Occurrences of noncompliance need to be identified quickly and improvement activities need to be data based, comprehensive, and long term. It is also important to realize that a focus solely on compliance and performance on the SPP/APR indicators is not sufficient to assure quality of services. Although these data demonstrate the extent to which the requirements of the IDEA are being met, they do not provide information about the <italic>quality</italic> of services children and families are receiving. For example, if providers meet the 45-day timeline for the IFSP meeting but their focus on timelines has precluded quality conversations with families and authentic assessments, the resulting IFSPs may not include functional outcomes and the individualized supports/services needed to enhance the child’s participation in home and community life. Therefore, states need to monitor on quality measures as well.</p>
<p>Across all of the SPP/APR indicators reviewed by NECTAC and ECO, states reported that budget shortfalls are impacting their ability to fully implement the early childhood provisions of the IDEA. It is likely that there will be continued tension between spending dollars for: (a) increasing child find and public awareness activities and (b) providing high-quality services to the children and families already being referred and identified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0271121411408119">Rosenberg et al. (2008)</xref> noted that states need to “evaluate the appropriateness of their definitions of eligibility and the effectiveness of their child-find strategies” (p. 1507). It is clear from their APRs that they have begun to evaluate the latter. They may also need to adopt new strategies, such as those suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0271121411408119">Dunst (2010)</xref> to streamline the eligibility process and those suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0271121411408119">Hurth, Nylander, Rooney, Woodcock, and Younggren (2010)</xref> to integrate the IFSP process with outcomes measurement. Furthermore, as more states consider narrowing their eligibility requirements for Part C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0271121411408119">Ringwalt, 2011</xref>), they need to evaluate the possible repercussions of doing so. For example, children with more severe needs may require more intense services and may be less likely to demonstrate major progress on outcomes measures. Focusing only on this population could potentially lead to outcomes data that does not accurately reflect what EI can do for most children. In addition, if infants and toddlers with milder developmental delays do not receive the supports and services they need, their delays may worsen over time, creating a larger population of children in need of special education services later in life. This is not consistent with the congressional findings on which Part C of the IDEA is based, which states that there is
<disp-quote>
<p>an urgent and substantial need: (1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities, to minimize their potential for developmental delay, and to recognize the significant brain development that occurs during a child’s first 3 years of life; and (2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, including our Nation’s schools, by minimizing the need for special education and related services after infants and toddlers with disabilities reach school age. (§631(a)(1-2))</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Personnel shortages were another theme underlying many of the challenges states reported on their APRs. To address this issue, states need to develop a systematic approach to professional development and TA that is multifaceted and includes orientation, guidance, training, and ongoing supports. A variety of topics have emerged as needed by practitioners, including child development, functional outcomes, authentic assessment, data collection techniques (family interviews and observation), how to interpret and use data, and the implementation of promising practices related to service delivery models, services in natural environments, and early childhood transition. Several states require orientations or competency-based training for all entering providers from all disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0271121411408119">Examples of State Competency Requirements, Certification and Licensure, 2010</xref>). To assure an understanding of high-quality EI/ECSE practices, preservice programs need to include competencies for pediatric providers and share recommended practices, position statements, and other resources developed by national organizations, OSEP-funded Centers and Professional Associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0271121411408119">Council for Exceptional Children, Division for Early Childhood &amp; National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0271121411408119">“Position Statements and Articles on Natural Environments from National Organizations,” 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0271121411408119">Rous, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0271121411408119">Sandall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0271121411408119">Workgroup on Principles and Practices in Natural Environments, 2007</xref>). Although states are trying to move to a team-based, primary provider service approach, it is important to understand that the process can take years and in many locales, practitioners are not yet adhering to the evidence base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0271121411408119">Workgroup on Principles and Practices in Natural Environments, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Implementing timely and seamless early childhood transitions also continues to be an area of concern in a number of states and locales. Much has been learned about the potentially negative impact transition experiences may have for families and clear implications for policy promoting best practice exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0271121411408119">Dogaru, Rosenkoetter, &amp; Rous, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0271121411408119">Harbin, Rous, Peeler, Schuster, &amp; McCormick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0271121411408119">Rous, Schroeder, Stricklin, Hains, &amp; Cox, 2008</xref>). State agencies, EI programs, and LEAs need mechanisms to gather information from parents about their transition experiences. This feedback, in combination with SPP/APR data, can be used to design transition practices that address desired family outcomes of preparation and adjustment, with special attention given to meaningful participation, knowledge, and facilitation of child development as well as a sense of parental self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0271121411408119">Dogaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0271121411408119">Harbin et al., 2007</xref>). Information is available on effective transition processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0271121411408119">Harbin, Rous, Gooden, &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0271121411408119">National Early Childhood Transition Initiative, 2008</xref>) and on specific strategies identified as useful by parents, providers, and administrators to support effective interagency relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0271121411408119">Rous, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0271121411408119">Rous, Myers, &amp; Stricklin, 2007</xref>). Acknowledging the complexity of the human experience in transitions will be essential to successful practices in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, it is critical that states continue to support the important work of collecting and reporting meaningful child and family outcomes data as well as using that data for decision making and program improvement. Connecting outcomes data with data related to child, family, and service characteristics will provide insights into questions such as What types of services result in the best outcomes and for which children? What families are we best serving? and What families have the best outcomes? These types of data can drive program improvement and help policy makers allocate scarce resources for those models and practices shown by the data to have the most promising results.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Since the IDEA was reauthorized in 2004, both the Part C and the Part B, Section 619 programs have been developing, implementing, and improving their monitoring and data collection systems for both accountability and program improvement purposes. The goals of the IDEA are no longer simply to ensure that services are available for children with disabilities and their families but also to demonstrate that those children and families are achieving positive outcomes as a result of participating in them. This is the new frontier for all early childhood programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0271121411408119">Hebbeler, 2008</xref>), and the experiences of the Part C and Section 619 programs can serve to illuminate the issues and frame discussions about accountability and outcomes as broader systems of early childhood services are emerging. Fiscal limitation is ever present in human services and has certainly challenged the IDEA early childhood programs in recent years, yet there is now data from the states demonstrating their commitment to and achievement of improved results for the children and families they serve. The lessons these programs have learned are lessons that can be shared broadly with the larger early childhood community.</p>
