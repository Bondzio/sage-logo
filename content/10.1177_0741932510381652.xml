<abstract>
<p>The current study reviews a computer-based math fluency intervention with 216 third- and fourth-grade students who were at risk for math difficulties. The intervention used a computer software program to practice math facts an average of three times per week for 8 to 15 weeks. Data were compared to those of 226 students in a control group. Results indicated that students who participated in the intervention had significantly larger gains on their math scores than those in the control group, and students with severe math problems (at or below the 15th percentile) grew at a rate that was equal to that of students with a pretest score that was between the 15th and 25th percentiles. Moreover, significantly fewer students remained at risk for math failure in the intervention group after participating in the intervention. These data suggest that the computer-based intervention was a useful supplemental math intervention. Suggestions for future research are provided.</p>

<p>Math proficiency is directly linked to successful employment after high school completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510381652">Saffer, 1999</xref>) and to the quality of instruction that students receive during elementary grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510381652">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Karns, 2001</xref>). According to the National Research Council, math proficiency is composed of (a) conceptual understanding, (b) procedural fluency, (c) ability to formulate and mentally represent problems, (d) reasoning, and (e) successful application of math to daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510381652">Kilpatrick, Swafford, &amp; Findell, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Math instruction should address the five components listed by the National Research Council, but math interventions must be highly and correctly targeted to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510381652">Burns, VanDerHeyden, &amp; Boice, 2008</xref>). The aforementioned five components of math could present potential intervention targets. Fluent computation is an important goal for math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510381652">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510381652">National Mathematics Advisory Panel [NMAP], 2008</xref>) and could be a potential intervention target. Students compute fluently when they solve math problems more quickly by recalling the answer than by performing the necessary mental algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510381652">Logan, Taylor, &amp; Etherton, 1996</xref>). For example, fluent computation can occur when a student can look at 3 × 3 = and quickly recall that the answer is 9.</p>
<p>The speed with which students complete basic math operations (e.g., single-digit multiplication and division) could serve as an intervention goal for some students, especially given that students with math difficulties frequently struggle to quickly recall basic math facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510381652">Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, Nugent, &amp; Numtee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510381652">Hanich, Jordan, Kaplan, &amp; Dick, 2001</xref>). Increasing speed of performance for any academic task occurs through practice with individual items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510381652">Binder, 1996</xref>). In fact, the amount of repetition was the instructional variable that was most closely related to retention of newly learned material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510381652">Daly, Hintze, &amp; Hamler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932510381652">Szadokierski &amp; Burns, 2008</xref>). Previous mathematics intervention research found that when students identified with a learning disability in math extensively practiced multiplication facts, they retained them, generalized them, and increased fluency to a level that was typical for their grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510381652">Burns, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Many students who are not proficient in more advanced math problems lack fluency of the basic skills within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510381652">Houchins, Shippen, &amp; Flores, 2004</xref>). Similar to the automatic processing theory of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741932510381652">Samuels, 1987</xref>), if students are able to compute basic math operations without devoting much cognitive energy to the task, then they can dedicate their resources to more advanced applications within the problem. Research has consistently demonstrated that teaching basic or component skills (e.g., single-digit multiplication), usually through repeated practice, led to the increased performance of more advanced skills such as multidigit multiplication or word problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510381652">Dehaene &amp; Akhavein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741932510381652">Singer-Dudek &amp; Greer, 2005</xref>). Moreover, previous research found a relationship between math fact fluency and applications of the concepts so that enhanced computation skills also increased conceptual understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510381652">Rittle-Johnson &amp; Siegler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510381652">Rittle-Johnson, Siegler, &amp; Wagner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Interventions within K–12 schools are becoming increasingly more frequently delivered within a multitiered approach in which the second tier involves efficiently delivered interventions for approximately 20% to 25% of the student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510381652">Batsche et al., 2005</xref>). Students with academic scores within the 10th to 25th percentile are identified as at risk and receive a secondary intervention (i.e., Tier 2), and those at or below the 10th to 15th percentile demonstrate severe needs and participate in a tertiary (i.e., Tier 3) intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741932510381652">Shinn, 2005</xref>). Academic intervention research frequently uses the 25th percentile as the criterion to determine if students require additional intervention within a tiered intervention model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510381652">Burns &amp; Gibbons, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510381652">Fuchs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932510381652">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>), and a synthesis of math research suggested that the 15th percentile accurately identifies students with severe deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510381652">Mazzocco, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some have suggested that the second tier of intervention is critically important to a successful intervention model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510381652">Burns, Hall-Lande, Lyman, Rogers, &amp; Tan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932510381652">Vaughn, Wanzek, Linan-Thompson, &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>), but most of the research for math interventions was conducted with researcher–student dyads for extended periods of time, which is often not possible in K–12 schools, or for entire classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510381652">Poncy &amp; Skinner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741932510381652">VanDerHeyden &amp; Burns, 2005</xref>), which is not directly applicable to a tiered intervention model because of the relatively large portion of the student population that needs additional remediation. Thus, it is important to focus on efficient intervention delivery. To ensure efficient delivery, many schools use computer-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510381652">Jimenez et al., 2003</xref>), in which interventions are delivered by having a student interact with a computer program with little supervision by a teacher or interventionist. Previous research found that computer-based interventions increased math skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510381652">Holmes, Brown, &amp; Algozzine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932510381652">Springer, Pugalee, &amp; Algozzine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510381652">Ysseldyke, Thrill, Pohl, &amp; Bolt, 2005</xref>), and computer-based interventions are promising approaches to efficiently deliver a tiered intervention model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932510381652">Ysseldyke &amp; McLeod, 2007</xref>). Moreover, using technology to implement interventions also resulted in easily accessible data that were also easily managed and analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510381652">McIntire, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932510381652">Wayman, 2005</xref>). However, previous studies did not focus on students with identified math difficulties, and most focused on general math proficiency rather than on a specific National Research Council area of math proficiency.</p>
<p>Ysseldyke and colleagues (2005) conducted a randomized study of a computer-based math intervention by examining Math Facts in a Flash (MFF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510381652">Renaissance Learning, 2003</xref>). MFF is a proprietary computer-based math intervention designed to increase computational fluency with independent practice with math facts. The study occurred in 13 elementary and middle schools with more than 4,000 students and 148 teachers. Students who participated in MFF for an extended period of time significantly outperformed students in the control group on an end-of-year math test, and 90% of the teachers reported that they liked the intervention. Although these data suggested that the intervention increased math skills with an efficiently delivered intervention, the student participants were from the general population and were not identified as at risk for math difficulties.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a computer-based math fluency (CBMF) intervention on the math skills of students identified as at risk for math difficulties. Specifically the following research questions guided the study: (a) How do the growth rates of students identified as at risk for math difficulties who participated in a CBMF intervention compare to the growth rates of those who did not? (b) How do the growth rates of students identified as at risk compare to the growth rates of those who have a severe deficit after participating in a CBMF intervention? and (c) What percentage of students remain at risk for math difficulties after participating in a CBMF intervention? It was hypothesized that the students in the CBMF intervention would experience faster growth than the control group, that students in the at-risk range would increase at a significantly faster rate than students who were severely deficit, and that fewer students in the CBMF group would remain below the 25th percentile after the intervention.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data were obtained from the Renaissance Learning (RL) database for 442 students in third and fourth grades. Of those students, 145 third graders and 86 fourth graders participated in the intervention at least three times per week for 8 to 15 weeks. The amount of use was selected because supplemental interventions generally involve three to five sessions each week for approximately 8 to 15 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510381652">Burns et al., 2006</xref>). A total 150 third graders and 90 fourth graders from the same schools were randomly selected from the RL database as a control group. Students in the control group participated in the intervention less than one time per week for less than 8 weeks. Third and fourth grade were selected because the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510381652">NMAP (2008)</xref> recommended that students be proficient in addition and subtraction of whole numbers by the end of the third grade and in the multiplication and division of whole numbers by the end of the fifth grade. Thus, whole number computation appears to be an important objective during third and fourth grade.</p>
<p>All participating students scored below the 25th percentile in mathematics on Star Math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510381652">RL, 2002</xref>), which is a group-administered math achievement test. Thus, all of these students were identified as at risk for math achievement difficulties by comparing math data to a commonly used criterion (i.e., 25th percentile) for determining students who need supplemental intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510381652">Burns &amp; Gibbons, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932510381652">Torgesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741932510381652">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, students were also classified as severely deficit if their score fell at or below the 15th percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510381652">Mazzocco, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The students in the study attended 104 elementary schools in 26 states. Although demographic data were not available for the individual students, the average student enrollment was 534.80 students; also, 52.58% were Caucasian, 19.92% were African American, 1.58% were Asian American, 23.31% were Hispanic, and 2.42% were Native American. Moreover, 65.80% of the students who attended the schools were eligible for the federal free or reduced price lunch program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741932510381652">
<title>Measure</title>
<p>Screening and pre- and postintervention data were collected with Star Math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510381652">RL, 2002</xref>), which is a computer-adapted assessment system. Students complete 24 items generated on a computer, from a bank of almost 2,000 items, based on an item response theory approach. Student responses are immediately scored by comparing the data to a norm group of more than 29,000 students and converted to an estimate of overall proficiency in math. Star Math was described as a technically sound instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510381652">Garner, 2005</xref>) with reliability estimates that ranged from .78 to .88. Previous research found that using Star Math to monitor student progress resulted in increased student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932510381652">Ysseldyke &amp; Bolt, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall mathematics score was converted to a normal curve equivalent (NCE), which can be interpreted much like a percentile rank but with an equal interval. The pretest and posttest Star Math assessments were conducted with at least 15 weeks between them for all of the student participants. The datum for the current study was an NCE growth score, which was computed by subtracting the pretest NCE from the posttest score. Moreover, student risk status was used as a dependent variable for the study. All students scored below the 25th NCE before the intervention, but those who scored above the 25th NCE after the intervention were no longer identified as at risk, but those who still fell below the 25th NCE remained designated as at risk for math difficulties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741932510381652">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>MFF was used as the CBMF intervention for the study because it was used in previous research on computer-based interventions for math and because it focused on computational fluency (RL, 2003). MFF is a software program designed to enhance computational fluency in the four basic mathematics operations. Students spend approximately 5 to 15 min working independently on math problems each intervention session, for at least three sessions each week. Each session consists of 40 math problems that are individually presented on a computer screen in large font (i.e., one problem per screen) along with three potential answers at the bottom of the screen below a thick line. The student then selects which answer he or she believes to be the correct one. If the student selection is correct, a red circle appears around the number and the student moves on to the next screen and subsequent problem. However, an incorrect selection results in the student’s choice being automatically crossed out with a large red X and a red circle appearing around the correct answer. At the completion of the intervention session, students see a computer screen that displays how long it took to complete the problems, how many problems the student correctly completed, and which specific problems were answered incorrectly.</p>
<p>Math problems for MFF are taken from one of 62 hierarchical levels, with 11 to 15 levels per grade. Each practice set consists of a randomly determined set of problems from the level on which the student is working (e.g., addition of 4 and 5, subtraction of 8 to 10, multiplication by 4 and 5, and division by 5 and 6). Students complete the practice set for up to 2 min. If they answer all of 40 items correctly within 2 min, then the level is mastered and the students begin the subsequent level during the next session. Essentially the students complete a baseline test to determine the appropriate library of items (e.g., multiplication by 4 and 5) and then practice the multiplication facts from that set of items until they can correctly complete all items within 2 min. After mastering a particular set of items, the students then move on to the next skill level in the hierarchy (e.g., multiplication by 6 and 7). Every third set of items is a review of the three previous sets. For example, after a student mastered multiplication by 0 and 1, multiplication by 2 and 3, and multiplication by 4 and 5, he or she then completed a review of multiplication facts 0 to 5.</p>
<p>The intervention sessions were supervised by the classroom teacher. Although MFF is mostly self-sufficient with little required supervision, the classroom teacher organized the students at the computers and assisted with starting the program as needed. The teacher also provided additional verbal cues to keep students on task and provided assistance with the program when needed but did not provide feedback on the math problems or instruction in them during the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741932510381652">
<title>Treatment Fidelity</title>
<p>Implementation of the intervention was not directly observed because of the size of the data set. However, the CBMF intervention records the number of times each week a student completes a practice set. Students in the intervention group participated in practice sets an average of 3.31 times (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.27) per week for third grade and 3.24 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.00) times per week for fourth grade. The average length of the intervention for the CBMF group was 11.05 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.33) weeks for third grade and 11.20 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.22) weeks for fourth grade. Therefore, the students in the intervention group participated in the intervention at an acceptable level for a sufficient period of time.</p>
<p>Third graders who served as the control group completed the Star Math assessments but completed the CBMF intervention an average of 1.40 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.85) times each week for an average of 3.36 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.40) weeks, and none participated in the intervention for longer than 7 weeks. Four graders who were in the control group completed the intervention an average of 1.41 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.77) times each week for an average of 2.64 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.71) weeks, with none exceeding 7 weeks of intervention activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741932510381652">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The research questions were addressed by computing an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that used the growth NCE as the dependent variable and the pretest NCE as the covariate. Because an analysis was conducted for each grade, a corrected alpha level of .025 was used to determine significance. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510381652">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> <italic>d</italic> was computed as an estimate of effect size, with .80 considered large, .50 moderate, and .20 small. Moreover, a χ<sup>2</sup> nonparametric test was used to compare the percentage of students identified as at risk after the intervention between the two groups, and again a corrected alpha level of .025 was used to determine significance.</p>

<sec id="section7-0741932510381652" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Before examining the effectiveness of the intervention, the distribution of the NCE growth data was examined by computing estimates of kurtosis and skew. The data were not normally distributed, with skew estimates of 1.30 for third grade (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.14) and 1.04 for fourth grade (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.18). Estimates of kurtosis were 2.00 for third grade (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.29) and 0.41 for fourth grade (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.36). Although a nonnormal distribution was expected given that the students all scored below the 25th percentile, it did violate an assumption necessary for parametric analyses. Thus, the data were converted to <italic>z</italic> scores using each grade appropriate mean and standard deviation. Data that resulted in <italic>z</italic> scores equal to or greater than 2.00 were considered outliers and were removed from the data set. Estimates of kurtosis and skew were all less than 1.00 and within two standard errors after the outlying data were removed and suggested that the data were now normally distributed and could be analyzed parametrically. The resulting descriptive data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510381652">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The first research question inquired about the differences in growth between the intervention and control groups. The data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510381652">Table 1</xref> show that students who participated in the CBMF intervention had larger increases in Star Math scores than those in the control group. The pretest NCE score for the two groups was not significantly different for third grade, <italic>t</italic>(279) = 1.00, <italic>p</italic> = .32, or fourth grade, <italic>t</italic>(159) = 1.62, <italic>p</italic> = .11, which resulted in small effects of .12 and .26, respectively. The ANCOVA with the growth NCE as the dependent variable and the pretest NCE as the covariate resulted in a significant effect for third grade, <italic>F</italic>(2, 278) = 4.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025, and fourth grade, <italic>F</italic>(2, 158) = 4.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025. The effect sizes for both groups resulted in small to moderate effects for third (<italic>d</italic> = .34) and fourth grades (<italic>d</italic> = .44).</p>
<p>The second research question compared growth rates among students identified as at risk and severely deficit and was evaluated with the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932510381652">Table 2</xref>. A two-way ANCOVA (again using the pretest NCE as the covariate) did not reveal significant effects for third, <italic>F</italic>(1, 276) = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = .88, or fourth grades, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = .76. Moreover, the ANCOVA for NCE growth did not reveal significant effects when comparing students who scored at or below the 15th percentile to those who scored above it for either third grade, <italic>F</italic>(1, 276) = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = .63, or fourth grade, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 1.29, <italic>p</italic> = .26, with three of the four estimates of effect size less than .10. Thus, students who scored in the severely deficit range (a pretest NCE score that was at or below at or below the 15th percentile) grew at the same rate as those whose pretest NCE fell between the 15th and the 25th percentiles.</p>

<p>The third research question inquired about the at-risk status of students who participated in the intervention. Although all participating students scored below the 25th percentile on the Star Math assessment before the CBMF intervention, 42.8% of the third graders who participated in the intervention scored above the 25th NCE after the intervention and 30.6% of the students in the control group scored above the 25th NCE. The percentages within the two groups were compared and resulted in a significant effect, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>n</italic> = 103, <italic>df</italic> = 1) = 8.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025. Among the fourth graders, 42.5% of the students who received the CBMF intervention scored at or above the 25th NCE and 29.1% of the control group did so, which again resulted in a significant effect, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>n</italic> = 60, <italic>df</italic> = 1) = 9.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .025.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study found that the CBMF intervention was effective in increasing math skills of students identified as at risk for math difficulties. Because fluent computation is an important math goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510381652">NCTM, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510381652">NMAP, 2008</xref>) and a frequent difficulty for students who struggle in math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510381652">Geary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510381652">Hanich et al., 2001</xref>), these data suggest a potentially useful intervention tool. However, the relationship between basic math fact fluency and more advanced skills among these students is not known. Student skills increased on the math assessment, but those data could have been exclusively related to increases in math fact fluency. Students who struggle with advanced math problems often lack the basic skills within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510381652">Houchins et al., 2004</xref>), but the current data are not analyzed by component skill.</p>
<p>Research has consistently demonstrated that increased repetition led to enhanced recall and fluency of the skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510381652">Burns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510381652">Daly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932510381652">Szadokierski &amp; Burns, 2008</xref>). The current data also suggested that increasing the amount of practice with a particular skill could be an effective intervention for math. However, a student must first complete the skill somewhat accurately before engaging in independent practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510381652">Haring &amp; Eaton, 1978</xref>), especially for math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932510381652">Rivera &amp; Bryant, 1992</xref>). Moreover, students may need to understand the problem conceptually before they can complete the steps of a computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510381652">Hiebert &amp; Lefevre, 1986</xref>). Therefore, a CBMF intervention may not be appropriate for all struggling math learners.</p>
<p>Tier 2 interventions within a multitiered intervention system are designed to be highly efficient and to address the needs of most of the struggling students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510381652">Burns et al., 2006</xref>). However, there will likely remain approximately 10% who require additional remediation beyond what is typically associated with an intervention provided in a second tier. Approximately 58% of the students who received the intervention still demonstrated scores that fell at or below the 25th NCE, but we examined only the postintervention score and did not judge the rate of improvement, which may also be useful data when evaluating intervention effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510381652">Fuchs, 2003</xref>). Thus, assuming that these data represent a student population, then approximately half of the lowest quartile would require support additional to what was provided by this CBMF intervention, which is also consistent with a multitiered intervention model. Perhaps a more conceptually based intervention might be more appropriate for those students who remain at risk, but meta-analytic research of conceptual math interventions found a negligible mean effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510381652">Baker, Gersten, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>). Thus, whether or not a fluency-based or conceptual-based intervention is most appropriate appears to be an area in need of future research.</p>
<p>The current data were also consistent with previous research that found that computer-based interventions increased math skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510381652">Holmes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932510381652">Springer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510381652">Ysseldyke et al., 2005</xref>), which could suggest that the CBMF intervention may be an effective component of a multitiered intervention model. Although the computer-based intervention was not delivered in a small group, it could still be used for efficient intervention delivery for 20% of the student population because the students work independently on the computer with little supervision. Thus, one teacher or interventionist could oversee the intervention for 5 to 10 students, which is the primary advantage of computer-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932510381652">Ysseldyke &amp; McLeod, 2007</xref>). However, the current data were not collected within a true multitiered system. Thus, we do not know about the quality of the core instruction or the intervention efforts for students beyond the CBMF intervention. The CBMF would be more effective if it were part of a total system that included quality math instruction and more intense interventions for students for whom the CBMF was not effective. Future researchers should replicate this study within a tiered system in which the quality of core instruction is measured and intervention efforts monitored. Moreover, future research is needed to examine the amount of teacher supervision that is required to complete the computer-based intervention, which could then be compared to teacher time dedicated within a small-group intervention.</p>
<p>Although the current data are likely of interest to teachers, math interventionists, and researchers, they should be considered within the context of their limitations. First, demographic data were available only at the school level rather than for the study participants. Thus, how well these data represent the schools and how well they generalize to specific populations is unknown. That data set was large and was obtained from a national sample, which suggest some confidence in the generalizability of the data, but how well they generalize to specific groups is unknown. Moreover, we did not collect additional student characteristic data such as attention span, behavioral difficulties, attendance, and so on and did not know if the groups differed on those potentially important variables. Second, data were obtained from a pre-post measure, which may be effective for research purposes, but most intervention systems monitor student progress much more frequently. Thus, future researchers could replicate this study with more frequent measures to determine growth. In addition, students in the control group were selected because they were enrolled in the intervention program but did not complete the intervention sessions. The difference between the two groups was small before the intervention occurred, but the groups could be different in unknown yet relevant ways. Future researchers could replicate the study with a true random assignment to control and treatment groups. Finally, treatment fidelity was measured by computing the average number of times the CBMF intervention was used. Frequency of use is certainly a component of treatment fidelity, but whether or not the students participated in the CBMF intervention as intended during those administrations is unknown and could be assessed in future research with direct observations of the intervention.</p>
<p>The current findings suggest that a CBMF intervention could be an effective means to increase the math skills of students at risk for math failure and that the intervention may have utility in a tiered intervention system. Additional research is needed to fully examine the potential utility of the CBMF intervention, but given the lack of guidance for tiered intervention systems for math and the number of students whose math skills are deficient, additional research seems warranted.</p>
