<body>
<p>The recent book <italic>Assassination, Anarchy, and Terrorism </italic>(2012) by Gerhard Falk is an intellectually sprawling work combing three related, albeit different areas of the historical and sociological literature. The book is an attempt to examine, within a historical context, the relationship between the three elements mentioned in its title, assassination, anarchy, and terrorism, while at the same time exploring the sociological and psychological underpinnings of these phenomena.</p>
<p>The book’s structure is fairly straightforward. After explaining the importance of topics under consideration in a brief introduction, the book can be divided into three major sections, one analyzing assassinations, organized by geographical region, one examining anarchy and terrorism, and the final section examining “the Muslim assault on Western Civilization” and “the causes of assassinations—some theories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057567712446692">Falk, 2012</xref>, p. v). Within these sections, generally, the material is arranged chronologically. This is a somewhat similar approach to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712446692">Oliver and Marion (2010</xref>) in <italic>Killing the President</italic>, of which this book can be thought of as a partial expansion.</p>
<p>Which audience the book attempts to focus on is sometimes difficult to ascertain, though in general, it seems to be directed at a specialized audience. It might additionally be useful as a supplemental text in a graduate course on terrorism or political assassination or even as a reader in an undergraduate course on similar subjects. It lacks the depth needed to be a primary text on the topics it covers, along the lines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712446692">Horgan (2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712446692">Hoffman (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057567712446692">Avrich, (2005)</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057567712446692">Reich (1998</xref>), specifically because of the attempt to integrate disparate areas of the criminal justice literature into a single text.</p>
<p>The breadth mentioned above, however, is not always a weakness. In the literature, there is a real lack of material linking important topics, and perhaps even more relevant to the current work, there is a general dearth of work on assassinations, though this is less true of the areas of anarchy and terrorism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712446692">Hoffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057567712446692">Reich, 1998</xref>). The fact that the book has much of its primary material examining the subject of assassination, and makes an attempt at applying theory to the topic, is important and should be noted as such, though his analysis also includes some questionable statements regarding motives for assassination (in many cases which he attributes antisemitism as the sole cause) and some factual errors (e.g., taking the now minority view that assassins were drug users).</p>
<p>Further, the book’s historical approach provides context to the reader, which would be an excellent feature for students utilizing the book, as all too often texts do not provide adequate historical contextualization. While some of the material cited is quite dated, there are also some excellent resources that point the reader to further information about each topic. However, despite its encouraging move into underexplored areas of sociology and criminal justice, assassination, the book suffers from four significant flaws.</p>
<p>First, in the opening chapter, the book lays out a typology of assassination. While interesting in its approach, the types contained are neither mutually exclusive nor well defined. Additionally, even though it is established early on in the book, Falk rarely attempts to type any of the assassinations he examines in the body of the text. Further still, the types he develop are only applicable to assassins, not to anarchists or terrorists. This is problematic for the reader because, though there is a clear organization by geographic area and chronologically, there is little ability to link groups of assassinations to the theories presented at the end as explanatory.</p>
<p>Second, the book does not define its terms well. Assassination seems to be anyone of political importance purposefully killed. This stands in contrast to some other works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712446692">Oliver &amp; Marion, 2010</xref>), which tend to examine assassination in narrower contexts. The same criticism extends to terrorism, which has a continuing, extensive discussion of definitional issues in the literature that Falk sums into the statement, “usually, terrorism is defined as an attack on uninvolved civilians for political gain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057567712446692">Falk, 2012</xref>, p. 116). This stands in stark contrast to the detailed conversation about appropriate defining characteristics in works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057567712446692">Schmid (1984</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057567712446692">Sloan (2006</xref>), and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712446692">Hoffman, 2006</xref>, for an extensive discussion of the academic conversation regarding the definition of terrorism).</p>
<p>Third, one of the continuing subtexts of the book is a counterfactual question regarding what might have happened if an individual was not assassinated. Falk considers this early in the introduction and carries it through much of the book. However, because the reader is uncertain of the inclusion criteria for a given assassination, it looks very much as if Falk is sampling on the dependent variable. This is the same mistake as Pape (2006) makes in his widely noted work <italic>Dying to Win</italic>, examining only cases of suicide terrorism. Similarly, the answer to Falk’s counterfactual regarding differences in history is answered not by assassination as a phenomenon but because he chooses only important, historically relevant individuals to include as cases.</p>
<p>Finally, while it should be noted that Falk does attempt to apply sociological theory to the causes of assassination, anarchy, and terrorism (mostly assassination and terrorism), the application is weak because it is contained within a single, closing chapter. The reader gets no sense of how the theory applies in the cases cited earlier in the text and even those cited in the application section provide relatively little sense of the amount or weight of the evidence Falk is considering. This is compounded by the fact that in the body of the book Falk provides little information on assassins in most cases, preferring to focus on the victim in support of his counterfactual examination.</p>
<p>Generally, the text provides an interesting, if shallow, examination of the anarchy and terrorism claimed in the title, but does a better job regarding assassinations. It is important insofar as it examines a little-studied area of the criminal justice world but has some important drawbacks in regard to its methodological approach to the topic. The book is sufficient as a reader for special topics courses or as a source material for a graduate class, but is unlikely to be considered as a primary text. It would be quite interesting if, in the future, Falk decides to extend the depth of the study and examine more closely the connectedness of the phenomena he examines or has a more explicit focus on application of criminological theory.</p>
