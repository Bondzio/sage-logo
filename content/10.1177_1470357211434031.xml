<abstract>
<p>This paper utilizes rhetorical analysis and feminist semiotic methodology to examine an anti-trafficking Public Service Announcement video produced in the United Kingdom and widely distributed online for a global audience. Rhetorical analysis necessitates looking not just at the meanings and possible interpretations of a communicated message, but also at the creators’ intent and the effect of the message through actual – or potential – audience response. All of these sites of meaning and interpretation are examined in this research project, and the author concludes with several guidelines for future anti-trafficking mass media campaigns, as well as suggestions for further research, specifically audience studies.</p>

<p>‘I Am Elena’: Rhetorical analysis as the first step to a ‘best practices’ formula for sex trafficking PSAs</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Through traveling to other people’s ‘worlds’ we discover that there are ‘worlds’ in which those who are the victims of arrogant perception are really subjects, lively beings, resistors, constructors of visions even though in the mainstream construction they are animated only by the arrogant perceiver and are pliable, foldable, file-awayable, classifiable.</p>

<p>Human trafficking is a prominent human rights issue facing the world today, but if anti-trafficking initiatives are any indication, it has been going on for over a century, with one of the first initiatives to stop trafficking ratified in 1904 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434031">Munro, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357211434031">1</xref></sup> According to the United Nations, trafficking is third only to illegal weapons and drugs in the international market, bringing in about 12 billion dollars each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434031">Malarek, 2003</xref>: 4). Some statistics estimate that between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357211434031">Samarasinghe and Burton, 2007</xref>: 52), while other estimates place that number as high as two million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357211434031">Penttinen, 2008</xref>: 42). Certainly no estimate can be exact – and these numbers often vary, depending on what study one is reading – due to the illegal nature of trafficking and the difficulty of monitoring activity. While human trafficking includes individuals trafficked to become domestic workers, general laborers, and hired soldiers/killers, the focus of this paper is on the media’s influence and involvement in sex trafficking. Sex trafficking alone earns traffickers about six billion dollars each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434031">Hughes, 2000</xref>: 36).</p>
<p>The United States government has, since 2001, published an annual <italic>Trafficking in Persons Report</italic> (TIP), which ranks countries around the world into three tiers based on how they are dealing with the issue. According to the 2008 TIP, sex trafficking is ‘a significant portion of overall trafficking and the majority of transnational modern-day slavery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470357211434031">2008</xref>: 23). Sex trafficking is the purchase of people – usually women and girls – to force or coerce them into performing sexual services on sometimes more than 40 ‘customers’ per day. Coercion can take many forms, from physical and psychological abuse and intimidation to threatening the safety of one’s family in their home country. Usually, the trafficked individuals are informed by the people who bought them that they now owe these people a significant debt – not only for the amount spent in purchasing the individual, but also for their airfare, room, and board – which they must now work to pay off. The traffickers tell these women and girls that if they fail to work, or try to run away, they will be found and killed and their families will also be killed.</p>
<p>Many of those who are trafficked in this way are young women who left a hopeless situation, which may include discrimination, inequality, violence, and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434031">Jana et al., 2002</xref>). Their home countries are often in the midst of political upheaval, and they have very few options, so they leave to find a better life working abroad. Reasons for leaving home are multi-layered and very complicated, based on economic, political, and social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">Sharma, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While many nations, including the United States, have signed, ratified, and enacted various legislative anti-trafficking initiatives and protocols, practice often diverges from policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357211434031">Munro, 2006</xref>: 322). For example, the United States’ Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357211434031">Malarek (2003</xref>: 186), seems to be ‘one very tough piece of legislation’, but it has, in practice, ‘turned out to be just another piece of paper’. If legislation is failing to prevent the increase and spread of trafficking, perhaps the persuasive powers of mass media can perform a significant role in this regard.</p>
<p>As the problem of trafficking increases, media involvement in the issue likewise increases, in both positive and negative ways. Newspaper ads for escorts, ‘dates’, strip clubs, and massage parlors – usually relegated to one of three sections: classifieds, ‘adult’, or sports sections – have been directly linked with sex trafficking;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357211434031">2</xref></sup> websites offer ‘sex tours’ for citizens of the US, Canada, the United Kingdom and others to travel abroad to foreign countries and have sex with women – often underage girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434031">DeCurtis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357211434031">Hughes, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, mass media play a significant role in anti-trafficking campaigns, with billboards, TV and Internet Public Service Announcements (PSAs), information campaigns, documentaries and fictionalized films on trafficking. The power of mass media cannot be overstated; various forms of media can reach massive audiences and can publicize issues, inspiring many people to become active in social justice causes. This paper will examine one such PSA created in the United Kingdom, which was aired in Australia and spread virally. I will analyze how this PSA conveys its message regarding sex trafficking through the visual and rhetorical tool of the voice of the ‘other’.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470357211434031">
<title>Anti-Trafficking Campaigns</title>
<p>While the United States passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act in 2000, and has many anti-trafficking non-governmental organizations (NGOs), its anti-trafficking initiatives focus primarily on rescue and rehabilitation rather than on prevention and public awareness. Most anti-trafficking campaigns take the form of professional training directly targeted at those who would most likely encounter trafficked individuals, such as police officers and social workers. Media campaigns in the US are rare, and are often limited to particular states (e.g. Florida’s STOP Project), or are targeted at possible ‘customers’ abroad (e.g. World Vision’s Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, which places billboards in foreign countries and a few US airports).</p>
<p>The United Nations, however, has been involved in various anti-trafficking information campaigns, especially after adopting the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434031">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children in 2000</xref>. The protocol is carried out by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which launched the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) in 2007. While most anti-trafficking campaigns are targeted at source countries (the home countries of trafficked individuals, mostly in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia), UN.GIFT has worked in conjunction with various NGOs and non-profits to create information campaigns – mostly in the form of Internet, cinema, and TV PSAs – to reach a global audience.</p>
<p>PSAs attempt to send a message of social responsibility to a wide audience. This form of advertising sometimes explores the world of ‘the other’ in an attempt to provoke compassion, awareness, and action in the audience. In the case of trafficking, the ‘other’ is the trafficked individual<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357211434031">3</xref></sup> whose ‘world’ is beyond the comprehension of the average person. Several anti-trafficking information campaigns targeted at source countries have been examined in previous studies, but there has been little research into campaigns that target the demand or ‘destination’ countries (most likely due to the fact that there are also very few actual campaigns that target this audience). One campaign that does target destination countries – with a focus on the United Kingdom – features British actress Emma Thompson, in a PSA that promotes awareness of the issue. The focus of this paper will be on this PSA, titled ‘I Am Elena’, created in conjunction with the Helen Bamber Foundation and the Body Shop.</p>
<p>The Helen Bamber Foundation is a non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 2005 to help survivors of human rights violations. The organization has branches for education and the advocacy for human rights, and clinicians who work with survivors, helping them to recover and move forward with their lives. The ‘I Am Elena’ PSA aims not only to increase awareness of the issue for a general audience but also to discourage potential customers from buying sexual services from any prostitute they may suspect is trafficked (and, I would argue, from any prostitute at all). It was created in conjunction with the Journey campaign, which is housed under the Helen Bamber Foundation. Journey aims to build public awareness about the reality of human trafficking. In addition to multiple PSAs, Journey has created a short film about sex trafficking and an art installation depicting the ‘Journey’ women experienced in being trafficked across international borders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357211434031">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The message of a PSA, however, is not as simple as its creators’ intent. Often the message is varied, based on the cultural context of the viewer. Thus in any analysis of this type of advertising, many aspects must be taken into consideration. Rhetorical analysis – the methodology employed in this paper – examines various factors involved in creating and interpreting media texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434031">Kenney and Scott (2003)</xref> outline three distinct aspects that must be considered in the rhetorical analysis of advertisements. First, the situation that led to the ad must be documented; in this case, that situation is sex trafficking. Second, the intent of the ad (intent by its creator) should be examined, in conjunction with a formal analysis of the message/meaning of the ad. Finally, the effect of the ad should be assessed. While I do not perform an audience study here, I will examine possible effects by looking at previous audience studies of ads and similar PSAs, and suggest further research into actual effect.</p>
<p>In carefully deconstructing the ‘I Am Elena’ video to better understand its intent, targeted audience, message, and possible effect, one can begin to understand the power of information campaigns. And, with continued research, media scholars can perhaps ultimately find a formula for PSAs that will have the greatest positive effect – increasing public awareness, social responsibility, and activism. This formula must take into consideration the various production sites (author, funding organization, creative team, editing team, etc.), the site of the image itself (deconstructing the meaning, both semiotically and rhetorically), and finally the site of the audience (how individuals interpret the PSA and its ultimate effectiveness – or lack thereof).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357211434031">5</xref></sup> This paper will closely examine the first two of these sites in relation to ‘I Am Elena,’ and will examine the third site through previous empirical research done on advertising and information-campaign audiences and effects. First, however, it is important to examine studies and analyses of previous anti-trafficking campaigns, as well as the relevant literature on information campaigns and PSAs.</p>

<title>The Dominant Discourse In Anti-Trafficking Campaign Analyses</title>
<p>Previous scholarly work on anti-trafficking campaigns has focused largely on campaigns that target trafficked individuals, specifically in Eastern European countries. The dominant discourse among these analyses critiques the campaigns for promoting a view of trafficked women as ‘victims’, with neither agency nor voice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434031">Nieuwenhuys and Pecoud (2007</xref>: 1684) examine how anti-trafficking campaigns often present women migrants as ‘naive and defenseless victims’, ‘ignorant’, ‘unaware’, and ‘vulnerable’. These campaigns’ primary goal is to discourage emigration, under the assumption that those who leave their home country do not know what inevitably awaits them.</p>
<p>This victimization discourse is closely linked to an anti-migration discourse in which the issue of trafficking is presented in a way that is meant to scare potential emigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357211434031">Davies, 2002</xref>). Such campaigns in essence serve not the interests of trafficked individuals but rather as ‘an arm of border control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">Sharma, 2003</xref>: 55). The message is that women should stay at home rather than seek better employment opportunities abroad. Migration is equated with victimization. This message works to reinforce sex and gender binaries, which place men in the position of migrants and workers and women in the position of domestic caregivers; or men in the position of the criminal traffickers and women in the position of the victimized trafficked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">Andrijasevic, 2007</xref>). Femininity is thus conceptualized as passivity, and trafficked women are seen as victims who need to be rescued.</p>
<p>Key to these arguments is the use of the female body in mass media anti-trafficking images. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">Andrijasevic (2007)</xref> conducts a semiotic analysis of two anti-trafficking billboard and poster campaigns in the Czech Republic and the Baltic states. Her findings are presented in a paper entitled ‘Beautiful Dead Bodies’, in which she examines how these campaigns (re)objectify the female body, portraying (an essentialized construct of) Woman as ‘an eroticized and voyeuristic spectacle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">2007</xref>: 26). Beautiful. And often dead, or doll-like. Depersonalized images – male hands, cages, spiderwebs, hooks, etc. – are used in the campaigns to portray trafficking as ‘an impersonal and capillary system of control over female bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">Andrijasevic, 2007</xref>: 34). Women become dolls or puppets in this system, with no control over their own bodies, and seemingly no voice, no agency, etc. These campaigns again return to the anti-migration discourse, presenting images of victimized female bodies as a warning to potential women migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">Andrijasevic, 2007</xref>: 26). The images examined include posters of young women dressed as sex workers – scantily clad and eroticized bodies – as well as bodies hanging from hooks or strings, as puppets and dolls, meant to scare the intended audience: young women in Eastern European countries who are at risk of being trafficked. Essentially, these campaigns portray not real women but an idealized, objectified Woman. Their message seems to imply empowerment (through information) but the sexualized representation of women takes away from this empowerment and in fact reverses it by maintaining essentialized understandings of gender in sexual economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434031">Nieuwenhuys and Pecoud, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Other anti-trafficking campaign analyses find that images of extreme physical and psychological abuse and sexual exploitation categorize women’s bodies as ‘weak and vulnerable’, seeking ‘masculinist intervention – a rescue by western men, represented in the nation-state, its agencies, or individual “crusaders”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434031">Milivojevic and Pickering, 2008</xref>: 28). Ultimately, the images suggest death, presenting what Andrijasevic considers a Western trope: feminine death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">2007</xref>: 42). Thus the images in the International Organization for Migration (IOM) campaigns that Andrijasevic analyzes work to eroticize and fetishize young female bodies, allowing for a disavowed voyeurism for male viewers while simultaneously scaring the intended audience from leaving the ‘home.’</p>
<p>Another major aspect of the discourse of anti-migration within anti-trafficking campaigns is the criminalization of migrants and the simultaneous romanticization of ‘home’. Specific groups’ mobility are celebrated (tourists, intellectuals, and NGOs), while the mobility of ‘Others’ is seen as harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">Sharma, 2003</xref>: 54). Sharma points to the fact that the UN’s Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children is housed under and enforced by the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime rather than UN groups that deal with human rights, which indicates that the measure is unconcerned with the actual migrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">2003</xref>: 58).</p>
<p>These campaigns tend to equate all sex work with trafficking. Anti-trafficking initiatives are seen as aspects of the ‘21st century abolitionist movement’, rescuing victimized third world women who have been forced into prostitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434031">Milivojevic and Pickering, 2008</xref>: 25). Milivojevic and Pickering argue against the moralist stance on trafficking with its assumptions that trafficked women do not know what’s happening to them or what they really want, which they link to the ‘colonial gaze’ of the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434031">2008</xref>: 38).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434031">Andrijasevic (2007)</xref> also argues against the message that migration will inevitably lead to prostitution. Only when anti-migration discourses are removed from anti-trafficking discourses will it be possible to tackle the international circumstances that limit women’s choices – what feminist scholars point to as the ultimate root of the problem of sex trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434031">Jana et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434031">Milivojevic and Pickering, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434031">Nieuwenhuys and Pecoud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357211434031">Samarasinghe and Burton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">Sharma, 2003</xref>). In essence, the issue that needs to be addressed is the fact that people are migrating from places where resources – economic, social, and political – are scarce, to places where these resources seem to be abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434031">Sharma, 2003</xref>). Instead of criminalizing trafficked and traffickers, instead of increasing migration control, people should be examining and eliminating this inequality of resources.</p>
<p>Some feminist critiques of anti-trafficking campaigns take a pro-sex-work stance, arguing against the conflation of prostitution with trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434031">Jana et al., 2002</xref>). While this conflation is dangerous and often categorical, I feel it is necessary to recognize the relationship between demand for sexual services and increased sex trafficking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470357211434031">6</xref></sup> The feminist debate over prostitution will not be examined here, but the connection between demand and supply certainly demonstrates a link between prostitution – and other forms of sex work, including stripping and massage parlors – and sex trafficking, a link that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Strict anti-trafficking laws equate to strict anti-immigration laws, which leads to a strengthened influence of organized crime (where women turn when they cannot migrate legally) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434031">Jana et al., 2002</xref>). Jana et al. present impossible, idealistic solutions to this problem, including ‘unrestricted movement of labour across international borders . . . universal education and equal access to information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434031">2002</xref>: 71), but I feel that a more realistic solution lies in creating information campaigns that eliminate the discourse of anti-migration and victimization, and address the demand for trafficking rather than the supply. While Jana et al. argue for a sweeping, idealistic call to action that lingers more in theory than realistic praxis, they also present a valuable suggestion for the creation of anti-trafficking programs: involving previously trafficked women in the creative process. They focus largely on rescue and rehabilitation centers, but this suggestion, I would argue, should extend to the creative process and implementation of anti-trafficking campaigns, a suggestion that is played out in the creative process of the ‘I Am Elena’ PSA.</p>
<p>In summary, previous scholarly studies on anti-trafficking mass media campaigns, which have focused on Eastern European campaigns, have isolated several distinct themes: victimization and lack of agency for the trafficked individual; anti-migration messages that enforce binary categorizations of women and men; and objectification of female bodies within the anti- trafficking discourse of these campaigns. These analyses call for future campaigns that target the demand and/or destination countries. I will turn now to an examination of PSAs and information campaigns, in which I will embed my own analysis of the ‘I Am Elena’ PSA, an analysis that will consider the previous analyses examined above while also searching for new, alternative discourses in a campaign that targets demand. This analysis will be followed with an examination of the previous empirical research on audiences of advertising and information campaigns, to suggest possible effects.</p>

<sec id="section3-1470357211434031">
<title>Psas And Information Campaigns</title>
<p>Research on information campaigns and PSAs is extensive and covers many areas, including best strategies/types of campaigns, objectives, effectiveness, and target audience. I will not cover all of these areas, but will instead focus on research that will enhance my own analysis of the ‘I Am Elena’ (IAE) PSA. IAE falls under the classification of a ‘global advertisement,’ which is one that is presented at an international level, targeting multicultural audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434031">Domzal and Kernan, 1993</xref>: 1). Though IAE’s monologue is in English, it is targeted at ‘people around the world’ with the intent to inform them about ‘the issue of trafficking’, according to Elizabeth Super, the Development and Outreach Coordinator of the Helen Bamber Foundation (personal communication, 31 October 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357211434031">7</xref></sup> IAE circulates mostly through viral, online marketing – on YouTube and the Helen Bamber Foundation website – and individual events, though it aired in Australia on major programming, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) (Super, personal communication, 3 November 2008).</p>
<p>Advertising can be categorized in many ways, one of which is information- versus meaning-based. Information-based ads transfer information directly to the consumer, whereas meaning-based ads are those which the audience negotiates, interpreting the signs of the ad to formulate one of various possible meanings. Most ads should be assessed not as either/or but as both/and, taking both the intent of the advertiser and the interpretation of the audience into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434031">Domzal and Kernan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357211434031">Mick, 1992</xref>). IAE can further be labeled as a ‘social marketing’ ad, which uses traditional advertising/marketing techniques to advocate for a social cause, rather than a commercial product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357211434031">Rogers and Storey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434031">Stadler, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The research on PSAs indicates that they cannot, however, be assessed with the same criteria used to assess commercial advertising. The level of ‘liking’ for a commercial ad positively correlates with the level of liking for a brand in commercial advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434031">Dillard and Peck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357211434031">LaTour and Zahra, 1989</xref>). PSAs should be evaluated based on effectiveness or ‘perceived persuasiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434031">Dillard and Peck, 2000</xref>: 468). Commercial ads should produce positive feelings, but PSAs should produce <italic>some</italic> feelings. Thus whether the audience likes IAE or not, the ad will be judged as successful if it persuades them to act: donate to the Helen Bamber Foundation, get more information on sex trafficking, or become involved in the cause to stop trafficking.</p>

<title>Rhetorical And Semiotic Analysis</title>
<p>Eloise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434031">Buker (1996)</xref> draws upon various schools of thought to construct a theory of feminist semiotics, which is ‘a more self-conscious, and hence politically effective, understanding of the power of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434031">1996</xref>: 33). Buker examines how language (and, I would add, images) exercises power, and how readers, by constructing meaning, likewise exercise power (through semiotic interpretation). Just as many analysts of advertising stress the authority of the reader/viewer, feminist semiotics sees a communicated message as ‘a process between speaker and reader’, shifting semiotics ‘to a new site of author(ity)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434031">Buker, 1996</xref>: 37). Buker seems to be describing rhetorical analysis here, which differs from semiotic analysis in that the latter is an interpretation of code, and the former is more flexible, based on an interaction between the communicator and the receiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434031">Kenney and Scott, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>I combine these two approaches here: feminist semiotics and rhetorical analysis, as they are closely linked, and, in fact, I would argue that rhetorical analysis <italic>is</italic> a feminist version of semiotics in its view of meaning as a cycle, a conversation between author and receiver, with cultural context mediating between the two. Rhetoric is the ‘use of symbols to persuade creatures who <italic>by their nature</italic> respond to symbols’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434031">Kenney and Scott, 2003</xref>: 19). Advertising uses symbols to convince the viewer to purchase a product, or, in the case of PSAs, to buy into a social responsibility, to take action on behalf of social justice. Both advertisements and PSAs rely on cultural symbols to get their message across to viewers. Rhetorical analysis includes an examination, at least in theory, of all of the components of the communicative process: ‘author, message, subject, context, and audience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357211434031">Medhurst and Benson, 1984</xref>: x).</p>
<p>Rhetorical analysis is based on an assumption that choices are consciously made in how something is shown, how a message is depicted. One view indicates that all other views (or angles/shots in camerawork) were rejected in favor of this one view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434031">Kenney and Scott, 2003</xref>: 21). The rhetorical analyst then asks <italic>why</italic>. Here I am questioning why IAE was constructed in the way it was to transmit its intended message. What is its message? How can IAE be interpreted, and how might it effect the audience who views it?</p>
<p>My method follows the work of Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434031">Gronbeck (1984)</xref>, who proposed a system of rhetorically analyzing televisual communication through two levels of codes: artistic and social. This is done by breaking the show (or, in this case, the PSA) into segments or scenes. Gronbeck isolates ‘markers’ or ‘symbolic cues’ that signal to viewers the codes or ‘stores of knowledge’ which the viewer should bring to her reading of the message.</p>
<p>The dramatic aspect of IAE – the first 60 seconds, followed by 15 seconds that display the message, ‘Women enslaved by sex trafficking lose more than just their names’, and information about the Helen Bamber Foundation – includes two stories, in a total of 20 scenes, that are told in conjunction. The stories are narrated by English actress Emma Thompson who portrays both characters (Elena and Maria) and tells their stories in the third person. The PSA opens with a quick shot of skin, seemingly moving, and a sharp sound as it cuts to Elena laying on her back, her face turned to one side, facing the camera; she says, ‘Elena didn’t think anyone would hurt her’. Then several quick, brightly-lit scenes of Maria played at high speed show her on her back as well, staring upwards, off camera, silent (the camera is above Maria, but to the side in scenes of Elena). Back to Elena, who is still laying calmly on the bed: ‘Elena trusted everyone’. Maria’s face in a grimace, eyes closed then open, staring off-camera, says, ‘Maria doesn’t trust anyone’. Another quick, high-speed sequence of Maria, then a cut back to Elena. This juxtaposition of the two stories continues throughout the PSA, and contributes to the pressed, fast-paced feeling of the ad, while the cool, distanced, third-person narration contributes to the haunting, emotionally-powerful experience of the PSA.</p>

</fig>
<p>By the end of the 60 seconds, the viewer is aware that Elena and Maria are the same person, the former before she was trafficked, the latter while she is being used for sex. One feels a sense of urgency, suffering, and pain; two stories told in fast-forward, and the final sense that Elena/Maria is ‘here’, waiting to be helped, still alive and still suffering. The last words uttered are from Maria’s lips, in a close-up of her face pressed against the bed as she rocks back and forth: ‘I’m here’. This – and the twice-repeated refrain, ‘help me’ – is the only time that the first person is used, and the words come from a voice-over, not from the lips of the actress. This first person, present tense conclusion leaves the viewer with a final and intense sense of urgency. The message is simple: this is happening <italic>now</italic> and time is running out.</p>
<p>In contrast to the scenes of Elena, Maria’s story is told in <italic>shots</italic>, quick, abrupt, and fast-paced. Some of the scenes are shown in high-speed, suggesting lack of control. This is Elena’s lack of control over her own body; Elena seems to be at the bottom of a dark pit from which she is distantly involved in Maria’s life but from which she no longer exerts any control. Maria’s face and body are brightly lit, exposing wrinkles and imperfect skin, smeared makeup and bruises; Elena’s face is in shadows, under low lighting, her wrinkles and pores invisible.</p>
<p>The images of Maria are spliced with still shots: pale white legs rising from stiletto heels, ankles chained to the leg of a chair; and later: empty chains laying on a dirty, bare wooden floor. Male hands hold Maria down, and her skin is violently squeezed – her shoulder, neck, and face, as well as indiscernible body parts, in varying shots – as she rocks back and forth on the dirty, stained mattress. One shot depicts the pillow into which her face is pressed: soiled, spotted with dark stains, possibly blood; another shot reveals the ripped sheets – also dirty and spotted – she lays on and grasps as an arm clutches her wrist from behind. The tone depicted through this artistic level of meaning is that of seriousness, starkness, almost-hopelessness (we are saved from completely losing hope by the scenes of Elena, knowing she still exists within Maria and that her cries for help suggest she still wishes to live).</p>

<p>The aesthetic or artistic level of codes is expressed through technical aspects of the film: ‘the lengths of scenes and shots, the [lack of] music, the camera work, and the editing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434031">Gronbeck, 1984</xref>: 7) of IAE suggest starkness, bareness, simplicity or lack. There is no music, but rather one long, continuous low note, like the drone of a fluorescent light in an empty hallway. Sounds other than the narration include the sounds of beating (slapping, male grunting, a woman crying out), sex (sighing, heavy breathing), a creaking bed, metal scratching metal (presumably this is the chain against the chair leg depicted in one of the quick still shots that interrupt Maria’s scenes), the movement of Maria’s skin against the sheets, and quick spurts of noise to accompany several of the transitions from Elena to Maria. The most important aesthetic distinction is that between scenes of ‘Elena’ and scenes of ‘Maria’. Elena is lying on her back, presumably on the same bed we later see Maria laying on. But Elena is calm, her face seems tranquil as Thompson narrates the story of her past. She is shot from the side, her head turned to face the camera, whereas Maria is shot from above. Maria, on the other hand, never looks directly at the camera; her voice is distant, monotone, and emotionless. At one point she even says, ‘Maria doesn’t feel <italic>anything</italic> anymore’.</p>
<p>The entire PSA is shot in a grainy black-and-white, a film stock that ‘is used for promoting a sense of gritty reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357211434031">Bulmer and Buchanan-Oliver, 2006</xref>: 55), but the scenes of Elena have a yellow hue, whereas Maria is starkly lit, contrasting the sex she is depicted having with the usual depiction of romantic sex (low lighting, flickering candles, slow movement). Everything about the sexual activity Maria is engaging in is the opposite of ideological/cultural understandings of romance. This is continued and accentuated through the technical aspects of these scenes, and indicates a conscious avoidance of fetishization on the part of the creators.</p>
<p>The aesthetics of IAE lead us to the first level of social meaning, the first (of two) themes I will isolate in IAE to better understand its predominating ideology. The first theme is that of the stark binary set up between the innocent girl and the emotionless prostitute: good girl versus bad girl. Elena looks at the camera; she has hope, even optimism as she tells her story. Maria, on the other hand, looks off camera, as if she cannot focus. She speaks in a monotone. The response from the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434031">‘The Body Shop’, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434031">Franks, 2008</xref>) and from those viewers who have commented in online forums about the PSA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357211434031">Nudd, 2007</xref>) indicate that this theme is very clear for the audience: the dualism of ‘a good girl full of hope’ and ‘a numbed prostitute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434031">‘The Body Shop’, 2007</xref>: para. 1). The separation of these two characterizations draws on the cultural ideology of good girl versus bad girl, the binary system of meaning-making that forces human beings into categories. What does this suggest about the subjectivity of sex workers or prostitutes – those who have not been trafficked? IAE presents two different women, not only metaphorically but through the language of the PSA – both aesthetic and social/cultural – which illustrates a dualism that takes away the humanity of both women. Certainly Elena is more than just the ‘good girl’, the victim. And certainly not all prostitutes or even trafficked women are as emotionless and passive as Maria. Communication is based on shared cultural meanings, and some of those meanings are based on characterizations that rely on stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434031">Gronbeck, 1984</xref>). But in order to understand ‘the other’, we must inhabit the world of the other rather than simply categorizing or arrogantly classifying ‘the other’, as warned by Lugones in the epigraph of this paper. IAE ultimately expresses the depth of character of the trafficked woman it represents by connecting Elena’s story with Maria’s current fate, although this connection is made only at the end. The majority of IAE relies on a binary classification system that separates the good, trafficked ‘victim’ from the emotionless, passive ‘whore’ that she becomes.</p>
<p>By naming her, IAE avoids objectifying Elena/Maria – and in essence, all women trafficked for sex. Objectification is absent from the images of IAE, another significant difference from the Eastern European PSAs examined previously. IAE prevents the disavowal of the erotic – the continued looking while simultaneously disavowing the sexual, erotic nature of the gaze – as examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434031">Hall (1997)</xref>. This disavowal is prevented by personalizing the message and forcing the viewer to face a very real, active sequence of sexual activity. There can be absolutely no question about what is happening to Maria in the sequence: she is having forcible, rough sex, which she is neither responding to nor enjoying. Disavowal is further prevented by the lack of eroticism, not only by the actress portraying Elena/Maria but also by the straightforward, unemotional sex taking place. Emma Thompson’s distance from the beauty ideal distances the sex on screen from the erotic. This PSA depicts the harsh reality of trafficking; it can in no way be interpreted as sexy.</p>
<p>Because of Maria’s reality, Elena has withdrawn into an alternate world in order to survive trauma. And yet this suggestion of withdrawal introduces another strong theme that runs through IAE, one that was also isolated in analyses of Eastern European anti-trafficking campaigns: the theme of victimhood and victimization. Maria is clearly an unresisting victim, passively submitting to rough sex, passively describing her past as Elena and her present as Maria. She is calling out to the viewer with the refrain – repeated twice – ‘help me’. This victimization, however, is not constituted fully in the main character/narrator, as only her role as Maria is passive and without agency. Elena, however, tells us the story of her past, when she had hopes and dreams, and her continued survival as Maria suggests that hope still remains and that she is much more than an essentialized construct, the ‘victim.’ Here the responsibility is shifted to the viewer, who is to be Elena’s ‘rescuer’. While the Maria character in IAE symbolically constructs woman as passive, one who does not act but rather inspires others’ (usually men’s) actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434031">Buker, 1996</xref>: 43), Elena is acting out by seeking help, by imploring viewers – men and women alike – to act, albeit in the form of the rescuer saving the victim.</p>
<p>Emma Thompson is naked (or seems to be) in the PSA, visibly unclothed from the upper chest and above, but most shots are close-ups of her face. As noted above, she is not presented as a sexualized woman, and her imperfections are clear and visible. She wears little makeup, with one shot depicting her (as Maria) with lipstick smeared above her lip. This is a stark image of a ‘real woman’, not the glamorized or sexualized image of a young actress or model (and a far cry from some of the objectified images of young women used in the Eastern European campaigns). Thompson speaks in the third person, telling Elena’s and Maria’s story while it is acted out on her own body, suggesting one of the major goals Thompson has expressed in her work with the Helen Bamber Foundation: that of empathy rather than pity, action rather than guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357211434031">Bunting, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At this point in the analysis, it is appropriate to consider the author’s intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434031">Burke (1945/1969)</xref> isolates five questions that should be examined in any attempt to understand motive: ‘what was done (act), when or where it was done (scene), who did it (agent), how he did it (agency), and why (purpose)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434031">1945/1969</xref>: xv). The act is the PSA, which was Thompson’s baby, created in collaboration with the Helen Bamber Foundation, The Body Shop, and the film production company Quiet Storm. The act and the agent are particularly relevant to the rhetorical impact of this PSA. The very presence of such a well-known, established actress as the representative for trafficked women may considerably impact the viral movement of the ad and viewers’ perception of the significance of the issue of trafficking (i.e. if Emma Thompson is representing this cause, maybe it’s something others should look into). Thus the use of celebrity is an aspect that may weigh into the PSA’s rhetorical effectiveness.</p>
<p>The scene is personal to Thompson: it was shot at Thompson’s home in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434031">‘The Body Shop’, 2007</xref>). The why is answered through media reports on the PSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434031">‘The Body Shop’, 2007</xref>: para. 4), my personal communication with the Helen Bamber Foundation, and the rationale given on the Helen Bamber Foundation website: to promote awareness of sex trafficking, and to inspire people to sign the Petition to Ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against the Trafficking in Human Beings.</p>
<p>Thompson is attempting to give voice to ‘the outsider’, to allow viewers to empathize with this outsider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357211434031">Bunting, 2007</xref>), naming her rather than simply calling her a ‘victim of trafficking’. Though it is only in the final few seconds that Thompson speaks in the first person, truly taking on the persona of Elena/Maria, her habitation of the body of a trafficked woman is clear through the dramatic depiction of Maria’s story. In the final scenes of IAE, Elena is shown, in the same still position, in the shadows, laying on her back as she stares out at the viewer from her left side. ‘I <italic>was</italic> Elena’, she says. The image cuts back to the fast-paced, grainy depiction of Maria, who then says, ‘I <italic>am</italic> Maria’.</p>
<p>Both themes – binary classifications of ‘the other’ (trafficked innocent and emotionless prostitute) and victimization/passivity of trafficked individuals – should be critiqued by the feminist scholar, and I hope my reading indicates that critique. But both themes can also be seen as necessary to present the intended message. Audiences make sense of communicated messages based on their experience and knowledge, the ‘shared stocks of knowledge – knowledges of things, of cultureways, of signs and their related signifieds – which can be called up symbolically or iconically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434031">Gronbeck, 1984</xref>: 10). Thus the binary characterizations and the message of passive victim (who needs to be rescued, presumably by the viewer) may work to impart the message this PSA is attempting to shout at the viewer: essentially, ‘help me!’ And this is the reason why rhetorical analysis (as opposed to semiotic) works better in examining a PSA. Rhetorical analysis considers the author’s intent, as well as the message presented, the culture to which it is presented, and the audience who must interpret it in various contexts. Thus one cannot simply critique and classify the themes of IAE. Rather, one must turn to the audience and the effectiveness of the message. Here an audience study would be ideal, but is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, I will briefly look at previous audience studies about PSAs, and then call for further research into this particular PSA and other anti-trafficking mass media campaigns that target destination countries.</p>

<title>Effect</title>
<p>It is interesting that IAE was produced in the United Kingdom, where shock appeal in advertising is used so often that it has its own name, ‘yobbo advertising’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434031">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>: 268). Shock ads are deliberately offensive, and the arousal of negative emotions, especially guilt, has been shown to increase the effectiveness of PSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434031">Dillard and Peck, 2000</xref>). Shock advertising has been shown to increase attention, benefit memory, and positively influence the behavior of the audience, though these results are more likely when ads are specifically targeted at populations that will be more open to the message, and the youth market is usually the most open to shock appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434031">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>: 277). The distribution of IAE, and the overall intentions of the Helen Bamber Foundation indicate that the target audience is broad and far-reaching, which may limit the effects of shock appeal, though audience and media responses point to a consensus: this ad is shocking, ‘produc[ing] a feeling of suffocation and unease’, even ‘terror and outright bile-rising forcefulness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434031">Franks, 2008</xref>, paras 15, 24). <italic>Esquire</italic> magazine named IAE among the top five ‘most disturbing public service announcements of all time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357211434031">Murphy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Shocking advertisements may bring about a significant intended result in campaign strategies: conversation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357211434031">Rogers and Storey (1987)</xref> consider the role of ‘interpersonal channels’ triggered by media campaigns to be integral to the success of these campaigns. A communication campaign cannot generate effects all by itself as it functions within a complicated matrix of social, economic, and political forces. Since IAE is circulated mostly online, through viral marketing and word-of-mouth (or word-of-mouse, if you will), conversation is integral to spreading its message. And its shock appeal is certainly a source of this activation of interpersonal channels of communication. The greatest danger in shock appeal, however, is severity: a message with severe intensity has limited powers of persuasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434031">Shanahan and Hopkins, 2007</xref>). Another danger of shock appeal is audience focus on the ad and not on the message or the organization behind the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434031">Stadler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357211434031">Tinic, 1997</xref>). This is certainly a risk with IAE, where its shock appeal alone may be a major reason for its 150,000 views on YouTube; Internet-users may spread the ad simply to shock others, not to spread its anti-trafficking message.</p>
<p>That message may also be decontextualized, not only because of the shock-appeal and the risk of audiences focusing more on the ad than on the message, but also because IAE does not explicitly <italic>state</italic> the message. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357211434031">Tinic (1997)</xref>, PSAs are usually advocacy messages, which should present a problem, give possible solutions, and encourage the public to act. IAE presents a problem, but does not place it in context, nor does it describe a solution; it only encourages contribution to the Helen Bamber Foundation by flashing its website and name on the screen at the end. In essence, IAE throws something at the audience with the intent to hit and stun them, hoping that they will stare at the screen, dumbfounded, and then take down the information at the end to find out more.</p>

<title>Suggestions For Further Research</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434031">Nieuwenhuys and Pecoud (2007</xref>) critique the lack of existing research on the success of anti-trafficking campaigns, research that would necessarily include audience studies. Previous research on the shock appeal of PSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434031">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>) and their affective and persuasive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434031">Dillard and Peck, 2000</xref>) has been done. An examination of the effect of IAE’s shock appeal – beyond media response and into specific audience responses, testing various demographics – would significantly add to the current research project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434031">Stadler (2004)</xref> suggests that academic research can be a valuable tool in creating effective PSAs. An ad such as IAE, which provokes extreme emotional response and shock from the viewer, should include careful research. As the studies above demonstrate, emotions often have unpredictable and unintended effects,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470357211434031">8</xref></sup> and such emotions should be connected to information and solutions clearly presented in the ad rather than elicited simply to increase the likeability or memorability of the ad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434031">Stadler, 2004</xref>: 606).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434031">Stadler (2004)</xref> further suggests that researchers should screen ads with the original program rather than in artificial conditions, a suggestion that would increase the applicability of results to understanding the effectiveness of PSAs. Ultimately, in order to determine the most effective way to combat sex trafficking using the mass media as a tool, the anti-trafficking community must examine what has been done, what has worked, and why. In this way, the most effective strategic media campaigns can be designed and implemented, and the media can become a stronger tool in the fight against sex trafficking.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In their elaboration of rhetorical analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434031">Kenney and Scott (2003</xref>: 23) state that ‘the effectiveness of any appeal would depend <italic>entirely</italic> on the confluence of speaker, audience, product, and history’, pointing to the many aspects inherent in a rhetorical analysis of a communication message. In this paper, I have attempted to examine all of these aspects in the PSA ‘I Am Elena’. Where semiotic analysis relies on one interpretation of a text, often a privileged interpretation (undertaken by an academic who brings a different ‘store of knowledge’ to the text than the casual viewer would bring), rhetorical analysis acknowledges that the researcher’s interpretation can be enhanced by considering the other facets of the message: author’s intention, cause or situation that brings about the message, interpretation, and ultimate effect. Rhetoric is about persuasion, and rhetorical analysis asks: what does this message persuade the viewer to do, feel, or think? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434031">Burke (1945/1969)</xref> states the process inherent in tragedy is an agent’s action provoking an audience’s passion, ‘and from the sufferance of the passion there arises an understanding of the act, an understanding that transcends the act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434031">1945/1969</xref>: 38). Exposing the tragedy of sex trafficking is the intent of ‘I Am Elena’, and the intended effect is the (com)passion of viewers, the incentive to action. Dissecting the meaning of this PSA is only the first step in understanding its function and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Based on my findings in this research project – looking at previous research into PSAs and global advertising, as well as research on their effects, then analyzing IAE in light of these previous studies and with a rhetorical methodology that considers various aspects of the communicated message – I feel I can begin to construct some guidelines for a ‘best practices’ strategy for anti-trafficking campaigns. First, it is important to involve women who have survived sex trafficking in the creative process of the campaign. Secondly, fetishization, objectification, and eroticism should be avoided through careful selection of actors, models, narrators, or voice-overs and through aesthetic considerations in constructing the images and narrative. Possible solutions to the problem presented and suggestions for audience action should be made explicit in the campaign – and this can be done creatively. And finally, discourses of victimization and othering should be avoided; people should be recognized – no matter what their situation – as active agents with depth of character. Either/or understandings do not account for human depth and complicated situations in the world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that ‘I Am Elena’ is a step in the right direction. While still relying on the ‘passive victim of trafficking’ discourse, it gives some depth and agency to trafficked individuals, and neither objectifies these women nor allows for a disavowal of the sexual and violent nature of sex trafficking. Its message is only implied but is delivered so forcefully that it cannot be ignored. Certainly, this PSA will be a significant consideration in determining ‘best practices’ for creating effective anti-trafficking campaigns targeted at destination countries.</p>

<p>There is no simple definition of human trafficking. Perhaps the most comprehensive definition is that expressed in the UN <italic>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</italic>. According to this Protocol, trafficking is:</p>

<p>Throughout this paper, I avoid using the phrases ‘victim of trafficking’ or ‘trafficked victim’ and instead refer to ‘trafficked individuals’ or ‘trafficked women’ (a gender distinction made due to the focus here on sex trafficking, which is the movement across international borders predominantly of women and girls) to prevent categorizing these women as passive victims without agency.</p>

<p>John Miller, Condoleezza Rice's advisor on human trafficking, stated, ‘All the research and evidence available shows that when you have large flows of women for sexual purposes, there is going to be trafficking. There is a link between prostitution and sex trafficking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357211434031">‘US Worried’, 2006</xref>: para. 5). Certainly, where there is demand, a supply will be made, and while we must avoid creating a ‘moral panic’ surrounding migrating women and sex trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434031">Milivojevic and Pickering, 2008</xref>), we cannot ignore the link.</p>

<p>The use of English, however, may indicate that this ad is more effective in destination countries or targeted at those who pay for sex in these countries – the ‘johns’ in the sex industry.</p>
