<p>When teaching an ensemble, wouldn’t it be great to be able to</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112439669" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>show students the entire score so each player could understand how his or her part fits in with the rest of the instruments?</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Now we can! By using a Smart Board or other “smart” technologies, it has become possible to teach interactively with our students. I have been able to use my Smart Board, along with Smart Music, to have students see on-screen all types of method book examples and write out the beats to help their fellow band members count out challenging passages. Now, I can share examples of excellent performances by world-class ensembles to amplify my teaching.</p>

<title>A Tool to Focus Attention</title>
<p>One of the hardest concepts for middle schoolers to understand is key signatures. The Smart Board has changed the way I reinforce key signatures with all my students, beginners to eighth graders. When I first introduce an example, I have one student come up to the board and highlight the key signature at the beginning of the excerpt. Another student will then highlight in the first few measures the notes that the key signature affects. We can then practice the example while focusing on the highlighted notes, thus reaching a better comprehension of what a key signature is. With a simple touch of the screen, all our highlights disappear, and students then must remember the key signature as they play through the example again. For the next step, I have the student play the example while watching the cursor on the Smart Board.</p>
<p>Another useful component of this technology is the capacity of notebook software to take a “snapshot” of music examples found in Smart Music. This snapshot can then be used in the notebook software to show students their particular rhythms on the board and compare their parts to those of others.</p>
<p>Scanning material into the notebook software on Smart Board presents no problem. It’s easy to scan scores, theory sheets, exercises, and notation about lip slurs or trills. I use all these extras to better teach my ensembles and to help students with specific challenges.</p>
<p>Any page used to introduce music with the Smart Board can be printed out for students to keep in their folders or to take home. These reference pages can also be stored in case a student’s copy is misplaced.</p>
<p>I want my students to understand not only the parts they play but also see how these parts fit into the larger ensemble as a whole. Many students can do this just by listening to each other’s parts, but some students, especially visual learners, benefit from seeing the music.</p>

<title>Learning by Sight</title>
<p>Before the invention of the Smart Board, if I wanted students to see a physical representation of a piece of music, I would have to borrow a projector from one of my colleagues, transfer the score onto transparencies, and then try to color-code or circle the individual parts. As my band room was set up, this meant moving my low brass section into the trumpet section just so I could use a projector.</p>
<p>Now I can to easily scan my music into the notebook software. Once I scan it in, I can use the highlighter tool or the pen tools to show students how their parts and rhythms fit with the others. Students can finally see, hear, and understand, for example, how a pickup note in the flutes and clarinets affects the rest of the group. If one instrument group has moving eighth notes, students can visually absorb how the eighth notes look and how they stand out as more important than the half or whole notes. After seeing the score and the parts, students are more aware of what to listen for in other sections.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each weekday morning, I can easily plan my sixth-period class and save it in the notebook software. I teach through the first four periods in my band room, then a colleague uses the room during the fifth period, and I still have my preparation for the sixth-period class done. Before we had a Smart Board, my colleague and I would have to work out which parts of the whiteboard we could each use to put our agendas for the day, warm-up rhythms, and announcements. Now, during the two minutes between the time that my colleague’s band class leaves and my class enters, I can easily pull up my class’s agenda and any rhythm exercises we are working on. In addition, I can use rhythms on multiple days without having to rewrite them on the whiteboard, which is cleaned and erased daily.</p>
<p>I use the notebook software to handwrite rhythms on the board. I can put up two or three of the rhythmic figures that occur during a piece we are playing. For example, we are currently working on “Primordium” by Mark Williams. There are triple rhythms against eighth-note rhythms against a low brass bass line. Before I even have the students pull out their music, I write the rhythms without notation on the board, and we use it in our warm-ups. Students can go up to the board and write the counting in. Once we use this for one particular day, I can save our work and open it back up the next time the class meets, allowing the group to continue where we left off.</p>
<p>When teaching fifth-grade band, I use theory sheets. As we discuss the material on these sheets, it is sometimes challenging to explain a given concept to students. I can now scan into the Smart Board all the theory sheets. I can have students go up and write in answers and draw clef signs, notes, and rhythms.</p>

<title>Technology across the Board</title>
<p>The Smart Board has endless possibilities. It is important that we as music educators stay interested and involved in all technology available to us. It is equally important for us to advocate that the technology in our classrooms is just as important as that in any other classroom throughout the school.</p>
<p>Check out some of this technology with an open mind to making your ensemble teaching more effective and interesting.</p>
