<p>PEComas are mesenchymal neoplasms composed of perivascular epithelioid cells (PEC) and include a spectrum of tumors. PEComas and malignant melanoma share common morphological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features, such as epithelioid cell morphology and melanocytic immunophenotype. Melanocytic markers commonly expressed in PEC tumors include HMB-45, Melan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), and occasionally, S100. Given this morphological and immunophenotypical overlap, the differential diagnosis between a PEComa and malignant melanoma can represent a challenge. Additional diagnostic difficulty is the differentiation of melanoma and PEComa from clear cell sarcoma that is indistinguishable from melanoma based on the immunohistochemical profile. Recent studies have shown that MUM-1, a known lymphocyte marker shows positive immunostaining in nevi and melanomas, its expression in PEComas and clear cell sarcoma, however, has not been previously addressed. In this study, the authors analyzed MUM-1 expression using immunohistochemistry in PEComas (n = 8), the PEComa family members, angiomyolipomas (n = 13), and clear cell sarcomas (n = 11) and compared the staining pattern with malignant melanomas (n = 25), both primary (n = 14) and metastatic (n = 11). It was found that 92.3% of primary melanomas and 81.3% of metastatic melanomas were MUM-1 positive. In contrast, MUM-1 was only weakly positive in only 25% of PEComas and negative in all angiomyolipomas. MUM-1 expression was noted in 72.7% of clear cell sarcomas. The study demonstrated differential MUM-1 expression between PEComas and other true melanocytic tumors and suggested that the addition of MUM-1 to the usual panel of melanocyte markers could be a helpful adjunctive study to aid in the differential diagnosis between these entities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PEComas are a group of mesenchymal neoplasms composed of perivascular epithelioid cells (PECs) with distinct morphological and immunophenotypical features. PEC tumors classically include a spectrum of entities, such as angiomyolipoma (AML), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and clear cell sugar tumors (CCST) of the lung. The PEComa family has more recently been expanded to include additional rare entities, such as clear cell myelomelanocytic tumor of the falciform ligament/ligamentum teres, abdominopelvic sarcoma of perivascular epithelioid cells and primary extrapulmonary clear cell sugar tumor (for review see Armah and Parwani<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911418204">1</xref></sup> and Martignoni et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418204">2</xref></sup>). They most commonly arise in middle-aged patients and preferentially affect female patients (female to male ratio: 7:1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref></sup> A strong association exists between tuberous sclerosis and AML, LAM, and less commonly, CCST. PEComas can arise at diverse anatomic locations, including a variety of visceral organs (gastrointestinal, uterine), retroperitoneal, abdominal sites and soft tissue location (for review see Hornick and Fletcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418204">4</xref></sup>). In addition, increasing numbers of reports in the literature describe the existence of cutaneous PEComas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418204">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418204">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Histologically, PEComas are composed of epithelioid or, rarely, spindle-shaped cells arranged in nests and sheets with perivascular accentuation. PECs are a distinctive cell type characteristic of PEComas with epithelioid features, clear or granular cytoplasm, round to oval central nucleus and prominent nucleolus. In addition to the classic epithelioid appearance described, PECs can occasionally display spindled morphology. Multinucleated giant cells can be present and the vascular component is most often composed of thin capillaries. Immunohistochemically, PECs are often positive for both smooth muscle and melanocyte markers. Immunophenotypic reactivity for most melanocytic markers has been reported, including HMB-45, Melan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), and occasionally, S100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911418204">7</xref></sup> In addition to the unusual melanocytic phenotype, PEComas have also been reported to possess premelanosomes. Given this morphological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical overlap, the differential diagnosis between PEComas and malignant melanoma can represent a diagnostic challenge and can lead to misdiagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911418204">8</xref></sup> Another entity that should be included in the differential diagnosis is clear cell sarcoma of the soft tissue, formerly called melanoma of soft parts, which often can be difficult to distinguish from melanoma based on histological and immunophenotypical characteristics. Differentiation however is critical as, aside from rare reports of malignant PEComas, most PEC tumors follow a clinically benign course in contrast to the unpredictable course of malignant melanoma and poor prognosis characteristic of clear cell sarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911418204">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, MUM-1, a B-cell proliferation marker has been reported to be expressed in nevi and melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418204">9</xref></sup> In a large study, Natkunam et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418204">9</xref></sup> analyzed MUM-1 expression in 1335 human malignancies and normal tissues using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry and found MUM-1 expression in a variety of hematolymphoid malignancies and malignant melanoma but not other human neoplasms studied. Although, MUM-1 has recently been reported to be positive in few clear cell sarcomas, MUM-1 expression has not been well studied in other tumors expressing melanocytic markers such as PEComa and clear cell sarcomas. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of MUM-1 among melanoma, AML, PEComa, and clear cell sarcoma.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective study with samples obtained from the records of the 2 participating institutes and from the personal collection of 2 of the authors (PJZ and JSB). A total of 57 biopsies and excisional resection cases were retrieved and grouped according to the original diagnosis rendered into 5 categories. The distribution of the cases into the established categories was as follows: primary melanomas (n = 14, 24.6% of total), metastatic melanomas (n = 11, 19.3% of total), PEComas (n = 8, 14.0% of total), angiomyolipomas (n = 13, 22.8% of total), and clear cell sarcomas (n = 11, 19.3% of total). Primary melanomas analyzed in this study included lentigo maligna melanoma (n = 3), superficial spreading melanoma (n = 10), and one nodular melanoma (n = 1). In the selection of metastatic melanomas, only cases that did not require decalcification prior to submission to histology were taken into consideration, avoiding potential interference with the antigen expression.</p>
<p>A hematoxylin and eosinâstained section was obtained in each of the cases to corroborate the initial diagnosis and to confirm the presence of tumor cells in the chosen blocks. For immunohistochemical analysis, 5-Âµm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were obtained. The sections were dried at 70Â°C for a period of 60 to 90 minutes. The Visionâs Bond-maX instrument (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) was used with on-board automated deparafinization and heat induced antigen retrieval in EDTA for 20 minutes. MUM1P clone (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used (1:100 dilution using Leica diluent) as primary antibody for 15 minutes of incubation followed by Vision Plus (Leica) for secondary detection, a standard methodology on the Bond-maX instrument.</p>
<p>On review of the slides, a numerical value for the staining intensity and extent was rendered according to a scale system from 0 to 3, in which 0 corresponded to no visible staining, 1 to equivocal staining (weak), 2 to unequivocal staining (moderate), and 3 to strong staining. The extent of tumor cell staining with each of the aforementioned intensities was recorded as percentage for each individual specimen by grouping the percentage of positive cells with the appropriate intensity into intervals of 10%. With this information, a total score was given to each case, calculated by multiplying the percentage of tumor cells with staining by the intensity of this staining. If more than one degree of staining intensity was observed in a particular case, a score for each of the distinct areas was calculated and a total score was rendered by adding the scores of the individual areas. A maximal score of 300 could be obtained by each case using this method, corresponding to a case that showed 3+ staining in 100% of the cells.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Ï<sup>2</sup> and <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>MUM-1 immunohistochemical staining using appropriate negative controls was performed as described in the materials and methods. The presence or absence of MUM-1 expression and the staining intensity was assessed as described above.</p>
<p>Our results show that as previously described, most melanomas showed diffuse MUM-1 immunostaining.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> We noted strong immunostaining in 13 out of 14 cases of primary melanomas in at least 90% of the tumor cells (92.3%) with an average score of 270 (range 66-300). Representative MUM-1 immunostaining in primary melanoma is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">1B</xref>. The one primary melanoma case that showed weak MUM-1 expression, displayed 2+ MUM-1 staining intensity in 33% of the tumor cells. Interestingly, in nodular melanoma, relatively diminished staining was noted by tumor cells in the deeper dermis when compared with epidermal and superficial dermal atypical melanocytes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">1D</xref>).</p>

<p>MUM-1 immunoreactivity pattern was also analyzed in eleven cases of metastatic melanoma. Representative hematoxylin and eosin and MUM-1 immunostaining pattern in 2 metastatic melanomas is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418204">1H</xref>. Positive MUM-1 staining was noted in 9 out of the 11 metastatic melanoma cases analyzed (81.8%). The 2 MUM-1 negative metastatic melanomas had only minute fragments of tissue with a very small amount of tumor to evaluate. However, the average score of 114 (range 0-270) was notably lower than that in primary melanomas. Statistical analysis showed this difference to be significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005).</p>
<p>In strong contrast to strong and diffuse immunoreactivity characteristic of primary melanomas, MUM-1 staining was completely absent in all of the13 angiomyolipoma cases that were included in this study (0% positivity). A similar MUM-1 negative staining pattern was evident in the majority of the PEComa cases as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911418204">Figures 2A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911418204">2D</xref>. Diminished MUM-1 expression was detected in 2 of the 8 cases (25%), one of which showed 2+ staining by only 25% of the tumor cells and the other displayed 1+ MUM-1 positivity in 5% of the tumor cells (range 0-50; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911418204">Figures 2E</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911418204">2H</xref>). The difference in percent MUM-1 + tumor cells between primary melanomas and angiomyolipomas or PEComas was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005 in both cases).</p>

<p>Analysis of MUM-1 expression in clear cell sarcomas showed a staining pattern that was reminiscent to that seen in metastatic melanoma in that MUM-1 positive staining was noted in 8 out of the 11 cases evaluated (72.7%).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PEComas are mesenchymal tumors composed of distinctive perivascular epithelioid cells (PECs) that characteristically co-express myoid and melanocytic markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418204">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418204">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911418204">11</xref></sup> Given the melanocytic phenotype, immunostaining with nearly all melanocyte markers and the ultrastructural features showing the presence of premelanosomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418204">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911418204">11</xref></sup> under certain circumstances, the differential between a PEComa or entities within the PEComa family and malignant melanoma could represent a diagnostic challenge. Such scenario includes the differentiation between a visceral or soft tissue PEComa and metastatic melanoma or a cutaneous PEComa versus a primary melanoma. Differentiation between these entities requires correlation of the clinical, histological, and immunophenotypical findings. Clinical information, such as personal or family history of melanoma in the setting of a cutaneous neoplasm would certainly favor a primary melanoma over a PEComa. Conversely, the presence of a visceral lesion in the absence of a known primary melanoma lesion, PEComa would be considered when one encounters an epithelioid tumor with melanocytic differentiation.</p>
<p>Histologically, epithelioid morphology and the presence of nucleoli can be a feature of both entities, but the presence of perivascular accentuation of neoplastic cells with proximity to vascular structures can be a helpful diagnostic clue suggesting PEComa. However, neither the clinical nor the histological features are sufficient to render a diagnosis with certainty and immunostains are a helpful adjunctive in approaching a more definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>PEC tumors typically show immunoreactivity for both melanocytic and smooth muscle markers. Of the myogenic markers, positive staining for smooth muscle actin is seen in 80% of the cases. Whereas positive staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) is not a feature of melanoma, immunoreactivity to SMA has been reported in desmoplastic melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911418204">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911418204">13</xref></sup> Desmin is less commonly detected; its immunoreactivity has been reported in 36% of PEComa cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>PEComas display immunoreactivity for most melanocytic markers, such as: HMB-45, Melan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, and MITF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911418204">7</xref></sup> In a large study of 26 PEComas, Folpe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref></sup> showed that HMB-45 was the most sensitive melanocyte marker as it was detected in 92% of the PEC tumors studied. This was followed by Melan-A, which was expressed in 72% of the cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref></sup> S100 has been suggested to be a useful marker in the differential as it is expressed in melanomas and absent in PEComas. Surprisingly, however, S100 expression was found in up to 33% of PEComas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418204">3</xref></sup> suggesting that, although detection of S100 in such a neoplasm would favor melanoma, its expression does not rule out the possibility of a PEComa. In addition, although rare, S100 negative melanomas have been described.</p>
<p>Whereas an immunophenotype showing positive melanocyte marker staining yet absent S100 and positive SMA expression, in the appropriate setting, might be suggestive of a PEComa, it is important to remember that a subset of PEComas are SMA negative or S100 positive, therefore none of these stains are sensitive or specific enough to reliably differentiate PEComas from malignant melanomas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896911418204">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that MUM-1/IRF4 (multiple myeloma-1/interferon regulatory factor-4), a lymphocyte-specific member of the interferon regulatory family of transcription factors is expressed in normal melanocytes, benign melanocytic lesions, and malignant melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418204">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911418204">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> In lymphoid tissue, MUM-1 expression identifies the transition from germinal center B cells to plasma cells and reflects a postâgerminal center phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911418204">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896911418204">17</xref></sup> Although the function of MUM-1 in plasma cells has been well appreciated, it is unclear thus far what role this protein plays, if any, in benign melanocytes, nevi, or in the development of malignant melanoma. MUM-1 mRNA has been demonstrated in normal melanocytes and its expression has been reported in nevi, variably reported to be present in 75% or in 50% of benign melanocytic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911418204">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911418204">18</xref></sup> In melanoma, Sundram et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> reported MUM-1 expression in up to 95% of primary and 86% of metastatic melanomas.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors report that MUM-1 is a more sensitive melanocytic marker than both HMB-45 and Melan-A, that were positive in 78% and 75% of the melanoma cases, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> However, another study showed that MUM-1 expression is lower in metastatic melanoma (7%) than primary melanoma (70%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911418204">18</xref></sup> Interestingly, in the study by Alonso et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911418204">18</xref></sup> a progressive loss in MUM-1 expression was noted with advanced melanoma stage. In this study, the authors observed MUM-1 immunostaining in 85% of the radial growth phase and in 55% of the vertical growth phase melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911418204">18</xref></sup> However, MUM-1 does not appear to stain spindle cell and desmoplastic melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, MUM-1 immunostaining was seen in 92.5% of primary melanomas and 81.8% of the metastatic melanomas, a finding very similar to that of Sundram et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> Moreover, our findings are notable for much weaker MUM-1 staining observed in metastatic melanoma as compared to diffuse and strong staining noted in primary melanomas. Interestingly, this metastatic melanoma MUM-1 staining profile is somewhat reminiscent to that we observed in clear cell sarcoma, an entity that shares the same immunohistochemical profile with melanoma (HMB-45+, S100+), where MUM-1 positivity was noted in 72.7% of the cases. Only one previous article analyzed MUM-1 staining in 2 clear cell sarcoma cases and reported strong and diffuse MUM-1 immunoreactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418204">15</xref></sup> These findings are of particular interest given the already well appreciated overlapping features between melanoma and clear cell sarcoma, including morphology, melanocytic immunophenotype, and the frequent presence of melanin. Even though a lower level of MUM-1 seems to favor a clear cell sarcoma over melanoma, in practice, because its relatively high frequency of expression, it is unlikely to be very useful in differentiating clear cell sarcoma from metastatic melanoma.</p>
<p>In contrast to MUM-1 expression in most melanomas and clear cell sarcomas, weak immunostaining was detected in only 25% of the PEComas (2 out of 8) studied and was completely absent in all of the 13 angiomyolipomas that were analyzed in this study. As significant phenotypic overlap with conventional melanocytic markers can be seen in PEComas and malignant melanomas, our results suggest that addition of MUM-1 to the workup might have potential value in doubtful cases, when morphology and melanocyte/myogenic markers are not sufficient to reach a diagnosis.</p>
<p>This difference in MUM-1 immunostaining between PEComas/PEComa family members and melanomas was significant, and most important, it suggests that MUM-1 has better sensitivity/specificity than S100 in the distinction between these entities as S100 staining was reported in 33% of PEComas. Thus, in the context of a differential diagnostic dilemma, addition of MUM-1 to the commonly used melanocyte marker panel is reasonable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896911418204">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The functional significance of MUM-1 expression in melanocytic lesions and melanoma is unclear as it is its rare and weak expression or absence in PEComa.</p>
<p>PEComas do not have a known normal counterpart and their histogenesis is currently unclear. Three hypotheses exist with the most likely being that they derive from undifferentiated cells of the neural crest with smooth muscle and melanocytic phenotype. Others speculate that PEComas have a myoblastic, smooth muscle origin with a molecular alteration that results in expression of melanocytic markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896911418204">19</xref></sup> or they may have a pericytic origin. Our findings suggest that the melanocytic differentiation in the PEComa family is somewhat different from true melanocytic tumors and may bear some implication in the elucidation of histogenesis of nonmelanocyte histogenesis in these tumors.</p>
<p>In conclusion, MUM-1 is differentially expressed in primary melanoma, metastatic melanoma, clear cell sarcoma, AML, and PEComa. The observations of significantly diminished or absent MUM-1 expression in PEComa and angiomyolipoma, respectively, in contrast to tumors with true melanocytic differentiation such as melanoma and clear cell sarcoma are novel. Similar to some previous studies, we also show diminished MUM-1 expression in metastatic melanoma when compared with primary melanoma. In addition, we first evaluated MUM-1 expression in larger series of clear cell sarcoma and show relatively frequent but lower level expression when compared with melanoma. The biologic significance of this differential MUM-1 expression between primary and metastatic melanoma is unknown. The lack or low level of MUM-1 expression in tumors of PEComa family might be related to unique histiogenesis of these tumors different from that of true melanocytic tumors. More important, MUM-1 appears to be a more sensitive/specific marker than S100, HMB45, and Melan-A in the differential diagnosis of these entities and may be a helpful additional study in the setting of differential diagnostic dilemma. The utility of this marker, however, in differentiating clear cell sarcoma from metastatic melanoma is limited.</p>
