<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common health problem and has several negative effects on the quality of life, along with high treatment costs. Although its etiopathology is still a disputed topic, CRS is defined as a prolonged inflammatory process, which may be triggered by infectious agents such as biofilms, fungus, and superantigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811434101">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bacterial biofilms, complex living forms of bacteria attached to surfaces, are described as an assembly of bacteria embedded in a self-produced polymeric matrix that occurs due to a crosstalk phenomenon known as “quorum sensing.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434101">2</xref></sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 65% of all human bacterial infections involve biofilms. It is also considered that 99% of all bacteria live in the form of biofilms because of reduced oxygen and nutrient requirements, easy handling of their waste products, and increased resistance to antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811434101">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811434101">4</xref></sup> There are many proposed mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in biofilms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434101">5</xref></sup> Once the biofilms are formed, repetitious antigenic presentation is caused by its resistance to both host defenses and external treatment. This kind of antigenic presentation leads to propagation of the chronic inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434101">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biofilms have been observed in many chronic ear, nose, and throat infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811434101">7</xref></sup> The relationship between CRS and biofilms was first described by Cryer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811434101">8</xref></sup> and its significance in CRS has been shown in many recent publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434101">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811434101">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811434101">12</xref></sup> In the current literature, anti-inflammatory treatments such as long-term macrolide antibiotics and intranasal corticosteroids have evidence-based recommendations from consensus and task force groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811434101">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811434101">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of biofilms and the effect of medical treatment on the eradication of biofilms in CRS without nasal polyps.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>There were 110 patients enrolled in this study who applied to our clinic from April 2007 to May 2009. However, the randomized controlled trial was completed with 32 patients, as illustrated in the patient flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811434101"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). All subjects were diagnosed as having CRS without nasal polyps by using patient history, nasal endoscopy, and paranasal sinus computed tomography findings, based on the criteria of the Rhinosinusitis Initiative 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811434101">13</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Our exclusion criteria were the presence of nasal polyps, marked septal deviation, history of allergic rhinitis, pregnancy, age younger than 18 years, previous sinus surgery, and congenital mucociliary diseases. Most of the patients had a history of prior antibiotics in the past year for several reasons, but no one had used antibiotics, oral-topical steroids, or decongestants in the past month prior to mucosal sampling. The institutional ethical committee of Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Training and Research Hospital approved the study, and informed written consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
<p>We performed the initial mucosal biopsy from the anterosuperior surface of ethmoidal bulla under topical and local anesthesia. Approximately a 4 × 4-mm specimen was obtained by otologic punch forceps for scanning electron microscopic (SEM) investigation.</p>
<p>We divided the patients into 2 groups for different treatment regimens. A randomization list was formed using simple randomization. The patients were assigned to their respective study groups by an investigator blinded to the treatment regimen, using the randomization list. In the first group (n = 16), oral clarithromycin was administered 500 mg/bid for 2 weeks and then 250 mg/d for the following 6 weeks. In the second group (n = 16), an 8-week course of 200-mcg/d topical mometasone furoate was added to the clarithromycin regimen, identical to the first group.</p>
<p>After the completion of the treatments, the patients underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). At the beginning of the operation, 4 × 4-mm ethmoidal mucosal samples were obtained from the anteroinferior surface of the ethmoidal bulla at the same site as the initial biopsy for SEM reassessment. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon, who was blinded to both treatment arms (EÇT).</p>
<p>Premedical treatment and operative samples were examined for biofilms by using scanning electron microscopy, each by the same researcher (İT), who was blinded to both treatment arms and treatment status of the samples. The fresh specimens were immediately fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde for 24 hours, washed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of alcohol. After dehydration, the specimens underwent drying to a critical point and were mounted on metal stubs with double-sided adhesive tape. Then, the samples were sputtered with 150-Å thick layer of gold in a BIO-RAD (Hercules, CA) sputter apparatus. The images were taken by JEOL SEM ASID-10 (Tokyo, Japan) and LEO 4.3 HVP SEM (Oberkochen, Germany) electron microscope.</p>
<p>Because the areas of interest are on the surface of mucosal tissue, we took sample SEM images within a voltage range of 5 to 80 kV and within a magnification range of 50× to 5000×. We identified the biofilms using SEM morphological findings as described in the literature, such as 3-dimensional structure, variable size of microorganisms embedded in polysaccharide matrix, and multilayered remnants of tissue and microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811434101">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811434101">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811434101">15</xref></sup> Tissue samples examined for biofilm by SEM were graded quantitatively according to Tatar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811434101">16</xref></sup> We graded the samples that had no biofilms but partial destruction of the cilia on the surface epithelium as grade 0+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811434101">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811434101"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), contrary to the grade 0 control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811434101"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>), which had neither epithelial destruction nor biofilm. Grade 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811434101"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>), grade 2, and grade 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599811434101"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>) biofilms were determined when &lt;25%, 25% to 50%, and &gt;50% of sample surfaces were involved, respectively.</p>

<p>The treatment groups were compared to each other and also within the group for the severity of biofilms and response to treatment in terms of grades. Statistical tests were conducted using SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used in the comparison of the biofilm before and after treatment within the groups, and the Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used in assessing the difference between the treatment groups. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was accepted as significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of biofilms in CRS is being increasingly recognized in the medical literature. Since biofilms were initially reported in patients who had sinus surgery and were resistant to medical therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811434101">8</xref></sup> they have been studied in various clinical trials and animal models of CRS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811434101">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811434101">21</xref></sup> In these studies, the prevalence of biofilms in CRS has been reported to be between 25% and 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811434101">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811434101">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811434101">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811434101">21</xref></sup> This reported wide spectrum of biofilm prevalence may depend on many factors, such as imaging modalities, number of samples, definition, and inclusion criteria of CRS.</p>
<p>In our study, SEM was used and biofilms were detected in 24 of 32 (75%) patients with the diagnosis of CRS without nasal polyps. To our knowledge, this biofilm study is the first to contain a homogeneous group of CRS patients without nasal polyps. Our quantitative grading of biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811434101">16</xref></sup> is also new in the literature, which we believe would be helpful to reflect the response to medications even if the biofilms persist. Our findings are consistent with recent studies that biofilms are common findings in CRS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811434101">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811434101">12</xref></sup> However, it is difficult to comment if the biofilms are the etiologic agents or are secondary to the ongoing process of chronic inflammation in the sinuses.</p>
<p>Medical treatment including long-term, low-dose macrolides and/or intranasal steroids has become a first-line treatment modality in CRS patients according to the current consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811434101">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811434101">14</xref></sup> Macrolides work primarily through their antibacterial effects. It has also been reported in the literature that macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects, especially when used in low doses in the long term. In a number of clinical studies, it was reported that macrolide therapy caused objective and subjective improvements in CRS patients, and this improvement was correlated to the duration of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811434101">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599811434101">25</xref></sup> Macrolide antibiotics have some inhibiting effects on the biofilm formation cascade as well. It was demonstrated that azithromycin and clarithromycin had the ability to retard but not prevent biofilm formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599811434101">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599811434101">27</xref></sup> In our study, we did not have a control group for macrolides, but we compared the effects of combined clarithromycin and topical mometasone furoate to clarithromycin. Our findings revealed that combined treatment had a similar effect.</p>
<p>Topical nasal steroids are the mainstay of the anti-inflammatory treatment in CRS. Subepithelial elements, which may act as receptors for the bacteria, can be exposed by the breaks in the epithelium. It is proposed that intranasal steroid usage may increase the restoration of normal epithelium by reducing mucosal inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599811434101">28</xref></sup> Numerous clinical and laboratory studies have shown the improving effects of topical nasal steroids in CRS, but the clinical data are very limited in CRS patients without nasal polyps. In a meta-analysis of intranasal steroid treatment, investigators could not find any study in which the study population involved only CRS patients without polyps, but 13 studies were relevant to CRS patients with polyps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599811434101">29</xref></sup> From this perspective, the contribution of our study is that it includes a homogeneous group of CRS patients without polyps.</p>
<p>In this study, we questioned whether the recommended medical treatment modalities had an effect on the eradication of biofilms. We determined that the prevalence of biofilms improved from 75.0% (n = 24) to 43.8% (n = 14) with medical treatment. We also observed an improvement in terms of biofilm gradings, which reflected the percentage area of biofilm extension. If the grade of biofilm was improved, it was by only 1 scale in each patient. Biofilms disappeared in some patients and regressed in others from grade 3 to 2 or from grade 2 to 1. It is also interesting to note that the epithelial morphology also improved in 5 of 6 “0+” patients. This effect shows that medical treatment at least causes some improvement in grading scale. This may raise the question if the extended or combined treatment can cause further improvement. In our study, we also determined that combining nasal steroids with macrolides did not give any further benefit. The extended treatments can be a subject of future studies.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study, with respect to comparison of medical treatment arms, was the small sample size. The sample size of 16 patients in each group has 80% power with a 5% type I error to detect a mean difference of 0.47 between groups. Thus, with this small sample size per 2 medical treatment groups, we would be able to detect only a very large difference, if it existed, between the groups. However, collecting such a homogeneous CRS patient population without polyps took a long time because only 32 of 110 patients fulfilled the criteria for the study in a period of 2 years.</p>
<p>In the current study, we showed medical treatment results in improvements with respect to biofilm prevalence and grading in CRS without polyps. However, absence of a significant difference between the 2 therapy groups before and after treatment showed that there was no advantage in adding nasal steroids to macrolides. However, it is not possible to make stronger comments on the effects of nasal steroids with the current sample size.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we have determined that biofilms were present in 75% of CRS patients without polyps by using scanning electron microscopy. With the recommended medical treatment, the prevalence of biofilms dropped to 43%. Even if the biofilms did not disappear by medical treatment, the reduction in the grades could be an indication of response to treatment. However, adding nasal steroids to macrolides did not give any further benefit in terms of biofilm response. Further clinical and SEM studies with larger numbers of patients would be helpful in designing a proper treatment of CRS patients with or without biofilms.</p>
