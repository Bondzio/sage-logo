<p>I deny that any one knows or can know, the nature of the two sexes, as long as they have only been seen in their present relation to one another. Until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely. (John Stuart Mill <italic>On the subjection of women</italic> 1869)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is the true nature of sex differences? This is an issue that has intrigued scholars for centuries. The answers have varied from the 17th century onward, between differences in bodily liquid composition, genital differences, brain sizes, chromosomes, genes, hormones and more recently the interdisciplinary and synthetic approach: brain organization research. These explanations have been challenged and fought unequally by feminist opponents, from John Stuart Mill (quoted above) to Simone de Beauvoir to more recent queer theorists. Feminist science studies and critique thus have a long history answering the following questions: How are notions of sex and gender (and other power regimes) produced in science? and How can alternative, less oppressive knowledge of sex and gender be produced? <italic>Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences</italic> (2010), by Rebeccah M Jordan-Young, is a recent contribution to this tradition, demonstrating the biases in sex difference brain research.</p>
<p>Let me tell you from the beginning: This is not yet another critique that does not engage with science. On the contrary, Jordan-Young, herself a socio-medical scientist, sets out to test the evidence in brain organization research – from the late 1960s and onward – with a scientific rigour I have not seen since Evelyn Fox Keller or Sandra Harding’s early work. I cannot help but think of these grand dames of feminist science studies and their rightful claim that science should strive for a strong objectivity – since objectivity today is not objective enough. Although the author does not situate her work in this tradition, I think it is fair to say that what is being performed in this in many ways groundbreaking book is a step towards constructing strong objectivity through the critique of publications over 40 years in the large field of brain organization research, that is, research that builds on the idea that ‘human brains are “hardwired” for sex-typed preferences and skills by early hormone exposures’ (p. 2).</p>
<p><italic>Brain storm</italic> starts with an introduction that states that the book is not written against science, or against the possibility that there may be sex differences, but against sloppy research that does not reflect on its own biases and presuppositions. Moreover, Jordan-Young is explicit that this is not a science and technology studies (STS) approach, or even a feminist science studies book, but rather a traditional critique from a ‘critical insider’ (p. 11), building on substantial empirical evidence such as academic publications and interviews with scientists.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, when questioning of the sex–gender distinction started in the feminist literature, attempts to rethink the sexed body in feminist terms have evolved rapidly. Still, one can rightfully ask: What actually constitutes ‘the biological’ in gender research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506811434250">Birke, 2003</xref>)? We could say that the theoretical answers to questions about corporeality and biology have shifted from depicting it as something the social can transgress (de Beauvoir) to representing the biological as a result of the social (Butler). Moreover, today there are discussions about a kind of mix of biological and social – about the biological being one process among others, thus not something static (Fausto-Sterling). Others do not refer to biology, but instead choose to talk about material-semiotic figuration when pointing out that the boundaries between nature and culture, biological and social, are arbitrary (Haraway). In more explanatory terms, we could say that the question of gender research’s relationship to ‘the biological’ is strongly connected to issues concerning nature/culture and the sex/gender distinction, and to the increased interest in the body and embodiment, which began in the early 1990s. So, how does Jordan-Young address this tricky issue? In the introduction, she characterizes sex-gender-sexuality as a three-ply yarn, all knitted together:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I find the metaphor appealing because it suggests three strands that are simultaneously distinct, interrelated, and somewhat fuzzy around the boundaries. [ … ] I have used the term sex to refer to characteristics of the physical body, gender to refer to psychological attributes and social behaviours that are associated with masculinity and femininity, and sexuality for the realm of erotic desires and practices. (p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The yarn is a metaphor that comes out in her engagement with the scientific texts (although the sexual is sometimes lost as a critical third ply), and it is a definition that she uses for pragmatic rather than ontological reasons. Towards the end of the book, the author picks up the term ‘norms of reaction’ in order to describe the interconnectedness of the layers in more scientific, biological terms, and I will return to this term later on. Before that, I will give you two examples from the book, just hinting at the richness and the complexities that the author presents.</p>

<title>Neuroscience and brain organization theory</title>
<p>The challenge for neuroscience is to bind together the genetic level with the social in a way that is credible, something that involves the working up of several categories and the drawing and fixing of boundaries. Classifications and boundary work are central features of (scientific) knowledge production; there is what we may call a negotiating potential to categories. What will count as, for example, nature or culture, man or woman or heredity or environment is not pre-given, but <italic>where</italic> the boundaries get drawn and <italic>what</italic> meaning different categories get assigned is central to knowledge production. The brain is a bio-social organ that is sensitive to environmental changes – today talked of as plasticity – but is also rather robust – our brains do not change all the time. The plasticity/robustness of the brain goes well together with the way we think about personality and behavioural traits that, although they are not static qualities, do not change radically from one day to another. Brain organization research is positioned right at the heart of the nature–nurture debate and has occasionally been portrayed as a controversial science because brain scientists often portray sex differences, despite the stability/change dialectics discussed, as static properties positioned in the brain. Debates of different kinds have long been a part of the sociology of science. But just as interesting as it may be to study controversies, so too is the analysis of how something is worked up as factual, as incontestable truth. Thus, Jordan-Young considers how it is that brain organization research, despite its scientific flaws – from the posing of research questions, through the selection of subjects to the interpretation of data and its inconsistencies in results – continues to hang on to a faith in sex differences. The answer is Garfinkel’s notion of the ‘natural attitude’ of gender, later developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506811434250">Kessler and McKenna (1978)</xref>. In short, this ethnomethodological theory states that gender is a ‘naturalized, rather than a natural system. In other words, gender rests upon a belief system about what is natural. It appears real only when the proofs used to produce it is invisible’ (p. 261).</p>
<p>The author convincingly demonstrates how stereotypical notions – the natural attitude – of gender feed into the neuro-scientific research and how these notions are so taken for granted that when a shift occurs, it is not even reflected upon in retrospect. For example, research on biologically atypical men and women (e.g. women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), who have enlarged clitorises and small labia) from the 1960s and 1970s regarded a ‘passive’ or submissive sexual role – oriented towards one partner – as feminine, whereas masturbation and having multiple partners were regarded as masculine. This was just taken for granted, while empirical research and reports published before and during this period demonstrated a quite different picture in which many women’s sexual lives were far from submissive and monogamous. Obviously, in the early brain organization research, stereotypical ideas of gender and heterosexuality preceded the construction of sex as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434250">Butler (1990)</xref> would frame it.</p>

<title>An example – sexual orientation</title>
<p>Why are some people gay and others straight? This is a question that has intrigued science for decades. The search for gay genes and gay brains (never the straight gene or brain) has cost enormous amounts of research funding, labour (both from research participants and researchers) and lab animal suffering and lives. Now, one hypothesis that has gained strong influence is that sexual orientation is based in hormonal exposure during pregnancy, thus an overexposure of testosterone for a female foetus may lead her to become lesbian, while an underexposure of the same hormone would lead a male foetus to become gay (the homosexual/heterosexual frame, p. 163). The narrative underlying this hypothesis is that of the gay person as not quite fully man or woman but as defective. As brain organization research cannot perform experiments on humans, research is based either on other animals (most often rodents) or, which is the main focus of the book, on quasi-experiments like cohort studies and case-control studies (for an overview of historical sex-difference studies on rodents, see Anne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506811434250">Fausto-Sterling, 2000</xref>). There are some major confusions in the definitions of sexual orientation. First, sexual orientation is sometimes understood as same-sex orienting and sometimes as directed towards men or women. The distinction has some significant meaning when it comes to study design, since</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it determines which people are considered to have similar versus contrasting sexual orientations. That is, are lesbians like straight men because both are attracted to women? Or are they like gay men, because they are both attracted to people of their own sex? (p. 147)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, there are inconsistencies in the ways orientation is measured on, for example, the Kinsey scale. In short, is it sexual attraction, fantasies, behaviour, love or identity issues that are taken to be the core of sexual orientation? How ‘much’ of these preferences is needed in order to count as gay? The somewhat odd result of this ‘scientific gerrymandering’ (p. 169) is that since different studies employ different criteria, ‘one scientist’s heterosexuals are another scientist’s homosexuals’ (p. 168).</p>
<p>Jordan-Young’s consistent point throughout the book is that since quasi-experiments need to be grouped together in order to be valid – they cannot stand alone – it is the grouping together of such diverse studies with diverse categorizations and designs that produces a falsely coherent picture of human sex differences and sexuality as hardwired in the brain, while in fact, when deconstructing the bulk and scrutinizing the evidence, not much is left as unquestionable evidence. For example, the brain organization studies claim as a main finding that sexual orientation is consistent in one person during a lifetime, whereas Jordan-Young demonstrates that it is a hidden criterion for inclusion of research subjects. Thus, subjects who are not ‘perfect’ in their preferences (and most people probably are not) are not included in the studies. But even so, from the brain organization research point of view, the results are disappointing; they do not confirm the hypothesis of early hormonal exposure. ‘The people with the most extreme cross-sex hormone exposures show little, if any, shift in sexual orientation’ (p. 196). The author’s conclusion is that data in the field of sexual orientation are not just weak, they are also extremely contradictory.</p>

<title>Sex is a bio-social thing</title>
<p>This is a rich and convincing book. Jordan-Young takes the reader by the hand and offers a thorough and comprehensive reading of brain organization research. It is rich in detail – sometimes too rich, at times one becomes impatient – and offers some very interesting insights through careful analysis. The structure of the book is clear and the arguments are refreshingly pointed. It covers the vast majority of research within this field, focusing on sex differences. This is an impressive undertaking and one that should be honoured. The strongest contribution is the way in which the author brings the social context of the research into all the different layers of the process: from the research questions asked, to the selection of subjects, to possible interpretations.</p>
<p>Having said this, the only problem I have with this book is that the author does not engage more with the feminist science studies tradition. Except for the introduction, not much attention is paid to theories that could have contextualized and consolidated the highly illuminating analyses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506811434250">Barad’s (2003)</xref> theory of agential realism and ‘agential cut’ to account for the categorizations made and their results and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506811434250">Robert’s (2007)</xref> analysis of the construction of ‘sex hormones’, the problematization of the boundaries of the biological and the social and consequently the challenges this poses to feminist theory, could, for example, have lifted the discussion in chapter two: ‘Hormones and Hardwiring’. Instead, the author, true to her declaration of herself as a critical insider, ends up with a development of the idea of ‘norms of reaction.’ This is a biological concept used to describe the range of phenotypic expressions that one genotype can give rise to in response to different environmental conditions, making the result an ‘ecotype’, rather than a phenotype (p. 276). Thus, gender as a reaction norm implies an interconnectedness with sex, which is more of a bio-social nature, transgressing the sex/gender dichotomy.</p>
<p>An even more radical approach to sex itself as a reaction norm has been developed by feminist biologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506811434250">Ah-King and Nylin (2010)</xref> who state that ‘it should be recognized that in an evolutionary perspective sex can be viewed as a reaction norm, with sex attributes being phenotypically plastic’. They also emphasize that genetic and environmental input on an already existing phenotype results in dynamic development of sexual features/behaviours. In their perspective, sex in an evolutionary time frame is extremely variable and they give examples from variation in sex determination to appearance and behaviour among animals to back this up. Jordan-Young concludes that ‘applying these observations along with the principle of norms of reaction might lead us to focus on the dynamism of development – understanding <italic>processes</italic> more that <italic>permanent states</italic>, development rather than “essences”’(p. 291). Perhaps, this points to a possibility of finding a more liberating/less oppressive neuroscience? Perhaps, like Dussauge and Kaiser (in press) argue, even a queer neuroscience in which the ontological understanding of the plasticity of the brain and of gender as performative is built into the methodologies used? Or, is it, like John Stuart Mill argued more than a hundred years ago, impossible to find out about the natural as long as the social conditions are radically unequal?</p>
