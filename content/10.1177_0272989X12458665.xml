<p>This issue contains seven articles that offer guidance for modeling studies for health outcomes research. To ensure that good research practices on modeling techniques remain useful for all current modeling techniques as well as to foster the use of model-based results to inform health care decisions, a Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force was created. The task force members consist of individuals from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM), and the journals of both societies, <italic>Value in Health</italic> and <italic>Medical Decision Making</italic>, agreed to publish the task force reports on the same date in both journals after a period of peer review.</p>
<p>Thus, the seven articles from the ISPOR-SMDM Task Force are being published simultaneously in <italic>Value in Health</italic> and <italic>Medical Decision Making</italic>. Each manuscript was submitted to both journals simultaneously. Before submission, as part of the guidance development process, the manuscripts underwent review by a panel of reviewers. In addition, the membership of each society was invited to comment on them. The original journal submissions included the comments of the reviewers as well as the authors’ responses to those comments.</p>
<p>Prior to submission, the wording of the task force’s recommendations was approved by the leadership of ISPOR and SMDM. For this reason, the journals agreed, prior to submission, that we would not change or suggest changes to the wording of the recommendations. However, we did provide opportunity for peer review of the write-up associated with the recommendations, since often the explanation and interpretation of recommendations are as important as the content of the recommendations themselves.</p>
<p>We assigned each manuscript to two editors, one from each journal. We alternated roles so that for some papers, the <italic>Value in Health</italic> editor had the first look, whereas for others, the <italic>Medical Decision Making</italic> editor did. In some cases, after review by an internal associate editor, the editors decided to send the manuscript to one of the panel reviewers, a new reviewer, or both. All manuscripts underwent one round of revision prior to final acceptance. Both editors signed each decision letter. Although <italic>Value in Health</italic> had a prior agreement with ISPOR to publish all papers submitted, and <italic>Medical Decision Making</italic> followed its usual editorial policy regarding invited material, the editors of the two journals collaborated at every step, and, as it happens, all decisions were mutual.</p>
<p>After acceptance of the papers, each journal followed its usual policies for journal style and copyediting, which may have resulted in differences in formatting. The editors did not review the proofs from the other journal, but J. Jaime Caro, the leader of the task force, approved the proofs for both journals. The two journals also used different procedures for disclosure of conflicts of interest.</p>
