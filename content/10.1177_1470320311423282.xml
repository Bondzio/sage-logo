<p>To investigate the potential role of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptors (AT<sub>1</sub>Rs) as well as endogenously produced nitric oxide (NO) in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis during ontogeny, experiments were carried out in conscious lambs aged approximately 1 week (<italic>N</italic> = 9) and 6 weeks (<italic>N</italic> = 11). The arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) was assessed before and after intravenous (IV) infusion of the selective AT<sub>1</sub>R antagonist, ZD 7155, before and after IV administration of the L-arginine analogue, <italic>N<sup>G</sup></italic>-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In both groups, after ZD 7155 alone, mean arterial pressure decreased then increased after L-NAME. At 1 but not 6 weeks, HR decreased after ZD 7155 as well as after L-NAME. At 1 but not 6 weeks, there was a decrease in the HR range after ZD 7155 and after ZD 7155 + L-NAME, as compared to control. There was also a decrease in minimum HR after ZD 7155 + L-NAME at 1 week. These data provide new evidence that, together, Ang II and NO regulate cardiovascular homeostasis as well as the arterial baroreflex of HR early in life which may help to explain the activation of these two systems early in life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulating cardiovascular and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, through its physiologically active peptide, angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent pressor and renal vasoconstrictor peptide. During the perinatal period, the RAS system is activated, with all its components, including Ang II, being elevated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311423282">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref></sup> Also during this time, the nitric oxide (NO) pathway is activated so that in infants, endogenous kidney NO production is higher than that of older children or adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423282">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311423282">10</xref></sup> increasing over the first week postnatally. To date, the physiological relevance of the activation of the RAS and NO pathways during the perinatal period is not completely understood.</p>
<p>In previous studies in conscious lambs, we investigated some of the physiological effects of Ang II and NO separately: for example, we showed that endogenously produced Ang II modulates both resting arterial pressure and renal haemodynamics through the activation of Ang II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>R) but not Ang II type 2 (AT<sub>2</sub>R) receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423282">11</xref></sup> over the first 6 weeks of postnatal life. Acute administration of Ang II to conscious lambs results in an increase in arterial pressure and a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF), although these responses are greater at approximately 6 weeks when compared to the first week of postnatal life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423282">12</xref></sup> Also, the Ang-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, alters several parameters governing the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) at 1 but not 6 weeks:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref></sup> in 1-week old lambs, after captopril, there is a significant increase in the slope coefficient (<italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic>), a decrease in minimum HR (<italic>P<sub>4</sub></italic>), and a decrease in gain (<italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic>). In 6-week old lambs, there are no effects of captopril on any of the parameters governing the arterial baroreflex. This provides evidence to suggest that Ang II modulates the arterial baroreflex control of in an age-dependent manner. Because ACE inhibitors such as captopril may also have secondary effects on other factors that modulate the arterial baroreflex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311423282">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311423282">16</xref></sup> further assessments of the baroreflex are needed with a selective AT<sub>1</sub>R inhibitor to further evaluate any such role for Ang II postnatally.</p>
<p>In addition to the physiological effects of Ang II during the postnatal period, we have previously demonstrated a greater role for endogenously produced NO in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis soon after birth when compared to later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423282">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311423282">19</xref></sup> Physiologically, a decrease in endogenously produced NO in the newborn period results in an increase in arterial pressure and powerful renal vasoconstriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423282">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423282">20</xref></sup> Administration of the L-arginine analogue, <italic>N<sup>G</sup></italic>-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), non-selective in inhibiting NO production from constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS), to conscious lambs is associated with a decrease in the HR range, slope coefficient, and minimum HR at 1 week, with no effects on any of these parameters at 6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423282">21</xref></sup> In addition, L-NAME administration is associated with a decrease in plasma renin activity (PRA) which is greater at 1 than at 6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423282">17</xref></sup> This suggests that the cardiovascular responses to L-NAME could have resulted from alterations in the level of activation of the RAS system. This premise forms the basis of the present study.</p>
<p>Experiments were carried out in two separate age groups of conscious, chronically instrumented lambs to investigate the hemodynamics effects of the selective AT<sub>1</sub>R antagonist, ZD 7155, including the arterial baroreflex control of HR. A potent, highly selective, and reversible antagonist for ZD 7155 does not generate an active metabolite, as is the case for losartan. Losartan’s active carboxylic acid metabolite, EXP 3174, has non-competitive antagonistic effects on the AT<sub>1</sub>R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311423282">22</xref></sup> In addition, ZD 7155 is around 10-fold more potent than losartan in antagonizing Ang II-induced pressor effects in conscious rats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320311423282">23</xref></sup> and it readily displaces [<sup>125</sup>I]-Ang II from its binding sites on guinea pig adrenal gland membranes in a concentration-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320311423282">24</xref></sup> To investigate any potential interaction between Ang II and NO in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis and the arterial baroreflex, the effects of ZD 7155 were also tested in the presence of L-NAME. An additional experiment in the absence of ZD 7155 or L-NAME served as a time-control.</p>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Surgery was performed using aseptic techniques as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423282">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320311423282">26</xref></sup> Briefly, anesthesia was induced with a mask and isoflurane (approximately 4%) in oxygen, the trachea was intubated, and then anesthesia was maintained by ventilating the lungs with isoflurane [1.5–2.5% in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (3:2)]. Under sterile conditions, catheters (Tygon<sup>®</sup> Microbore Tubing, ID 0.010 in, OD 0.030 in; Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, Aurora, Ohio, USA) were inserted into the femoral vessels and advanced to the aorta and inferior vena cava for later pressure measurements, as well as intravenous (IV) injections of drugs and solutions. Catheters were tunneled subcutaneously to exit the lamb on the right and left flanks, respectively. Either the right or the left kidney was then approached retroperitoneally, and a pre-calibrated ultrasonic flow transducer (size 3S–4S; Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, New York, USA) was placed around the renal artery for later measurement of RBF as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320311423282">27</xref></sup> The catheters and the flow transducer cable were contained in pouches on a lamb body jacket (Lomir Inc., Montréal, Quebec, Canada) for safe storage between experiments. All lambs were able to stand soon after the completion of surgery and were allowed to recover from the effects of surgery and anesthesia in a small animal critical care unit (Shor-line, Kansas City, Kansas, USA) for approximately 30–60 min, after which time they were returned to the vivarium, where they were housed with their mothers until the time of the experiment at least 4 days later. Antibiotics (sulbactam benzathine 3.3 mg/kg<sup>-1</sup>, ampicillin trihydrate 6.6 mg/kg<sup>-1</sup>; Pfizer, Kirkland, Quebec, Canada) were administered intramuscularly at 24-h intervals beginning on the day before surgery for a total period of 4 days. During the recovery period, animals were removed from the vivarium daily for a period of approximately 1 h to allow them to accommodate to a supportive sling in which they were housed during the experiments. This training period ensured that animals were at ease and resting quietly in the laboratory setting during the experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470320311423282">
<title>Experimental details</title>
<p>On the day of an experiment, each animal was removed from the vivarium at approximately 08:00 and placed in the same supportive sling in the laboratory environment for at least 60 min. During this equilibration period, an IV infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.9% sodium chloride (4.17 ml/h/kg<sup>-1</sup>) was started and continued until the end of the experiment to assist in maintaining fluid balance. The flow transducer cable was connected to a flowmeter (T101, Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, New York, USA) for measuring RBF. The left femoral catheters were connected to pressure transducers (model P23XL; Grass Technologies, West Warwick, Rhode Island, USA) for measuring arterial and venous pressures. RBF and arterial and venous pressures were recorded onto a polygraph (model 7; Grass Technologies, West Warwick, Rhode Island, USA) and simultaneously digitized at 200 Hz using the data acquisition and analysis software package, PolyVIEW™ (Astro-Med Inc., Grass Technologies subsidiary, West Warwick, Rhode Island, USA).</p>
<p>Three experiments were carried out in each lamb in random order at intervals of 24–48 h: control + ZD 7155 + vehicle (experiment 1); control + ZD 7155 + L-NAME (experiment 2); control + vehicle + vehicle (experiment 3). After the 30-min control period, an IV infusion of 70 μg/kg<sup>-1</sup>/h<sup>-1</sup> ZD 7155 hydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, Missouri, USA) was started following an IV bolus of 100 μg/kg<sup>-1</sup> (experiment 1 and 2) or an equivalent volume of saline vehicle (experiment 3). To ensure the efficacy of the inhibition of AT<sub>1</sub>Rs, the pressor response to IV administration of a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of Ang II was also tested at the beginning of the experiment, 5 min after the start of ZD 7155 infusion, and at the end of each experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423282">11</xref></sup> The dose of ZD 7155 was selected from our previous dose-response experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423282">11</xref></sup> as that which inhibits the pressor response to IV administration of EC<sub>50</sub> Ang II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423282">12</xref></sup> For experiment 2, L-NAME (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) was then administered IV as a bolus at a dose of 20 mg/kg<sup>-1</sup>. This dose of L-NAME inhibits intra-renal production of acetylcholine and increases systolic arterial pressure (SAP) for 120 min in the first 6 weeks of postnatal life in conscious lambs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311423282">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311423282">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423282">21</xref></sup> For each experiment, baseline cardiovascular variables were measured for 30 min (control), at the end of which time the arterial baroreflex control of HR was assessed as follows: briefly, phenylephrine hydrochloride [(PHE), 10 µg/kg<sup>-1</sup>; Sabex Inc., Boucherville, Quebec, Canada] and sodium nitroprusside [(SNP), 10 µg/kg<sup>-1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakville, Ontario, Canada] were administered IV using a programmable syringe pump (Model 11; Harvard Apparatus Canada, Saint Laurent, Quebec, Canada) to increase and decrease SAP and to allow the construction of the physiological range over which the arterial baroreflex operates, including the upper and lower limits. Beat-to-beat SAP and pulse interval were measured for 10 s before each intervention, and measurements continued until the maximum response to PHE, as well as SNP, was reached as previously described by us.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423282">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311423282">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data handling and analysis</title>
<p>Peak intervals of the arterial pressure waveform were used to determine pulse interval. Cardiovascular measurements were averaged over consecutive 1-min intervals and averaged over 30 min. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated as follows: RVR = [mean arterial pressure (MAP) - mean venous pressure (MVP)/RBF], where RBF was normalized per gram kidney weight. For each assessment of the arterial baroreflex control of HR, the relationship between SAP and HR obtained during the consecutive pulse interval was constructed for each animal. For each age group, raw data were pooled and a four-parameter sigmoidal logistic function was applied to the pooled data in each age group (SigmaPlot, version 9.0; Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The method used to assess the arterial baroreflex control of HR was that described by Kent et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470320311423282">29</xref></sup> and detailed previously by us:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423282">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311423282">28</xref></sup> HR = <italic>P<sub>4</sub></italic> + <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> / [1 + e ^ <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> (SAP - P<sub>3</sub>)], where <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> is the HR range (bpm<sup>-1</sup>), <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> is the slope coefficient, <italic>P<sub>3</sub></italic> is SAP at the midpoint of the HR range (mmHg), and <italic>P<sub>4</sub></italic> is the minimum HR (bpm<sup>-1</sup>), and maximum gain (<italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic>) = -<italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> × <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> × 0.25, considered to describe the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320311423282">30</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present experiments were carried out in conscious lambs to further explore the physiological role of Ang II in modulating systemic and renal hemodynamics as well as the arterial baroreflex control of HR through the activation of AT<sub>1</sub>Rs during postnatal maturation. In addition, the putative role for NO in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis and the baroreflex through AT<sub>1</sub>Rs early in life was evaluated. Novel findings of our study are that: (a) after ZD 7155, MAP decreased in both age groups of animals, then increased after the addition of L-NAME; (b) in 1-week old lambs, HR decreased after ZD 7155, then further decreased after the addition of L-NAME, whereas at 6 weeks, HR decreased only after a combination of ZD 7155 plus L-NAME; (c) an increase in RBF occurred after ZD 7155 in both age groups but there were no further changes after the administration of L-NAME; and (d) there were age-dependent effects of ZD 7155 and ZD 7155 plus L-NAME on the arterial baroreflex control of HR. In fact, the combination of ZD 7155 and L-NAME appeared to remove the age-dependent differences which normally exist in the arterial baroreflex control of HR during postnatal maturation. This provides new evidence that there appears to be an important interaction between Ang II and NO in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis as well as the arterial baroreflex early in life. This interaction between Ang II and NO appears to be predominant in the immediate newborn period, which may help to explain the activation of these two systems early in life.</p>
<p>It is well recognized from studies in adult animals and humans that the majority of the physiological actions of Ang II are mediated through the activation of AT<sub>1</sub>R. Ang II promotes an increase in arterial pressure through the activation of AT<sub>1</sub>R localized to vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and exerts facilitatory effects on neural transmission at sympathetic nerve terminals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320311423282">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470320311423282">32</xref></sup> Ang II inhibits both baroreceptor afferent activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470320311423282">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470320311423282">34</xref></sup> and vagal tone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470320311423282">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470320311423282">37</xref></sup> as well as modulating the arterial baroreflex control of HR and sympathetic activity with effects occurring at the periphery and/or specific sites within the central nervous system (CNS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470320311423282">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470320311423282">41</xref></sup> AT<sub>2</sub>Rs appear to modulate renal afferent arteriolar resistance as well as intra-renal production of bradykinin and NO and oppose the effects of Ang II on AT<sub>1</sub>Rs when the RAS is activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470320311423282">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470320311423282">43</xref></sup> NO may also influence at least some of the aforementioned cardiovascular effects of Ang II. For example, Jerez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470320311423282">44</xref></sup> showed in rabbit aortic rings that maximal contractile responses to Ang II were increased by pre-treatment with L-NAME, providing evidence that NO modulates the Ang II-induced contractility of VSM cells.</p>
<p>Constitutive NOS isoforms have also been localized to discrete brain regions which are involved in cardiovascular regulation including cell bodies in the magnocellular neurons of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus that project to the posterior pituitary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470320311423282">45</xref></sup> In addition, NOS coexists with Ang II in neurons and glial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470320311423282">46</xref></sup> and interacts with Ang II within the CNS to modulate blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470320311423282">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470320311423282">48</xref></sup> A central interaction between Ang II and NO at the cellular and nuclear levels also appears to be fundamental to the sympathoexcitatory state seen in heart failure, at least experimentally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470320311423282">49</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies in conscious rats have provided evidence that both excitatory and inhibitory NOS inputs to the control of sympathetic outflow are active at baseline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470320311423282">50</xref></sup> and that NOS activity supports baseline HR. To date, however, any interaction between Ang II and NO in the perinatal period – a time when both systems are elevated – in influencing cardiovascular homeostasis has not previously been investigated.</p>
<p>In the present study in 1-week old lambs, the decrease in HR which occurs following the administration of ZD 7155 appears to result from a decrease in the HR range over which the baroreflex operates. After the administration of L-NAME, the further decrease in HR appears to reflect, instead, a decrease in the minimum HR at which the baroreflex operates. These data provide new evidence that NO may interact with Ang II through the activation of AT<sub>1</sub>R in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis and the arterial baroreflex control of HR, and that this is developmentally regulated. Previously there has been little physiological relevance to the activation of these two systems early in life. Therefore, these observations provide a new possibility for these two systems in governing cardiovascular regulation together during the critical adaptations of both the kidney and the circulatory system to extrauterine life. In keeping with the known modulatory roles for NO and Ang II in fluid and electrolyte disorders, such as congestive heart failure, the present data provide evidence for a new, previously unexplored interaction in the newborn period, in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis soon after birth.</p>
<p>Differences in level of activation of the RAS system can explain the age-dependent changes in the effects of ZD 7155 alone on the arterial baroreflex. For example, in conscious dogs, Hatton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470320311423282">51</xref></sup> assessed the baroreflex under Na<sup>+</sup>-replete conditions and after activating the RAS system by a combination of dietary Na<sup>+</sup> depletion and diuretic administration. Na<sup>+</sup> depletion raised PRA from approximately 2 ng AI/ml<sup>-1</sup>/h<sup>-1</sup> to approximately 20 ng AI/mL<sup>-1</sup>/h<sup>-1</sup> which is similar to the differences we have previously measured in resting PRA between 1- and 6-week old lambs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref></sup> Under Na<sup>+</sup>-replete conditions, Hatton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470320311423282">51</xref></sup> showed that ACE inhibition had little effect on resting arterial pressure and HR, and did not change any parameters governing the arterial baroreflex control of HR. This is similar to our previous observations in 6-week old lambs after captopril,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423282">6</xref></sup> as well as the present observations in 6-week old lambs after ZD 7155 alone. Under Na<sup>+</sup>-deplete conditions, however, arterial pressure was decreased after ACE inhibition and the arterial baroreflex control of HR was shifted towards lower pressures. This is also similar to our previous observations in 1-week lambs after captopril, as well as our present observations in 1-week old lambs after ZD 7155. The present findings are also consistent with the observations by Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470320311423282">37</xref></sup> in conscious adult sheep that in conditions where Ang II levels are high but resting blood pressure is normal – as also occurring in the immediate newborn period in conscious lambs – baseline HR depends upon endogenous Ang II.</p>
<p>Previously, we showed that the administration of L-NAME alone to conscious, 1-week old lambs was associated with a decrease in the HR range, the slope coefficient, and minimum HR, as well as a decrease in maximum gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423282">17</xref></sup> In older lambs, however, there were no apparent effects of L-NAME alone on any of the parameters governing the arterial baroreflex control of HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423282">21</xref></sup> These findings provided evidence that endogenously produced NO may influence the baroreflex control of HR early in life. In a later study, we showed that the administration of L-NAME alone to conscious newborn lambs was associated with a decrease in PRA. Therefore, we reasoned that these aforementioned effects of L-NAME alone on the arterial baroreflex control of HR could be due to alterations in circulating levels of Ang II providing the basis to the current study. The present observations reveal that L-NAME alters the effects of ZD 7155 on the arterial baroreflex control of HR at 1 week but not at 6 weeks, suggesting that the age-dependent effects of removing endogenously produced NO on the arterial baroreflex can, at least in part, be attributed to the effects of endogenously produced Ang II and elicited through AT<sub>1</sub>Rs. Furthermore, at 1 week, when the effects of Ang II through AT<sub>1</sub>Rs is inhibited in combination with inhibition of endogenously produced NO, the arterial baroreflex control of HR assumes a similar relationship as that which occurs at 6 weeks. Therefore the two systems (Ang II and NO) working together may be underlying the age-dependent differences in the baroreflex relationship which exists postnatally. This observation may help to shed some light on the physiological relevance which underlies the activation of both systems – the RAS and NO pathways – during the perinatal period.</p>
<p>It is also plausible to suggest that early in life, AT<sub>2</sub>Rs modulate the effects of Ang II in eliciting AT<sub>1</sub>R activation, such as occurs later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470320311423282">42</xref></sup> AT<sub>2</sub>Rs appear to counterbalance the effects of AT<sub>1</sub>Rs by influencing cellular differentiation, vasodilation, inhibition of cellular proliferation and hypertrophy, NO production, and Na<sup>+</sup> excretion. This possibility has not yet been explored in the developing animal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470320311423282">52</xref></sup> Additional studies are therefore warranted to investigate the potential role of AT<sub>2</sub>Rs in modulating the responses to AT<sub>1</sub>Rs during ontogeny, by exploring the combined inhibition of both Ang II receptor subtypes on cardiovascular homeostasis as well as the arterial baroreflex control of HR.</p>
