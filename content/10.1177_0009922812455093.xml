<abstract>
<p>Patient-centered care requires pediatricians to address parents’ health concerns, but their willingness to solicit parental concerns may be limited by uncertainty about which topics will be raised. The authors conducted surveys of parents to identify current health-related issues of concern.</p>
<sec id="section1-0009922812455093">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants rated 30 items as health problems for children in their community (large, medium, small, or no problem) and volunteered concerns for their own children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812455093">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1119 parents completed the survey. Allergies (69%), lack of exercise (68%), asthma (65%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (65%), Internet safety (63%), obesity (59%), smoking (58%), and bullying (57%) were identified as important problems (large or medium) with variation among demographic subgroups.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parents regard their pediatrician as a trusted source of health information and rely on them to provide advice on raising children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812455093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812455093">2</xref></sup> Health information and advice is often provided within the context of well-child care, a cornerstone of pediatric care. Topics selected for discussion at a well-child visit are guided by the Bright Futures Guidelines for health supervision visits published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812455093">3</xref></sup> The list of potential topics has lengthened over time and is described as “overwhelming” by community pediatricians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812455093">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812455093">5</xref></sup> In addition to traditional topics such as healthy growth and development and prevention of injuries, pediatricians are asked to address “new morbidities” such as obesity, behavior disorders, depression, adolescent risky behaviors, and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812455093">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812455093">7</xref></sup> Gaps between what is recommended to be included in well-child care and what parents report is provided have been identified, with more than half of parents reporting one or more unmet needs for guidance or education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812455093">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents often have concerns about psychosocial issues but are unlikely to raise them during the office visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812455093">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812455093">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812455093">10</xref></sup> Recognizing this, the Bright Futures Guidelines promote solicitation of parental concerns at every well-child visit to keep the visit patient centered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812455093">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812455093">11</xref></sup> This more tailored approach to well-child care is supported by pediatricians, although it creates a tension between addressing parents’ concerns and covering the recommended visit content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812455093">5</xref></sup> Implementation of this approach to care requires a change from the more traditional visit format that is still encouraged by the templates included in electronic medical records, where the pediatrician determines the topics for discussion and asks most of the questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812455093">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practitioners’ willingness to ask open-ended questions to solicit parental concerns as well as their ability to provide effective management may be limited by their uncertainty about which topics are likely to be raised by the parent, their concern that they may not have the knowledge to adequately respond, and a paucity of research evidence to guide care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812455093">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812455093">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812455093">13</xref></sup> Knowledge of common parental concerns could guide implementation of patient-centered care. We conducted surveys of parents to identify current health-related issues of concern in our community. Our goal was to alert local pediatricians about common parental concerns, so they could be prepared to address them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812455093" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We developed and implemented a survey to assess parents’ health concerns for children and adolescents in their community and parents’ concerns for their own children. The study was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office.</p>
<sec id="section6-0009922812455093">
<title>Survey Tools</title>
<p>The survey was developed by the authors, based in part on the University of Michigan C S Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.med.umich.edu/mott/npch/about/index.htm">http://www.med.umich.edu/mott/npch/about/index.htm</ext-link>). This Web-based survey measures national opinion and priorities regarding major health care issues and trends for US children using a representative national sample of about 2000 US households.</p>
<p>We modified this 20-item instrument (with permission) to reflect local concerns, adding 10 items to the list of possible health problems nominated by local experts and community pediatricians after reviewing the original survey. These included allergies (including food allergies), diabetes, HIV/AIDS, lead poisoning, marijuana use, overuse of antibiotics, poverty, risks associated with immunization shots, sport- and play-related injuries, and swine flu. We also modified the wording of 8 items for clarity: environmental pollution, heavy drinking of alcohol, illegal drug use, lack of exercise, motor vehicle accidents, neighborhood safety (including assaults and homicides), obesity, and sexually transmitted infections other than HIV/AIDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, etc). Respondents used a 4-point categorical scale to indicate how much of a problem (large, medium, small, or not a problem) they felt each item on the 30-item list was for children and adolescents in their community. Items rated as a large or medium problem were considered an important problem.</p>
<p>In addition, parents identified the top 3 health concerns for their own children by age group (&lt;2 years old, 2-5 years old, 6-11 years old, and 12-17 years old) by responding to an open-ended question (eg, “What are the top 3 health concerns for your own children under 2 years old?”). The final parent survey had a reading level of 6.3.</p>
<p>The survey also collected demographic information and was paper based, self-administered, and anonymous and took about 10 minutes to complete.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812455093">
<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>Parents (or legal guardians) attending the office of a pediatrician in our practice-based research network, Washington University Pediatric and Adolescent Ambulatory Research Consortium, when a research assistant (RA) was present were eligible to participate in the study. Parents were approached by the RA in the waiting room and invited to participate. Parents were not approached if they were immediately called to see the physician, were preoccupied with an administrative task, or if the RA was busy with another parent. Unaccompanied minors and pregnant women with no children were ineligible as were parents who could not speak English or had previously completed the survey. Most parents finished the survey prior to seeing the physician. Of 31 participants who did not have enough time to complete the survey in the office, 13 returned the completed survey in the provided stamped, addressed envelope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812455093">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics are reported for respondents and for demographic subgroups, defined after comparing the distribution of responses. These groups included African American versus all other races, Medicaid versus work-related insurance, less than a bachelor’s degree versus a bachelor’s degree or higher educational attainment, and family income &lt;$60 000 per year versus ≥$60 000 per year. Meaningful differences in important problems between subgroups were defined as differences of at least 20%. Parents’ responses to the open-ended questions were coded by 2 of the authors (EL and JMG). Potential categories were identified from a review of the survey responses and the Bright Futures Guidelines. A total of 9 discrete categories were identified, and parents’ responses were coded by consensus. The categories included mental health (eg, self-esteem, behavioral problems, bullying, depression, and suicide), food/activity (eg, healthy nutrition, obesity, eating disorders, and lack of exercise), environment (eg, environmental pollution, lead, food safety, and poverty), risky behaviors (eg, alcohol, smoking, illicit drug use, sexually transmitted diseases [STDs], and teen pregnancy), safety (eg, accidents, car and pedestrian safety, sport-related injuries, neighborhood safety, and Internet safety), development (eg, normal growth and development, social health, and healthy sexuality), parenting (eg, sleep problems and education), oral health (eg, thumb sucking and oral hygiene), and diseases (all diseases mentioned specifically; eg, acute infectious diseases, allergies, asthma, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). Summary statistics are presented as means and standard deviations or medians and ranges for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. We used Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact test to compare responses among subgroups. A probability of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 (2-tailed) was used to establish statistical significance. All statistical analyses were done using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC)</p>

<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>In-office recruitment for the parent survey occurred in 12 practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812455093">Figure 1</xref>). The RA was at each practice for a median of 3.9 days (range = 3.5-4.5 days) from June 8, 2009, to September 4, 2009. Of 1278 eligible parents, 1119 (88%) completed the survey with a median of 93 surveys completed at each practice (range = 40 to 170). Respondents were from throughout the St Louis metropolitan area: 85% were the child’s mother, 24% were African American, 60% had a college degree or higher, and 22% used Medicaid insurance for their child (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812455093">Table 1</xref>). The noncompletion rate for each item in the survey ranged from 2% to 6% (median 4%).</p>

<title>Health Concerns for Their Own Children</title>
<p>Parents’ health concerns for their own children varied considerably by age group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812455093">Table 2</xref>). Across all age groups, many parents had concerns for their child’s mental health, healthy nutrition, healthy growth and development, and safety. Many parents were also concerned about specific diseases—most often allergies, asthma, acute infectious diseases, and ADHD. Concerns about mental health increased with the child’s age. Parents of 2- to 5-year-olds were concerned about behavior problems (2.9%), parents of 6- to 11-year-olds were concerned about bullying (10%), and parents of 12- to 17-year-olds were concerned about depression (10.7%). The frequency of parental concern about obesity and lack of exercise increased across the age groups, whereas more parents of young children were concerned about environmental pollution. Few parents identified Internet safety as a concern (4.6% of parents of 5- to 11-year-olds and 6.0% of 11- to 17-year-olds), and few parents were concerned about risky behaviors in their adolescent children (13.7% illicit drug use, 11.8% alcohol use, 6% STDs, 4.9% teen pregnancy, and 3.2% tobacco use).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We asked almost 1200 parents from various demographic groups about their health concerns for children. We found considerable variation for the items parents identified as important health problems for children in their community and as concerns for their own children. These findings support the need for health care providers to ask each parent to identify their specific concerns in order to promote a more patient-centered approach to well-child care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812455093">3</xref></sup> Although strongly recommended in the Bright Futures Guidelines, a recent study found that clinicians did not ask open-ended questions to solicit parental concerns in almost 25% of well-child visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812455093">14</xref></sup> Expanding the scope of the well-child visit with a more patient-centered approach may improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812455093">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812455093">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents are more likely to follow advice from their pediatrician than advice from other sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812455093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812455093">16</xref></sup> To provide the most relevant and helpful advice, pediatricians must both be aware of parents’ concerns and be prepared to address them. Our findings suggest that pediatricians need to be prepared to adequately address psychosocial concerns that reflect recent social and environmental changes such as obesity, lack of physical exercise, depression, violence, and Internet safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812455093">17</xref></sup>—problems identified as significant causes of morbidity by many parents in this study. Although they are common, psychosocial concerns are unlikely to be raised by the parent during an office visit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812455093">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812455093">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812455093">18</xref></sup> and are less likely to be raised than traditional topics by the pediatrician, especially if time is short.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812455093">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812455093">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812455093">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812455093">19</xref></sup> A parent questionnaire could be used to alert parents that their pediatrician can provide help with psychosocial issues and to identify any issues that are a particular concern,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812455093">3</xref></sup> but pediatricians may need additional education and an established referral process to feel comfortable dealing with behavioral, developmental, or psychological issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812455093">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings also suggest that parents may fail to identify significant health risks for their own children. Some items commonly identified as an important problem for children in the community were not reported as concerns for their own children. For example, there was a 6-fold decrease in the frequency with which parents identified Internet safety and lack of physical exercise as a concern for their children compared with the same being a concern for children in the community. A detailed enquiry by the pediatrician may be needed to ascertain if physical activity is adequate and Internet access is being monitored. Similarly, there was a 3-fold decrease in the frequency with which parents identified risky behaviors such as alcohol, tobacco, and drug use and unsafe sexual activity as concerns for their own adolescent children compared with the same being a concern for adolescents in their community. Pediatricians could help parents guide their teen to make healthy choices by raising these issues for discussion at an earlier age but may need additional training to enhance their comfort with and effectiveness in discussing these issues with parents and adolescent patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812455093">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812455093"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812455093">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Items identified as important problems for children in the community may represent unmet needs and opportunities to improve care. The significant morbidity associated with asthma and allergies identified as important problems by parents in this study could be reduced by increased use of effective, safe treatments that are readily available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812455093">23</xref></sup> Establishing a therapeutic partnership by inviting parents to share their specific concerns is a strategy supported by national guidelines and by community pediatricians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812455093">5</xref></sup> and may increase treatment effectiveness. Meeting the needs of disadvantaged families may be more difficult for providers. Mothers from disadvantaged groups in this study identified neighborhood safety and violence at school as important problems for children in their community. Language barriers, low health literacy, and problems with provider-patient communication may make it difficult for these mothers to raise their concerns with the provider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812455093">24</xref></sup> Providers too may be reluctant to raise these issues as A result of lack of training and time pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812455093">25</xref></sup> Although pediatricians cannot alleviate these problems, they could enlist the help of community agencies to provide needed services and advocate for safe environments for their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812455093">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812455093">26</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section14-0009922812455093">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations to our findings must be noted. Altho ugh the practices used for the survey represented all sociodemographic groups in the St Louis area, the concerns identified in this survey may still be local. For example, the prevalence of asthma and allergy is high in the St Louis area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812455093">27</xref></sup> Findings may also have been influenced by the seasonality of the survey (the summer months). However, our survey could easily be replicated to identify local concerns.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Concerns and problems identified by parents may differ from those routinely addressed at well-child visits. Health problems and concerns for children identified by parents are varied and are likely to change over time, influenced by social changes, the emergence of new health threats, and the media. Variations in parents’ concerns support the need for the health care provider to ask the parent to identify their specific concerns during each visit. Identifying common parental concerns can inform the primary care provider about topics that they need to be prepared to discuss at well-child visits and issues that may need a more detailed enquiry. Common concerns may reflect unmet needs and help guide the development of targeted interventions and policies to improve health.</p>
