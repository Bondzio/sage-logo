<abstract>
<p>The purpose of the study is to assess the relationship between timing of adolescent development and risk factors for suicide. Nationally representative data from the Add Health survey were used. The relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, known risk factors, and physical developmental timing and cognitive developmental style to suicide attempt was assessed. Depression was a risk factor for suicide attempts in both 9th and 11th grade. Other risk factors differed. Use of illegal drugs, homosexual orientation, using public assistance, and physical development were the important risk factors for ninth graders. For 11th graders, sexual abuse, being in counseling, and being of “other” race or ethnicity (mainly Asian or Native American) were risk factors. The cognitive development variable of using a systematic problem-solving method was protective for 11th graders. Recognizing that risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts change over time and with developmental timing of puberty is an important factor for suicide prevention strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Suicide is one of the leading causes of death for adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18 and is, therefore, a major public health issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512461010">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512461010">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>). School-based clinicians are often the first to identify signs of suicidality and comprehensive school-based programs have been shown to be successful in reducing adolescent suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512461010">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Suicide-related behaviors are an ongoing and major issue in adolescent health. Many more teens attempt suicide than complete one and attempts are related to completions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512461010">Gould, Greenberg, Velting, &amp; Shaffer, 2003</xref>). In 2009, the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) found that 19.8% of students had seriously considered attempting suicide while 6.3% of students had attempted suicide one or more times during the previous 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512461010">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Risk and protective factors increase and decrease the possibility that suicide or a suicide attempt will occur. The risk and protective factors for adolescent suicide attempts are well documented in the literature. Factors such as a history of prior suicide attempts, having been a victim of violence, having depressive symptoms, using alcohol and drugs, female gender, and sexual orientation have all shown associations with increases in suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512461010">Borowsky, Ireland, &amp; Resnick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512461010">Dube et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512461010">Gould et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512461010">Nock et al., 2008</xref>). Having a friend who attempted suicide increased the risk of suicidal thoughts for both girls and boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>). Having had sexual intercourse has been shown to be a risk factor in very young teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512461010">Afifi, Cox, &amp; Katz, 2007</xref>). Goldston et al. showed that adolescent suicide attempts are associated with specific psychiatric diagnoses and that some of these diagnoses change over the course of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512461010">Goldston et al., 2009</xref>). The relationship between suicide attempts and major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorder increased in later adolescence and young adulthood while the relationship with conduct disorders decreased.</p>
<p>There are also protective factors that reduce the risk of suicide, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts. An adolescent’s perception of connectedness to parents and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512461010">Borowsky et al., 2001</xref>) is a protective factor for boys and girls. Emotional well-being is protective for girls as is having high self-esteem, while grade point average is protective for boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512461010">Borowsky et al., 2001</xref>). Friendship also has protective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>). For girls, being in a school-dense network of friends (friends who are friends with each other) is protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that risk factors for adolescent suicidal behavior vary by age and physical developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512461010">Brent, Baugher, Bridge, Chen, &amp; Chiappetta, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512461010">Hacker, Suglia, Fried, Rappaport, &amp; Cabral, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512461010">Lewinsohn, Rohde, &amp; Seeley, 1993</xref>). Suicide risk may also vary with psychological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512461010">Cha &amp; Nock, 2009</xref>) and by sex within specific age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512461010">Boeninger, Masyn, Feldman, &amp; Conger, 2010</xref>). Specifically, the patterns of risk for boys and girls are different across adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512461010">Boeninger et al., 2010</xref>). Developmental differences in risk factors related to suicide may provide important insight for interventions and focus gatekeeper trainings on particular risks at different phases of development. While there is literature on developmental differences in risk behavior and, in particular, on the risk of depression related to suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512461010">Benjet &amp; Hernandez-Guzman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512461010">Vogt, 2007</xref>), there is no literature that has specifically examined developmental differences in suicide attempt risk factors in a longitudinal study from either a physical or cognitive perspective.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified differences in suicide attempt risk factors for 9th and 11th graders in a cross-sectional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512461010">Hacker et al., 2006</xref>). These grades were chosen because, based on typical 9th-grade age levels, more youth would be in early or middle adolescence in 9th grade compared to those in 11th grade. However, in order to validate our findings and assess risk factors in a longitudinal sample, we sought to replicate the analysis in a national sample using a prospective, cohort study methodology. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) provides such a sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512461010">National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study was designed to assess the relationship between pubertal timing of adolescent development in 9th and 11th graders and risk factors for suicide. The Add Health longitudinal cohort was used to determine whether these factors change through adolescence and whether they are consistent with developmental cognitive and physical changes. The results of this study will help identify risk factors for suicide attempts that are age specific and can inform school-based prevention programs, clinical practice, and policy.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1059840512461010">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study used Add Health data from Waves I, II, and III in the In-Home, In-School, and Parent surveys. Add Health was designed to provide a nationally representative sample of adolescents. The In-School Survey of Add Health Wave I was a stratified, random sample of all U.S. high schools that included an 11th grade. Students were surveyed in 1994 and 1995 and asked sociodemographic questions, household structure, risk behaviors, and health status among other questions. An In-Home sample of 27,000 adolescents constituted the second phase of Wave I and included a Parent Survey. In Wave II, the In-Home sample was interviewed again, but parents were not reinterviewed. The In-Home Survey used computer-assisted interviewing (ACASI) technology because of the sensitive nature of the health behavior questions. Wave III reinterviewed Wave I respondents and included a 1,507 sample of their partners. This study used data from Waves I, II, and III in the In-Home survey and the Wave I Parent Survey. The longitudinal nature of the Add Health study allowed us to use the risk factors from Wave I and the outcome data from Waves II and III.</p>

<sec id="section5-1059840512461010">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The outcome in this study was any self-reported suicide attempt in either Wave 2 or Wave 3. The question asked was “During the past 12 months how many times did you actually attempt suicide?” It was recoded as a dichotomous variable (0 = never, 1 = 1 or more times).</p>
<p>Risk factors analyzed in this study were derived from the factors that were found to be important in our previous cross-sectional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512461010">Hacker et al., 2006</xref>) as well as from known risk factors identified in the literature. In our prior study, the risk factors for ninth graders were current cigarette smoking, having problems with alcohol, worrying about depression, having been raped, familial verbal abuse, and gender. For 11th graders, these variables were worrying about depression, being threatened in school, using illicit drugs, having been a victim of sexual abuse, and having one or more friends who have/have not attempted suicide (as a protective factor), as well as gender. We also examined a variety of sociodemographic characteristics as well as risk factors such as family mobility, use of weapons, gang membership, experience of abuse and violence, sexual orientation and experience, criminal history, and drug and alcohol use derived from factors found in our previous study as well as found in the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840512461010">
<title>Sociodemographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Several sociodemographic factors from Wave 1 were included in the analytic models as potential confounding variables. These variables were gender, race/Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic other, Hispanic), age (range 13–16 for 9th graders, mean = 14.86, standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) = 0.64; for 11th graders, range 16–18, mean = 16.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.60), U.S. born, and receipt of public assistance (based on the respondent’s answer to whether her or his mother was on welfare).</p>
<p>In assessing the effects of suboptimal education, data on special education and grade retention were combined in order to reduce missing data. These variables were tested and there were no differences in predictive results for suicide risk. Questions on the survey asked for the parent/guardian’s report that the child received special education (from the Parent In-Home Survey) or the respondent’s self-report of having repeated a grade. The parent/guardian’s marital status was also taken from the Parent/Guardian In-Home Survey. The categories for this variable used in the analyses were married/widowed, single, never married, separated, or divorced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840512461010">
<title>Mental Health Characteristics</title>
<p>In addition to our primary outcome questions about suicide, two mental health questions were used: Whether the respondent was in counseling and whether she or he was depressed in the past 7 days. While not a measure of depression per se, these questions are associated with risk behavior for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512461010">Goldston et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840512461010">
<title>Developmental Measures</title>
<p>In addition to age and grade, gender-specific measures of physical development were utilized. Female physical development was based on respondents’ self-reported age at first period. Age 10 to 16 was considered “normal.” Ages outside that range were considered delayed or matured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512461010">Marshall &amp; Tanner, 1969</xref>). Self-perception of physical development for females was based on the question of how physically mature they are compared to other girls their age––normal, delayed, or matured. We grouped together responses outside of the norm––either early or late. Menarche is a common method of measuring pubertal status for females and this type of self-report of pubertal status has been found to be reliable and valid in other studies for both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512461010">Petersen, Crocket, Richards, &amp; Boxer, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Male physical development was based on the respondent’s self-reported age when their voice changed. Ages greater than or equal to 13 were considered “normal” compared to those who matured later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512461010">Marshall &amp; Tanner, 1970</xref>). Self-perception of physical development for males was based on question about how physically mature they are compared to other boys their age. The categories analyzed for physical development were normal, delayed, and matured. Responses outside of the norm both early and late were combined and compared to normal development. In boys, voice change is often used as a pubertal measure and self-report is reliable and valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512461010">Petersen et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The Add Health data set also allowed us to create cognitive development variables based on youths’ responses to questions about how they process information, specifically, whether they respond through strategizing and organizing information or through responding to their gut feelings, that is, more impulsively. The specific statements used were, “When you have a problem to solve, one of the first things you do is get as many facts about the problem as possible” and “When making decisions, you usually go with your “gut feeling” without thinking too much about the consequences of each alternative.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840512461010">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>All descriptive statistics, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were weighted and incorporated the design effects as appropriate for this complex sample survey using SUDAAN 10.0. According to Add Health documentation, survey “weights are calculated for four main reasons: (1) to allow the sample totals to serve as estimates of population totals; (2) to compensate for differences in selection probabilities across different members of a sample; (3) to compensate for differences in response rates across different subgroups of the sample; and (4) to adjust for chance fluctuations of the composition of the sample from the composition of the population as a whole” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512461010">National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 2012b</xref>). In the tables presenting descriptive statistics, unweighted sample sizes and weighted percentages are presented.</p>
<p>We created separate analysis data sets for the 9th and 11th graders in order to identify and separate risk factors at each developmental stage. In bivariate analyses, risk factors for suicide among youth in each grade were identified. Through these analyses, we identified known risk factors such as race, homosexual attraction, gang membership, illegal drug use, sexual abuse by a guardian, counseling status, failing in school, depression, immigrant status, parents marital status, smoking status, drinking habits, and marijuana use. We then performed multiple logistic regression analyses in which variables were selected for inclusion in the model using the following criteria: (a) statistically significant at the .05 level or (b) odds ratio (OR) ≥3.0 or ≤ 0.33 or (c) of substantive interest based on prior literature or theory (cognitive and physical development variables). Analyses were also stratified by gender to assess whether gender interactions should be considered. In addition to analyzing individual risk factors in our models, a variable was created that represented a sum of all of the indicator variables for the risk factors in order to assess the cumulative effects of multiple risk factors. For ninth graders, this variable had a range = 0–4, mean = 0.94, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.91. For 11th graders, it had a range = 0–7, mean = 2.64, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.21.</p>

Due to the complex sample survey design, the tables show weighted percentages along with unweighted counts. Being born in the United States (OR = 10.50, 95% confidence interval, CI: [1.35, 81.71]) and receiving public assistance (OR = 4.03, 95% CI: [1.78, 9.13]) were positively associated with prevalence of suicide attempt among ninth graders. Among 11th graders, Black race was identified as protective (OR = 0.33, 95%CI: [0.10, 1.12]).</p>

<p>In bivariate analyses, 9th- and 11th-grade students had several risk factors that showed elevated risks. Among 9th- and 11th-grade students who were ever a member of a gang, reported ever being sexually abused by a guardian, ever smoked, ever used marijuana, had failing grades, were in counseling, or were depressed in the past seven days were more likely to have had a suicide attempt. For 9th- and 11th-grade students, the cognitive development variables emerged as protective factors (9th OR = 0.61, 95%CI: [0.39, 0.96]; 11th OR = 0.38, 95%CI: [0.18, 0.79]).</p>
<p>Although several common variables arose as risk factors for both 9th- and 11th-grade students in bivariate analysis, differences also emerged. For ninth-grade males, students whose voice matured “on time” (OR = 16.36, 95% CI: [3.23, 82.87]) were more likely to have had a suicide attempt, while for ninth-grade females, beginning menstruating “on time” had a protective effect (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.75]). Among 11th-grade students, those who reported physical abuse by a guardian (OR = 3.30, 95% CI: [1.41, 7.72]) were more likely to attempt suicide.</p>
<p>In multivariate analyses, physical, but not cognitive development variables predicted suicide attempt in ninth graders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840512461010">Table 4</xref>). Among girls, those who matured early or late compared to those who matured “on time” were over four times more likely to attempt suicide (OR = 3.81, 95%CI: [1.61, 9.69]). However among boys, those whose voices did not mature by age 14 were less likely to attempt suicide (OR = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.25]). Other predictors in the ninth-grade model that showed elevated risk of suicide attempts included the socioeconomic status (SES), proxy of mother’s use of public assistance (OR = 3.56, 95% CI 1.65, 7.71); illegal drug use (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: [1.06, 3.49]); homosexual attraction (OR = 3.32, 95% CI: [1.32, 8.33]), and depression (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: [1.45, 4.81]).</p>

<p>In the 11th-grade model, the cognitive development proxy variable of strategizing to solve problems had a protective affect (OR = 0.41, 95% CI [0.17, 0.96]), while physical development variables were no longer predictors of suicide risk. Other predictors in the 11th-grade model included being in the “Other” race/ethnicity category. This category included Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and youth identifying themselves as multiracial (OR = 3.20, 95% CI [1.17, 8.76]). In addition, sexual abuse (OR = 9.24, 95% CI: [3.96, 21.57]); depression (OR = 2.65, 95% CI [1.01, 6.91]); and receiving counseling (OR = 2.65, 95% CI [1.01, 6.91]) were also predictive of suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840512461010">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This longitudinal study identified developmental differences in suicide attempt risk factors between 9th and 11th graders consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512461010">Hacker et al., 2006</xref>). Depression is a risk factor across adolescence. We hypothesized, based on our previous work that risk factors for suicide change from physical developmental factors to cognitive developmental factors as adolescents’ age and the findings from this study provide some support for this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The proportion of adolescents in our study who had attempted suicide was consistent with other studies (7.1% of females and 4% of males in the 9th grade had attempted suicide, while 2.2% of females and 3.7% of males in the 11th grade had attempted suicide). Also consistent with other studies, girls and students on public assistance were generally more likely to attempt suicide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512461010">Bearman &amp; Moody, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512461010">Borowsky, Ireland, &amp; Resnick, 2001</xref>) However, unlike Bearman, friendship was not found to be related to suicide attempts. Study methodology may account for this difference. The current study used a dichotomous variable (yes or no) in analyses while the Bearman study, which focused on suicide and friendships, used a more complex series of questions, including measures of social network position.</p>
<p>After controlling for confounding, use of illegal drugs, homosexual orientation, using public assistance, and physical development were the important risk factors for ninth graders. For 11th graders, having experienced sexual abuse, being in counseling, and being of “Other” race/ethnicity were risk factors for suicide attempts. Asian/Native Americans have been shown to be at high risk in other studies, also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512461010">Gould et al., 2003</xref>). The cognitive development variable of using a systematic problem-solving method was protective. Only depression was an important risk factor for both 9th and 11th grade.</p>
<p>The risk factors for suicide identified in this study are well known and have been identified elsewhere (including previous suicide attempt, depression, psychiatric disorders, accessibility of weapons, drug use, homosexual orientation, being on public assistance, history of sexual abuse, and Native American race; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512461010">Borowsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512461010">Bridge, Goldstein, &amp; Brent, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512461010">Gould et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512461010">Nock et al., 2008</xref>). Cross-sectional studies, including our prior study, have found changes in adolescent risk behavior over adolescence and with pubertal stage, although not necessarily related to suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512461010">Hacker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512461010">Hemphill et al., 2010</xref>). One study assessed age-by-sex trends and found differences between boys and girls in the prevalence of suicide attempts over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512461010">Boeninger et al., 2010</xref>). This study was one of the few that followed young people over time to see whether risk factors persisted and, to our knowledge, none has examined the relationship to pubertal markers as risk factors over time.</p>
<p>In the current study, younger teens tended to have risk factors such as homosexual orientation and illegal drug use, which seemed to dissipate as these teens reached 11th grade. Perhaps more important is that these risk factors were not only consistent with grade level but were also supported by developmental markers. That is, young teens—particularly girls who perceived themselves as early or late developers––were more likely to attempt suicide. The challenges for girls related to their physical appearance are well known in the developmental literature. For example, early onset of menarche has been shown to increase risk behavior in adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512461010">Caspi &amp; Moffitt, 1991</xref>). Girls who develop outside of the “norm” may be uncomfortable with their own development, given their natural inclination to compare themselves to other peers. This developmental profile may put them at higher risk for depression and suicide attempts.</p>
<p>The literature on the effect of pubertal timing in boys is less clear partly because the pubertal milestones are not as clearcut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512461010">Mendle, Brooks-Gunn, Harden, &amp; Graber, 2010</xref>). In our study, younger boys seem to be protected by earlier development. Some studies show that for boys, pubertal tempo, that is the length of time puberty takes, is more important than when it begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512461010">Ge, Conger, &amp; Elder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512461010">Ge, Kim, Conger, Brody, &amp; Simons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512461010">Mendle et al., 2010</xref>). Psychiatric disorders appear to increase with age and for males, conduct disorders increase in later adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512461010">Brent et al., 1999</xref>). The combination of psychiatric disorders and substance use increase the risk for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512461010">Brent et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512461010">Bridge et al., 2006</xref>). While we found that cognitive maturity was protective, as these abilities increase, they can also make a suicide attempt more lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512461010">Brent et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512461010">Bridge et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While most of the 11th graders had likely met their physical developmental milestones, it is at this point that cognitive developmental issues were noted. That is to say, having the ability to problem solve was protective against suicide attempts. In other studies of adolescent risk taking, planning and problem solving have been shown to be associated with safer decision making (safe sex), as well as protective against suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512461010">Cha &amp; Nock, 2009</xref>). Steinberg studied risk, measured by impulsivity, and reward behaviors across the life span from 10 to 30 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512461010">Steinberg, 2010</xref>). He found that reward-seeking behaviors increase from ages 10 to 16 and then decline. It is highest in middle adolescence. Impulse control shows a more gradual increase from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512461010">Steinberg, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings fit with those of the current study in which risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts develop along with the physical and cognitive aspects of a young person’s life. As younger teens, issues of drugs, sexual orientation, and physical presence seem to be important factors whereas for older teens sexual abuse and grades seem to have greater predictive value. Looking at or interpreting how teens develop and how specific risk factors may change is important to understand. Those who care for young people should be aware of these differences and vulnerabilities.</p>
<sec id="section12-1059840512461010">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Strengths of this study include the large, representative sample size from the Add Health study. Also, the longitudinal design allowed us to assess risk factors that preceded suicide attempts. Having the cognitive development and physical development variables along with traditionally known risk factors provided key information on changes over time.</p>
<p>Our prior research examined certain risk factors that were not available in the Add Health questionnaire. These questions included worrying about depression, violence in the neighborhood, violence at home, fights at home, not having enough money, being homeless, family problems with alcohol and drugs, having a family member or close friend who died, being a witness to family violence, being beaten or physically hurt by a nonfamily member, being verbally or emotionally abused, being mistreated due to appearance, and carrying a weapon outside of school.</p>
<p>In addition, there were some missing data on relevant variables in the current analysis sample. However, there were no differences between the missing and nonmissing cases on the suicide attempt outcome variable.</p>
<p>The Add Health study collected data through 2009 (Wave IV), however, the initial waves were collected in the mid-1990s. The data have been very useful for many investigators interested in adolescent health and numerous publications have come from these data. While risk and protective factors for adolescent suicide and suicide attempts have been generally stable, the age of the data from the initial waves makes it possible that temporal changes have occurred over the years and those conclusions from these data may be limited by their age.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Recommendations for School Nursing and School Health Services</title>
<p>Risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts change over time and with developmental timing of puberty based on longitudinal data from a national sample. Given the critical importance of the issue of adolescent suicide, early detection is a key to prevention. School nurses are in a position to identify at risk youth and link them to suicide prevention services. Comprehensive school programs to reduce suicide can be successful. Gatekeeper trainings that help clinicians identify at risk youths and understand when to make referrals have been shown to be effective and should be implemented more broadly for school nurses. Programs should be targeted to the age, sex, and developmental stage of the adolescent.</p>
<p>Systematic identification of risk for suicide is a key to prevention. Understanding the risk factors for suicide and suicide attempts is part of identification. Findings from this study will be useful to school professionals including teachers, school nurses, guidance counselors, and clinicians as a way to distinguish suicidal teens at different points along the developmental path.</p>
<p>Understanding the importance of physical changes for young adolescent girls and the importance of cognitive development for older teens is critical to prevention. While more research is needed to better understand these factors, the knowledge that risk factors vary by age and stage of development is additional information that will be helpful in identifying at risk teens, targeting specific school-based programs, and, potentially, preventing suicide attempts.</p>
