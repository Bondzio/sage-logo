<p>This article analyzes customer reviews of Fareed Zakaria’s best-selling book, <italic>The Post-American World</italic> posted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>. Zakaria’s book explores the emergence of a new world order in which the “rise of the rest,” particularly China and India, threatens the geopolitical dominance of the United States. Drawing on reception studies of print culture, debates over the virtual public sphere, and sponsorship of literacy, our article’s textual analysis of 281 customer reviews offers a window into audience reactions to this public intellectual’s deliberations on the beginning of a possible decentering of America in certain realms of globalization. Our analysis of consumer citizenship in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>’s reviewer space identifies three dominant frameworks or “horizons of expectations” that structured interpretations of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>: readers’ framing of the book as a tool to foster enlightened citizenship, reviewers’ affective rhetoric of nation building, and the impact of Zakaria’s status as an immigrant intellectual on readers’ responses.</p>

<p><italic>The Economist</italic>’s August 21, 2010, issue’s cover story declares “Contest of the Century: As China and India rise in tandem, their relationship will shape world politics.” <italic>The Economist</italic>’s report joins a steady stream of other news accounts and books chronicling the impact of these two developing nations’ unexpected ascent on the global geopolitical order. Paving the way for these debates, journalist and public intellectual Fareed Zakaria’s book <italic>The Post-American World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859913489571">2008</xref>) was among the early pioneers in tackling the implications of these two nations’ changing fortunes for America’s unrivalled position as global hegemon. Soon after its publication, the book received praise and recognition from numerous quarters. Major news outlets including <italic>Newsweek</italic>, the <italic>National Post</italic>, and <italic>The New York Times</italic> published excerpts, positive reviews, and cover stories about the book, and it enjoyed a high-ranking position on such best seller lists as <italic>USA Today</italic>’s Top 150 Best-Selling Books list.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the release of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, concern with America’s future in a globalized world also shaped the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, which was marked by the historic ascendance of Barack Obama. While some conservatives viewed Obama as an ineffectual liberal and a frightening version of a “Muslim Other,” his supporters hoped he could repair the country’s tarnished international image. Not surprisingly then, when a photo of Obama carrying <italic>The Post-American World</italic> went viral on the Internet during the campaign, critics cited the candidate’s endorsement of the book as evidence of his anti-America, pro-Muslim sentiments while supporters referred to the photo as a testament to Obama’s global cosmopolitanism. These polarized reactions to the photo spilled over into the online site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> where readers rate and post public reviews of books. “I decided to read [<italic>The Post-American World</italic>] because I saw that Barack Obama was reading it and I wanted to see what he was thinking about,” says one <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> reviewer. Other reviewers of the book express alarm that Obama was seen reading it, with one disgruntled reviewer commenting, “All I can say is, God help us when the leader of our country fantasizes about the fall of America.” As these comments about Obama indicate, the reviews posted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> present an archive of discourse that contains the opinions of a segment of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s more active readership at a specific moment in America’s history.</p>
<p>In this article, we investigate popular reception to <italic>The Post-American World</italic> and its author by analyzing customer reviews of the book on the popular site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>, which recent analyses have rated as having the “largest global audience among the retail and auction sites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489571">Amazon sites, 2011</xref>). A snapshot of January 2013 web traffic suggests that <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> reached nearly 44% of that month’s American Internet population, estimated at 222 million users (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://comScore.com">comScore.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859913489571">2013</xref>). Our textual analysis of readers’ comments on <italic>The Post-American World</italic> published on this site offers a window into audience reactions to a particular public intellectual’s deliberations on the rise of China and India and to the beginning of a possible decentering of America in certain realms of globalization. In what ways do readers construct the strengths and weaknesses of the book? How do they judge Zakaria’s analysis of America’s position in the shifting terrain of global power? How does the author’s status as an immigrant intellectual become relevant in reviewers’ reception to the book’s premises? In addressing these questions, our article advances the larger project of internationalizing media and cultural studies in the United States, fields that have yet to fulfill their promise of engaging seriously with recent developments wrought by globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859913489571">Abbas &amp; Erni, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> reviews of this particular text are valuable to study because these public forms of expression, posted on the fifth most popular commercial American website based on overall traffic and garnering about 6% to 7% of global Internet users in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913489571">Alexa, n.d</xref>.), have the potential to link readers’ agency as critics to economic transactions <italic>and</italic> to political and cultural ideologies, especially when particular books become the subject of scrutiny. Reviews of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, which cite issues of citizenship, nationalism, and politics, are likely to shape both the purchasing decisions of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> visitors <italic>and</italic> their political attitudes, and in this sense, our article contributes to ongoing considerations of consumer citizenship. Depending on circumstances, readers may be simultaneously interpellated on the site as mass audience and individual person, passive visitor and active agent, market and public, buyer and reviewer, and reader and writer. While consumerism and citizenship were once conceived as distinct and even oppositional entities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859913489571">Banet-Weiser and Lapsansky (2008)</xref> explain that in an era of unbridled global neoliberal capitalism and rapid technological changes, “the divisive separation between the consumer and the citizen no longer holds the same salience in U.S. public culture as it has historically” (p. 1256). Scholars of consumer citizenship probe citizens’ strategic deployment of spending power to promote, boycott, or question political and philanthropic causes and candidates, a practice also known as “voting with one’s dollars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489571">Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859913489571">Canclini, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859913489571">Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0196859913489571">Penney, 2011</xref>). Reviewers on Amazon.com may not engage in open tactics of boycott or direct endorsement and promotion, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859913489571">Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006)</xref> observe, positive book reviews on online retailers result in increased sales of the book at hand and negative reviews decrease sales of a book, with the latter having a stronger effect. In addition, they found that consumers do actually read the lengthy reviews rather than just using the “star” ranking system to make purchase decisions. On a more subtle level, in her study of agency and consumer citizenship in online spaces for youth markets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0196859913489571">Willett (2008)</xref> urges scholars to analyze online activities in ways that can account for corporate power while at the same time recognize “how young people actively engage with the commodities” sold to them (p. 49). Borrowing from the insights of such scholarship, an underlying concern driving this article is: How do ordinary reviewers and readers for such public affairs books as <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, who may participate on Amazon.com as consumers contemplating purchasing decisions, also act as citizens to articulate their beliefs about globalization, nationalism, and geopolitics?</p>
<p>Within this <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> space, the main page for Zakaria’s book <italic>The Post-American World</italic> offers cultural studies scholars a significant site to explore reception to a key text that addresses the rise of China and India. The book was short-listed for the 2009 Lionel Gelber Prize for the best nonfiction book that seeks to deepen public debate on significant global issues. Since its publication in 2008, new editions of the book have been released in 2009 and 2011. Zakaria, <italic>Time</italic> magazine editor, host of CNN’s weekly show <italic>GPS</italic>, and former editor of <italic>Newsweek</italic> International, joins Tom Friedman, Paul Krugman, and others as a member of an elite pantheon of public intellectuals whose opinions carry great weight in news, business, and policy discourses. Zakaria has hosted a number of prominent figures on his CNN show <italic>GPS</italic>, including Bill Gates, George Soros, Wen Jiabao, Barack Obama, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, and Lee Kuan Yew. <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, Zakaria’s second book, further consolidated his reputation as a globalization and foreign affairs expert. In addition, Zakaria’s unique biography as a successful non-White, Indian American, and Muslim immigrant captures many of the currents swirling within the terrain of globalization, some of which include globalization’s historic precipitation of migration from the non-West to the West, its privileging of elite migrants in Western contexts, and the recent mutation of India into a rising power.</p>
<p>The first section of this article summarizes <italic>The Post-American World</italic> and situates our analysis within the arenas of reception studies of print culture, the sponsorship of literacy, and the virtual public sphere. The second section outlines our methodology and describes the archive of customer reviews on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>. The next three sections of analysis explore the dominant themes that structured reviewers’ responses to the book and its author. The concluding section dwells on the possibilities and limits of the informal online customer reviews we study for advancing an understanding of public responses to key texts that address globalization.</p>

<title>Responses to <italic>The Post-American World</italic>: Reception Studies, the Public Sphere, and Literacy</title>
<p>Zakaria organizes <italic>The Post-American World</italic> in seven chapters that take readers on a journey from what he calls the “bipolar duopoly” of the Cold War era to the current uni-multipolar world in which America still leads at the politico-military level, but is losing dominance “in every other dimension” (p. 4). The first chapter introduces the core argument of the book: a new world order is emerging in which the United States will continue to occupy its prime position as world leader, but its relative power will be diminished by the “rise of the rest” (p. 2). Zakaria outlines three power shifts over the last 500 years: from Asia to the West during the Renaissance, from Europe to the United States, and now a decentering of the United States due to the economic expansion of several countries in Asia and Africa (p. 1). Specific chapters in the book attend to the recent rise of China and India, the differences between the two Asian nations, and their prospects for gaining power. After outlining the serious problems the country faces today, Zakaria lists America’s unequivocal strengths: continued investment in scientific and technological innovation (p. 191), a strong higher education system that prizes creativity (p. 193), and a growing population due to immigration (p. 195). In his conclusion, he offers a set of guidelines for America to stay ahead and manage the rise of new nations in Asia (p. 235).</p>
<p>This brief summary of <italic>The Post-American World</italic> provides important context for our project, which explores <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> reviewers’ responses to the book. Book reviews offer a form of discourse that has existed in print for decades, but their recent migration to online spaces and the expansion of their authorship has altered the scope of this discourse. Hence, the conceptual framework we employ here draws from research on community formation in traditional and new media spaces. Analyzing book reviews from the Victorian era, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859913489571">Lundin (1994)</xref> describes reception studies of print culture as an approach that considers the relationship between texts and readers, between what is “being communicated and how it is received” (p. 32). Investigating popular reception to texts takes into account the evaluative role that intermediary interpretive communities of texts play in creating the “horizons of expectations,” or the criteria and norms of taste, that surround, inhibit, or expand the meanings of texts beyond the words and images that populate pages and screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859913489571">Lundin, 1994</xref>). Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489571">Barnett (1999)</xref> draws upon the concept of reading formation—“a set of material and discursive practices which connect readers and texts in specific relations to one another in constituting readers as particular subjects and their texts as objects-to-be-read in particular ways”—to track the responses of different national communities of readers to literary novels (p. 289). This article approaches Amazon.com reviewers as constituting one popular reading formation—informal and voluntary—whose writing subjects articulated their horizons of expectations regarding the book and its author.</p>
<p>From the perspective of cultural studies scholarship on literacy and books, which addresses reading and writing as material and cultural practices, Amazon and other transnational mega-bookstores are not merely global capitalist enterprises that sell books online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859913489571">Trager Bohley, 2011</xref>). Working alongside such middlebrow endeavors as Oprah’s book club (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859913489571">Peck, 2002</xref>), they are also global sponsors of new forms of literacy that have in recent decades rivaled the efforts of traditional sponsors—libraries, churches, and public schools—in their attempts to craft alternative “third spaces” for literary consumption and to guide consumers on how to select, read, and respond to a range of artistic and literary products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859913489571">Brandt, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859913489571">Brandt’s (1998)</xref> concept of “sponsors of literacy” refers to any agents that “enable, support, teach, and model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy—and gain advantage by it in some way” (p. 166). Brandt’s work on sponsors of literacy is useful to consider how textual practices such as reviewing and recommending knowledge commodities online register new forms of literacy. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>’s interpretive community of reviewers offers one possibility to think more deeply about how textual practices emerge and develop and how corporate “sponsoring institutions” enable or stifle new formations of communities and consumer agency (p. 177).</p>
<p>With the advent of the Internet and e-commerce, ordinary customers have begun writing and posting book reviews for public consumption, and such user- and citizen-generated discourse contributes to the creation and distribution of virtual public opinion. When approached this way, our article’s focus of inquiry also intersects with scholarship that explores the relationship between self-publishing practices on the Internet and Habermas’ concept of the public sphere, a term used to describe citizens’ discourses in cafes and other public spaces in 19th century Europe wherein public opinion was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489571">Chaves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859913489571">Fraser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859913489571">Goldberg, 2010</xref>). The public, argumentative, and reasoned qualities of this sphere are meant to “discredit views that cannot withstand critical scrutiny and to assure the legitimacy of those that do” as well as serving as “a vehicle for marshaling public opinion as a political force” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859913489571">Fraser, 2007</xref>, p. 7). We do not succumb to the idealistic argument that the customer review section for books on a commercial site such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> embodies a virtual public sphere, but even with all its constraints, this specific space does present opportunities for readers to propagate opinions and knowledge about citizenship, politics, and leadership in a globalized world. Though the review space itself is not a transnational public sphere, we can build on that theoretical area, as well as on related research on online participation, to explore how the readily accessible voices of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s readers on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> may increase the publicity of political discussions, enhance opportunities for public “stance-taking” on a mass scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859913489571">Myers, 2010</xref>) and expand the heterogeneity of users’ political discussion networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489571">Brundidge, 2010</xref>). In this way, we position Amazon.com as a potential “mediascape” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489571">Appadurai, 2003</xref>) that allows ordinary people to voice their opinions on texts that tackle major global issues, and hence provides scholars the opportunity to gauge public opinion on such topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0196859913489571" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To investigate the contours of reception to <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, we conducted a qualitative textual analysis of 281 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> reviews of the book posted over 2 years, between its April 2008 release and July of 2010. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> utilizes a star rating system, with five stars signifying most favorable and one star registering as most negative. The average <italic>Post-American World</italic> customer rating was four out of five stars, corresponding with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859913489571">Chevalier and Mayzlin’s (2006)</xref> finding that online book reviews trend toward the positive. The book received 148 five-star ratings (53%), 76 four-star ratings (27%), 29 three-star ratings (10%), 13 two-star ratings (5%) and 15 one-star ratings (5%). The length of the reviews varied from 15 to 2,500 words. The book’s reviewers (as indicated by names) were overwhelmingly male (82%), 80% of reviewers disclosed a location, and 90% of the reviewers who identified a location appeared to be writing from the United States.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>’s corporate “gatekeeping” practices may impose constraints on the kind of interpretive community that gains a voice in its book review space and hence on the site’s potential to act as a public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489571">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859913489571">Shoemaker et al, 2008</xref>). The corporation’s strategic positioning of the link for customer reviews, which appears at the top of the page beneath a book’s title, may signal the importance of customer reviews to potential buyers. The retailer allows <italic>only</italic> customers who have already purchased items on the site to post reviews. Hence, the demographics of the community formed in the book review space could mirror Amazon.com’s older, educated, and upper-middle and middle-class customer population, with more than one quarter being over 50 years old and 57% earning over US$60,000 a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0196859913489571">Tice, 2010</xref>). The five-star rating system can limit the range of possible evaluations. Review guidelines state that both positive and negative reviews are welcome, yet editors reserve the right to delete profanity or “obscene and distasteful content;” thus, our analysis is limited to only those reviews that ultimately evaded censorship. The organization also states that it reserves the right to remove reviews that are “written for compensation” or by “persons with a financial interest in the product or a directly competing product,” but there is no way to guarantee that Amazon.com adheres to these principles.</p>
<p>Issues of verifiable identity and authenticity become particularly relevant when we examine the authorship of content in commercial online spaces. Our analysis takes a more postmodern rather than positivist approach to the virtual texts posted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>—one that does not discount or dismiss the numerous opinions and comments we encounter online simply because they are disembodied or there is a chance that they may be fake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859913489571">Carter, 2011</xref>). A <italic>New York Times</italic> investigative article documents the growing phenomenon of authors hiring writers to produce disingenuous online book reviews, and a data-mining expert quoted in this report notes that it is impossible to separate genuine customer reviews from the concocted reviews of marketers, retailers, or hired writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489571">Streitfeld, 2012</xref>). We acknowledge readily that the “purity” and “integrity” of the public opinion expressed within <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s reading formation cannot be guaranteed. While our lack of information on the authenticity of the data and its creators is a concern, we also want to note that the extensive commentary, the sheer quantity of details and facts cited from the book, the diversity and nuance in the opinions, and the polarized reactions to the book suggest to us that ordinary readers of <italic>The Post-American World</italic> did earn some representation in this public space. Moreover, concerns about authenticity do not affect the reality that these testimonials, which offer the “illusion of truth,” are published and archived on a major retail site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489571">Streitfeld, 2012</xref>), awaiting readership from the millions of daily visitors to Amazon.com. When we approach the customer reviews as texts that contribute to semiotic discourse on the book’s content, this interpretive community’s collective archive of online voices does produce a “public” if the term public “connotes ideas of citizenship, commonality, and things not private but accessible and observable by all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859913489571">Papacharissi, 2002</xref>, p. 10).</p>
<p>Our inductive methodological process follows the guidelines for thematic analysis and the constant comparison technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859913489571">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859913489571">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859913489571">Wimmer &amp; Dominick, 2006</xref>), which emphasize an organic and systematic approach to discovering reoccurring patterns of meaning in texts. Our analysis of reception to <italic>The Post-American World</italic> privileges overarching <italic>patterns</italic> of meaning rather than the systematic linking of author identities to individual reviews. After a “long preliminary soak” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859913489571">Hall, 1975</xref>, p. 15) in the data during which each author closely read all reviews and coded for a long list of initial categories of meaning across the spectrum of ratings, we reread the reviews and collapsed small categories to form three analytical themes that were relatively distinct, yet encompassed diverse meanings: the utility of the book as a teaching tool to foster enlightened citizenship, the affective rhetoric of nation building, and reactions to Zakaria’s status as an immigrant intellectual.</p>

<title>Valuable Lessons, Serious Shortcomings: The <italic>Post-American World</italic> as a Teaching Tool</title>
<p>In evaluating <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, many of the four- and five-star reviewers contemplate the book’s most worthy and valuable lessons for readers. For some reviewers, the book’s chapters on the spread of globalization to China and India were “insightful” and “educational” because they illuminated distant and foreign cultures. One reader writes:

<p>Zakaria . . . offers an amazingly succinct analysis of [China and India] delving into the geography, social history, economics and culture of each region. These chapters are invaluable in introducing these global “players” to the reader as they are presented in such a vivid, complete and human way that you come away from the book with a much greater “sense” of the regions and will feel a stronger familiarity with and sympathy toward these cultures even if you have never traveled to these places.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some four- and five-star reviewers, who title their reviews with such persuasive headlines as “Handbook for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century” and “Excellent perspective on the new world order,” extract, highlight, and explain new information on China and India gleaned from the book, including trade and economic data, Confucianism’s and Hinduism’s influences on foreign policy, British colonial legacies, and nationalist politics. Several reviewers praise the book for its lessons about the <italic>differences</italic> between the two nations, such as one who writes: “Zakaria helps you understand what Westernization has meant to world growth and how the different paths of China and India have resulted in totally different outcomes and diplomatic/political alternatives for us.” Several other reviewers acknowledge the didactic qualities of Zakaria’s historical approach, noting particularly the author’s comparisons between Great Britain and America. One comment exemplifies the spirit of this strand of critique: “If there was ever a vindication for the worn out cliché about the value of understanding history or being doomed to repeat it, this book is it.”</p>
<p>Other reviewers promote a more expanded role for the book as a collective instructional tool to improve the caliber of democracy. Adopting an evangelistic tone, these reviewers recommend the book as a source of essential knowledge on globalization for politicians who wish to steer America in the right direction, declaring it as “required,” “commanded,” and “compulsory” reading for all elected officials. Once again, tying the book into the 2008 American presidential elections, one reviewer said “[Zakaria’s] final chapter giving policy guidelines . . . is one I hope presidential candidates will read before November.” These responses mirror reviewers’ aforementioned reactions to the photo of then Senator Obama with the book. Some reviewers extend the usefulness of the book to a broader base of ordinary citizens who want to make informed decisions in an election year. Reviewers declare that the book “should definitely be read by voters getting ready to choose a President” and “read by every thinking American.” Other reviewers advocate for the book’s use in college classes as required reading that would prepare the future generation of American leaders to handle the vicissitudes of globalization. As reviewers urge readers to purchase and read <italic>The Post-American World</italic> in order to become knowledgeable voters and leaders, the articulations in this space begin to approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859913489571">Banet-Weiser and Lapsansky’s (2008)</xref> formulations of consumer citizenship.</p>
<p>Going beyond enumerating the educational merits of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, users also transform the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> review space into their own discursive “pulpits” from which they sermonized on the book’s shortcomings. In doing this, ordinary readers harnessed the reviewer space to promote their own grassroots versions of literacy on the changing global economy. Four- and five-star reviewers take Zakaria to task for his neoliberal promotion of population growth and modernization in emerging markets as a panacea for curing the ills of capitalist economies in the West. One reviewer endorses several others’ concerns when he cautions readers about the consequences of approaching rising Indian and Chinese populations as consumers for multinational products and services: “[Zakaria’s] focus on population growth as a requirement for continued economic success falls short of acknowledging that we are nearing the breaking point when there won’t be enough resources (clean water, food, living space) to go around.” When these few reviewers engage one another in this reasoned and deliberative way, it appears that <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s reception space has simulated to some degree the discursive aspects of a democratic public sphere. Other issues that reviewers flag as oversights for potential readers of <italic>The Post-American World</italic> include American students’ weaknesses in math and science and low standardized testing scores, the “devastation” of rural America and the country’s manufacturing sector, and the prohibitive costs of higher education for poor citizens. In these ways, numerous reviewers seize the opportunity to raise their fellow readers’ consciousness about the hidden role that class privilege plays in shaping what they see as Zakaria’s elitist vision of America’s future.</p>

<title>The Affective Rhetoric of Nation Building and American Exceptionalism</title>
<p>The future status and power of a vulnerable America surfaced as a strong theme in <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s reading formation on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>. On analyzing the positive reviews, we discerned two different positions, one praising the book for its devotion to the project of ensuring America’s continued success and another commending the author for candidly pointing out America’s flaws. The book itself frames America as uniquely positioned to serve as a global leader, tapping subtly into the historic idea of American exceptionalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859913489571">Mingst (2003)</xref> defines the concept in the following manner:
<disp-quote>
<p>American exceptionalism is rooted in the notion that America is special. Its history of being one of the first to shake off the mantle of colonialism to forge a federal democracy, its longstanding political experiment with democracy, its vibrant and successful capitalist economic system, its principles and values (individualism, equality), and more recently, its unique role as defender of these values—these are the bases of American exceptionalism (p. 84).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our analysis finds that both positive and negative reviews of the book foreground and amplify Zakaria’s themes of American exceptionalism. One stream of these comments focuses on how the world <italic>needs</italic> a strong America, as exemplified in this five-star review:
<disp-quote>
<p>Those interested in understanding America’s place in the world-past, present, and future-would do well to read [<italic>The Post-American World</italic>] carefully. The world, after all, needs an America-embodying the free spirit and sense of adventure we have always taken for granted. That is, the author concludes, this country’s real role in the world-and the reason that most people across the Earth still look to the United States with good will.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these patriotic reviewers, a strong America is defined in several ways. First, as the Statue of Liberty promises, America is a collector of the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Repeating this sentimental opinion, another reviewer comments, “One great measure which should never be overlooked is . . . an unending desire for people to “come to America.” Where else, and when else has that ever been so?” Another equally patriotic commentator points out that Zakaria crafts America as an exceptional ideoscape, that is, as a nation that has spearheaded the successful global spread of its ideals: “The emerging global culture of the late-20th century is distinctly American. It has all the hallmarks of U.S. middle-class consumer society. It embodies the aspirations of the American dream—upward social and economic mobility.”</p>
<p>While these reviews are filled with hopeful optimism that America can stay strong, a murkier side of American exceptionalism emerged here in the form of hostile and ethnocentric colonial discourse on China and India. A host of reviewers, primarily in the one- or two-star rating levels, found it simply ludicrous that these “backward” countries could ever pose a threat to America’s superior power. Such reviewers belittle India, China, and other emerging nations, explaining their lack of capacity for technological progress (“except body shopping”) and primitive religious and cultural values that hinder the spread of human rights, science, and democracy. Such racialized commentary reinstates the troubling and hierarchical center (metropole)-periphery (marginality) binary of 19th century colonial discourse, according to which Europe/western civilization was home to rational thinking, orderly progress, science, and modernity, while superstition, backwardness, barbarism, stasis, and chaos characterized non-Western cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0196859913489571">Schneider, 2001</xref>). Reviewers within this category also view Zakaria as delusional, as illustrated by a one-star reviewer who writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The most outlandish assumption made by the book is that the US will no longer be a dominant force in world politics, being replaced by India and China. India? With its dilapidated airports, crumbling roads, vast slums and impoverished villages. The India . . . containing several Nigerias within it? India with 300 million people living on less than one dollar per day? India, home to 40% of the world’s poor and the country with the second highest population of HIV-positive people. That India is going to be the country to take over the world? Huh? India, whose population goes down to a river to bathe? Yea, right, they are going to take over the world. Give me a break!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As we’ve demonstrated, American exceptionalism—at moderate and extreme ends of the spectrum—is a recurring theme in this archive, delivered through both sentimental and dismissive rhetoric. Not all reviewers take this position however. In fact, a second strand of engaged commentary warns readers to <italic>only</italic> read the book if they were willing to take a good, hard look at America’s promises <italic>and</italic> pitfalls. In this way, reviewers actually suggest that Zakaria’s book may serve as an antidote to <italic>unchecked</italic> American exceptionalism. These reviewers applaud Zakaria for his honest evaluation of where and how America has failed, with one reviewer recommending the book only to those readers willing to “see the warts and disappointments, along with the beauty and promise of America.” Taking a similar stance, a five-star reviewer, who is grateful to the author for encouraging an isolationist America to participate in multilateralism, writes: “It seems like many people have the attitude that America is so above and beyond everyone else . . . we should be mindful of our relations with the rest of the world, and maybe bring to light a less aggressive or less “macho” (as Zakaria would say) foreign policy.” Similarly, another reviewer argues for the potential of the book to encourage humility in Americans: “Zakaria writes that one of America’s greatest weaknesses is the prevailing cultural attitude that ‘America is the best’ and therefore has nothing to learn from other cultures/societies.” Finally, one reviewer reserves his greatest appreciation for the author’s candid delivery of the message that America needs to change gears: “Fareed is blunt about America’s political shortcomings: we get a lot of things right, but our political system (Washington) is ailing if not broken.” Zakaria deploys American exceptionalism in a more subtle way towards the end of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>, but as these affective responses suggest, readers’ posts magnify and elevate this aspect of the book through their emotion-laced responses.</p>

<sec id="section5-0196859913489571">
<title>Reactions to Zakaria as an Immigrant Intellectual</title>
<p>For a majority of reviewers, perceptions of Zakaria’s identity as an immigrant intellectual veered toward the extreme and filtered their reception to his thesis. They either praised his optimistic clarity and balanced insights or denigrated his elitist perspectives and liberal America bashing. Similarly, his immigrant status—Indian American and Muslim—was either constructed as an asset in shaping his unique cosmopolitan perspective or critiqued as a liability leading to clouded judgment. Reviewers who respected Zakaria (who earned his BA at Yale and his PhD at Harvard) as an intellectual were quick to pay tribute to his optimistic tone and authority as an expert, framing him as realistic but forward thinking, a contagious problem-solver, and as exhibiting “a level of understanding of world affairs that few seem to possess.” Numerous reviewers were pleasantly surprised by this optimistic tone, particularly considering the book’s seemingly bleak title. Zakaria’s optimism was often compared to other, more sensational expert voices in American political media. One reviewer welcomes Zakaria’s “refreshing and timely” buoyancy and contrasts it with media pundit Tom Friedman’s alarmist viewpoints. Other reviewers compliment the author for his ability to “cut through the polemics of both right and left to soberly assess the state of American society,” and for his “dispassionate, unbiased ability to critically analyze events and even ideological movements.” While one reviewer attributes <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s even-handed approach to the author’s hybrid professional identity—“equal parts journalist, economist, poet, and political scientist”—others admire the “balanced and objective view” that the book’s combination of historical analysis, statistical information, and accessible writing yields for the reader. Readers were quick to comment on Zakaria’s “formidable brilliance,” and on his status as “one of the most intelligent men in America.” Unlike the formal book reviews published in elite magazines and journals, reviewers in this space unabashedly adopt the tone of “fans” and they refer openly to their intertextual knowledge of the author’s credentials outside of the book.</p>
<p>Not everyone in this space, however, was a fan of Zakaria’s “posturing” as a public intellectual. Skeptical one- and two-star reviewers criticize Zakaria for his erroneous and elitist perspective on America’s weakening position in the global order. These reviewers characterize the author as too liberal, too eager to “bash America,” and ignorant of America’s history and culture. Fittingly, given the hubbub over Obama being spotted with Zakaria’s book, certain negative reviewers were quick to connect Zakaria and Obama via their perceived status as non-White, intellectual, liberal “Others.” One reviewer warns that the book is filled with “the same serving of false hope that Obama eats from . . . it has a strong liberal taste, laced with American-hating rhetoric, and topped with left-wing fantasy.” Several posts translate Zakaria’s elite intellectualism into anti-Americanism, labeling him as a member of “the blame-America-first crowd” or “global elite scum” whose book avoids historical substance in exchange for “pompous anti-American statements” and “the planned destruction of America and our freedom.” Some of the book’s critics cite Zakaria’s professional affiliations with the Aspen Strategy Group, the Council of Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission as evidence of his “anti-American” biases.</p>
<p>Zakaria’s background as a first-generation immigrant becomes another source of lively debate in reception to <italic>The Post-American World.</italic> For the positive reviewers, Zakaria’s international life experiences were valuable influences on his analysis of America’s altering fortunes. One reviewer describes Zakaria’s book as “a very eloquent paean to America, which only an immigrant could have written.” For some five-star reviewers, the author’s partial “outsiderness” facilitates deeper critical insights, which allow him to “step outside the box” as a keen observer and as a mediator who can connect America to other nations. As one reviewer puts it: “[Zakaria] has a broader global perspective than most Americans. He understands the American outlook of the proverbial ‘Joe Six-Pack’, and also understands the outlook of many citizens in other countries.” Affirming Zakaria’s Indian heritage, another reviewer chimes in, “Although he is considered a western journalist, the fact that Fareed Zakaria was born and raised in Mumbai gives him an insight into that society that cannot be taught.”</p>
<p>For negative reviewers, these very biographical aspects discounted Zakaria’s credibility, adding another layer to the debate surrounding the author’s integrity. Commenting sarcastically that the book’s thesis on the rise of China and India was predictable, one angry one-star reviewer mockingly cites Zakaria’s “unquestionable objectivity.” Another negative reviewer directly addresses Zakaria: “Thanks Mr. Muslim for your next book about how sharia law is going to save America.” Finally, yet another accuses Zakaria of capitalizing on 9/11, using the tragedy as a springboard to “rise to prominence” as a “rare Muslim journalist” in the United States.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion: Decoding <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s Field of Reception</title>
<p>Our analysis of <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s field of consumer citizenship on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> yields the following horizons of expectations that emerged in readers’ responses: the articulation of a pedagogy of global citizenship attuned to this particular moment; the enduring cultural purchase of the nation-state and neoliberalism in the midst of globalization and the economic decline of the United States; and the filtration of public intellectuals’ texts through the politics of identity (race, religion, class, immigrant status, and reputation.) When reviewers feel emboldened to utilize <italic>The Post-American World</italic> as a launching pad to discuss the kinds of <italic>education</italic> and knowledge on globalization that citizens and the ruling elite of America need to secure the nation’s future, we argue that they are producing a grassroots pedagogy of global citizenship. These reviewers’ informal pedagogy can be located along a continuum that also includes formal pedagogies that are designed and developed in various educational institutions to improve awareness of globalization. Illustrating the limits of discourse incited by this form of consumer citizenship, however, the book’s blueprint to revive America’s primacy provoked some nostalgic responses that sought to affirm the strength of the American nation-state in the midst of globalization, despite arguments that the forces of corporate globalization, global activist and civil society, and transnational and regional bodies of governance have weakened the power of the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859913489571">Lechner, 2009</xref>). Neoliberal ideas of international relations as constituted by antagonistic nations acting only in competition with one another also rear their heads in this space with some readers viewing the rise of China and India as a loss for America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489571">Harvey, 2005</xref>). Unlike formal reviewers, commentators in this space did not hesitate to debate Zakaria’s credibility as an expert on globalization or the impact of his immigrant “insider-outsider” vision on his book. Such an assessment of Zakaria as rational and reasonable may shed light not only on how much they were drawn to his seemingly neutral tone, but also perhaps, to the extent of polarization and incivility audiences witness on a regular basis in the “expert talking heads” format of television news.</p>
<p>Cultural studies scholars have demonstrated that multiple practices of literacy (defined as reading, writing, and critical thinking skills) that unfold outside of established educational institutional settings are typically oriented toward particular ends and shaped by broader contexts and power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859913489571">Besnier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489571">Barton, Hamilton, &amp; Ivanic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859913489571">Street, 1993</xref>). For visitors to <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>, the customer reviews act as a readily accessible archive of information, opinion, judgment, approval, and censure that can both expand and limit visitors’ literacy on the book itself (its standards of writing and presentation of evidence) and on globalization, the rise of China and India, and America’s place in the global economy. For others, particularly for reviewers who posted longer and more contemplative reviews, the customer commentary space enabled them to occupy the subject position of a reviewer-author and a critic, that is, to gain the agency to <italic>write</italic> about social and economic problems and to “publish” their writing in a public space. Ultimately, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> does exert control as the commercial gatekeeper of these forms of customer agency and public literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859913489571">Brandt, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Contributing to ongoing work on the quality and tone of public discourse on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489571">Brundidge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489571">Chaves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489571">Hindman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0196859913489571">Singer, 2010</xref>), it appears that to a large degree, reviews of <italic>The Post-American World</italic> produce a more civil, deliberative, and engaged reading formation than users’ comments on online news reports and YouTube videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859913489571">Loke, 2011</xref>), although it is important to acknowledge the instances of bigotry and hyperbole that circulate in this online space as well. <italic>The Post-American World</italic>’s more deliberative reader discourse may speak to the differences in the online public spaces that responses to books might engender in contrast to news reports and short videos; the genre of nonfiction books on weighty subjects like the global economy or foreign policy may provoke deeper reflection (rather than quick comments) from select readers who are more invested in a particular topic. However, this space is by no means inclusive or egalitarian: as we noted, a majority of the posters appear to be male U.S. citizens and some members of this community dismissed Zakaria for his immigrant Muslim background and his seemingly liberal political leanings. Access to this space is also dependent on users’ access to the Internet and basic computer literacy, two conditions we cannot take for granted. On a final note, this article’s engagement with one book’s active interpretive community, which has expanded by 57 additional reviews since we began analysis, could be extended to study other online and offline reservoirs of consumer citizenship, with the goal of illuminating the responses of various national communities—both elite and ordinary—to the shifts we are witnessing in this current moment of globalization.</p>
