<title>Delivering on early years</title>
<p>A conference at the National Museum of Scotland on the 7<sup>th</sup> March 2012 organized by Holyrood Magazine saw a range of speakers from across the UK and panel discussions on a wide variety of topics of interest to professionals looking for ideas and inspiration to improve and promote early years care.</p>
<p>The day was ably chaired by Tam Baillie, Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People and started off with a look at human interconnections and the connected baby with a moving and heartfelt presentation by Dr. Suzanne Zeedyck who used excerpts from her new video, the Connected Baby to illustrate the importance of attachment in the very earliest stages of development.</p>
<p>This was followed by illustrative case studies on the importance of attachment from Paul Gilroy of Crossreach and on working in and with communities by Mary Glasgow of Barnardos Scotland.</p>
<p>The second part of the morning focused on the wider policy context and was kicked off by Councillor Isabel Hutton, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) spokesperson for Education, Children and Young People. Councillor Hutton emphasised the importance and centrality of the early years across Scotland in order to make a long term positive difference to Scotland’s future. This was followed by a lively and interesting panel discussion and question and answer session with a range of participants from health, education, local government and the third sector.</p>
<p>The afternoon began with a session focused on funding with input from, and a panel discussion with, representatives from the Scottish Community Foundation, Inspiring Scotland and the Big Lottery Fund Scotland. Useful information was shared on the mechanisms, procedures, priorities and thinking behind some of the major and more substantial grant funders in Scotland.</p>
<p>The final session of the day looked first at how Nottingham has succeeded in rebranding itself as an Early Intervention City with a full and interesting presentation from Katy Ball, the Head of Early Intervention and Market Development with Nottingham City Council. Katy outlined how Nottingham had turned around a series of negative aspects of a city with high levels of deprivation and associated problems to one where an Ofsted Inspection recently said that Nottingham has <italic>“an extensive and outstanding range of early intervention services, making a marked shift with vulnerable children and families”</italic>. This was achieved with an extensive basket of early intervention programmes starting from:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913912457301" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>universal services offered to all (Healthy Child Programme);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>moving on up to proportionate universal services offered widely but pushed towards certain groups (Baby Massage);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>then on to targeted work with specific groups (Family Nurse Partnership); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>on finally up to highly specialised programmes working with high end/high cost groups to reduce long term costs and intergenerational impacts (Family Intervention Project).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Katy was followed by a very inspirational speaker, Jane Casson MBE, a Locality Manager for Sure Start Northumberland. She detailed how a range of rather unexpected partnerships developed across her patch with shared services and often co-location of services such as: Sure Start family centres; Ambulance Service; Community Transport; Environment Agency; GP Support Services; Midwifery Services; Probation Services; and Local Community Charities.</p>
<p>This wide range of close partnership working and facilities sharing has led to very significant cost savings, better collaboration, co-location and co-production as well as a range of positive outcomes for individuals, families and communities including:</p>
