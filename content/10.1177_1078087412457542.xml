<abstract>
<p>The urban financial industry is expected to continue to be a primary target of terrorism. Critical policy analyses call for reevaluations of knowledge via direct linkages with served communities. We use interview and survey data from 79 financial executives in New York after 9/11 to study place-based subsidy policies. We demonstrate that place is an important, and often overlooked, geographical concept for understanding how financial decision makers should respond to terrorism. We show that an analysis of local context must be included when crafting effective policies, and we argue that microscales are as important to urban resiliency as the citywide and regional scales.</p>

<p>Terrorism is predicted to remain an urban phenomenon, particularly in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1078087412457542">Savitch and Ardashev 2001</xref>). The financial industry is also theorized to remain a likely target of terrorism, given its power in world affairs and close connection to national governments and militaries in the United States, Britain, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078087412457542">Coaffee 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412457542">Harvey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078087412457542">Coaffee 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087412457542">Boddy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1078087412457542">Pohl 2004</xref>). Despite the presence of the financial industry in urban areas, the likelihood that it will be targeted by terrorists, and the continued concern about terrorist attacks within U.S. cities, little work has been done on effective governmental policies for dealing with the industry’s pre- and post-attack needs.</p>
<p>The lack of work in this area is surprising for several reasons. First, the financial industry employs significant numbers of people in cities, and its large tax base matters for urban budgets. Second, the industry often has the capability to influence government action given its collective prestige, power, and constituent bloc (i.e., employees and those affected by multiplier spending effects). Third, the emphasis within post-9/11 terrorism research has been on urban resiliency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412457542">Coaffee 2006</xref>), signaling that large and powerful employers like the financial industry must be studied because their ability to survive an attack and function afterwards will be essential to urban continuity and recovery. Furthermore, policy efforts toward urban resiliency may be compromised as other places attempt to lure financial institutions to their locales after terrorist attacks, and thereby give the institutions leverage to influence policy in ways that may be bad for the long-term interests of local governments.</p>
<p>The need for policy work on the financial industry and its concerns vis-à-vis terrorism is also signaled by recent critical analyses of policy practice informed by managerialism. Managerialism refers to the standardized approaches used by government workers for coordinating service delivery among agencies, often in absence of direct linkages and informational networks with the populations being served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412457542">Cochrane 2007</xref>). The professionalization of urban policy knowledge via an agreed upon theoretical and applied framework may limit the capabilities of policy analysts to fully understand the needs of their populations. The concern is that—as is the case with all professions—knowledge becomes outdated rather quickly. The managerial perspective must continually be updated by engagement with the communities served. This raises a question regarding the extent to which government workers have access to academic knowledge on the financial industry, as well as the extent to which academia itself has access to knowledge regarding this industry.</p>
<p>Our paper attempts to provide this access for a pressing social and policy concern: urban terrorism in the United States. Directly engaging communities in order to generate knowledge requires an understanding of the local context within which these communities function, a point well made in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078087412457542">Lees 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087412457542">Perramond 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078087412457542">Miller and Glassner 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412457542">Hanson and Pratt 2003</xref>). The post-9/11 urban research reveals that production of post-attack spaces was a complicated process that involved community, identity, distance, and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078087412457542">Low, Taplin, and Lamb 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078087412457542">Kasinitz, Smithsimon, and Pok 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078087412457542">Beunza and Stark 2005</xref>). However, the actual policy responses to 9/11, as evidenced in the various local, state, and federal assistance programs for businesses after the attack (e.g., WTC Large Business Job Creation and Retention Program), included only a rudimentary articulation of geographical awareness (i.e., space as a container for human action) and its relevance for policy outcomes. Our work explores how financial executives thought about their establishments’ abilities to respond to terrorism in geographical ways, and we explain how terrorism policy for private businesses might include a geographical perspective.</p>
<p>Drawing from 13 interviews with executives and 79 surveys completed by them, we explore three aspects of geography that directly affected the financial services in New York City. First, we explore how financial executives were not as concerned about empirical space post-9/11 (e.g., moving far away from New York) as they were about a disrupted ontological security that was no longer provided by familiar places. We explain how policies for keeping the financial industry in Manhattan might have been much more effective had they been developed around a holistic understanding of place needs, and not in ways that sought to counter recruitment efforts by other locales. Second, we explore the direct policy efforts toward affecting executives’ geographical strategies post-9/11, arguing that empirical space was mostly irrelevant and that local contexts mattered much more in the decision-making process. Third, we advocate for a change in the scale of analysis when it comes to studying terrorism policy and explain how a microscaled policy approach is needed in response to terrorist attacks.</p>

<title>Managing Empirical Spaces and Placeless Policies</title>
<p>Urban policy is the set of interconnected initiatives adopted by the government that attempts to deal with a problem that is beyond the control of an individual, or even a small group of people. These initiatives are aimed at problems that occur in cities that, if left unattended, threaten to affect a much larger number of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412457542">Cochrane 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Most urban policy has been driven primarily by social concerns such as poverty, racial segregation and discrimination, and disorder that were believed to be delimited by areal extent and mostly solvable by local government. These foci thus raise the question regarding where and how responses to terrorism can be understood within the traditional policy canon, and how we might analyze governmental responses to terrorism in order to provide useful information to policy analysts. Terrorism research does not fit neatly within the traditional areas of policy analysis, as it is not primarily an issue of race, poverty, or disorder but rather combines elements of all three. The variety of terrorism experienced on 9/11 is bound up with global patterns of inequity and power, much of which is mirrored in racial differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087412457542">Dalby 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412457542">Glassman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087412457542">Watts 2007</xref>). And while terrorism is a form of crime, its disordering effects on society are fundamentally different from the effects of everyday street crime. Furthermore, terrorism draws from domestic and international sources—and responses emanate from these areas—thus raising an additional question about whether or not terrorism can properly be considered an “urban” policy issue or if it should be analyzed as a national policy issue.</p>
<p>The confusion has not been lost on government and researchers, as evidenced by the juxtaposition of the myriad policy responses that have been generated to deal with terrorism and the analyses of these policies against the dearth of explicitly urban policies and reviews. The United States—and the financial executives it protects and supports—are directly accountable for many of the global conditions that incentivize terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412457542">Glassman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1078087412457542">Thrift 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412457542">Harvey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1078087412457542">Smith 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078087412457542">Murphy 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412457542">Hannah 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087412457542">Dalby 2007</xref>) and both are immanently subject to policy intervention. But while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087412457542">Gregory and Pred (2007)</xref> provide a trenchant analysis of the need for fundamental changes to national and international policy in order to alleviate the conditions that create terrorism as a viable means of political expression, there is little work on the social policy aspects within cities in response to 9/11 and the subsequent threat of terrorism. To be sure, there is a lot of work with clear urban policy implications, especially with regard to transportation planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078087412457542">Bae, Blain, and Bassok 2005</xref>); business continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078087412457542">Czinkota, Knight, and Liesch 2004</xref>); and economic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412457542">Chernick 2005</xref>), political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412457542">Mollenkopf 2005</xref>), and social resiliencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078087412457542">Foner 2005</xref>). However, the existing research posits an actual or hypothetical social problem deriving from terrorism as the starting point for conducting policy-relevant analyses. It does not start with an assessment of actual urban policies that have been put in place, and thus it does not lead to assessment of the implications of these policies.</p>
<p>Starting with actually articulated urban policy to craft our analysis reveals the absence of attention to the post-9/11 space and place that comprise New York City. Space refers to the socially produced environment that enables particular modes of being and production, often modeled after hegemonic interests such as capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087412457542">Thrift 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078087412457542">Lefebvre 1991</xref>). Our research shows how post-9/11 policies furthered the economic interests of the financial industry as an expression of advanced capitalism while ignoring the human desires for safe urban places. We draw from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412457542">Agnew (1987)</xref> for a threefold conceptualization of place as point, background for action, and subjective understanding. Our research reveals that 9/11 and the policy responses have indeed had an effect on people and businesses, contrary to the findings of other analyses that have not considered these concepts directly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087412457542">Eisinger 2004</xref>). Actually articulated urban policy, such as the 9/11 subsidy programs known as the Liberty Zone and the World Trade Center Large Business Job Creation and Retention Program, illustrate only a very basic grasp of the role that space and place might play in shaping the individual’s reaction to terrorism. Yet these policies intended to be fundamentally geographical in that they sought to influence the decisions of executives regarding where they located their businesses after 9/11.</p>
<p>These urban policies are informed by what is best characterized as a conceptualization of empirical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087412457542">Thrift 2003</xref>). Empirical space refers to the construction of the physical environment in ways that enable everyday life to unfold—in this case, everyday life after a major terrorist attack. Thinking about empirical space provides a way to understand the fundamental stuff of social organization, as well as the phenomenology of the spatial world. However, these understandings will be derived from preexisting and predominant understandings of the spatial world rather than the understanding of that spatial world as it emerges in response to the terrorist attack. This is the crux of managerialism in policy theory and research: knowledge—in this case knowledge about space and place applied to postterrorism policy—is used to understand and solve a problem. However, that knowledge may not reflect emergent changes in the social world that are the result of some unprecedented and impactful stimulus. For the policies under analysis here, the stimulus was the 9/11 attack.</p>
<p>In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412457542">Harvey (2002)</xref> argued that the competitive spirit of capitalism overshadowed any other interpretation of the 9/11 attacks and their effect on New York and the United States: the mindset that emerged focused on preserving New York City and ignoring the role of the United States in creating the conditions of terror throughout the world. It was this mindset that prevented financial executives—many of whom worked in the Giuliani and subsequent Bloomberg administrations—from crafting policy that did anything other than keep financial establishments in New York and thwart efforts by other municipalities to lure them away. Managerialists informed by capitalism did not see a community need for ontological security in place. This is consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> found regarding Bloomberg’s broader approach to urban management: a conceptualization of New York City as a place that can be branded for <italic>global competitive</italic> advantage. Brash traced a story that suggests that the elite of the elite (i.e., the small subset of corporate New York that worked in the Bloomberg Administration) were increasingly out of touch not only with what most New Yorkers wanted for the city (e.g., divisiveness over the Hudson Rail Yards redevelopment and planning efforts) but also with their own class peers (e.g., the planning for the 2012 Olympics was overly influenced by a small group of real estate interests). Our article draws its strength from the tension between space and place: policy was produced that reflected capitalist space (i.e., competitive, subsidized spaces to support business functions) while the more localized, subjective experiences of what city workers actually want in urban places was largely ignored.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> pointed out, a transnational capitalist class (TCC) that had direct influence within the Bloomberg Administration was effective in shaping urban policy to generate wealth, but he is silent about this class’s perception of the city as a place in which to live and work after 9/11. His silence in this regard may be the result of formal 9/11 policy being crafted before Bloomberg’s term began. Furthermore, our data do not correspond to Brash’s characterization of the TCC as being primarily concerned with creating competitive spaces, and so we wonder how representative the <italic>transnational</italic> capitalist class is of most financial workers in New York. We believe our sample is more representative of financial workers and executives than is the staff of the Bloomberg Administration that Brash studied. As Brash himself states, Bloomberg sought the elite of the elite; our sample did not.</p>

<title>The Contexts for Postterrorism Policy</title>
<p>Understanding how spatial knowledge might change in response to the 9/11 attacks requires attention to context. Context refers to the spatial, social, political, and economical performances that enable urban life and our understanding of that life as well as to the linkages that make these performances possible. Context is usually experienced as the local milieu that shapes the opportunity structures and experiences available to a person, but that local milieu is also recognized to be connected to and shaped by various other scales. The local milieu is also emplaced; city life is not lived in a vacuum or up in the ether. There are several contexts that matter for understanding the policy environment after 9/11: (1) proximity to the disaster site (i.e., as one moves toward the World Trade Center site, social, political, and economic practices were drastically altered); (2) the formal and informal policy agenda setting arenas and processes post-9/11 (i.e., the policy process was transformed, with much policy made quickly and informally but with great involvement by all levels of government); (3) the changing meaning accorded to the city by workers and financial executives given the threat of terrorism (i.e., ontological dissonance experienced vis-à-vis place caused people to experience localities as risky, fear-inducing spaces); and (4) economic uncertainty (i.e., locations where identities were constructed and reinforced in the presence of others were now inaccessible or avoided). By analyzing these contextual features, it is possible to explain how post-9/11 policies might have taken into account the processes underpinning reconstituted urban space and place.</p>
<p>Proximity to the disaster site undeniably shaped the post-9/11 urban experience in New York City, and this rather straightforward understanding of space is reflected in policy articulations. Two of the state and city subsidy programs recognized a higher impact on business function (and thus a greater subsidy) given location south of Canal Street than in other areas of the city. The federal program also established the Liberty Zone, recognizing the need for greater assistance south of Canal Street. These conceptualizations of policy failed to recognize other dimensions of space such as “unblocking space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087412457542">Thrift 2003</xref>). Unblocking space refers to the linkages among places and people, and the mechanisms for moving across these links that in turn enable ceaseless rearrangements of social, political, and economic life. The connections that urban life enables must be included in analyses of terrorism responses to create resiliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087412457542">Erikson 2005</xref>). While it is tempting to quarter the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087412457542">Marcuse 2000</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078087412457542">1</xref></sup> and apply policy within the quarters, such a practice obscures the connections via social networks, transportation routes, and business linkages that shaped the post-9/11 desire to relocate. Furthermore, by prioritizing business losses via subsidies for them, post-9/11 policy ignored other aspects of the business environment such as changed understandings of place that also may have lead to dispersal.</p>
<p>That the holistic desire to relocate was not tapped via the policy apparatus is perhaps a result of the absence of a defined policy problem. Drawing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412457542">Anderson’s (2006)</xref> overview of the policy-making process, we can illuminate the features of post-9/11 policy situation in New York. While the devastation and audacity of the attacks was clearly a problem, the potential implications of businesses relocating out of Manhattan were not clear to the public. A constituency was difficult to discern, and indeed some of the financial service establishments that were to benefit from the government policies were hostile to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078087412457542">2</xref></sup> In effect, there was no criterion by which the government’s intervention could be assessed because terrorism in the United States was novel and the public was preoccupied. Yet policy was crafted, formally expressed but informally created given the exigency of the moment. It was created in the absence of agreed upon standards and public input. These conditions facilitated a policy focus on the center of the damage in lower Manhattan, leaving the changing geographical perceptions within the broader city unrecognized and unaddressed. The elite of the financial industry—some of whom worked in the Bloomberg Administration and were inculcated with thoughts of the city as a place for economic growth only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078087412457542">Logan and Molotch 2002</xref>) did not recognize the use-values of city place as important dimensions of post-terrorism policy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> found, the increasing technocratic approach of the Bloomberg Administration—illustrative of the worst symptoms of a managerial bent—seemed to incrementally divorce the policy apparatus from recognizing the power of place as a subjective experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1078087412457542">3</xref></sup> We document a similar situation vis-à-vis New York City as a place for financial workers post-9/11.</p>
<p>That perceptions of the city may have changed after 9/11 points to the importance of exploring social contexts, especially the phenomenologies of place. Phenomenologies of place shape one’s experience of the local milieu and opportunity structures, which are the essence of local context. Because people construct a sense of security within a particular place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078087412457542">Cresswell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078087412457542">Janz 2008</xref>), and 9/11 created ontological dissonance by shattering this sense of security for many New Yorkers via a transformed urban context, it is possible that people would seek to restore a sense of place-based security by relocating out of the City. Understanding changing perceptions of place—and what they mean for residential or business location decisions—would illuminate policy approaches that might focus on countering these changes rather than simply addressing business losses. There were many things lost in the 9/11 attacks, and most of them have been addressed and studied to provide policy-relevant knowledge. Conspicuously absent in this research, however, is attention to the importance of place-based ontological shifts that accompany a transformed urban context.</p>
<p>The policies that were generated after 9/11 focused almost exclusively on economic context, implicitly arguing that businesses needed economic help (which many of them did need), and that this help would be most effectively allocated in a spatial way. We, however, argue that a much more robust inclusion of geographical awareness in the policy formulation process would have led to a richer, more holistic recognition of the changes underfoot in New York City and ultimately to appropriately tailored policy responses. For example, while the existing policies addressed economic uncertainty by providing relief for business losses, they did not consider other aspects of the local environment that also created economic uncertainty (such as police presence and armed forces with weapons in lower Manhattan scaring off clients from office visits).</p>

<title>Contesting the Scales: Thinking About the Microgeographies of Manhattan</title>
<p>One way to include geography in the policy formulation process is to pay attention to how scale is politically created for particular policy purposes. Scholars have recognized that while policy may be formulated at one level of government and in one agency, the influences acting upon the policy makers themselves are likely to have emanated from other scales of government and other agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087412457542">Brenner and Theodore 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078087412457542">Logan and Molotch 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078087412457542">Agranoff 2008</xref>). This was the case after the 9/11 attacks. The attacks targeted localized U.S. military and financial strength (i.e., the Pentagon and the World Trade Center), but they were quickly scaled to a national disaster in order to garner support for a war response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412457542">Harvey 2002</xref>). Yet the policies aimed at ameliorating the effect of the attacks on businesses reflected regional interests (i.e., keeping businesses from leaving Manhattan and moving to New Jersey) articulated at the scale of the city (i.e., Manhattan-based policy areas). New York City rushed to rebrand itself as safe and prosperous to national and international audiences, but this branding did not at all address the forces unleashed within the microgeographies of everyday workplaces and local environments. The qualitative aspects of the scale of everyday life were ignored, probably because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> notes, Bloomberg’s ear was held by a <italic>transnational</italic> capitalist class that sought to remodel New York City in a <italic>global</italic> and not a local way.</p>
<p>Research on terrorism, however, shows that the scale of everyday life must be studied to fully understand terrorism’s effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412457542">Coaffee (2006)</xref> argued that local institutions and the communities that they serve are essential for urban resiliency, while others have argued that localized security discourses shape urban vulnerability awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1078087412457542">Ruben and Maskovsky 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078087412457542">Katz 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1078087412457542">Wekerle and Jackson 2005</xref>). Framing terrorism studies within the microgeographies of everyday life leads to an understanding of how everyday places affect people’s perceptions of terrorism. If government policies aim only to influence business relocations by alleviating business costs, then they are unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>Post-9/11 urban policy has focused almost exclusively on alleviating business costs in order to maintain the business presence in lower Manhattan. Our research, however, suggests that beginning the analysis with the local scales in which people live their daily work lives—and crafting policies informed by this scale—may more effectively influence the locational decisions of financial service establishments than current policies articulated at other scales. We are not advocating that attention to the places and microgeographies alone will produce good policy, but rather that they are one important—and often overlooked—component of approaching the craft of terrorism policy. It is true that many institutions, such as the Association for a Better New York and the Partnership for New York City, became active in rebranding the city post-9/11 and that this rebranding was focused on ideas of place. It is possible that their efforts to emphasize the positive in post-9/11 New York City may have helped to alleviate concerns about place-based ontological dissonance and terrorism. However, these efforts were largely directed at shoppers and tourists and not workers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412457542">Greenberg 2008</xref>). The problem here is that shoppers and tourists are temporary visitors, capable of easily leaving the neighborhood if they are uncomfortable. This same strand of thought is reflected in the place-branding strategies of the transnational capitalist class discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref>. They sought to brand New York City as a good place to do business. Workers and most of their leaders, however, are much more tied to places, and the effects of place-based ontological dissonance are therefore likely to be greater for them. This includes financial workers and executives, only a few of whom are regular globetrotters. There were some rebranding efforts directed specifically to these groups, especially through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412457542">Greenberg 2008</xref>), but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> notes that the leaders of many municipal organizations in New York at the time (but especially within city government) were informed by technocratic policy approaches. Their ideas (and hence policy responses) in the immediate days after the attacks were limited by managerial perspectives informed by place as a static point (hence policies to retain business within New York City were proposed) and not place as subjective understanding (hence the absence of policy proposals that accounted for changing urban ontologies likely to be unaffected by business subsidy programs). We advocate that changing the scale of analysis when it comes to studying terrorism policy involves bringing in the qualitative dimensions of subjective human understanding of place that might not be so easily seen or understood from the established technocratic, managerialist perspective – especially one informed by a global transnational class. As Brash so pointedly and clearly argued, Bloomberg sought the best of the best to join his administration, but their globetrotting experiences are unlike those of most New Yorkers—including most financial workers and executives.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-1078087412457542">
<title>The Survey Instrument</title>
<p>We conducted 13 in-person, in-depth interviews with financial services executives. As part of these interviews, we asked all 13 participants to complete a survey, which we then mailed to 66 additional financial services executives. Contact information for financial establishments in Manhattan was purchased from Dunn and Bradstreet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zapdata.com">www.zapdata.com</ext-link>). Out of the 578 leads (one per establishment) purchased, 102 leads were unusable for various reasons such as incorrect or nonworking phone numbers, duplicated listing, and majority of the business not in the financial industry. Among the 476 usable leads, 223 establishments either agreed to participate in the survey or requested a copy of the survey instrument in order to make a more informed decision about participation. In total, we collected data from 79 establishments.</p>
<p>All data were collected in the summer of 2004. We are confident that the theoretical issues raised by the interviews are still valid today. First, the financial services industry still has a significant presence in cities throughout the world, and terrorism is predicted to remain an urban phenomenon. Second, the United States has not experienced another terrorist attack similar in magnitude to the 9/11 attacks and there is little work on place, vulnerability awareness, and effective policy. Thus, there is little reason to believe any revision in post-9/11 policy ideas has occurred. Specifically, technocratic and manageralist perspectives that dominate in the Bloomberg Administration and the increasingly popular CEO model of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash 2011</xref>) are unlikely to have explored the more qualitative, subjective dimensions of place that we document here. All of the evidence to date, including Brash’s thorough analysis of Bloomberg’s Administration, indicates that government was focused on understanding the value-added dimension of New York City as a place to do business. This is not surprising because quantitative methods are emphasized in American business schools, as is the supremacy of understanding value addition. However, we believe that understanding the meaning accorded to place—not just the <italic>urbanism</italic> (which refers to the way people live in that place) that Brash cites as constitutive of value addition—requires a qualitative approach, and that use values of the city are seen only with a conscious effort. While it is possible that the elite professional networks of the Bloomberg Administration brought policy makers into contact with information about place-based ontological dissonance, it takes an approach different from the quantitative, value-added one to see place as a subjective human experience and translate this sight into an inclusive, holistic policy response. Third, terrorism is, by its nature, unpredictable, so the issues arising from any terrorist attack will always vary given the nature of that attack. What will not change theoretically, however, is the significance of place in shaping the responses. Our work is the first step in theorizing place-based ontologies and their relevance for terrorism policy.</p>
<p>The survey instrument provided the questions that guided the interviews and the data collection; it was eight pages long. We used the term <italic>establishment</italic> to refer to the individual office where the survey was received, recognizing that firms may have had multiple establishments in different locations. This reporting unit for the interviews and surveys was consistent with the definition of establishment used in the <italic>County Business Patterns</italic> and the <italic>ZIP Code Business Patterns</italic> data available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey/interview guide operationalized concepts within the following areas: (1) desired agglomeration economy features both before and after 9/11, (2) perceptions of urban work environments pre- and post-9/11, and (3) influence of the subsidy programs on locational decisions. Each interviewee and survey respondent was also prompted to articulate his or her own understanding of geography’s role in affecting post-9/11 experiences; these responses formed the crux of our work discussed below that links policy analysis with a priori articulations of space.</p>
<p>Establishments in various types and sizes participated in the survey. Forty-four establishments identified themselves as the headquarters for their firms, 15 as branch offices of larger firms, and 19 as single location firms. The respondents represent the full complement of establishment sizes in Manhattan, with some of the largest (10 establishments with 1,000 or more employees) participating. Furthermore, our sample almost perfectly reflected the universe of financial establishments in New York County (Manhattan) that we were interested in studying. In 2004, there were 2,007 NAICS 522 establishments and 4,656 NAICS 523 establishments in Manhattan, or 30.1% and 69.8% of the universe respectively. The respective percentages of these establishments within our sample were 28 and 70.</p>

<sec id="section6-1078087412457542">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We acquired the data for this analysis primarily from the open-ended sections of the survey/interview instrument that prompted respondents to explain their experiences of space and the subsidy programs. However, we also acquired quantitative data on the subsidy programs in which the respondents participated, as well as data regarding whether they were planning to relocate their establishments despite having participated in the program.</p>
<p>All qualitative data (<italic>n</italic> = 52 documents) were imported into the Nvivo software system and it was coded. Because we are seeking to understand the financial executives’ own understanding of terrorism geographies before imposing our own theoretical constructs, we used a grounded theory, open coding approach to analyze the data. After initially coding all of the data, we then moved into axial coding in order to understand connections among the ideas expressed by interviewees. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087412457542">Table 1</xref> provides the number of participants in each subsidy program. A total of 52 codes were created, with the most productive code being for respondents’ changing perception of place post-9/11. We discuss the specific codes and how we used them as we discuss the findings in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Overview of Findings</title>
<p>There are three main themes that we set out to explore in this study: (1) the ways in which financial executives thought about empirical space, which was the conceptualization of space that informed the subsidy programs; (2) the role of context in the post-9/11 policy process; and (3) how to nuance a scalar approach to public terrorism policy. Our analysis reveals that place, rather than space, was the best concept for understanding how decision makers in the financial establishments responded to terrorism. We show that an analysis of local context, which very directly involves how people experience places, must be included in crafting effective policies. We argue that microscales are as important to urban resiliency as are the citywide and regional scales.</p>
<sec id="section8-1078087412457542">
<title>Place: An Important Concept for Postterrorism Policy</title>
<p>As noted above, the federal, state, and local policies adopted after 9/11 to influence the locational decisions of the financial establishments were only rudimentarily geographical. These policies sought to prevent financial executives from leaving New York City by offering them payments, grants, and tax credits for staying put or for reinvesting in New York. The financial establishments were simply seen as points on a map, and government policy had keeping the most points within New York’s boundaries as its goal. The underlying principle was that commerce and industry form the crux of urban life, and thus the status-quo spatial agglomeration needed to be maintained so that New York’s economic powerhouse, and the lives of many New Yorkers, would not be further disrupted.</p>
<p>This conceptualization of space, however, ignores the more experiential aspects of geography that we believe form the basis of urban experience and inform the decisions about whether or not to maintain an urban presence. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078087412457542">Table 2</xref>, the most productive code in our data set was “the role of place,” capturing 36 statements out of a total of 109 coded statements. These data illustrate the complexity of financial executives’ experiences of geography post-9/11.</p>

<p>Our interpretation of these data is that the executives’ experiences themselves could have been leveraged via normal state functions, such as improving road access or reducing police presence in certain areas at certain times, in order to maintain financial services in Manhattan. By creating policies that incorporated the experiences of executives in order to allay their concerns and thereby perhaps prevent them from leaving New York, the state could have avoided direct subsidies that are seldom shown to be the primary influence on corporate decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412457542">Fisher 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>And what were the geographical concerns of executives? First, financial executives were concerned about the security profile of their neighborhoods in the post-9/11 city as reflected in 13 coded statements. These statements, however, tended to reflect a holistic understanding of a changed urban place, rather than a conceptualization of space that would be amenable to geographically delimited subsidies aimed at keeping workers put in pre-9/11 locations. For example, an executive from a NAICS 523 establishment commented that the establishment’s “total real estate portfolio” was viewed “in light of the events of 9/11.” According to this executive, “Where we situate groups across the country are [<italic>sic</italic>] driven by those events.” Similarly, another NAICS 523 executive, though for a very large financial establishment, commented that “housing all employees in one building” was no longer considered acceptable and that that establishment too was taking a more holistic approach to office location strategies. Other executives discussed the need to locate additional facilities “in a different geographical location from the main office” (NAICS 523 executive, medium-sized establishment). Subsidies might be effective at keeping some employees in New York City, but clearly not all of them.</p>
<p>And furthermore, it seems that at least some executives were planning to keep at least some workers in New York anyway, suggesting that the subsidies were irrelevant for these establishments. In the words of an executive from a NAICS 523 establishment, “The subsidies didn’t influence where the business decided to locate after 9/11; we knew we would come back downtown.” Of course, we can only imagine how many establishments did not see the need to be in New York at all after 9/11 and left, and thus were not captured in our surveys or interviews. We report on the executives who intended to keep establishments in New York; they were two times as likely to say the subsidies did not influence locational decisions. Of those executives who said that policies did have an effect, three were classified as a significant influence whereas one was classified as the subsidies having only a minor influence. For the subsidy programs to have an influence on roughly one-third of the respondents who provided statements about the efficacy of the subsidies is not that bad. Our point, however, is that when coupled with the other statements about irrelevancy, we are left questioning whether a more holistic menu of policies should have been crafted that considered all of the needs and experiences of financial executives post-9/11. We wonder if a globetrotting capitalist class, which we suspect has less place attachment than their more local and more numerous counterparts, promoted policy to keep New York competitive using numbers of establishments retained rather than with feelings about the city as a good place to be.</p>
<p>Executives formulated their holistic locational strategies in light of local, place-based features that may have been amenable to influence by normal government procedures. Executives commented that it was important to know the security profile of a neighborhood, but this raises the question of what type of data would be used to create that profile. Presumably, a mixture of government and private sector indices would be used to create an acceptable profile, and provision of accurate, timely data about security initiatives—and communication of this data—could properly fall to government offices in a manner similar to statewide efforts at GIS data collection and dissemination. Neighborhood security profiles are already part of government service via vulnerability analyses; partnering with the financial industry to make sure accurate information circulates about places may be more effective than direct subsidies.</p>
<p>Subsidies were also unlikely to affect the everyday concerns about urban work environments that executives found to have deteriorated after 9/11. Five executives felt that downtown was generally unpleasant as a place to do business after 9/11 because of street closures, police presence, and a climate of fear that was affecting clients. An executive for a small NAICS 523 establishment commented that “it is currently unpleasant downtown due to the constant construction,” while an executive from a medium-sized NAICS 523 establishment commented that “too many roads are closed and the ones that are open are in such bad shape.” Still others commented that the prolonged loss of utilities downtown was the major cause of changing perceptions of urban place and the major impetus for moving establishments elsewhere. “Our employees relocated to Park Avenue for 7 weeks after the 9/11 events. This was due to the data communication lines being unavailable or unreliable during this period,” noted the executive of a NAICS 522 establishment. These are all conditions that are immanently within the purview of local government administration. And perhaps the Bloomberg Administration was well aware of these concerns, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412457542">Brash (2011)</xref> documents how closely that administration involved corporate leaders. If that was the case, however, we are left wondering why we have found these results, especially since Brash notes that Bloomberg prided himself on getting things done. If the networks carried the right information, and this information was recognized, the administration would have acted on it. Perhaps the information we have uncovered was missed because Bloomberg focused on selling New York City to a <italic>transnational</italic> capitalist class as a place to do business, and so his administration lost sight of a rooted, local group of financial workers.</p>
<p>When coupled with an emergent understanding of current places vis-à-vis the security profiles of other places, government intervention in the features of place become more important than the provision of subsidies. Seven executives specifically articulated their thoughts about relocation via a comparison of their location against some other location perceived to be better. These reasons included “vibrancy” of other places, a critical mass of financial services executives and clients, and the very frequently cited need for affordable rents. For example, the words of the following NAICS 523 executive from a small establishment captures this sentiment:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no longer a need for successful financial services firms to locate offices in New York City, given the drawbacks of high rent, high taxes, increased commute time and increased risk from terrorism. Clients are very willing to meet with us and other competitors in Fairfield County, CT.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Place is both a background for human action and the environment attributed with human meaning. In our data, we find concern about the setting for their workplaces (e.g., closed streets, police presence and visibility of armed forces, and disrupted utilities) and changing urban meanings (e.g., nonurban and nondescript environments suitable for financial establishments because such environments may be less target-prone) guiding financial executives’ decisions more than reimbursements for business revenue lost. Government policy may have sought to influence spatial decisions via subsidies, but we believe a better approach would have restored a sense of place. Specifically, sense of place might be incorporated into the policy process via attention to qualitative methods that challenge managerialist knowledge. Focus groups, interviews, and even ethnographies conducted by policy makers may help connect place to policy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1078087412457542">Sanjek (2000)</xref> used case studies of ethnographic research on ethnic communities in New York City to explain both the unintended implications of city policy designed to keep the financial industry in the city as well as the increasing futility of these efforts. Restoring a sense of place could have been accomplished in post-9/11 New York City via attention to ordinary government functions (such as improving utility maintenance and changing policing strategies post-9/11), as articulated in the interviews and surveys conducted in this research. Policy that is context-specific can be crafted by including a qualitative research component to any policy formulation program.</p>

<sec id="section9-1078087412457542">
<title>Contexts for Terrorism Policy</title>
<p>Urban terrorism policy will also be more effective if it is based on a sound understanding of local context and its relevance for the performance of business operations. An analysis of the role that context played in the decisions and business functioning of financial executives in New York City after 9/11 illustrates a richness of activities. These activities suggest a multitude of policy responses other than subsidies that will encourage urban resiliency.</p>
<p>As noted above, context refers to the local milieu that shapes the opportunity structures and experiences available to a person, as well as the connections to and influences by processes operating at various other scales. This milieu is constituted by the everyday spaces that a person inhabits such as the workplace, children’s school, public street, and home. Within these spaces, a person is presented with various opportunities often shaped by larger structural forces such as race, gender, and in the case of financial services executives, experience, connections, and professional achievements. Linkages to processes at other scales touch-down in specific (local) places. So, for example, the success of any financial executive might be related to the global and national linkages of his or her firm because such linkages carry rich information and transaction opportunities. An executive’s success may be related to government connections established in the host city that enable additional work such as managing a pension fund. Or they may simply be related to hearing about relevant information at a local restaurant or coffee shop frequented by other professionals in the office neighborhood. Thus, context is both the site and the situation of local action.</p>
<p>Financial services executives in New York City responded to the disaster in ways that drew upon their local contexts, and they often sought to manipulate those contexts to build forms of urban resiliency—albeit temporarily. Our data shows that in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, financial executives drew upon their linkages to other establishments to both survive and to help these establishments. For example, one executive noted the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of our clients whose offices were downtown in a building that was rendered unusable by the 9/11 attacks moved into our space with us for a period of 2 to 3 months until they could find alternative space. (NAICS 523 financial executive, small establishment)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An executive of a medium-sized NAICS 523 establishment echoed these thoughts, but from the perspective of a “helped” establishment:
<disp-quote>
<p>We located in many various locations; several were space-sharing arrangements with lenders and others who offered us space as they knew that we needed it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The role of aiding professional network members also surfaced, as illustrated by this comment from the executive of a small NAICS 522 establishment:
<disp-quote>
<p>We had loans with many small businesses and worked with them during this difficult period. Because of that, they all survived.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet despite financial services executives’ engagement with contextual features, terrorism policy has largely been devoid of attention to context. Specifically, policy has not considered how features of the local (linked up) environment might be augmented or incentivized to build urban resiliency. Of course, it is well known that social networks and other features of context (such as institutional pipelines for informational buzz) are integral to professional accomplishments. Furthermore, many would argue that policy cannot and should not intervene in such contexts because government involvement would risk disrupting such beneficial contexts. We argue, however, that government policy would be better crafted if it rewarded networks that function in ways that encourage resiliency—such as sharing space and extending or forgiving loans—rather than attempting to maintain the spatial status quo via geographically defined subsidies that are unlikely to be effective because they ignore place. One of our respondents presented a very interesting network policy to postterrorism business response and recovery: create an electronic infrastructure and physical location that would allow business community members to network and exchange information postdisaster about available resources, response activities, and coping strategies. While this proposition was made by a financial executive, we believe it can be analytically generalized to postterrorism policy—as is the case for many of the points raised here—as information sharing and networking affects all urban businesses.</p>
<p>We also found evidence that financial executives, while embracing geographical dispersal principles as a way to ensure business continuity in the event of an attack, sought to maintain dispersed facilities proximal to headquarters. Maintaining localized linkages within the establishment mattered. For example, one executive of a small NAICS 523 establishment noted that the “firm has a backup facility located in Jersey City [which is across the Hudson River, but still very close to Manhattan]. We selected Jersey City because it was close.” Another noted that “having critical staff available” was a major issue after 9/11. The finding that dispersal strategies are inevitable and that there is a trend of backup facilities staying local suggests that policy might seek to reward the construction of backup facilities in-state—and perhaps even within the city, though in areas distant from Manhattan’s center on separate utility grids. For example, parts of the Borough of Queens are serviced by a separate power authority, and thus locating backup facilities in these locations would satisfy the conditions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1078087412457542">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2003)</xref> on resiliency while also maintaining workers and resources in New York City. Rather than devoting scarce resources to maintain establishments and their staffs within Manhattan that our data suggests goes against the inclinations of financial executives to move personnel to New Jersey, for example, we recommend exploring policies that reward these executives’ desire for proximity when they keep their backup facilities within the municipality (in this case, New York City or State).</p>
<p>Finally, local contexts also prevented establishments from moving. First, the local economic conditions and links within Manhattan were mentioned several times as a reason for not moving, particularly sunk costs, the costs of relocating, and the uniqueness of geographical access provided by a location within Manhattan. For example, an executive of a midsized NAICS 523 establishment told us that “the value of the building equals [<italic>sic</italic>] why the firm is still in lower Manhattan” while an executive of a small NAICS 523 establishment noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the firm’s clients are in midtown and it has reached its “tipping point.” There is no longer a critical mass of financial services downtown. The firm could afford better space in midtown. The only restraint is the cost of relocating.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following executive, from a small-sized NAICS 523 establishment, noted that the geographical access provided by Manhattan’s centralized location was essential to his establishment’s continued presence there. His ideas are representative of other comments about geographical access under our code for “preventing the establishment from moving.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many of the senior people would like to move our business out of the city due to terrorism and other quality-of-life concerns, but since our employees come from all over the tri-state area it would be too disruptive to move out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When the idea that local contextual features themselves might prevent establishments from relocating is coupled with the eight respondents who stated that the subsidies were used, but that they did not influence their locational decisions, we are left questioning the extent to which the subsidies simply alleviated costs for establishments that had no intention of leaving. The words of a small NAICS 523 establishment capture this sentiment: “The subsidies didn’t influence where the business decided to locate after 9/11. We knew we’d come back downtown.”</p>
<p>Local context is composed of the linkages and opportunity structures that form the fabric of everyday life—in this research, the professional life for financial executives in the post-9/11 city. Our respondents worked within the contexts of their everyday lives to respond to the disaster, and in this process they fostered kernels of urban resiliency throughout the city. In our view, the purpose of government policy should be to nurture these kernels into a robust resiliency that will enable major employers to survive future disasters. Unfortunately, post-9/11 policy for the financial services in New York, uninformed by ideas about local context, did not seem to take the same approach.</p>

<sec id="section10-1078087412457542">
<title>The Missing Microscale</title>
<p>To ensure that urban terrorism policy does not ignore geographical processes and contexts that may play a significant role in executives’ decisions about where to locate their establishments, we remind policy analysts of the importance of thinking about scale. Specifically, we propose that post-9/11 terrorism policy should be crafted with the microscales of everyday urban life in mind, and that research at this scale will often require a qualitative approach.</p>
<p>Scale refers to the delimited extent of a researchable problem or activist project. The extent frames what constitutes the project, and it provides the parameters within which work is conducted. Scale is usually thought about in hierarchical ways, but this approach is problematic because it may obscure relationships and processes that do not fit neatly into a hierarchical classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078087412457542">Marston, Jones, and Woodward 2005</xref>)—a problem that has perhaps hampered the policy efforts we have discussed in this article. Scale is also often politically contested, meaning that people have significant interests in how a problem is framed and tackled. For example, is poverty a household or citywide issue? It may be both, but framing poverty as one or the other will matter for the types of research conducted and ultimately the solutions that are offered.</p>
<p>So too the scale matters for postterrorism urban policy: crafting policy at the regional and even citywide scales takes into account a certain set of politics, processes, and structures that result in quite different policy outcomes than might have been crafted given a more nuanced attention to scale. It is well known that corporations have pitted states against each other in order to extract tax breaks and other concessions, usually when those corporations have had no intention of actually moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078087412457542">LeRoy 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412457542">Fisher 2007</xref>). In the case of 9/11, the postattack corporate threat of relocation was also used to extract government benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087412457542">Bagli 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087412457542">2002</xref>). New Jersey and New York were, unfortunately, gamed. It is thus not surprising, given the interstate competition to influence the locational decisions of financial executives, that a regional scale was adopted.</p>
<p>However, thinking about scale in this way is precisely the problem that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078087412457542">Marston, Jones, and Woodward (2005)</xref> identified, and it is the one that we believe policy analysts need to consider in the future. The competition between the states was understood as a regional issue, and hence the locus of the solution was articulated at this scale as well. Other scales were ignored. Once the post-9/11 business retention problem was framed as one between states, the possibility of looking for policy solutions at local levels within New York (where New Jersey could not compete) became less important. This use of scale prevented a policy approach that considered the microgeographies of executives’ everyday business lives. A microgeographical approach would have addressed their concerns about changing workplaces and environments, their embeddedness in and utilization of local contexts to cope, and their desires to stay in New York. We believe that crafting policy targeted at the microgeographies of post-9/11 financial executives may have had a greater influence over their locational decisions than regional approaches. We thus recommend that policy analysts consider the relationships and processes among all scales as they craft policy options for managing the postattack city. Key starting points for the microgeographies of everyday life include the phenomenologies of place, perceptions of security in local environments, and the local linkages and opportunity structures that enable businesses to prosper but also to cope with disasters. The microgeographies of the city, and the policies crafted with them in mind, are an important aspect of urban resiliency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078087412457542">
<title>Geographical Process as Integral to Policy Analysis</title>
<p>Our data and analysis signal that there are implications for ignoring geographical processes when crafting urban terrorism policy. These implications include leaving unaddressed ontological and contextual issues that may matter more for locational decision making than aggregate business losses, and that attention to place is more effective for countering interurban competition for businesses postterrorism than is attention to empirical space only. Using qualitative data from 13 in-person interviews and 66 in-depth surveys with financial executives in New York City, we have demonstrated that one of the key influences on executive relocation decisions after 9/11 was changed perceptions of urban place. Given these changed perceptions, we find it problematic that terrorism policy ignored the complexity of place and rather focused its attention solely at the regional and citywide scales. Place is more than a commodity to be rebranded and sold to tourists and shoppers after terrorism, and it can be only partially understood by a transnational class more intent on marketing New York City to the world than to those already living and working within the City. We believe policy interventions geared toward addressing place-based concerns of the executives themselves may have been more effective in achieving policy objectives than were the policies actually implemented.</p>
<p>We emphatically do not believe that attention to place alone will produce good policy but rather that the unpredictable nature of terrorism necessitates a multifaceted approach to responding that includes place. We suggest throughout this paper that postterrorism urban policy—or any policy for that matter—should include a grounded, qualitative dimension to prevent the worst effects of managerialism and domination by a singular view such as those promulgated by the transnational capitalist class.</p>
<p>We have also shown that local context is an important concept for understanding possible policy responses. Thinking about context in the postterrorism city will lead to policies that recognize linkages and opportunity structures important for businesses—but also for urban resiliency. Understanding context is directly related to understanding the role of place in postterrorism policy, for context is effectively the local milieu, political, and institutional structure that shapes any experience of place. Our analysis leads us to conclude that rather than directing policy funds toward competition against other jurisdictions, a more effective approach for building urban resiliency would reward businesses that undertake actions to encourage resiliency (such as the space sharing and loan leniency efforts discussed above). Studying local context will illuminate what these actions might be.</p>
<p>Indeed, keeping the policy analyst’s focus on the microgeographies of the city is the final recommendation of this paper. While critical approaches to urban policy have emphasized the negative effects of managerialism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412457542">Cochrane 2007</xref>), such as decision making absent direct linkages to the communities served, we argue that these linkages can and should be created by scaling down the study to begin with the microgeographies of the city. We are not the first to pick up the relevance of this theme for urban policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078087412457542">McGuire and Schneck (2010)</xref> have argued that emergency managers must adopt a multiscalar, interdisciplinary approach to improve disaster management. In the same way, attention to the complexity of scale, place, and space by policy theorists and practitioners will ensure that the urban geographies of the city—the geographies that hold the processes and experiences of everyday life—are not ignored.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the executives we have studied are a privileged lot, and their work is in many ways structurally responsible for global conditions that garner terrorism. It is not our intention to make lives easier for the privileged or to perpetuate destabilizing inequality, but rather to ensure that public resources are invested in ways likely to improve city life for groups of people larger than just financial executives. When policy makers appreciate the importance of the microgeographies of the city in terrorism policy they may be more likely to avoid direct handouts to the wealthy, diminish competitive economic development wars for relocating business, and instead craft policy that diminishes fear and improves urban places for many.</p>

<p>The concept of quartering the city is taken from Marcuse, though he did not discuss terrorism policy explicitly. Rather, he was concerned with the process of urban restructuring, and various practices and policies that created a segregated city. We, however, recognize Marcuse’s prompt to think critically about any process that creates divisions within the city, as well as the implications for society given the creation of such divisions. Thus, we want to signal our incorporation of that critical perspective vis-à-vis the post-9/11 terrorism policies and their divisive qualities.</p></fn>

<p>Brash uses the words of West Side residents to capture the essence of place held by residents of New York City. By communicating these ideas about place, he explains that elite planning failed because it misunderstood this other conceptualization of place. The Bloomberg Administration’s policy articulations were overly informed by an idea of place as primarily a source of economic growth.</p></fn>
