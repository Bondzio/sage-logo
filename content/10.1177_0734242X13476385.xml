<p>It can be safely argued that the production and use of solid recovered fuels (SRF) is an area where ‘science meets practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X13476385">Hansen and Newman, 2012</xref>). The potential to return fuels prepared from solid waste materials in a new virtuous cycle forces us to consider their position in the emerging landscape of resource efficiency. Can SRF be a quality assured, customizable, de- polluted, transportable, storable, partly renewable and climate neutral source of energy as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels? Have the standardization efforts of the last 10 years in Europe started to deliver the desired progress?</p>
<p>A special issue of <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> (April 2012, 30(4)) recently re-assessed the state-of-the-art on SRF, drawing widely from experience so far ‘hidden’ in the German-language literature, as it has been in those countries that this new SRF cycle has been pioneered. The editorial summarized the old challenges and highlighted specific aspects of recent progress.</p>
<p>An initial disaster cycle for refuse-derived fuels (RDF) was effectively closed by the early 1990s; indeed the term ended up denoting a low-quality fuel and/or absence of quality checks. The challenges around RDF at that time were not significantly different to those of today. The recommendations of an excellent book <italic>Waste Sorting and RDF Production in Europe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X13476385">Barton et al., 1985</xref>), which summarized the then state of the art, still sound all too familiar. That cycle of activity was completed within a slightly different set of prevailing societal values that were driving solid waste management. In the 1970s, resource efficiency had just re-emerged as a driver for managing wastes, the recycling rates of European countries starting building on low initial levels; it had yet to reach today’s obsession, condensed in buzzwords, phrases and notions such as: ‘zero waste’, ‘sustainable consumption and production’, ‘cradle-to-cradle’, ‘closed-loop recycling’, ‘circular economy’ – and so on. Similarly, it was not until the last 10 years that the fear of global climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions started to frequently be driving policy initiatives (‘low-carbon’).</p>

<title>Advanced material flow management</title>
<p>In a resource-efficient society, recovering value from materials should be maximized on a systems and inter-generational justice level. However, despite the wider acceptance of the waste processing hierarchy as a generic policy instrument, a ladder of recovery of value/resource efficiency is far from scientifically established, and in any case not rigid and/or necessarily universal. Naive and scientifically ungrounded advertising slogan-like concepts such as ‘zero-waste’ (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X13476385">Ragossnig (2006))</xref> do not cast much light. The framework for a technically feasible, environmentally and financially sustainable level of recycling is openly debated (particularly for the maze of waste plastics, where upstream innovation on recyclability is desperately needed). SRF can be a practical and environmentally safe outlet for recovering value from the non-sustainably recyclable waste fraction.</p>
<p>SRF is a product of advanced management of material flows, taking place in mechanical–biological treatment (MBT) plants, processing unrecycled residual wastes. Mechanical processing concentrates suitable waste components into a prepared de- polluted, combustible fraction; dry recyclables may also be recovered, if suitable. At the same time, separating out polluting fractions is also necessary, for which suitable ‘sinks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X13476385">Brunner and Tjell, 2012</xref>) are only landfills or combustion in energy from waste (EfW) plants. There is a trade-off between SRF yield and quality. To address the need for as low a chlorine (Cl) content as feasible in SRF (the main technical show-stopper) it is necessary to discard a long list of high Cl items. This advance has recently been made feasible through chemically based sorting, such as near infra-red scanning, enabling selective removal of contaminating PVC items from the SRF stream – another manifestation of human innovation – enabling sorting on characteristics beyond the physical–mechanical properties, which previously had been the only option available.</p>

<title>Manufacturing and quality management</title>
<p>The poor capability of MBT plants for chemically based separation is also exacerbated by a lack of good manufacturing practices, not least quality management. Therefore manufacturing industries, including the automotive, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and food processing sectors, carefully select their raw materials and apply advanced process control engineering and quality management to the outputs. It would not be libellous to argue that in comparison, despite intense recent progress, mechanical waste processing in MBTs remains an ‘art’. Feedstock cannot be effectively chosen, or controlled, and is highly variable and contaminated. There is only limited understanding of the process output, no regular sampling and testing of the SRF properties against a comprehensive statistical quality control scheme, and often not even the use of basic quality control charts. Even where quality controls are applied, there is no guarantee that a specific plant flow-sheet would be effective in delivering the desired SRF quality. Plant design remains largely semi-empirical, necessitating retrofitting beyond the commissioning stage. However, if it were possible to characterize the material flows within MBT plants in-line and in real time, without the need to collect, process and analyse solid samples, a new glorious era could emerge, to transform mechanical waste processing into mainstream manufacturing. <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> welcomes manuscripts aimed at covering this limiting factor in waste process engineering.</p>

<title>Energy efficiency, transport, climate-neutrality</title>
<p>Assuming it is possible to customize the SRF to the quality specification requested by the end-user industry and guarantee its constant quality, a dependable product that can replace fossil fuels in cement/lime kilns, power plants and steel furnaces then emerges. It may be that such an SRF has reached the end-of-waste status as permitted, for instance, in the revised EU waste framework directive – or at least meeting the CEN TC/343 quality management requirements.</p>
<p>Resource resilience which comes with local availability, ability to transport and have long-term storage of SRF is a key part of its attractiveness. Storability for MSW-derived SRF is achieved typically via reducing its moisture content to levels inhibiting further biodegradation. Bio-drying technology has mastered the heat released in aerobic decomposition, thereby in the last 15 years replacing the inefficient and costly fossil fuel dryers that were used back in the 1980s to produce RDF, a major breakthrough towards efficiency. Having a market need, meeting quality criteria as a fuel product and being transportable turns SRF into a viable commercial commodity with perhaps even a positive financial value in certain cases, and still, in most cases, much more affordable than the fossil fuels that they replace – although, natural gas prices in the USA are currently very low.</p>
<p>In 2013, the trans-boundary trade of SRF in Europe is a reality. Interestingly, life-cycle analysis studies consistently indicate that the CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions released during SRF production in MBT plants and transport to other European countries are minor in comparison with the savings from replacing fossil fuels with a partly biogenic SRF (typically 50% or more, on a carbon basis). CO<sub>2</sub> savings depend on SRF composition and striking the right balance between the fossil, but high in calorific value, content of plastics and the biogenic fraction, which is low in calorific value, is a critical choice for SRF users and therefore plant designers and operators.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, along with the local thermal recovery capacity available, it is the national policies/fiscal measures that primarily motivate the trans-boundary trade in SRF, such as prevailing high landfill taxes coupled with lack of suitable off-takers in the UK, for example. As a result, guaranteeing SRF quality and enforcing it becomes paramount.</p>
<p>Local outlets offering high energy conversion efficiency, such as power plants/cement kilns, are probably the ideal SRF destination, because this enables recovery of the energy content of waste to be maximized, and the ash content can be typically used as pulverized fuel ash or is incorporated into the clinker, respectively. Adhering to the proximity principle is desirable but not a fundamental necessity for recovery. By processing MSW into a de-polluted SRF, about 25% (indicative value) of the energy content of the residual MSW is lost. It is still to be determined whether this loss is sufficiently compensated by the higher energy efficiency of, for example, cement kilns and power plants in comparison with traditional combustion of the entire unprocessed residual waste stream in combined heat and power EfW plants. On the same dilemma, optimizing economics, from macro-economic activity to specific waste processing systems level should also be considered.</p>
<p>For the future, there is the prospect of utilizing SRF in plants designed to convert this processed waste into advanced storable energy carriers as well. These options include: production of bio-jet fuel through plasma-arc gasification and use of the long established Fischer–Tropsch process to convert gases to liquid fuel or gasification to supplement fossil fuel natural gas resources in order to improve local sustainability for gas supplies.</p>
<p>SRF production and its thermal recovery exemplify the excellent possibilities and challenges in advancing the energy and materials resource efficiency, to which everyone aspires. Detailing such a vision still remains highly problematic. Despite this daunting prospective we argue that the SRF case in many ways demonstrates the substantial advances of the solid waste management sector over the last 10 years, bringing the waste industry ever closer to the manufacturing and energy production sectors. Who said resource efficiency is just a ‘buzzword’?</p>
