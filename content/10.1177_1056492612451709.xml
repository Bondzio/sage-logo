<p>Well, here we go! For those of you who know Walt Nord, you probably know him as a mild-mannered guy, a longstanding diplomatic figure in the Academy of Management who is pleasant and polite to everyone he meets. A true old-school gentleman. Well, you can forget all that for the next few minutes. Walt apparently has a bit of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde about him. The estimable Mr. Hyde lurks in the next few pages and he’s coming after you . . . especially if you are one of the purveyors or acceptors of a couple of venerable institutionalized norms in our field. If you are among those who hold a certain reverence for the ubiquitous null-hypothesis test or if you are a party to the current over-the-top obsession with theoretical contribution in our scholarly work, then get ready. Dr. Nord/Mr. Hyde has your number and is out to make you squirm a tad. On the other hand, if you are someone who simply likes reading a provocative little essay from a stealth provocateur who takes some professional delight in skewering a couple of sacred cows, then this one is for you, too.</p>
