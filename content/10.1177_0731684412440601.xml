<abstract>
<p>Aircraft repair is gaining importance for extending the fatigue life of aging aircrafts and also for improving its structural integrity. Among various repair techniques, bonded composite repair is mostly preferred. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element analysis is carried out to study and compare the performance of single- and double-sided patch on center-cracked aluminum panel. The effects of different parameters such as patch layup, patch thickness and patch material on the stress intensity factor is highlighted. It is shown that the mechanics of double-sided repair is completely different from the single-sided repair. Also, it is found that double-sided repair is more efficient than single-sided repair. In case of single-sided repair, alternative patch material like unbalanced lamina or transversely graded material is proposed. It is observed that there is significant reduction of stress intensity factor with transversely graded patch in case of single-sided repair.</p>

<p>During the service life of an aircraft, it is subjected to severe structural and aerodynamic loads that result from repeated landings and takeoff, fatigue, ground handling, bird strikes and environmental degradation such as stress corrosion. However, due to limited budgets and escalated procurement costs in replacing the aircraft, aircrafts need to be put in service beyond their design life. Hence, a repair or reinforcement of damaged aircraft is essential to improve its service life. These repairs can be possibly achieved by using bonded patches made of unidirectional composite over the cracked area. The bonded repair reduces stresses in the cracked region and prevents the crack from opening and therefore from growing. The fiber composite patches have improved directional stiffness, high durability under cyclic loading, low density and excellent formability. Repair of aircraft aluminum structures using composite patch has been initiated by Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412440601">1</xref></sup> in the early 1970s mainly in order to enhance fatigue life of cracked components. From geometrical consideration, bonded repairs fall into two categories: double-sided (symmetric) and single-sided (asymmetric). In most of the practical cases, both sides of the cracked panels are not available to perform a symmetrical repair. Therefore, single-sided repair is often adopted such as in case of aircraft wings. This asymmetric repair causes a significant bending field which increases the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip beyond the value compared to unrepaired panel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412440601">2</xref></sup> This bending stress reduces the repair efficiency and hence static strength or fatigue life of the repaired model gets lower. Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412440601">3</xref></sup> developed theoretical and design aspects for predicting the loss in efficiency due to single-sided repair. Over the last two decades, an enormous development has taken place in the field of finite element analysis (FEA) and in particular its application to composite repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412440601">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412440601">12</xref></sup> Umamaheswar and Ripudiman Singh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412440601">4</xref></sup> performed finite element modeling and analysis of single-sided patch repairs applied to thin aluminum sheets. They showed the SIF variation through the thickness of the panel assuming straight crack front. Chukwujekwu Okafor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412440601">5</xref></sup> developed a finite element model for analyzing the stress distribution of cracked plates repaired with a single-sided octagonal patch. They found that the zone of maximum stress shifted from the crack front (for cracked specimen) to the edge of patch (for the patched specimen) because of high peel stress development at overlay edge. Marie Laetitia Pastor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412440601">6</xref></sup> have conducted experimental and numerical investigation of damaged and undamaged specimens patched with carbon epoxy composite material. They observed that failure of the repaired model occurs when the maximum shear stress in adhesive is close to its maximum shear strength.</p>
<p>There are only few investigations available on repaired panels having mixed-mode crack condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412440601">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412440601">12</xref></sup> Hosseini-Toudeshky et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412440601">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412440601">8</xref></sup> have carried out fatigue crack growth tests for single-sided, repaired thick and thin panels containing inclined center cracks with different layup configuration and patch thickness. Not much discussion exists in their studies on how to reduce the higher SIF value at unpatched surface. Ayatollahi and Hashemi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412440601">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412440601">10</xref></sup> have done FEA to investigate the effect of composite patching on the SIF reduction for an inclined center crack panel under different mixed loading case. Bachir Bouiadhra et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412440601">11</xref></sup> have conducted FEA to estimate SIF in single- and double-sided repairs in mode I and mixed-mode edge-cracked panels. They have shown that the adhesive and patch properties have a significant and beneficial effect on the symmetrical patch. All these previous work do not thoroughly investigate the effect of bending in case of asymmetric repair which in turn causes the peaking of stresses at the unpatched side generating higher SIF. Recently, Ramji et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412440601">12</xref></sup> have investigated that in the case of an asymmetrical patch, at the unpatched surface, the SIF value exceeds the value of SIF obtained in unrepaired panel. Therefore, reducing the static strength of the repaired panel. The peel stresses in bonded joints normally peaks at the end of the overlap, which in turn can cause failure of the adhesive layer; thereby, reducing the performance of the repair. To avoid the severity of these peel stresses occurring at the overlapped ends, Duong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412440601">13</xref></sup> suggested usage of tapered patch.</p>
<p>In the present work, an elaborate study involving FEA has been conducted to investigate the effects of composite reinforcement on the fracture strength of a panel under mode I and mixed-mode conditions. The crack tip SIF, mode I (<italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>) and mode II (<italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub>) are determined using <italic>J</italic>-integral values. Comparison of the performance of both single- and double-sided repair has been carried out by varying very important parameters like patch thickness, layer angles and patch material and so on. The SIF is quantified corresponding to every parameter variation. The tapering of patch edge is also done to reduce the peel stress at the overlay edge.</p></sec>

<p>The typical model for the cracked specimen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412440601">Figure 1</xref>. The panel is made of aluminum alloy 2024 T3 plate with dimensions of 39 × 160 × 3.175 mm<sup>3</sup> and contains an inclined center crack ‘2<italic>a</italic>’ of length 10 mm. The crack is inclined at an angle of β = 45° with the horizontal as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412440601">Figure 1</xref>. The plate is subjected to an uniaxial load of 15 kN (σ = 121.11 MPa). The boron/epoxy composite is bonded asymmetrically and symmetrically using FM-77 film adhesive material. The dimensions of the composite patch is considered as 25 × 25 × 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. The layer thickness of the laminate is taken as 0.375 mm. The general material properties of aluminum panel, composite patch and adhesive are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412440601">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-0731684412440601"><title>Modeling of the cracked panel</title>
<p>Finite element method is the most effective tool for computing SIF in 3D fracture models. Modeling and analysis is done using ANSYS 12.1 which is a commercially available FEA package. For capturing very high stress gradient near the crack tip, super fine meshing has been done around the crack tip as recommended in Ref. [12]. Initially, individual areas are created around the crack tip and meshed with plane element having eight nodes. In the present analysis, the radial extent of the outer most nodes is 0.8766<italic>t</italic> and the crack tip element size is 0.0005 <italic>t</italic>. The crack tip mesh has a total of 7128 elements (36 circumferential, 33 radial; 6 elements through the thickness) around the crack tip region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412440601">Figure 3</xref>(a)). Outside the disk, a structured area mesh has been done in the panel as per the dimensions given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412440601">Figure 1</xref>. Later, all the areas are extruded in thickness direction to generate volume. Finally, all the generated volumes are meshed with 20-noded solid-186 element through sweep mode as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412440601">Figure 3</xref>(b). A tensile load of 15 kN is being applied as a pressure load of 121.11 MPa on the top surface of the panel and the bottom face is arrested. The panel, patch and adhesive are modeled with the same 20-noded solid-186 element as per the dimensions. Then, <italic>J</italic>-integral values for the unrepaired panel are directly obtained from the ANSYS. From the <italic>J</italic>-integral values, <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> are estimated as mentioned in previous section. The area meshing of patch and adhesive is generated similar to the panel so that it can be easily coupled with respect to each other at the interface. In the thickness direction, the panel is meshed with six elements, adhesive with two elements and patch with four elements.

<sec id="sec6-0731684412440601"><title>Modeling and analysis of the repaired panel</title>
<p>As patch is made of composite laminate having different layup orientation, the layer angles are defined by assigning element coordinate system to the patch elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412440601">15</xref></sup> Each layer is assigned one element in thickness direction. It is assumed that patch is perfectly bonded to panel by the adhesive. Appropriately, the nodes are coupled at the respective interfaces to reflect the perfectly bonded behavior. During coupling, all the three degrees of freedom are coupled. The total number of elements in single-sided and double-sided repair configurations is 43,536 and 57,480, respectively (in case of panel with straight crack). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412440601">Figure 4</xref>(a) and (b) shows the finite element model of single-sided repaired panel having straight and inclined center crack. Similar boundary conditions mentioned in the previous section is applied to the repaired panel. Later, SIFs are estimated using the same approach as discussed previously.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412440601">Figure 5</xref> shows the SIF distribution through the thickness of the panel having straight center crack. In this work, both analytical SIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412440601">16</xref></sup> and numerical values (from FEA) is being compared. Looking at the figure, one can see that there is a reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at edge and peaks at the center of the panel in case of numerical SIF values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412440601">Figure 5</xref>). This is because of the corner singularity effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412440601">16</xref></sup> The order of corner singularity is different from the crack tip therefore there is a reduction of SIF at the edges. It is also shown that the SIF obtained is very close to analytical SIF, confirming the adequacy of the mesh considered. Thus, mesh considered is good enough for further analysis and the same pattern is considered for 45° cracked panel.

In case of single-sided repair, from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412440601">Figure 6</xref>(a) and (b), it is clear that <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> is lower and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> is maximum for the patch layup configuration of [−45]<sub>4</sub>, but <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> are lower for the patch layup configuration of [90]<sub>2</sub>/[0]<sub>2</sub> as compared to the balanced patch layup configuration of [90]<sub>4</sub>. The effect of layup configuration [−45]<sub>2</sub>/[45]<sub>2</sub> is same as that of [−45]<sub>4</sub>. In case of double-sided patch repair, the variation of the SIF value is symmetric for all patch configurations and is minimum for the patch layup configuration of [90]<sub>4</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412440601">Figure 6</xref>(c) and (d)). As previously explained, unbalanced laminate leads to debonding and is generally not preferred. But for better understanding and comparative study, both [90]<sub>4</sub> and [90]<sub>2</sub>/[0]<sub>2</sub> configurations are considered in case of single-sided repair and only [90]<sub>4</sub> configuration is considered for double-sided patch repair.

<sec id="sec10-0731684412440601"><title>Variation of SIF in repaired model</title>
<p>SIF variation through the thickness for a single-sided and double-sided patch model being compared to unrepaired panel having straight center crack is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412440601">Figure 7</xref>. This figure clearly indicates a drastic reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> about 70% in case of double-sided patch and the variation is symmetric through the thickness of the panel. In case of single-sided patch, because of out-of-plane bending, the <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> is more at unpatched surface and even it exceeds <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> value of unrepaired panel. The reason for this is behavior is explained in next paragraph. But, not much work has been done to address this issue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440601">Figure 8</xref> shows the variation of SIF (<italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub>) along the panel thickness for both single- as well as double-sided patch model being compared with unrepaired panel having a crack inclination angle of 45°. In double-sided repair and unrepaired panels, the <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> values are lower and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> values are higher at the edges when compared to the center of the panel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440601">Figure 8</xref>(a) and (b)). As a crack intersecting a free surface in a 3D model, the order of singularity weakens and it is different from the crack tip singularity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412440601">16</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440601">Figure 8</xref> shows that there is a reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> about 70% in case of double-sided patch and the variation is symmetric through the thickness of the panel. In case of single-sided repair, at the unpatched surface there is a reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> about 8% as compared to unrepaired panel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440601">Figure 8</xref>(b)). But, the value of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> obtained for a single-sided patch model at the unpatched surface is higher than the unrepaired model and double-sided patch model. This is due to existence of out-of-plane bending which in turn causes higher <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at the unpatched surface and a similar trend has been observed in Ref. [17]. This trend has been observed because of linearly increasing bending stress (σ<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>) across the panel thickness. The variation of bending stress (σ<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>) through the thickness of the panel is linearly increasing in case of single-side repaired model and is constant in case of unrepaired and double-side repaired model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412440601">Figure 9</xref>). This linear variation of (σ<italic><sub>y</sub></italic>) in turn causes SIF to vary linearly across the thickness. Therefore, design consideration for single- and double–sided patch repair has to be different and must be addressed individually as their fundamental behaviors are completely different. Also, because of higher SIF at unpatched surface, the static strength of the panel gets reduced. Therefore, in this work, usage of unbalanced laminate and transversely graded material (TGM) as patch material is being attempted to reduce <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at unpatched surface so that the static strength and fatigue life can be improved.

<p>In case of double-sided repair, SIF reduction is very prominent and the composite patch works very effectively. But, there are few issues in case of single-sided repair mainly higher SIF (<italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>) value at the unpatched surface because of its increasing linear trend across the thickness. Subsequent part of the manuscript will deal with single-sided repair analysis with a focus on reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> value at the unpatched surface for improving its static strength.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412440601"><title>Effect of patch thickness</title>
<p>In this section, effect of patch thickness on SIF reduction is studied. The patch is having different number of lay and each layer is of thickness 0.375 mm. Also, the layer orientation is 90°, so that they are aligned parallel to the loading direction thereby maximizing load-carrying capacity. The SIF (both <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub>) variation through the thickness of the panel for a single-sided repaired model with varying number of layers is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412440601">Figure 10</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412440601">Figure 10</xref>(a), it is evident that as the patch thickness increases, <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> value at the unrepaired side decreases. It is the also same with <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> but not much variation is seen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412440601">Figure 10</xref>(b)). This reduction in SIF value is because of additional reinforcement over the crack zone (i.e. more load transfer through the patch) with an increased number of layers in the patch. Also, greater reduction of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> has been observed in the eight lay configuration compared to other two configurations. Still, <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at the unpatched surface is more than the unrepaired value and also the order of the patch thickness is comparable to panel thickness in the case of eight layers. Hence, increasing layer thickness seems not to be a possible solution for the reduction of SIF at unrepaired surface in case of single-sided repair. Therefore, authors are suggesting usage of unbalanced laminate or TGM as an alternate patch material for possible reduction of SIF at unpatched surface.

<sec id="sec12-0731684412440601"><title>Effect of unbalanced laminate and TGM</title>
<p>To reduce the in-plane stresses in the single-sided repair, unbalanced laminate ([90]<sub>2</sub>/[0]<sub>2</sub> and [90]<sub>2</sub>/[45]<sub>2</sub>) and TGM are considered as patch materials. The unbalanced laminate of chosen configuration will introduce counter bending effect, so that the SIF would reduce at unpatched surface. But as discussed previously, the laminate debonds much before failure of panel. To overcome this drawback, the authors have proposed TGM as the patch material. TGM is considered as the nonhomogeneous material whose elastic modulus varies continuously along the thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412440601">18</xref></sup> This material is new and very much at the development stage. In this work, TGM is used as patch material which is having a linear variation of elastic modulus across the thickness and two different variations are considered: one with the (<italic>E</italic>) variation of 200–250 GPa and other with 300–450 GPa. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412440601">Figure 11</xref>(a) and (b) shows the variation of <italic>E</italic> across the patch thickness. For comparative purpose, results obtained from using both TGM and unbalanced laminate are shown here.

Thus, TGM proved a good alternative for unbalanced laminate. Also, debonding will not happen in case of the patch made of TGM material and it is one of the added advantages, compared to unbalanced laminate. Hence, TGM is found to be a better option for the patch material in the case of single-sided repair.

<sec id="sec13-0731684412440601"><title>Effect of tapered patch</title>
<p>The key interest in the composite repair is the adhesive stress concentrations at the extremities of the load transfer regions. Patch debonding occurs due to development of high peel stress (σ<italic><sub>z</sub></italic>) at the overlap end. To minimize these peel stresses, a tapering (20:1) is provided along the patch edge. The variation of peel stress along the panel length from the overlap end with different patch material (having same tapering ratio) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684412440601">Figure 13</xref>(a). Schematic representation of location of the peel stress distribution in the bonded repair is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684412440601">Figure 13</xref>(b). It can be observed that at the overlap end, peel stress reduces compared to straight edge patch. It is shown that in case of asymmetric laminate with layup configurations [90]<sub>2</sub>/[0]<sub>2</sub> and [90]<sub>2</sub>/[45]<sub>2</sub>, peel stresses are high as compared to other tapered patch materials. Because in case of asymmetric laminate, the loading is off axis and it leads to development of high peel stress at the overlap edge. It can be further observed that there is a reduction in peel stress of about 60% in case of the tapered patch made of TGM compared to the straight edge patch model having [90]<sub>4</sub> configuration.

<p>A 3D FEA is carried out to compare the performance of single- and double-sided patch on center-cracked aluminum panel. It is found that the behavior of single-sided repair is completely different from the double-sided repair. In case of double-sided repair, there is a drastic reduction in SIF as compared to the unrepaired panel and its variation is symmetric through the thickness of the panel. On the contrary, in case of single-sided repair, <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at the unpatched surface exceeds the value obtained in the unrepaired panel due to out-of-plane bending. The variation of both <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> is not symmetrical through the thickness of the panel. In case of single-sided repair, to alleviate SIF especially <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at unpatched surface, patch thickness is increased. As patch thickness increases, the stiffness of the patch increases aiding in more load transfer and hence both <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>II</sub> values get reduced, especially <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> at the unpatched surface. But, the reduction is low and also the patch thickness becomes comparable to plate thickness. Hence, an attempt is made to use unbalanced laminate with layup configurations [90]<sub>2</sub>/[0]<sub>2</sub> and [90]<sub>2</sub>/[45]<sub>2</sub> for single-sided repair. But not much reduction in <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> value is observed at the unpatched side. To overcome this, authors have proposed the use of TGM as patch material. It is shown that TGM patch reduces the <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> value at the unpatched surface by 15% compared to the balanced and unbalanced lamina. Hence, TGM is preferred as patch material in case of single-sided repair and also it does not debond that easily compared to unbalanced lamina. Bonding a composite patch shifts the maximum stress from the crack front to the patch edges and there is every chance that it will fail from overlay edge. Therefore, tapering is provided at the patch edges for reducing the peel stress and it showed a significant reduction with the tapered edge. Among different patch materials, TGM showed the maximum reduction.</p></sec>
