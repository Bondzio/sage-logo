<body>
<p>In his 2011 article, ‘Managing the elite consensus’, Florian Zollmann takes issue with a number of arguments put forward in <italic>Pockets of Resistance: British News Media, War and Theory in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). This book was the end-product of a research project<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512444354">1</xref></sup> that examined UK television news and press coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, focusing mainly on the invasion phase (mid-March to mid-April). Our central conclusions were that most UK news outlets, for reasons of <italic>humanitarian warfare ideology</italic>, over-reliance upon <italic>official sources</italic>, and <italic>patriotism</italic>, failed to maintain their independence (pp.161–172). But we also noted that there were exceptions, and, due to factors such as <italic>professional autonomy, event-driven news</italic> and UK <italic>media-system characteristics</italic>, a minority of media outlets (<italic>Channel 4 News, The Mirror, The Guardian</italic> and <italic>The Independent</italic>) were able to exercise meaningful levels of independence from the government position (pp.172–176). We also noted that both <italic>patriotism</italic> and <italic>humanitarian warfare ideology</italic> were limiting factors on the degree of independence exercised by these media outlets (p.177). In criticising our account, Zollmann argues that by over-measuring media criticism, we incorrectly claim that UK media performance deviated, on occasions and across a minority of media outlets, from the predictions of elite-driven accounts of media-state relations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444354">Herman and Chomsky, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In this response, we first identify several issues in need of clarification and correction. We then pick up and expand on the matter of procedural vs substantive media criticism, and how this relates to arguments over media performance and the extent to which that performance can be understood as reflective of elite debate. In this respect, Zollmann’s article, and the discussion of his own important findings in the case of the 2004 US attack on Fallujah, raise important issues about how to assess different forms of media criticism. In addressing these issues, we propose a solution to dichotomous arguments over what counts as media criticism that challenges elites, and also reiterate the call for more nuanced theoretical approaches to understanding media–state relations. The response proceeds in four stages: first, we address Zollmann’s argument that our findings regarding independent media coverage were merely a reflection of elite dissensus; second, we address Zollmann’s claims that we fail to theorise the role of corporate elites; third, we discuss what counts as procedural and substantive-level media criticism. Fourth, and finally, we highlight the importance of refining existing theoretical accounts.</p>
<sec id="section1-1742766512444354">
<title>1 On elite consensus/dissensus and the possibilities for independent and oppositional media</title>
<p>With respect to the elite-driven model and elite consensus/dissensus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">Zollmann (2011a</xref>: 264) argues that there was in fact elite dissensus during the Iraq war, therefore indicating that our findings of media independence are actually fully explicable via the elite-driven model because it allows for media criticism when elites are in disagreement. Media criticism during elite dissensus, for Zollmann, is largely a reflection of elite disagreement, and, moreover, ‘instrumental for elite interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">Zollmann, 2011a</xref>: 267). As such, Zollmann is claiming that media criticism during elite dissensus cannot be taken as evidence of genuine media independence. Two issues are raised here.</p>
<p>First, although we refer to there being high levels of elite debate during the Iraq war in the opening pages of <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic>, our argument, as we explain clearly in the body of the book, is that during the invasion the major political parties closed ranks in support of the war and British troops. Whilst there continued to be some elite dissent (notably MPs George Galloway and Robin Cook), the overall picture was one of a more, rather than less, unified political elite during this period, and, despite this, examples of independent and oppositional media coverage did occur.</p>
<p>Second, the way that Zollmann presents media criticism as a largely passive reflection of elite dissensus underplays the scope for genuine media independence under conditions of elite dissensus. The point here is that even if media criticism emerges only when elites are arguing over policy, there remains the important question of whether news media simply reflect that elite debate, often in a way instrumental to elite interests, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512444354">Zollmann (2011b)</xref> argues, or whether the elite dissensus actually creates greater scope for journalists to adopt a more genuinely independent stance from political elites. The seminal elite-driven accounts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444354">Hallin (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444354">Bennett (1990)</xref> can be read as suggesting the former. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444354">Hallin (1986)</xref> emphasises the extent to which media criticism of the Vietnam War largely reflected the arguments between the Washington ‘hawks’ and ‘doves’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444354">Bennett’s (1990)</xref> study of US policy towards Central America during the 1980s emphasised the degree to which US media coverage reflected the range of viewpoints expressed across the US legislature and executive (with a heavy preference towards executive viewpoints). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">Zollmann (2011a</xref>: 267) also appears to hold to this view, arguing as he does that the more important task for scholars is to ‘delineate how conflict in press coverage is functional for elite interests’. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444354">Herman and Chomsky (1988)</xref> hint at wider possibilities, arguing that conditions of elite dissensus can open up the space for a more genuinely independent media:
<disp-quote>
<p>We also emphasized the fact that there are often differences within the elite that open up space for some debate and even occasional (but very rare) attacks on the <italic>intent</italic> as well as the tactical means of achieving elite ends. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman, 2000</xref>: 103)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444354">Herman and Chomsky (1988)</xref> do not theorise in any detail those situations, as Herman confirms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">2000</xref>: 111). This is because the propaganda model is ‘less interested in those moments when “normal” relations are disturbed’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444354">Freedman (2009</xref>: 71) puts it. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman (2000</xref>: 107) explains that the propaganda model ‘only claims to offer a broad framework of analysis, a first approximation, that requires modification depending on local and special factors, and that it may be entirely inapplicable in some cases’. So, even if we were to accept that elite dissensus is a precondition for media criticism to emerge, it does not follow that the resulting patterns of media criticism can necessarily be reduced purely to being a passive reflection of elite debate. It is precisely these conditions, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444354">Herman and Chomsky (1988)</xref> identify, and as we theorise, that provide the potential for a more genuinely independent media that does more than simply reflect elite political debate.</p>
<p>To sum up, we disagree with Zollmann in two ways. First, elite dissensus was not a major feature of the political landscape during the invasion phase, and, as such, our findings regarding oppositional media coverage during this period are particularly noteworthy, given the persistence of an anti-war stance amongst some media. Second, even if there had been elite dissensus during the Iraq invasion, this still would not mean that the critical media reporting that we found should be understood merely as a passive reflection of elite debate, and, consequently, instrumental for the elites.</p>

<sec id="section2-1742766512444354">
<title>2 On corporate elites</title>
<p>Zollmann criticises our description of the elite-driven model for failing to ‘theorize corporate elites – who own, fund and control the media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">2011a</xref>: 264) and, because of this, failing to account for the possibility that the negotiated and oppositional coverage we find may have been generated by corporate elites disagreeing over the war. It is true that, when discussing the variety of factors that conjoin to create an elite dominance of the media, we do not explicitly flag up the role of corporate elites in terms of relaying Herman and Chomsky’s <italic>propaganda model</italic> filters regarding the concentration of ownership and advertising reliance of the mass media (although we do discuss their political-economy model when discussing the normative underpinnings of the oppositional model). We do, however, discuss at length the significance of ideological imperatives, including Cold War ‘anti-communism’ and the ‘war on terror’, and how these can work in ways to inhibit media criticism. Implicit in this discussion is the position that ideological imperatives shape coverage according to <italic>both</italic> elite political and economic interests. For example, in our discussion of the elite-driven model, we discuss the impact of anti-communist ideology during Vietnam, which prevented journalists from understanding the war as an anti-colonialist struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 37). Political-economic/corporate explanations for both the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions are also flagged up in our discussion of ideology, where we note that the ‘war on terror’ discourse worked to exclude alternative interpretations of US motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 38). In relation to Iraq, we note how claims regarding the oil issue in Iraq were factored out because of the domination of the ‘war on terror’ discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 38). Finally, one of the central conclusions of the book, discussed at length, is that ideological imperatives remain just as important today as they did during the Cold War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 102–104 and 170–172). Here we say: ‘The international spectre of communism may have departed, but it appears to have been replaced by fresh ways to simplify the world which, in turn, generate an ideological bond between policy makers and journalists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 170). So, it is inaccurate to suggest that our description of the elite-driven model fails to theorise the ways in which vested economic interests (which obviously includes corporate elites) shape media output.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the possibility that the negotiated and oppositional coverage we found may have been generated by corporate elites disagreeing over the war, we also note that corporate interests were a factor in explaining the pro-war press (e.g. Murdoch’s support for the war; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 77). But there are no obvious grounds for thinking that the more independent stance shown by Channel 4 (a public trust), <italic>The Guardian</italic> (owned by the Scott Trust), the <italic>Mirror</italic> and the <italic>Independent</italic> could readily be reduced to particular corporate elites opposing the war.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1742766512444354">
<title>3 On procedural and substantive criticism and what counts as a challenge to political elites</title>
<p>Zollmann argues that we over-measure levels of media independence by counting procedural-level criticism as an indicator of independent and oppositional coverage, even though ‘it has been established that procedural criticisms can be accommodated with an elite-driven model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">2011a</xref>: 263). The issue here concerns the extent to which our study has, first, equated relatively trivial procedural-level criticism – for example, arguments about military tactics, military losses and the state of a military campaign – with independent and oppositional coverage; and, second, failed adequately to assess the extent to which the independent and oppositional media we identified produced substantive-level criticism – for example, challenging the underlying strategic or moral legitimacy of the war. Zollmann’s criticism highlights a need to clarify one confusing aspect of our findings, and we address this first, but the issue raised here also usefully brings to the fore a significant question about how researchers measure media criticism – we address this second.</p>
<p>First, the important area of potential confusion that Zollmann identifies concerns how our basic coding categories for media coverage (supportive, negotiated and oppositional) were used for both procedural and substantive-level issues. As a result, when discussing our results, we write about both <italic>procedural-level</italic> oppositional coverage and <italic>substantive-level</italic> oppositional coverage. On the one hand, this labelling decision was driven by the recognition that mainstream and critical audiences would have very different views on what counts as oppositional coverage. For example, for military and some academic audiences, procedural media criticism of the military campaign would be understood as oppositional, whereas for critical scholars, only substantive-level opposition could be understood as oppositional. This approach, in short, ensured that our analysis of UK media performance was relevant to a full range of interested parties, ranging from the mainstream and pro-establishment through to critical voices. On the other hand, this decision has meant that it is possible to read the discussion of our findings as citing only procedural-level media criticism found in individual <italic>news reports</italic> as evidence for an independent and oppositional media <italic>outlet</italic>. This is not the intention in <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic>.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision to describe a media outlet as either independent or oppositional was not only based upon the balance (supportive, neutral, oppositional) of procedural criticism, but also the balance of substantive-level criticism regarding the government’s WMD (weapons of mass destruction) justification for the war, and the editorial stance towards the war taken by the media outlet in question. So, a media outlet was only described as either independent or oppositional if there were <italic>both</italic> procedural and substantive-level challenges to the coalition. In fact, some of our most important measures of procedural-level framing included identifying coverage that presented a clear challenge to coalition attempts to shore up support for the invasion. For example, our measure concerning the framing of battle stories assessed the extent to which journalists were either reinforcing coalition claims regarding progress, or, alternatively, suggesting no clear outcome or framing the war as being lost. In this sense, our measure of procedural-level criticism here concerned not just arguments over military tactics or troop equipment (classic areas of procedural-level criticism), but also criticism that was presenting a meaningful, and potentially influential, challenge regarding the progress of the war. This brings us to a second and more general point about what counts as procedural and substantive-level criticism.</p>
<p>There are a number of definitions employed across the literature regarding the procedural/substantive distinction and there is not the space here to undertake a detailed discussion on anything other than very general grounds. On the one hand, for some, only media coverage that challenges the representation of their state as a benign and morally upstanding force in the world can be worthy of the label, <italic>substantive-</italic>level criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512444354">Hertog 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman (2000</xref>: 101) refers to this type of ‘substantive-level criticism’ as concerning challenges to basic ‘ideological premises’ and this understanding is clearly one aspect of the predictions of the propaganda model. So, for example, coverage that questions whether a country is acting aggressively, immorally and in its own selfish economic and political interests might be described as substantive-level criticism. Other scholars distinguish between procedural-level debate over the ‘execution and outcome’ of policy and substantive-level debate over the ‘wisdom and justification’ of policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444354">Mermin, 1999</xref>: 9–10). Here, coverage that challenges official justifications for a war, such as questioning ‘key elements’ of ‘official justifications’, is understood as indicative of substantive-level criticism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444354">Althaus, 2003</xref>: 388; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444354">Mermin, 1999</xref>: 46). In discussing the propaganda model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512444354">Herman (1993</xref>: 29, 40; 2000: 101) also implicitly associates debate over the justifications for a war with substantive-level debate, noting as he does that one inspiration for the propaganda model was his and Chomsky’s observation of how US media ‘depend heavily and uncritically on elite information sources and participate in propaganda campaigns helpful to elite interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman, 2000</xref>: 101). So, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman (2000</xref>: 40) describes how US journalists uncritically relayed official claims that Saddam Hussein was about to attack Saudi Arabia (following the invasion of Kuwait in 1990), and, in doing so, allowed the Bush administration to deploy troops to Saudi Arabia. In contrast to substantive-level criticism, procedural-level (or tactical) criticism is agreed by most to include criticism over issues such as military tactics, civilian and military casualties, and also as to whether a war is being won or lost. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444354">Althaus (2003)</xref> has suggested a tripartite categorisation of criticism according to ‘means’ (similar to procedural), ends and contexts (the latter two arguably fall under the substantive-level category).</p>
<p>Whilst acknowledging the utility of the procedural–substantive distinction, what we propose here is a more nuanced and fine-grained approach to this issue. First, it seems appropriate to understand the procedural/substantive issue, not as a dichotomy, but as a continuum. In doing so, it is also useful to think of different types of coverage and the extent to which they pose a significant challenge to elites trying to realise a given policy. At one end of this spectrum lies relatively trivial and non-significant procedural-level criticism of, for example, military tactics, troop levels and equipment quality, controversy concerning ‘friendly fire’ and discussion over delivering humanitarian relief to civilians caught up in a conflict. Because debates over the <italic>effectiveness</italic> of military and humanitarian efforts can arguably be premised on an underlying support for the intentions and activities of military involvement, media criticism here presents little meaningful challenge to the legitimacy and continuation of a war, and, therefore, those elites who are trying to maintain support for the policy. But other types of stories, usually categorised as procedural, can start to produce a greater challenge to political elites: for example coverage of civilians’ deaths, attributing responsibility to those prosecuting the war, coverage of military losses and their impact on families and relatives, and focus on either the uncertainty of military victory or likely failure. All of these types of reporting, whilst not challenging a war in terms of its legitimacy and justification, may start to erode public and political support for those conducting a war, especially over time and after negative coverage has accumulated. In this respect, such coverage is significant and non-trivial. Moreover, to the extent that it starts to provide a challenge to the preferred narratives of those conducting a war, this coverage can be understood as indicative of a level of media independence, and not simply part and parcel of the elite-driven model. As we move to substantive-level criticism, such coverage might include focus on the inhumane consequences of a war, challenges to official justifications for a war, and, at the far end of this continuum, challenging the moral character of the state and the legitimacy of the interests it is pursuing through war. And yet even then, the distinction between the most significant procedural-level criticisms, for example concerning civilian casualties, and substantive-level criticisms, is hard to judge: coverage that highlights the suffering of civilians, whilst laying blame at the door of those prosecuting a war, does not engage directly with substantive-level justifications for a war. But it does clearly impinge upon elite attempts to present a war as clean, necessary and morally upright: in this sense, this kind of coverage of casualties can start to overlap with substantive-level criticism.</p>
<p>In short, the issue of how different forms of procedural and substantive-level criticisms relate to levels of media independence is less straightforward than suggested by a strict procedural/substantive-level distinction. It is better understood as a continuum with coverage ranging from benign criticisms that do little to challenge elite viewpoints, through increasingly challenging levels of procedural criticism (e.g. the more damaging forms of coverage of civilian deaths), towards substantive-level criticisms that question the underlying justification for action and the moral legitimacy of those prosecuting a war. Crucially, the more severe forms of procedural-level criticism, to the extent that they start to undermine the goals of elite policy promotion, <italic>should not</italic> simply be subsumed under the elite-driven model and <italic>should</italic> be understood as indicative of a level of media independence. This argument, emerging from a combination of our operationalisation of media criticism in <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">Zollmann’s (2011a)</xref> criticisms and our response here, is an important new way of thinking about what counts as a media challenge to elites, and is worthy of further exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1742766512444354">
<title>4 On the project of refining existing theoretical accounts</title>
<p>More broadly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444354">Zollmann’s (2011a)</xref> article raises questions about how critical research on media-state relations should proceed. He concludes by stating (pp.266–267) that analysis of how media dissent serves elite interests is more important than analysis that explores independence. We would argue that both are of equal importance. For those who agree with critical scholarship such as that of Herman and Chomsky, exploration of instances where media do not serve the interests of elites is fully condoned in their work, as the earlier quotes have shown. However, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman (2000</xref>: 108), it is important to foreground those powerful constraints acting on media, rather than to start by documenting those rarer aspects of media–state relations that concern media acting against elite interests; this approach is the ‘starting premise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444354">Herman, 2000</xref>: 108) of the propaganda model. We adopted the same approach in <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic>, where we spend almost three times as much space (pp.161–172) documenting the constraints acting on media as we do the exceptions to the rule (pp.172–176). We make clear that the big picture is a story of media failure. But our goal in the conclusion of the book is to refine and develop the elite-driven model by helping to develop our theoretical understanding of precisely those situations where possibilities for independent and oppositional media emerge: one of our concluding arguments is that, by combining the elite model with arguments about media-system characteristics, professional autonomy, event-driven news and field theory, a more comprehensive understanding of media–state relations can be attained. We write (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444354">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>: 17):
<disp-quote>
<p>Field theory provides a productive and holistic approach … In wartime, the influence of ideology, patriotism and political elites, understood either as emanating from fields external to news media (such as the political field) or from macro-level influences such as the nation-state, exert a powerful influence on coverage. At the same time, the field of journalism, possessing some level of autonomy, creates pockets of resistance to those forces which ‘refract rather than simply reflect the play of external forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512444354">Benson, 2006</xref>: 196).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In conclusion, exploring exceptions to the rule in order to develop more nuanced accounts of media–state relations (even if we accept the dominating influence of political and economic power) is a necessary and important activity. Understanding when and how patterns of dominance can vary and alter is one part of equipping those who seek progressive change with more accurate knowledge of how the system works. Understanding variability also contributes to a more thorough-going evaluation of the efficacy of different media systems in producing levels of independence. For those who see academia as involved in providing convincing analyses about the way the world works, accounts which show complexity and nuance are an essential part of empirically grounded and accurate social science. This brings us to a final point: if one maintains that the manufacture of consent is total and that there is never any space for meaningful contestation in the mainstream media, then those parts of <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic> which document the exceptions are to be rejected. But not even Herman and Chomsky adhere to such a position, nor does Zollmann with his interest in the areas of media <italic>consent</italic> and <italic>conflict</italic>, and nor do we. If we accept that exceptions can occur, then the arguments contained in <italic>Pockets of Resistance</italic> should be given serious attention.</p>
