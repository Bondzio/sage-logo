<p><bold>Introduction</bold>. Major surgery is associated with physiologic alterations that may promote tumor growth, and catechins in green tea may inhibit tumor growth. This study’s aim was to assess the impact of a green tea extract on laparotomy wound healing in mice. <bold>Methods</bold>. Mice were randomized to daily oral catechins solution (n = 25) or placebo (n = 20), underwent sham laparotomy after 10 days, and were sacrificed on postoperative day 7 or 21. The peak force and total energy required to rupture the abdominal wall wound, wound collagen content, and histology were assessed. <bold>Results</bold>. There were no wound complications in either group, and mean peak wound rupture forces and collagen concentration were similar.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Surgical resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment for most solid malignancies; however, surgical trauma results in transient systemic physiologic changes that promote the growth of residual tumor early after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612436565">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612436565"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612436565">7</xref></sup> Although anticancer therapy is not currently given during the first postoperative month it would be logical to do so in an attempt to prevent or offset surgery’s tumor stimulatory effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612436565">8</xref></sup> However, because cancer growth and wound healing are similar in some ways, anticancer therapy may inhibit wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612436565">9</xref></sup> It is mainly the fear of impaired healing that has led to the standard 4- to 6-week moratorium on chemotherapy after surgery. What are needed are effective anticancer drugs that do not impair wound healing.</p>
<p>Experimental and in vitro studies have shown that green tea inhibits cancer growth and decreases tumor cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612436565">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612436565"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612436565">14</xref></sup> In addition, human studies also suggest that green tea may have anticancer effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612436565">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612436565"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612436565">19</xref></sup> The active components in green tea are polyphenols, also known as catechins. Polyphenon E (PPE), a green tea extract that contains epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and other catechins has stronger anticancer effects than the tea alone and has minimal systemic effects on healthy volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612436565">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several ongoing clinical trials are currently assessing PPE as a treatment for solid and hematological malignancies. In none of these studies is PPE being used in the perioperative period (month prior to and after surgery). Because it is well tolerated and has minimal toxicity, PPE may be a reasonable drug to give perioperatively. Before it can be used clinically, as mentioned, PPE’s effect on wound healing must be assessed. The aim of this study was to assess PPE’s impact on the healing of the abdominal wound after laparotomy in a murine model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350612436565" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To assess the effect of PPE on wound healing in a rodent model, mice were randomized to receive PPE or placebo via their drinking water for the duration of the experiment. All animals underwent sham laparotomy followed by standard closure of the abdominal wall. A subgroup of animals from each group was sacrificed on postoperative day (POD) 7, whereas the others were euthanized on POD 21. Abdominal wound healing was assessed by tensometry, collagen content measurement, and histopathology.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350612436565">
<title>Reagents</title>
<p>Polyphenon E was supplied by the Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). This is a standardized green tea polyphenol preparation, containing 65% EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), 7% epicatechin-3-gallate, 3% epigallocatechin, 9% epicatechin, 3% gallocatechin gallate, and &gt;0.5% caffeine.</p>
<p>A 1% PPE solution (1 g in 100 mL distilled water) was freshly prepared every other day and protected from light. The solution was supplemented with a sweetener (0.75% Sweet Plus, containing 3.6% saccharin) and provided to the animals as their sole source of drinking water. Control mice were given distilled water supplemented with 0.75% Sweet Plus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612436565">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Forty-five 6-week-old female Balb/cJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study. The mice were maintained at the animal facility of Columbia University, acclimated for a week prior to any study procedure and received food and water ad libitum. Body weight was measured weekly and water/drug consumption was monitored daily. The study was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350612436565">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Mice were randomly divided into control (n = 20) and treatment (n = 25) groups. All mice were treated with drug or placebo for 10 days and then underwent sham laparotomy. Drug or placebo was administered postoperatively until the mice were sacrificed. Ten animals from each group were sacrificed on POD 7 whereas on POD 21 the remaining 10 control mice and 15 PPE mice were sacrificed. The total number of days of PPE exposure was 17 for the POD 7 subgroup and 31 days for the POD 21 subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612436565">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Anesthesia was induced using 4% inhaled isoflurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane. A dose of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously before the laparotomy for analgesia. Under sterile conditions, each mouse underwent a 2-cm midline laparotomy incision. The abdominal cavity was kept open for 20 minutes, with the bowel maintained moist with saline irrigation, after which the abdominal wall was closed with interrupted 4-0 nylon sutures. After recovery, the mice were returned to their cages and given food and water (either PPE or control preparation) ad libitum. Postoperatively, animal were treated with buprenorphine for pain control, which has no known effect on wound healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350612436565">
<title>Abdominal Wound Assessment</title>
<p>The mice were euthanized as per the schedule above. Clinical assessment of wound healing was performed by 2 surgeons evaluating the wound integrity and signs of infection (erythema, swelling, and discharge). Following euthanasia, the abdominal wall was harvested and the sutures removed. Using a custom-built dual-razor cutting device, 4 sections of the abdominal wall (full thickness and 3 mm wide), perpendicular to the wound were excised. Two sections were used for tensometry analysis, 1 section was used for collagen content determination, and 1 section for histology. Tensometry samples were then immersed in saline and kept frozen at −80°C. Samples for collagen content determination were dry blotted, weighed, and stored at −80°C. Samples for histologic analysis were placed in a tissue cassette between biopsy sponges, fixed in 10% formalin, processed, and embedded in paraffin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1553350612436565">
<title>Tensometry</title>
<p>On the day of analysis, the abdominal wall samples were defrosted and kept moist. The 2 ends of each tissue strip were carefully glued to sandpaper tabs, which were then placed in the 0.2 N load cell of an Instron 5848 Tensometer (Instron Corp, Canton, MA). The tensometer then applied an outward force to the ends of the abdominal wall strip, in a direction perpendicular to the wound, until the wound ruptured. The tissue was pulled at a constant rate of 1.5 mm/s and the peak wound bursting force measured in Newton (N). The total energy until wound failure was obtained by calculating the area under the force–displacement curve (N mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1553350612436565">
<title>Collagen Assay</title>
<p>Total collagen content was determined by assaying total soluble collagen with a Sircol Collagen Assay Kit (Biocolor, Northern Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Acid-soluble collagen is synthesized within 7 days from wounding. After this time, covalent cross-links are formed and the collagen becomes insoluble. Therefore, the acid-soluble collagen from the POD 7 samples was extracted with acetic acid whereas the collagen from the POD 21 samples is extracted after the addition of pepsin, which breaks the covalent cross-links (ie, pepsin-soluble collagen). Wound samples (25-30 mg) that included the wound edges were diced into small cubes approximately 2 mm in size, using a scalpel. POD 7 samples were incubated and stirred for 24 hours at 4°C in 2.5 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid containing 2 µL per 10 mg tissue of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St Louis, MO). POD 21 samples were incubated and stirred for 24 hours at 4°C in 2.5 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid containing 1 mg pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St Louis, MO) per 10 mg tissue and then centrifuged at 13 000 rcf for 10 minutes at 4°C. A solution of 100 µL of each supernatant was assayed. One milliliter of Sircol dye reagent that binds to collagen was added to each sample and the solutions were stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 1 mL of the alkali reagent included in the kit and read at 540 nm with a microplate reader. Collagen standard solution was used to construct a standard curve. Collagen content is expressed in micrograms collagen per milligram sample tissue (µg/mg).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1553350612436565">
<title>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate Plasma Levels</title>
<p>This analysis was done to confirm that EGCG was in the blood of the PPE mice at several time points. Blood samples were obtained from 3 animals on PODs 1, 7, and 21 using a retro-orbital puncture technique. After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>EGCG assay: 75 µL of mouse serum was diluted with 325 µL of dPBS + Ca and Mg and 100 µL of a β-glucuronidase solution with sulfatase activity (100 units/µL) and then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Digested serum was extracted 3 times with 2 mL of ethyl acetate per extraction by vortex mixing for 3 to 5 minutes followed by 1-minute centrifugation at 2500 rpm. The upper organic layers of each extraction were combined and evaporated to dryness with nitrogen gas at 37°C. The dried extract was reconstituted with 200 µL of 10:90 methanol:0.2% formic acid (aqueous). Samples were then analyzed for EGCG by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.</p>

<sec id="section11-1553350612436565">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>Four-micrometer thick tissue sections were cut from the paraffin-embedded abdominal wall strips and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichome according to standard procedures. The parameters assessed were as follows: integrity of the epidermis, presence of fibrin clot, extent of inflammatory cell infiltrate, extent of angiogenesis, extent of collagen deposition, and the presence of fibroplasia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612436565">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Mice Weight Change and Water Consumption</title>
<p>Since 1% PPE alters the taste of water, we supplemented both the PPE and the control water with an artificial sweetener. Thus, it was important to monitor both weight and water consumption.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As mentioned, surgery induces physiological changes that may foster the growth of preexisting or new metastases early postoperatively. The following surgery-related changes may stimulate tumor growth: cell-mediated immunosuppression, plasma IGFBP-3 and MMP-9 alterations, and persistent proangiogenic plasma protein changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612436565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612436565">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612436565">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612436565"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612436565">24</xref></sup> Also, it has been shown that plasma from the second and third weeks after cancer resection, in humans, stimulates in vitro proangiogenic endothelial cell behavior (proliferation, migration, and invasion). These conditions, likely related to wound healing, may stimulate tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, viable tumor cells that are shed into the blood stream during cancer resection may form new metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612436565">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612436565">26</xref></sup> In light of the above, a strong case can be made for giving anticancer agents perioperatively to protect patients during the first month after tumor resection. In this regard, conventional chemotherapy is not a good option since most of these agents inhibit mitosis in an indiscriminate manner and would likely impair healing, and increase the rate of wound and anastomotic complications. Thus, less toxic yet effective anticancer agents that do not inhibit wound healing are needed for perioperative use.</p>
<p>The limited toxicity and documented anticancer effects of green tea compounds make them promising perioperative agents. In addition to containing EGCG, both green tea and PPE contains other catechins, including (−)-epigallatecatechin, (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate, and (−)-epicatechin that also have anticancer effects. Nearly 20 human studies assessing green tea compounds are underway; results, thus far, have been inconclusive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612436565">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350612436565"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350612436565"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612436565">31</xref></sup> To date, green tea compounds have not been used immediately prior to or after surgery. Before perioperative green tea trials can be initiated, the impact of green tea compounds on wound healing must be determined.</p>
<p>This study assessed abdominal wound healing in the setting of perioperative PPE ingestion. There were no significant differences between the PPE and control group results with regards to the following parameters: peak bursting force on POD 7 and 21, total energy required for wound rupture on POD 7, collagen content on POD 7 and 21, and 5 of 6 histologic parameters at both time points. Also, as expected, wound tensile strength and collagen content increased to a similar extent from POD 7 to POD 21 in both the PPE and the control groups.</p>
<p>However, significant differences, in favor of the control group, were found on POD 21 with regards to total energy required for wound rupture and the extent of wound fibroplasia (fibroblast proliferation). Also, although the POD 7 results were similar between groups, there was a trend toward less angiogenesis in the PPE wounds on POD 21 (<italic>P</italic> = .059). This latter result corroborates the findings of several investigators who noted that green tea has angiostatic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350612436565">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350612436565">33</xref></sup> Most important, clinically, there were no wound infections or dehiscences noted in the PPE or the control mice, although, this observation was made in a nonblinded fashion. Thus, the limited wound healing differences noted between groups on POD 21 did not translate into clinically detectable problems.</p>
<p>Our application protocol was based on preclinical experiments with PPE from cancer treatment and pharmacological studies. There are a large number of studies, where tumor-bearing mice or rats were treated with PPE. The dose range administered is 0.1% to 2.0%, with most studies using up to 1% PPE. The timeline of PPE administration stems from the definition of the “perioperative period,” that is, just before and after surgery. Because the PPE was delivered via the drinking water it was important to document that the drug was ingested and present in the blood. Ideally, a dose escalation study to determine the relationship between orally ingested PPE and blood PPE levels would have been done; however, this was not feasible for financial and logistical reasons. As an alternative, for a subset of PPE mice at several time points, serum EGCG levels were determined. Unfortunately, the reagents required for the EGCG assay are not commercially available, thus, it was necessary to outsource these analyses which proved to be costly and difficult to obtain. PPE was present in 6 of the 8 serum specimens assessed. With regard to the POD 21 results, in 2 specimens EGCG was not detected. Caffeine, another component of PPE, was found in the same samples, which suggests the mice ingested the PPE water. These results are difficult to explain; however, it has been noted that oral consumption of green tea polyphenols by rodents is associated with a decrease in plasma levels on ingestion day 28.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350612436565">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>No conclusions can be made regarding PPE’s late impact (POD 30-60) on wound healing because the study was completed on POD 21. However, an increase in wound problems 4 to 6 weeks after surgery seems unlikely. This study did not assess bowel anastomoses, thus, no comments can be made regarding PPE’s effect on intestinal healing. Therefore, additional studies are needed to determine the impact of PPE or other green tea compounds on anastomotic and late abdominal wound healing. Also, more thorough assessment of blood EGCG levels is warranted.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that PPE has no discernible effect on abdominal wall wound healing 7 days after surgery yet does have a small inhibitory effect 3 weeks postoperatively with regard to several parameters. The fact that none of the mice in either group had wound complications or problems suggests that the POD 21 differences may not be clinically relevant, at least in this model, since most postoperative wound healing related complications in humans tend to occur earlier in the postoperative course. Further murine studies are warranted; provided the results are supportive, it is hoped that a phase 1 perioperative study in human patients will be initiated.</p>
<p>We have confirmed the presence of the drug in the blood by chromatography and we measured expected levels on POD 1 (day 11 of treatment) and POD 7 (day 17 of treatment). The level on POD 21 (day 31 of treatment) was very low. This phenomenon is described in a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350612436565">34</xref></sup> which showed that oral consumption of green tea polyphenols by mice and rats for more than 14 days lead to a decrease in plasma levels to baseline levels on day 28. The clinical significance of this phenomenon is not clear yet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that power analysis was calculated to detect effect size of 0.7 and the main outcome. Thus, this study may be underpowered to detect small differences in the main outcome, which may be of clinical importance, or to detect differences in secondary outcomes. In addition, effective doses of green tea or tea polyphenol preparations are much higher than the levels of tea constituents obtained from normal tea consumption in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1553350612436565">35</xref></sup> However, if found useful and safe for cancer treatment, medical preparations of green tea extracts in effective doses can be prepared.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that PPE has no effect on wound healing capabilities of rodents’ abdominal wall 7 days after surgery, but does exhibit <italic>an</italic> inhibitory effect on wound healing 3 weeks postoperatively, which may potentially be clinically negligible. Additional studies regarding the effect of PPE on bowel anastomosis healing and leak rate may be required to further assess the safety of this therapy in the perioperative period following colorectal surgery and to allow human trials using green tea compounds as anticancer agents during the perioperative period.</p>
