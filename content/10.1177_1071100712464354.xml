<sec id="section1-1071100712464354">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Achilles tendinopathy is a pathological state resulting from repetitive loading or stress on the tendon. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is hypothesized to be an effective alternative intervention to surgery when other conservative therapies fail. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of ESWT in the treatment of insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712464354">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Articles were electronically searched from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were included if they were prospective clinical trials examining the effectiveness of ESWT for insertional or noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using PEDro scale and Modified McMaster tool. The strength of the evidence was reported using the National Health and Medical Research Council body of evidence framework. A narrative summary of the findings was presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712464354">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Four of the included studies were randomized controlled trials, and 2 were pre-post study designs. Common methodological deficiencies included not blinding the clinician and participants. There was consistent evidence from 4 reviewed studies on the effectiveness of ESWT in the management of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathies at a minimum 3 months’ follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712464354">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Overall, our review showed satisfactory evidence for the effectiveness of low-energy ESWT in the treatment of chronic insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies at a minimum 3 months’ follow-up before considering surgery if other conservative management fails. However, combining ESWT with eccentric loading appears to show superior results.</p>

<body>
<p>Achilles tendinopathy is one of the most frequently encountered overuse injuries, especially in the athletic population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464354">3</xref></sup> accounting for 5% to 18% of all running injuries. Tendinopathy was described by Cook and Purdam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464354">5</xref></sup> as a pathological state of the tendon that results from repetitive loading or stress shielding that may lead to a catabolic effect on tendon integrity. There are 3 stages to tendon pathology: early reactive, disrepair, and degenerative. The management for tendinopathies depends on the stage of pathology and should consider factors such as age, repetitive loading, and the presence of bony spurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464354">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Achilles tendinopathy may involve lesions in the tendoachilles, the enthesis organ, the surrounding peritendinous structure, or a combination of these structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712464354">24</xref></sup> The impairments associated with this condition include loss of muscle power, pain, and stiffness of surrounding soft tissues. As a result, patients with this condition often experience limitations in their ability to walk, run, climb, and perform household activities and sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464354">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, there has been substantial investigation to understand tendon pathophysiology, which has led to a change in management strategies for Achilles tendinopathies. The management of chronic Achilles tendinopathies has shifted from passive inflammation management only to active exercises and pharmacological interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464354">1</xref></sup> Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is a recent addition to the list of management choices and has shown promising outcomes such as a decrease in pain and an improvement in functional scores in managing chronic tendinopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464354">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of systematic reviews have been published in the past 10 years reporting the effectiveness of different management approaches to Achilles tendinopathy. In 2001, McLauchlan and Handoll<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464354">13</xref></sup> reviewed clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of various treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis. This review found insufficient evidence to determine which method of treatment is most appropriate for Achilles tendinitis.</p>
<p>A recent review on insertional Achilles tendinopathy management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464354">9</xref></sup> reviewed both surgical and conservative approaches for treating the condition. This review aimed to include only prospective trials, but it also included 1 retrospective cohort study to review ESWT. A review by Magnussen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464354">12</xref></sup> evaluated the effects of nonsurgical interventions, including ESWT, for noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies. Their review included 2 trials on ESWT, one of which included a mixed population of tendons and could have been excluded according to their mentioned criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464354">6</xref></sup> A guideline published by Carcia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464354">3</xref></sup> addressed Achilles tendinopathy with a wider scope to suggest examination choices and treatment recommendations but included only 2 studies on ESWT. Since there are no high-quality reviews on this topic and methodological issues in the ones available in literature, there is need for a systematic review focusing on the effect of ESWT on both insertional and noninsertional chronic Achilles tendinopathies. This review aimed to explore the effectiveness of ESWT in the treatment of chronic insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy</p>

<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>As a first step in the systematic review process, we framed our review question using the PICOT (population, intervention/exposure, comparison, outcome, time frame) framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712464354">Table 1</xref>). A range of keywords was identified and grouped into 2 categories to ensure that a broad search would be conducted. Category 1 represented key words within the concept of “Achilles tendinitis” (OR “Achilles tendinopathy”). Category 2 represented key words within the concept of “shock wave therapy” (“extracorporeal shock wave therapy” OR “ESWT”). Wildcards and truncations symbols were used as appropriate across different databases.</p>

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>We conducted a comprehensive search using the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Reference lists of all relevant articles were examined for additional studies that may not have been indexed in the electronic databases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1071100712464354">
<title>Study Selection</title>
<p>We considered all experimental designs in this review because of a limited number of studies with high methodological quality. Our review examined studies that investigated the effects of ESWT on insertional and/or noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. Only articles published in English within the past 10 years were included.</p>
<p>Two reviewers independently (H.A. and J.V.S.) scrutinized the titles and the abstracts to determine eligibility for inclusion. Full texts of potentially relevant papers were retrieved for a more detailed examination. The decision to include or exclude studies, based on the set criteria, was made independently by the same authors. Differences in opinions were resolved by discussion until a consensus was reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712464354">
<title>Methodological Quality Assessment</title>
<p>The methodological quality of all included studies was independently assessed by 2 authors (H.A. and J.V.S.). The PEDro scale, which is scored out of 10, was used to examine the quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is an assessment scale of the methodological quality and risk of bias of clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712464354">17</xref></sup> Non-RCTs were assessed using the Modified McMaster Quantitative Critical Appraisal Tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712464354">7</xref></sup> This tool yields a maximum score of 15. It contains a generic quantitative appraisal scale. Differences in scoring between reviewers were resolved by discussion until a consensus was reached.</p>

<title>Data Extraction and Synthesis</title>
<p>The first author (H.A.) extracted data from individual studies and included characteristics of the population studied, description of the intervention, outcomes assessed, and results of individual studies. All extracted data were double-checked by the second author (J.V.S.) for rigor. This extracted data were compiled into a tabular form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712464354">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, this is the first systematic review that reports the effectiveness of ESWT for the treatment of chronic insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies. The evidence for ESWT suggests that it can be considered an alternative to surgery for patients who fail to respond to conservative management. This finding concurs with other systematic reviews that report the effectiveness of ESWT on other conditions, including shoulder calcified tendinitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464354">11</xref></sup> patellar tendinopathies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712464354">22</xref></sup> and chronic proximal plantar fasciitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464354">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Achilles tendinopathy has been shown to cause pain because of the presence of neuropeptides (eg, substance P and calcitonin gene–related peptide [CGRP]) and neurotransmitters (eg, glutamate), altered collagen fiber structure, and increased interfibrillar ground substance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464354">2</xref></sup> Öhberg et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712464354">16</xref></sup> on the other hand, demonstrated the presence of neovessels in pathological tendons using color Doppler and identified them as a potential cause of pain. According to Cook and Purdam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464354">5</xref></sup> Achilles tendinopathy in the late disrepair stage has some chance for reversing the change to cellular matrix, and thus a treatment algorithm focusing on better conservative methods must be tried before surgery is considered. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy fits within this paradigm of treatment. Low-energy ESWT has been speculated in the short term to produce an analgesic effect by altering the permeability of neuron cell membranes and in the long term to increase inflammation by causing increased blood flow in the chronic tendinopathy and improve the symptoms. High-energy ESWT is believed to be able to cause destruction of neovessels, but the risk of tissue damage is too high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464354">4</xref></sup> and therefore not included in this review. Furia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464354">8</xref></sup> cited a study on rat tendons that found low-energy ESWT causes an increase in neovessel formation and angiogenesis, which may facilitate a positive effect overall. This may contradict the earlier belief on neovessels being the source of the pain in this pathology, and this may indicate a lack of consensus on the behavior of pain and effect of shock wave in altering it.</p>
<p>All studies reviewed in this article were not strictly consistent in their treatment parameters, but most agreed on the number of sessions and interval between sessions. Costa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464354">6</xref></sup> chose a lower dosage and longer intervals between sessions, thus delivering a lower energy to the tissue. Two studies by Rompe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712464354">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712464354">21</xref></sup> were most consistent in their treatment parameters and achieved similar findings throughout their studies. Thus, the similar parameters reported in the majority of the studies support a dose-effect relationship. Although the average age of patients in the ESWT groups was slightly higher in all reviewed studies, Costa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464354">6</xref></sup> had a larger range of ages and experienced poor results. These differences in their study methods may explain their lack in demonstrating positive findings compared with the other studies.</p>
<p>None of the reviewed studies found serious complications with ESWT except for one,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464354">6</xref></sup> which reported tendon rupture. In this study, tendon rupture was attributed to the severity of condition and age of patients. Both patients were older than 60 years and had advanced tendinosis. Furthermore, the actual rupture happened during trivial incidents and not during treatment, and thus drawing a conclusion becomes difficult. The most common reaction experienced by patients was transient reddening of the skin. The ESWT treatment in all studies used low-energy shock waves, which could explain why application was safe and comfortable in most patients. In addition, movement of the treatment head over the affected tendon distributes the energy evenly, which could prevent tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712464354">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations in our review might be the exclusion of 2 non-English studies that may result in language bias. Other limitations are the relative inconsistencies in adhering to a treatment dosage among all studies, which could have made drawing a strong recommendation easier. However, keeping in mind that the tendons were at different levels of severity and at different stages of symptoms, dosages may be varied to suit the client.</p>
<p>Overall, the literature supports the use of ESWT in the treatment of chronic insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. The dosage likely to produce positive effects can be between 1500 and 2500 impulses per session administered at a flux density of 0.1 to 0.5 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>. A minimum of 3 sessions, with an interval of 1 week between sessions, can be expected to improve pain and function in this patient group. An increase in the frequency of sessions did not seem to have any additional effect on outcomes. The risk of ESWT is reported to be transient skin reddening in most studies. However, there was evidence for possible tendon rupture in patients older than 60 years with advanced tendinosis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our review showed satisfactory (grade C—NHMRC recommendation) evidence with the majority of the studies reporting satisfactory consistent findings for the effectiveness of low-energy ESWT in the treatment of chronic insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinopathies. Studies show improved pain and functional outcomes for a minimum of 3 months, and therefore ESWT may be considered before surgery if other conservative management fails. The dosages applied may be varied within the parameters found in this review according to the length, severity, and irritability of patient symptoms. Further research needs to be done into the long-term outcomes of ESWT on Achilles tendinopathy, in addition to establishing if there exists a clear dose-effect relationship by comparing high-intensity ESWT with low-intensity ESWT. Future research should explore the effects of ESWT on Achilles tendinopathy on different age groups, as well as duration and severity of symptoms.</p>
