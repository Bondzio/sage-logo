<abstract>
<p>This article examines BBC Digital Curriculum, the BBC’s online learning service, from its conception in 1999 to its termination in 2008. Although it is a case study, the article has broader relevance for public service media. First, drawing on (media) policy-making literature, it presents a complex web of private, public and political interests refuting claims that commercial opposition alone closed down BBC Curriculum. Second, it questions the suggestion that the entry of public service broadcasting into a market necessarily displaces commercial activities. Third, it discusses complementarity, distinctiveness and market impact, and highlights some pitfalls of the public value test. Finally, it argues that BBC Digital Curriculum raised fundamentally political questions. The case study is placed in the context of public service content provision online, particularly the battle between ‘free’ and paid-for services, the outcome of which will shape the society we live in.</p>

<p>This article is a study of BBC Digital Curriculum, the licence fee funded online learning service for 5–16-year-olds, conceived in 1999, which was subject to fierce commercial opposition and, despite being formally approved, terminated in 2008, before it was fully operational, by the newly instituted BBC Trust. The service represents probably one of the most controversial pages in the history of British public service broadcasting (PSB). Yet, with the exception of an early article on educational policy and a conference paper, there has been no comprehensive study of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163443712455557">Harvey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163443712455557">Scanlon and Buckingham, 2003</xref>). The significance of the case lies in the fact that the service is in the field of education, traditionally one of the cornerstones of the public service remit, and concerns the wider potential conflict between the public and private interest in the digital media era.</p>
<p>The article makes four arguments which have broader relevance to public service media (PSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163443712455557">Lowe and Bardoel, 2007</xref>). First, it maintains that the BBC Digital Curriculum case is not simply one of straightforward commercial opposition. Drawing on (media) policy-making literature, the article explains the dynamics of this specific instance of policy and presents a complex web of private, public and political interests.</p>
<p>Second, it is argued that the controversies surrounding BBC Digital Curriculum (and PSM in general) are essentially political questions about the need for, the degree, types and provision of publicly funded ‘freely’ and universally available content, the answers to which will shape the society we live in (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163443712455557">Harvey, 2010</xref>). The article agrees that ‘[PSB’s] survival depends as much on support by the audience as on the support from the political system’ and calls for a clear policy framework for its evolution in the digital era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712455557">d’Haenens et al., 2008</xref>: 244).</p>
<p>Third, the case study highlights some of the pitfalls of the public value test, the new PSB governance model implemented throughout Europe to determine the scope of PSBs’ new media activities. The test explicitly requires regulators to consider the public interest, for the first time, alongside the commercial interest and it therefore confirms the growing centrality of market arguments in media policy. Although the BBC Curriculum pre-dated the formal introduction of this test, the case is interesting since issues of complementarity, distinctiveness and market impact were at its heart.</p>
<p>The BBC’s activities as a licence fee funded public service broadcaster, and indeed one of the strongest, have often given rise to allegations of anti-competitiveness. In the BBC Curriculum case, there was never a formal competition investigation following its approval and so claims of adverse market impact were never officially (dis)proven. But, and this is the last argument, the evidence presented here questions the suggestion that the entry of PSBs into a market necessarily displaces commercial activities since, following the BBC’s retreat, there has been no flourishing of private investment in the markets the Corporation intended to serve.</p>
<p>As well as an analysis of official policy documents and materials for the various consultations, this study draws on articles in the national press (often controlled by publishers active in the educational software market), specialist journals and websites. Given space limitations, I have used what I consider the most significant and representative materials. Finally, I benefited from four contacts, only one of whom can be identified. These helped me clarify the context and the issues at stake, and improved my understanding of the market and the circumstances surrounding the termination of the service. Three semi-structured interviews were conducted (two by phone and one in person) with high-level officials in some of the main market players (including the trade association of the educational supply industry – the British Educational Suppliers Association – a vocal critic of the BBC) and relevant regulatory bodies. A fourth contact close to government sources was consulted informally. Two of these officials were contacted in the aftermath of the service closure when the case was quite emotive while the remaining two were contacted in 2011 and were able to offer a distanced yet current account.</p>
<p>The article starts with an overview of the BBC Curriculum, the commercial opposition and the compromise between public and private interests as reflected in the approval conditions. The subsequent sections critically assess the termination of the service, the market impact claims and the persistence of commercial complaints about the BBC’s remaining educational online offerings. The penultimate section analyses the policy process. I chose to discuss policy in a single section, rather than in various parts, in order to provide a focused and coherent policy analysis and highlight the arguments. I placed the policy analysis towards the end because the reader needs to know the facts of the case. The last section summarizes the key arguments.</p>
<sec id="section1-0163443712455557">
<title>BBC Digital Curriculum: the internet as the third arm of PSB</title>
<p>BBC Digital Curriculum brought together two core strands of the BBC: education and the internet. The BBC’s online presence goes back to the mid 1990s. BBC Online has since grown into one of the largest and most popular websites. Not surprisingly, it has been subject to numerous reviews and competition complaints (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0163443712455557">Graf, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Since its creation in the 1920s, the BBC has placed education at the forefront of its work. The Corporation has adapted its educational mission to the digital environment with, for instance, the launch of the specialist television channel BBC Knowledge (renamed BBC4) and the provision of the hugely successful GCSE Bitesize online examination revision materials. The idea of an online digital curriculum was conceived in 1999 as the latest development in the Corporation’s educational output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712455557">Dyke, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The political climate appeared favourable. Education was central to the New Labour Party’s 1997 electoral manifesto. The subsequent New Labour government ushered in a new era in educational policy centred on content, as opposed to the previous Conservative governments’ emphasis on information technology hardware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0163443712455557">Selwyn, 2007</xref>: 224). Initially, the government strongly encouraged digital educational initiatives and was keen that the BBC should be involved. Indeed, the proposition of a BBC Digital Curriculum service funded solely by the licence fee with no public money was very attractive to the government, especially the Department of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712455557">BBC News, 1999</xref>). But the government, in keeping with its ‘Third Way’ mixed economy solutions, was also favouring private sector involvement in online learning. The simultaneous encouragement of public and private sector initiatives by the government exacerbated the tension between public and commercial interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163443712455557">Scanlon and Buckingham, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In May 2002, the BBC Governors submitted a formal proposal to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to launch Digital Curriculum, a new licence fee funded online learning activity for 5–16-year-olds, supported by its own website separate from BBC Online. The Corporation planned to spend £150 million over five years. The BBC described Digital Curriculum as ‘a new public service’ in support of the school curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712455557">BBC, 2002a</xref>: 2). It noted the presence of some commercial operators but argued that the market was in its infancy and potential users might be excluded if access was conditional upon payment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712455557">BBC, 2002b</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>BBC Digital Curriculum would be distinctive. It would use a range of media, cover a maximum of half of the curriculum for any one subject, and 60% of the budget would be allocated for content focusing on areas exhibiting market failure, notably minority and non-core subjects. The BBC also offered to publicize annually its three-year commissioning plans in order to help competitors plan ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712455557">BBC, 2002b</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>Responding to bitter opposition from commercial educational suppliers, in June 2002 the BBC submitted a revised proposal clarifying, for instance, that half the content, as opposed to the general, budget would be commissioned from external providers, thereby further supporting the domestic industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712455557">BBC, 2002c</xref>). This was a big concession. Indicatively, BBC Curriculum’s annual spend on external content was estimated at £15 million, nearly three times the spend of BBC Online on content in all genres for the year ending March 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0163443712455557">PACT, 2007</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>Opposition remained phenomenal, despite these assurances and additional steps taken by the BBC to show that allegations that it was effectively taking it upon itself to expand its remit were unfounded (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712455557">Davies, 1999</xref>: 391). First, although not required to, in 2000 the BBC conducted a public consultation which, perhaps not surprisingly, revealed strong support for its plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712455557">BBC, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the BBC commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to undertake a market impact assessment study which concluded that, contrary to criticisms, the service would not adversely affect the market but would stimulate it by, for instance, increasing user confidence in online learning resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0163443712455557">PwC, 2002</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Finally, the BBC actively participated in the government’s 2001 Curriculum Online consultation, engaging closely with government and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712455557">DfEE, 2001</xref>). But despite these additional steps to appease opposition, the former approvals process for new BBC services lacked accountability and transparency for it was not clear how the Secretary of State weighted public value against market impact. This weakness in the process left BBC Digital Curriculum open to criticism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0163443712455557">
<title>Market reaction: emphasis on competition arguments</title>
<p>The BBC Curriculum idea started quite ambitiously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712455557">BBC, 2000</xref>) and was thus threatening to commercial players at a time, moreover, when the BBC was expanding its overall online presence. In general, there is a deep-seated apprehension in the industry about all BBC online activities: ‘the BBC’s increasing provision of free new media material [is] making it difficult, if not impossible, for commercial players to offer paid-for services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163443712455557">House of Commons, 2007</xref>: para. 185).</p>
<p>BBC Curriculum needs to be understood within this broader context of the battle between ‘free’ and paid-for services, a battle which is becoming increasingly heated as the internet’s usage keeps on growing, as technological convergence blurs the lines between media platforms and makes the market more competitive and fragmented, and as economic recession hits the revenues of commercial media players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712455557">Barnett and Seaton, 2010</xref>). These factors have intensified and broadened opposition to PSB. Opposition comes from commercial broadcasters but also publishers and, in our case, educational software developers.</p>
<p>Profit-driven companies believe that the educational software market has high growth potential and regard ‘free’ content – the BBC Curriculum proposition – as a direct threat to commercial business models. Various companies were active at the time the BBC announced its plans such as Research Machines (RM), Britain’s biggest educational information technology supplier, which was at the time moving into content provision, Granada Learning and Reed Elsevier. Other players included News Corporation and Pearson, whose strong performance in the educational field prompted its chief executive to declare that the company was ‘all about education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712455557">Bradshaw, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712455557">Fenton, 2010</xref>). All these quite powerful, and some less powerful companies led opposition to BBC Curriculum.</p>
<p>Commercial rivals fought the BBC plans individually but also through trade associations. In doing so, they were able to raise the same objections more times and arguably increase their weight. The creation of the Digital Learning Alliance representing 90% of commercial providers is a good example. The Alliance submitted comments to the DCMS consultation separately from the comments of its members and commissioned two market impact reviews, both highly critical of the BBC service. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0163443712455557">Nera (2002)</xref> study rejected the PwC report, commissioned by the BBC, maintaining that it paid insufficient attention to the impact of free material which, the second study claimed, would displace £400 million of the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0163443712455557">SRU, 2002</xref>). Commercial companies made their determination to take on the BBC clear. In 2002, while the government consultation was under way, an industry consortium led by RM sought a judicial review of BBC Curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712455557">1</xref></sup> In addition, RM and the British Educational Suppliers Association filed a complaint on unfair competition with the Office of Fair Trading which was dismissed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0163443712455557">OFT, 2003</xref>: 6–7).</p>
<p>The core objections were commercial. Rivals claimed that the BBC was branching out into a new area of activity – classroom materials and mainstream curriculum development – in which it had limited experience (see responses by BESA, ESPA, HarperCollins, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>). They argued that the anticipated benefits of the BBC service depended not on its distinctiveness – which they dismissed – but on external factors, especially the uptake of ICT (information and computer technology) in schools, which could be equally applied to their offerings (BESA, HarperCollins, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>). Opponents also maintained that the BBC plan to restrict its coverage to half the learning outcomes for any subject would effectively satisfy all that would be required given the amount of time schools allocated to ICT-based learning and the fact that some outcomes were not amenable to online delivery (PA, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>). The industry alleged that the BBC service would impede ‘the development of a potentially world-leading industry’, a core government priority (PA, CLSC, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>). For instance, it claimed that, as a result of market uncertainty, investment did not materialize, citing Pearson’s Knowledge Box, a potentially global product (interview with BESA).</p>
<p>The industry requested long-term demand-funding to compensate for the adverse market impact of BBC Curriculum. In response, the government introduced the electronic Learning Credits (eLCs) scheme in 2001, initially committing £50 million to support investment by schools in commercial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0163443712455557">DCSF, 2001</xref>). But the industry found the resources committed inadequate and called for them to be at least trebled (e.g. Reed Elsevier, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides competition issues, opponents raised educational concerns, warning that the BBC service was a monolithic one-size-fits-all proposition, even that it represented ‘backdoor nationalisation of the UK educational content marketplace’, and would therefore seriously curtail diversity of online resources (HarperCollins, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0163443712455557">McMullan, 2002</xref>: 5). Essentially, ‘the potential conflict between public and private interests in education was re-framed as a matter of choice versus lack of choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163443712455557">Scanlon and Buckingham, 2003</xref>: 197). This framing, emphasizing ‘consumer sovereignty and market competition’, reflected a consumerist understanding of the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712455557">Freedman, 2008</xref>: 70). Other concerns related to online learning in general and the potential of inequalities in ICT facilities and skills among schools and homes to exacerbate social divides (NUT, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A final criticism concerned the existing approvals process (and more broadly the BBC self-governance), which the industry was increasingly questioning and in which it had no confidence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712455557">BESA, 2002</xref>: 7–8). Thus, although this matter was outside its scope, the government’s consultation on BBC Curriculum reignited calls for the BBC to be subject to external oversight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0163443712455557">
<title>Conditional approval to moderate market impact</title>
<p>In January 2003, BBC Curriculum got ministerial approval on the basis of ‘the strongest ever’ conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712455557">DCMS, 2003</xref>). Simultaneously, the government launched the Curriculum Online initiative and announced an additional £300 million of eLCs funding during 2003–6, double the projected BBC total investment in the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712455557">DfES, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The 18 approvals conditions were clearly a response to the vociferous opposition from private educational publishers and designed to minimize potential market impact. Among others, they required that BBC Curriculum should be distinctive in relation to commercial products, and complementary to them; should cover a maximum of half the learning outcomes amenable to ICT-learning; should commission half of the content budget; and should pre-publish commissioning plans at least one year in advance. Although the overall scope of the service remained the same, the spread of coverage changed: 48% on minority subjects (up from 40%), 30% on non-core subjects (down from 35%), and finally 22% on core subjects (down from 25%). The conditions were incorporated in the Service Licence issued by the BBC Trust, the Corporation’s new governing body under the 2006 Charter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712455557">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BBC Trust was charged with reporting annually on the implementation of the service. Crucially, soft external regulatory controls were introduced: the BBC was required to work with the Content Advisory Board (CAB) of the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) – in which the industry would also participate – but had to follow the CAB’s recommendations only ‘where possible’, thereby giving it considerable leeway. Lastly, the DCMS committed to review the service after two years, a review which would now include an independent market impact assessment.</p>
<p>As required, following domestic approval of BBC Curriculum, the British government sought the consent of the European Commission. In February 2003, an industry consortium led by RM lodged a formal complaint with the Commission alleging that the service was not clearly defined. The Commission reasoned that, since it did not bear a ‘close association’ with the Corporation’s broadcasting activities, the proposed service represented ‘a digression’ and would potentially distort competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712455557">EC, 2003</xref>: para. 36).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163443712455557">3</xref></sup> Still, in October 2003 it approved Digital Curriculum on the basis of the strong conditions the British government had set to reduce market impact. This was the first decision concerning the application of state aid rules to PSB where market failure proved a determining criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0163443712455557">Michalis, 2007</xref>: 236–8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0163443712455557">
<title>RIP BBC Jam: some complexities in regulating PSM</title>
<p>Opposition continued unabated. Despite the rigorous conditions, commercial educational publishers were concerned about adherence to them since the criteria to demonstrate compliance were often vague. They launched a public relations campaign targeting key media to draw attention to the substantial market disruption the BBC service would bring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712455557">Barker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In December 2005, just before the soft launch of BBC Curriculum, its official monitoring body, the CAB, based on very little and early material, issued a highly critical report. Two points are worth mentioning. First, the CAB alleged that the service was not meeting the approvals conditions, in particular those concerning complementarity and distinctiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712455557">CAB, 2005</xref>: 4). The DCMS provided no relevant definition although, as the CAB acknowledged, it was difficult to see how these two qualities, which referred to the service as a whole rather than specific elements of it, could have been defined.</p>
<p>For the BBC, the distinctiveness of the service related to: availability at home, commitment to anytime/anywhere learning, and its learner-centred focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712455557">CAB, 2005</xref>: 21). But the CAB, echoing the views of commercial providers, rejected this analysis, arguing that BBC Curriculum would also be available in schools and that some commercial products also prioritized the learner. In an attempt to moderate market impact, the CAB proposed that BBC Curriculum concentrate on minority subjects and languages, while in areas already extensively covered by the private sector (notably the core curriculum), BBC products had to be clearly distinct by, for instance, relying on the BBC archives rather than production of new content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712455557">CAB, 2005</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Crucially, the CAB observed that, in effect, complementarity and distinctiveness were conditioned upon two-way communication between the BBC and commercial rivals. But whereas the BBC was required to publicize its investment plans (a now typical condition when approving new services by PSBs), there was no reciprocity and the BBC did not have access to the private sector’s investment plans and could not therefore support judgements of complementarity in its planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712455557">CAB, 2005</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Complementarity and distinctiveness are the primary justification for PSM and core elements of their public value (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712455557">EC, 2009</xref>). Although they typically feature in licences (or equivalent) granting PSBs permission to engage in specific activities, it is difficult to see how they can be adequately elaborated in regulatory texts. It is possible to achieve that to an extent through other conditions in licences, as was the case with BBC Curriculum. But the problem is that, as the market changes, so the meaning of complementarity and distinctiveness changes. A degree of flexibility is therefore required. Regular market reviews may assess complementarity and distinctiveness and provide for adjustments. But the experience of BBC Curriculum, where a review had been set as a condition, suggests that even that might not be enough. Hence, the challenge to adequately define complementarity and distinctiveness remains. Too broad a definition renders services vulnerable to commercial opposition. Too detailed a definition risks paralysing PSBs, stifling their responsiveness and innovation, and even subverting their editorial autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712455557">Barnett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The second point in the CAB report worth emphasizing is procedural. The report recognized that the protracted approval process (increasingly the norm in Europe whenever PSBs look to launch new activities) had shortened the production period and, as such, unduly limited the ability of the BBC to promote complementarity and distinctiveness.</p>
<p>The government supported the recommendations of the CAB but was against an immediate review of the service, explaining that the licence provided for a review within two years after launch and stressing that compliance with the conditions was the BBC’s, not the government’s, responsibility (James Purnell in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0163443712455557">House of Commons, 2006a</xref>: col. 1913; Shaun Woodward in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163443712455557">House of Commons, 2006b</xref>: col. 1157).</p>
<p>It was in this charged climate that, in January 2006, BBC Curriculum, branded BBC Jam, soft launched with 10% of the planned total content, aiming for a full launch by September 2008. Allegations that the service had failed to meet the demanding licence conditions were left hanging. Despite strong concerns and the call for an early review, no action was announced. It is argued here that BBC Jam was the victim of regulatory failure. The government and the interim BBC Trust did not respond in the first instance.</p>
<p>Commercial interests then approached the European Commission and some interviewees suggested that they were prompted to do so by the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), which prioritized economic aims and was therefore more inclined to listen to their arguments. The European Commission put pressure on the national authorities to review the service. But nothing was happening. With no progress in sight and the prospect of a Commission investigation, the BBC Trust decided to intervene. In March 2007, the newly instituted Trust under an acting chairman suspended BBC Jam 14 months after it launched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712455557">BBC, 2007</xref>). BBC management was asked to submit new proposals for the Corporation’s educational mission which, under the 2006 Charter, would be subject to a full public value test.</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that the decision to suspend the service was reached on the basis of allegations about non-compliance and in the absence of a formal investigation. The Trust’s decision was widely condemned by teachers for reducing widespread and affordable access to educational content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0163443712455557">Kenny, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0163443712455557">Lord Puttnam (2007)</xref> observed:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to imagine an education service which has been the subject of so much politicking and so much shadowy commercial and bureaucratic self-interest – and yet where the interests of the most important party – the children – have been so badly marginalised.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He opined that that the BBC Trust’s decision to suspend Jam, shortly after it decided to water down the BBC’s on-demand media player (iPlayer) in response to Ofcom’s market impact assessment, was worrying, and he felt that ‘the BBC’s public purposes [were] already at risk of being diluted by the very Trust that was put in place to advance them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0163443712455557">Puttnam, 2007</xref>). The government offered a different interpretation, one which confirms the centrality of the market failure argument in media policy. For them, the Trust’s decision to suspend Jam was ‘an encouraging sign of real change’ in the BBC’s approach towards activities that may damage the commercial sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163443712455557">House of Commons, 2007</xref>: 82). In 2008, the Trust formally closed down BBC Jam.</p>

<title>Continuing opposition and market impact<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0163443712455557">4</xref></sup></title>
<p>The article argues that there is lack of convincing evidence establishing a clear correlation between BBC Curriculum and market displacement. It therefore questions the suggestion that the entry of PSBs into a market necessarily displaces commercial activities. Overall, and in the absence of an independent market impact assessment, it would appear that there was more a fear of what might happen were BBC Jam to fully launch rather than a specific quantifiable impact on the market (interview).</p>
<p>One of the difficulties in considering market impact is the very definition of the market. For instance, the educational software market can be subdivided on the basis of users into the students and teachers markets; on the basis of use into the home use and school use markets, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 20–1). On the one hand BBC Curriculum was aimed at homes and its competitive impact was likely to have been minimal since commercial players almost exclusively cater for the schools market, where commercial opportunities lie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 26). But, on the other hand, the BBC service was also used in schools and it is not possible to argue that there was no competitive impact.</p>
<p>Yet no significant investment has taken place by commercial players since the closure of Jam, which suggests that the market impact of the BBC service was negligible. The broader context is important. Following a peak in 2004/5, the educational software market has since been declining by around 7% per annum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 22). This decline renders ‘free’ products, especially in core subjects which account for over 90% of the market by value, more threatening to commercial suppliers. But the increasing number of free resources makes it hard to isolate the BBC effect. Many resources like Google/YouTube and Wikipedia (free and not for educational purpose solely), Apple’s iTunes (not necessarily free or for educational purpose solely), YahooKids! and Britannica (free and for educational purpose) would not necessarily be deemed educational software products, yet enjoy high market awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 24). Additional factors in the decline of investment include reduced government funding for schools and saturation following purchases under the eLCs scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 43). In sum, even in hindsight, it is hard to pin down the independent market impact of the BBC’s educational activities. Yet, these remain contentious.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2008 after the closure of Jam, the Publishers’ Association argued that the BBC should not be present in educational markets which can be supplied by commercial models and alleged that the Corporation’s three remaining activities (the GCSE revision site Bitesize, the provision of videos for schools through Learning Zone Broadband and the Learning Portal, the gateway to the BBC’s online educational resources), having started under the previous BBC governance regime, had evaded scrutiny and ended up offering essentially an online curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0163443712455557">PA, 2008</xref>: para. 4). These views formed part of a formal complaint submitted by the British Educational Suppliers Association and the Publishers’ Association. The BBC Trust rejected the suggestion that the three services were not subject to appropriate approval but upheld the claims that (1) the Executive had not conducted an appropriate market impact assessment and (2) the BBC had not engaged sufficiently with the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712455557">BBC Trust, 2009</xref>). The Trust concluded that, while the services in question had had an impact on the market, it was unlikely that the Executive, had it conducted such an assessment at the time, would have made substantial changes to them without significantly compromising their public value. The only potential approach to minimize market impact, which the Trust called for, would have been better engagement with the industry. Overall, as the retrospective competitive impact assessment found, the BBC’s online educational activities appear to have some market impact, although this ‘has not precluded some providers growing and [has not] substantially foreclosed competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 53). The problem is that even the top five suppliers (including RM,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0163443712455557">5</xref></sup> Espresso Education and <italic>The Guardian</italic>), which account for roughly half of the market, cannot match the BBC’s scale of investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455557">FTI, 2010</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>It seems likely that the BBC will present a lesser commercial threat in the online environment in the medium future. A reduced licence fee settlement in 2010 and the increasing weighting of the potential market impact of BBC activities under the current Charter form the main elements behind the Corporation’s ‘less but better’ strategy. In 2011, the Trust approved the Executive’s proposals to reduce BBC Online’s budget by 25% to around £103 million by 2014 and make the service more focused on the BBC’s public purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712455557">BBC Trust, 2011</xref>: 1). The budget of Learning and Knowledge, with an average weekly reach of 1.5 million users, will decrease by 0.6% to a total of £16.2 million by 2014 and account for 20% of the overall online budget, representing the second largest spending category after News (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712455557">BBC Trust, 2011</xref>: 11). In addition, the Trust approved the closure of two services (Blast! and Switch), aimed at teenagers, on the grounds that ‘they [were] not widely used and lack[ed] impact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712455557">BBC Trust, 2011</xref>: 9). It further recommended improved industry engagement, the scaling down of original content and closer ties to broadcast output.</p>

<title>The policy process: a complex web of private, public and political forces</title>
<p>A few observations can be made about the BBC Curriculum case and the nature of the media policy. The first concerns the semblance of a pluralist policy process. For instance, the DCMS consultation attracted 90 responses. These ranged from commercial educational publishers; associations of schools, teachers, and parents; hardware and software manufacturers; and individuals. The seemingly pluralist policy-making process masks power inequalities. Public participation in the process, though beneficial for legitimacy purposes, was minimal and, besides, participation does not equal influence. Commercial forces sharing a well-defined common interest and having a much higher stake in the policy outcome, mobilized financial, organizational and informational resources at national and European levels to influence policy to their advantage. The case confirms Freedman’s conclusion that, despite the growing number of participants, British media policy remains concentrated among a small core of actors and lacks transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712455557">2008</xref>: 80–104). BBC Curriculum policy was the responsibility of a policy community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163443712455557">Rhodes, 1997</xref>) which, although it reached beyond the three historically main policy actors – government (DCMS/DTI), regulators and (public service) broadcasters – and included more government departments (e.g. Department of Education, DoE) and commercial market players from outside the broadcast environment (such as publishers and educational software developers), it was a policy community dominated by business interests, politicians, regulators and civil servants.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the influence of commercial interests in the process, policy was never a given and BBC Curriculum is not an example of policy ‘capture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0163443712455557">Stigler, 1971</xref>), whereby policy advances the interests of businesses at the expense of the public’s interest. First, in this case business interests included private <italic>and</italic> public organizations. The BBC was instrumental in the process: it set the agenda by proposing Digital Curriculum and obtained formal approval, though with conditions to moderate market impact. Second, the case points to the relative autonomy of the state rather than its relative dependence on the industry it seeks to regulate as the ‘capture’ explanation implies. The analysis showed that the state did not outright support one set of interests against the other (commercial players – public institution) and in the end the decision to terminate the service rested with the BBC Trust (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0163443712455557">Hesmondhalgh, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The second observation confirms the historical fragmentation of British media policy and associated inconsistencies and paradoxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0163443712455557">Seymour-Ure, 1987</xref>). The state is not unitary. Parts of its administration have their own preferences and seek to expand their institutional power and resources (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0163443712455557">Nordlinger, 1981</xref>). Their preferences are shaped by, but are not reduced to an aggregate of, the interests of their client groups. Indeed, the segmented policy pattern impacted upon process and outcome.</p>
<p>Hence, the DoE was originally supportive of BBC Curriculum, a project which would advance educational objectives without demanding public funds. The DTI was more inclined to the arguments of the private educational publishers whereas the institutionally weaker DCMS was more prepared to listen to the BBC. Policy fragmentation worked at the expense of the broader public interest; there was no department to make the case for it. Moreover, New Labour policy suffered from internal contradictions, not only in attempting to simultaneously encourage public and private initiatives, thereby creating confusion and fuelling the tension between public and private interests, but also in its attempt to promote commercial business opportunities in the online educational market whose scale and direction, at the same time, are inexorably dependent upon government educational policy and public funding of state schools. Finally, the service was caught in the midst of broader policy upheaval with the contemporaneous passing of a new Communications Act and the review of the BBC’s Charter. The ensuing regulatory uncertainty and the novelty of the subsequent BBC governance structures with the inauguration of the Trust, all had an impact upon the events. In short, in line with new institutionalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163443712455557">Galperin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0163443712455557">March and Olsen, 1998</xref>), the case study confirms that institutions are not neutral and that they matter.</p>
<p>The third observation concerns the government’s use of the BBC for broader public policy objectives, in this case educational ones. This is not new. Recent examples include reliance on the BBC to advance digital terrestrial switchover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0163443712455557">Smith, 2011</xref>) and additional obligations under the licence fee settlement in 2010 such as the funding of rural broadband. The government perceives the BBC as one available policy and financial instrument to advance public policy goals. This practice strengthens the BBC’s raison d’etre but threatens its independence.</p>
<p>A fourth observation concerns non-decisions. Non-decisions are as important as decisions. Government inaction is a kind of policy since it favours certain interests and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0163443712455557">Lukes, 1974</xref>). Non-intervention – in the light of mounting opposition from commercial forces and the damming CAB report – steered the policy process from the national to the EU arena, which prioritizes economic and competition objectives and would therefore be more prepared to listen to the claims of commercial forces and possibly act upon them. The decision of the government not to intervene (on the one hand stressing that it was the BBC’s responsibility to ensure compliance with the licence conditions but on the other allegedly encouraging aggrieved competitors to complain to the European Commission) was a kind of policy. Inaction favoured the private competitors while the BBC was left isolated, trying to fight the non-compliance allegations at a time of broader policy uncertainty. The decision to terminate the service reflected what was politically feasible at the time. This decision of the BBC Trust, not the government, underlined the Corporation’s independence but at the same time it depoliticized policy by removing essentially political decisions on public intervention in media and educational markets from government.</p>
<p>Fifth, the BBC Curriculum case illustrates how deeply enmeshed national media policy has become with EU policy. In effect, although the EU was not to blame for the closure of the service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0163443712455557">Tongue, 2007</xref>), the overhang of an EU competition investigation, triggered by the actions of commercial players, provided the catalyst for a national resolution.</p>
<p>Finally, market and competition considerations and a growing economic imperative have all become more central in media policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712455557">Bardoel and d’Haenens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712455557">Cave et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712455557">Cuilenburg and McQuail, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712455557">Freedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163443712455557">Harvey, 2010</xref>). The prominence of market-based arguments is evident at both EU and national levels. It is the result of various factors, including new distribution technologies (involving cable, satellite and more recently the internet) and the accompanying multiplication of outlets, the concerted lobbying efforts of commercial media players under intensifying market competition to limit, if not eliminate, public broadcasters and regulatory controls, but also a transformed political and regulatory culture shaped by the rise of neoliberalism.</p>
<p>As the case study showed, PSM are fundamentally defined with reference to their market impact, a policy formally endorsed with the 2006 BBC Charter and the introduction of the public value test. This is not to argue that everything PSBs do is by definition in the public interest nor that business interests have no place in the media markets. As Corner explains, the ‘public frame’ and the ‘market frame’ are not ‘comprehensively incompatible’ but, the dynamics have swung decisively in favour of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712455557">2010</xref>: 139). The associated policy discourse and beliefs are not neutral but influence problem definition and narrow policy options by strengthening the credibility of business commercial solutions and associated consumerist values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0163443712455557">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>National and European authorities did not originally object the expansion of PSBs in the digital and online environment. But as these markets have grown rapidly since the 1990s – markets which the PSBs have helped develop in the first place – and as competition has intensified, commercial pressure to minimize PSBs’ online presence has increased in tandem.</p>
<p>The case of BBC Digital Curriculum examined here is even more intriguing because it concerns education, a core PSB mission. For the BBC, the service was simply an extension of its traditional educational remit to the online media. But to commercial educational suppliers, Curriculum was an activity outside the Corporation’s normal line of business and presented an immense threat. They feared that the BBC, through the provision of ‘free’ material, would displace commercial activities. It seems that, for commercial rivals, the public interest is legitimate only to the extent that it does not impact upon the private profit-maximizing interest.</p>
<p>The BBC’s plans were subject to sustained and aggressive opposition from commercial educational publishers. Only 10% of the service was live for just over a year before it was suspended in 2007 and eventually shut down on the basis of allegations that it was insufficiently differentiated from commercial rivals’ offerings and thus in breach of its licence. A series of complaints were made to the European Commission, which threatened to launch its own inquiry unless the service was reviewed by national regulators. But there never was a formal complaint following approval and this made it hard for the BBC to fight the allegations.</p>
<p>Still, it would be wrong to single out commercial opposition for the closure of the service. The article presented a complex web of private, public and political interests, and confirmed the concentration and growing complexity of British media policy. The case attests to the rise of a media policy paradigm which prioritizes business interests, the market failure argument and consumerist values.</p>
<p>Moreover, the timing of the service was unfortunate as it coincided with the passing of a new Communications Act and the renewal of the BBC Charter instituting new governance structures. BBC Curriculum was the victim of regulatory uncertainty and upheaval. It was conceived under the old structures of BBC governance by the Governors. It then obtained government approval under a process which was not transparent, never won the confidence of the wider industry and, as a result, left the service unprotected. It was suspended by the provisional BBC Trust in 2007 and subsequently terminated by the first Trust under an acting chairman. The Trust, a newly established body, was nervous and lacked legitimacy. Defending BBC Curriculum would have been a long and expensive battle for the BBC Trust to take on for a service it had not approved and for an uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>Since it was not formally investigated, we have no proof whether, and if yes how, BBC Curriculum affected private sector operations. The discussion above questioned the suggestion that the entry of the BBC into the educational software market crowded out commercial players. Despite having raised this argument repeatedly, commercial competitors to date, four years after the closure of the service, have not made any significant investment, proof in itself that the BBC’s activities had no noteworthy adverse impact. Conversely, it can be argued that, following the BBC’s withdrawal, competition, innovation and plurality have all suffered since the intended markets remain unserved. Moreover, the rising commercialization of (online) learning, together with the growing concentration of private ownership in the educational publishing market, will further narrow plurality of provision as well as the forms and experience of learning, and exacerbate social inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712455557">Buckingham and Scanlon, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the BBC Curriculum case, most of the concerns related to the core subjects. Arguably the added value of the BBC service was the promotion of access to lower-income households through the provision of universally ‘free’ online educational material, as well as content in indigenous languages and for pupils with special educational needs, all of which would likely advance social equity. However, even the subsequent partial release of such market failure content was contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712455557">BBC, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2006 Charter has established quite an elaborate system for approving services, namely the public value test, which has introduced greater scrutiny of the commercial impact of BBC services. Had BBC Curriculum gone through it and had it been approved, such a test could have conceivably protected the service against allegations of adverse market impact. But while the new BBC governance provides greater transparency and certainty to market players, it remains to be seen whether the fundamental conflict in the BBC self-governing structures has been offset, namely the potential conflict that the Trust now faces between promoting the interests of licence fee payers (the public interest) while simultaneously regulating the BBC and, for the first time, being under an explicit obligation to consider the potential competitive impact of any significant activity.</p>
<p>Overall, as suggested here, the BBC Curriculum case is symptomatic of the tension between public and private interests. Ultimately, the issues raised are fundamentally political. Their resolution will determine the character of the society we live in.</p>

<p>The 2006 Charter established the BBC Trust to replace the Governors and represent the licence fee payers. The Trust is responsible for ensuring that the Corporation fulfils its public purposes and holds the BBC Executive to account. The Charter strengthened the separation between BBC Executive and Trust, and increased BBC independence by putting an end to ministerial involvement in the evaluation of new services but stopped short of subjecting the Corporation to completely external oversight by only giving Ofcom – the media and telecommunications regulator – responsibility for assessing the market impact of new BBC services while the Trust assesses their public value and, on the basis of these two assessments, approves or rejects new services (public value test).</p>
