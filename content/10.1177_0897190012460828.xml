<abstract>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the globe and within the United States. Although several medication classes are used for COPD treatment, none of these medications have been shown to significantly improve long-term lung function or mitigate overall disease progression. This review describes the pharmacologic treatment options for COPD and highlights recent studies evaluating the impact of bronchodilators and combination therapy on lung function, mortality, quality of life, and exacerbations. Additionally, indacaterol and roflumilast, 2 new COPD treatment agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, are discussed. Pharmacists play an important role in managing and educating patients with COPD and should utilize new evidence to make recommendations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide health concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460828">3</xref></sup> Currently, COPD ranks as the fourth leading cause of mortality across the globe and in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref></sup> and deaths from COPD are expected to rise 30% in the next decade if there are no interventions to decrease the risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref></sup> What is more concerning, though, is that while the overall death rate has declined among the general US population, deaths from COPD have doubled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460828">5</xref></sup> In addition to its impact on morbidity and mortality, COPD is also costly to the health care system. In 2007, direct health care costs related to COPD were estimated at 26.7 billion dollars in the United States alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>COPD is an irreversible disease that combines conditions formerly referred to as chronic bronchitis and emphysema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460828">6</xref></sup>; it is “characterized by chronic airflow limitation and a range of pathological changes in the lung, some significant extrapulmonary effects, and important comorbidities which may contribute to the severity of disease in individual patients.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup> The primary cause of COPD is inhalation of irritants including, most commonly, tobacco smoke but can result from inhalation of dusts, chemicals, and pollution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460828">6</xref></sup> Inhaled irritants generate airway inflammation, which leads to small airway disease and destruction of the lung parenchyma, finally resulting in airflow limitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup> Hallmark symptoms of COPD include dyspnea, cough, and sputum production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460828">7</xref></sup> COPD exacerbations are characterized by increased airway inflammation and physical decline and occur more commonly in advanced stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Tobacco smoking cessation is the single most important step in COPD treatment and has been shown to diminish disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460828">8</xref></sup> No currently available medical treatments reverse the COPD disease process or significantly alter the decline of lung function. Instead, COPD treatments are targeted at eliminating risk factors and improving quality of life by decreasing symptoms and preventing exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460828">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460828">7</xref></sup> Bronchodilators are central in the management of COPD as they modestly improve lung function, reduce hyperinflation leading to dyspnea, and decrease exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460828">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460828">5</xref></sup> In addition to bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can be added to patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations; however, unlike in asthma, ICS do not significantly improve lung function in COPD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460828">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Over the past few years, new data have been published evaluating the use of bronchodilators and ICSs in COPD patients. Three large randomized controlled trials, TORCH, UPLIFT, and POET-COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460828">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460828">8</xref></sup> have assessed the impact of combination therapy on mortality, lung function, and exacerbation frequency. In addition, new agents, indacaterol and roflumilast, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011. This article summarizes COPD treatment options and highlights key clinical trials published in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>According to the GOLD guidelines, COPD is staged based on the symptoms of airflow limitation and objective measures, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup> In 2011, GOLD included patient groups A, B, C, and D to guide treatment.

<p>The goals of COPD management are to relieve symptoms, prevent disease progression, improve exercise tolerance, improve health status, prevent and treat complications, prevent and treat exacerbations, reduce mortality, and prevent or minimize side effects from treatment. According to GOLD, an effective approach to COPD management is to assess and monitor condition, avoid or reduce risk factors, manage stable disease, and treat exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of COPD include bronchodilators, ICS, and phosphdiesterase 4 inhibitors, though none of these modify the long-term FEV<sub>1</sub> decline. Pharmacologic treatment can control symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Treatment recommendations by GOLD COPD group are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012460828">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Bronchodilators are prescribed on an as-needed or on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. By altering airway smooth muscle tone, bronchodilators improve emptying of the lungs, reduce dynamic hyperinflation at rest and during exercise, and improve exercise performance. The extent of these changes, especially in moderate-to-severe disease, is not easily predictable from the improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The improvements in expiratory flow reflect the widening of the airways rather than changes in lung elastic recoil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Inhaled bronchodilator therapy is preferred over systemic treatment in order to minimize side effects. Regular treatment with short-acting bronchodilators is less expensive but less convenient than treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Combining bronchodilators may improve efficacy and decrease the risk of side effects compared to increasing the dose of a single agent. Currently, there are 3 types of bronchodilators used in COPD treatment: beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines.</p>
<p>Beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists relax airway smooth muscle by stimulating beta<sub>2</sub> receptors, which increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and produce functional antagonism to bronchoconstriction. Inhaled beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists produce rapid bronchodilation; however, the effects are probably slower in COPD than in asthma. Short-acting agents (albuterol and levalbuterol) have effects for 4 to 6 hours; while the long-acting agents (salmeterol, formoterol) have effects for more than 12 hours. Major adverse effects include sinus tachycardia, somatic tremor, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and hypokalemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup> COPD patients are at a greater risk of experiencing adverse effects since they are generally older and have more comorbidities.</p>
<p>Anticholinergic agents produce bronchodilation by blockade of acetylcholine's effect on M3 (muscarinic) receptors resulting in a reduction in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which normally acts to constrict bronchioles. The effect of the short-acting anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide) usually last longer than that produced by short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists. However, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists are typically preferred for as-needed use due to their quicker onset of action. The long-acting anticholinergic (tiotropium bromide) is a quaternary agent that dissociates slowly from M1 and M3 receptors, resulting in increased potency compared to ipratropium. The onset of action is 30 minutes and cholinergic bronchoconstriction is inhibited for 24 hours. Major adverse effects of both agents include a bitter, metallic taste, and glaucoma. Adverse effects are less common compared to beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists because the quaternary structure of both agents results in poor systemic absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Methylxanthines (theophylline) are bronchodilators; however, data are limited regarding their use in COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460828">1</xref></sup> Inhaled bronchodilators (beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, anticholinergics) are preferred in COPD management due to the numerous drug interactions and dose-related toxicities associated with methylxanthines.</p>

<title>Existing Therapies Literature Review</title>
<p>Several large-scale studies have been conducted in the last 5 years evaluating the impact of existing bronchodilators and/or ICS on treatment outcomes, such as lung function decline, mortality, exacerbations, or quality of life. Tiotropium is commonly used for the treatment in COPD groups B-D, and 2 large randomized controlled trials and 1 meta-analysis were conducted assessing whether tiotropium treatment could improve COPD outcomes. In recent years, concerns were raised about the cardiovascular risk associated with tiotropium treatment. A summary of the outcome studies and safety concerns is described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190012460828">
<title>Tiotropium Studies</title>
<p>The Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT; 2008) was a large (n = 5993), multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that evaluated tiotropium 18 mcg inhaled daily compared to placebo over a 4-year time period. The study’s primary end points were the yearly decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> before and after bronchodilation from study day 30 to study conclusion. Mean decline in FVC and slow vital capcity, patient health-related quality of life as scored by St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD exacerbations and associated hospitalizations, and death were key secondary end points. Patients aged 40 years or greater with a 10 pack-year history of tobacco use and a FEV<sub>1</sub> <underline>≤</underline>70% and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC <underline>≤</underline>70% were included. Excluded patients had a history of asthma, recent COPD exacerbation or respiratory infection, history of pulmonary resection, or required supplemental oxygen for more than 12 hours daily. The majority of the patients included in the study had moderate-to-severe COPD (previously categorized as stages II and III). There was no statistical difference between tiotropium and placebo in the mean decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC; however, tiotropium-treated patients reported higher scores on St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had increased time until their first exacerbation (16.7 months versus 12.5 months), and a 14% reduction in their mean number of exacerbations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). A decreased risk of death was seen with tiotropium in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses; however, this was only statistically significant in the per-protocol population. Anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth and constipation were more commonly reported in patients who received tiotropium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460828">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Van den Bruel et al conducted a meta-analysis that evaluated tiotropium’s impact on the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations in patients with COPD. The authors searched several electronic databases to obtain randomized, controlled, trials that compared tiotropium to placebo or other bronchodilators. Included studies evaluated stable COPD patients who had no exacerbations in the past 1 month and were followed for at least 12 weeks. Studies were reviewed independently by 2 authors and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. A total of 9 studies were included for analysis, of which 7 compared tiotropium to placebo, 1 compared tiotropium to placebo and salmeterol, and 1 compared tiotropium to ipratropium. Tiotropium decreased exacerbations per patient per year by 31% compared to placebo (95% CI 0.46-0.17) and by 23% (95% CI −0.31 to −0.15) compared to ipratropium. When compared to ipratropium, salmeterol reduced exacerbations by 16% (95% CI −0.29 to −0.03). There was a small decrease in hospitalizations for patients receiving tiotropium compared to placebo and ipratropium but not salmeterol. Limitations of this meta-analysis include evidence of publication bias, inadequate concealment for most studies, and moderate quality for included studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460828">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Prevention Of Exacerbations with Tiotropium in COPD (POET-COPD) study (2011) sought to capitalize on results from the UPLIFT study and other meta-analyses that showed tiotropium reduced COPD exacerbations. The POET-COPD study was a large (n = 7384), multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial evaluating tiotropium 18 mcg daily versus salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily over a 1-year period. The primary end point of the POET-COPD trial was time to the first moderate-severe COPD exacerbation. Exacerbation was defined as an increase in 1 or more of the following for at least 3 days: cough, sputum, wheezing, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea. In addition, an attending physician had to deem that the exacerbation was serious enough to require treatment with corticosteroids and/or antimicrobials. Key secondary end points included time-to-event and number-to-event points, serious adverse events, and death. Patients included were very similar to those included in the UPLIFT study but also had a history of a previous COPD exacerbation. Key exclusion criteria were asthma and other pulmonary disorders, history of recent cardiovascular disease, moderate renal insufficiency, or any patients with medical problems that could be worsened by tiotropium or salmeterol. Time until the first quartile (25%) of patients had an exacerbation was 42 days longer in the tiotropium group compared to the salmeterol group (187 days vs 145 days, respectively, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.77-0.90, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, tiotropium reduced the number of moderate exacerbations by 14% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), severe exacerbations by 28% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and the number of patients requiring corticosteroids, antibiotics, or both compared to salmeterol (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for all 3). Tiotropium-treated patients had an 11% reduction in annual exacerbation rate (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Antibiotic use during exacerbations was significantly reduced in patients treated with tiotropium compared with those treated with salmeterol (31.1% vs 34.3%, respectively, HR = 0.85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Adverse events, including cases of pneumonia and number of deaths, were similar between both groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460828">3</xref></sup>

<title>Tiotropium Safety</title>
<p>In 2008, the FDA issued a communication to the public about potential increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular events with tiotropium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828">2</xref></sup> The warning came after Boeringher-Ingelheim reported to the FDA that pooled data from 29 studies showed an increased risk stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828">2</xref></sup> The following September, Singh et al published a meta-analysis in 2008 that evaluated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in COPD patients treated with inhaled anticholingerics, tiotropium (n = 12) and ipratropium (n = 5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460828">10</xref></sup> The meta-analysis reported a 60% relative increase in the primary end point for patients treated with inhaled anticholinergics (relative risk [RR] 1.60; 95% CI 1.22-2.10).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460828">10</xref></sup> There are several limitations to the meta-analysis including biased study selection, limited trials reporting cardiovascular risk, lack of follow-up time assessment, no account for discontinuation rates, differences in baseline characteristics, lack of information on subjects who withdrew from studies, and the combination of data for ipratropium and tiotropium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828">2</xref></sup> In addition to study limitations, the results of the larger UPLIFT and POET-COPD trials have demonstrated no increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular events, or death in patients treated with tiotropium. The FDA convened the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee on November 19, 2009 to discuss the UPLIFT data and in a nearly unanimous vote decided that UPLIFT data addressed the safety concerns with tiotropium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460828">2</xref></sup>

<title>Combination Therapy Studies</title>
<p>Combination therapy is often used for COPD treatment. Combinations may include use of 2 classes of bronchodilators and/or combination of a bronchodilator with an ICS for patients with frequent exacerbations.

Investigators compared the combination of salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone 500 mcg inhaled twice daily to 3 comparators for 3 years: placebo, salmeterol monotherapy, and fluticasone monotherapy. Secondary end points included exacerbation frequency, health status as defined by the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, and spirometry data. Inclusion criteria were very similar to the UPLIFT and POET-COPD studies previously described, except the TORCH study included patients with a slightly lower FEV<sub>1</sub> of less than 60% of predicted. Key exclusion criteria included asthma, other respiratory disorders, need for long-term oxygen, or long-term treatment with corticosteroids. The majority of patients were male, with a baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> around 44% and approximately 30% had received previous treatment with long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist and corticosteroid combination. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality among the groups, though there was a trend toward decreased mortality when combination therapy was compared to placebo (combination 12.6% vs placebo 15.2% HR 0.825; 95% CI, 0.681 to 1.002; <italic>P</italic> = .052). The combination of salmeterol and fluticasone did significantly reduce the annual rate of exacerbations when compared to placebo by 25% (95% CI 1.07-1.2), to salmeterol by 12% (95% CI 0.81-0.95), and to fluticasone by 9% (95% CI 0.84-0.99). The rate of hospitalization was 17% lower with combination therapy compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> <underline>≤</underline> .03). Combination therapy also improved health status and FEV<sub>1</sub> compared to all 3 comparator groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460828">7</xref></sup> The major critiques of the TORCH trial are the 40% patient dropout rate and use of placebo as a comparator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460828">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A post hoc analysis of the TORCH study performed in 2009 stratified patients based on their GOLD COPD stage to determine whether the combination of salmeterol and fluticasone resulted in mortality differences. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as those in the original TORCH study. The majority of patients were classified as stage II (n = 2156) or stage III COPD (n = 3019). As expected, patients with increasing COPD severity had a higher rate of exacerbations, increased smoking history, and decreased quality of life. The combination of salmeterol and fluticasone reduced the rate of death by 33% in patients with stage II COPD (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.98), by 5% in stage III COPD (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.73-1.24), and by 30% in stage IV COPD (HR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.47-1.05) when compared to placebo. Exacerbations were also reduced when comparing combination therapy to placebo. Combination therapy compared to placebo reduced annual exacerbations by 31% in stage II (95% CI 19-40), by 26% in stage III (95% CI 17-34), and by 14% in stage IV (95% CI −4-29). There was no significant improvement in health status scores. As expected, patients receiving regimens that contained ICS had more severe disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012460828">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the addition of tiotropium to regimens already containing an ICS and long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist (triple combination) to tiotropium or combination therapy alone in patients with COPD. Since the GOLD guidelines do not specify 1 bronchodilator over another, many patients with severe or very severe (stages III and IV) disease are on long-acting anticholinergics, long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, and ICS therapy. The primary outcomes of the meta-analysis were all-cause mortality, frequency of hospital admission, exacerbations, pneumonia, and health status. The review included 1051 patients and 3 studies with treatment durations from 3 months to 1 year. Due to the small number of studies available and heterogeneity between the studies, there was no significant difference in mortality, hospitalizations, episodes of pneumonia, or adverse events. Since exacerbation data were so heterogeneous, the data were not combined. There were small improvements in health status based on St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (mean difference 2.49; 95% CI −4.04 to −0.94) and FEV<sub>1</sub> (mean difference 0.06 L; 95% CI 0.04-0.08) for patients treated with the triple combination. The authors concluded that due to meta-analysis limitations, more studies evaluating triple combination therapy need to be conducted in order to determine the true impact of adding tiotropium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460828">6</xref></sup>

<title>Literature Review of Novel Therapies</title>
<p>Two new treatment options, indacaterol and roflumilast, were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COPD patients. Indacaterol is an ultra–long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist approved in July 2011 for the long-term management of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. Indacaterol has an onset of action of 5 minutes with a sustained bronchodilator effect over 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012460828">12</xref></sup> The recommended dosage of indacaterol is one 75 mcg capsule/d administered using the Neohaler inhaler. Phase III studies evaluating indacaterol are described below.</p>

<title>Indacaterol Studies</title>
<p>Feldman et al (2010) conducted a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing the efficacy and safety of indacaterol 150 mcg with placebo. Change in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks was the primary end point. The study included patients (n = 416) with stage II and stage III COPD and a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. Patients were excluded if they had any recent respiratory tract infection, were hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation in the past 6 weeks, had a history of asthma, or any significant pulmonary disease or cardiovascular abnormality. Patients were permitted to continue maintenance ICS and beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists as rescue medications throughout the trial. Indacaterol provided a postbronchodilator response superior to placebo with an indacaterol-placebo difference of 130 mL in FEV<sub>1</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), which exceeded the 120 mL for clinical relevance. The overall rates of adverse events were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%) the most common adverse events were COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). The authors concluded that indacaterol 150 mcg once daily provided effective bronchodilation in patients with stage II and stage III COPD and may be an alternative to the twice-daily long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460828">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Korn et al (2011) conducted a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy trial assessing the efficacy of indacaterol 150 mcg once daily compared to salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily. The primary efficacy end point was time-standardized area under the curve (AUC) for FEV<sub>1</sub>. A total of 1123 patients with stage II and stage III COPD with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years were included. Patients were excluded if they had a history of asthma or concomitant pulmonary disease, type 1 diabetes, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, or cancer (active or with less than 5 years disease-free survival time). Patients were permitted to continue maintenance ICS and short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists as rescue medications throughout the trial. At week 12, indacaterol was statistically superior to salmeterol in time-standardized AUC for FEV<sub>1</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) with an adjusted mean difference of 57 mL, which exceeded the 50 mL for clinically significant difference. The overall rate of adverse events were comparable between groups (indacaterol 33.8% and salmeterol 33.5%) the most common adverse events were COPD worsening (indacaterol 4.5% and salmeterol 5.7%) and headache (3.6% for both). Serious adverse events occurred in 3.6% of indacaterol-treated patients and in 2.8% of salmeterol-treated patients with the most frequent being cardiac-related events. The authors concluded that indacaterol 150 mcg once daily provided more effective bronchodilation compared with salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily in patients with stage II and stage III COPD and may be a useful treatment option.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012460828">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Volgelmeier et al (2010) conducted a multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multidose, crossover study to compare the efficacy of indacaterol 150 mcg, indacaterol 300 mcg, tiotropium 18 mcg, and placebo. Change in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 24 hours post-dose after 14 days was the primary end point. The study included patients (n = 169) of age 40 or older with stage II or stage III COPD with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. Patients were excluded if they had been hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation in the past 6 weeks, had a history of asthma, or had concomitant pulmonary disease of a significant unstable cardiovascular or metabolic comorbidity. Both doses of indacaterol resulted in a superior FEV<sub>1</sub> at 24 hours post-dose compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) with an indacaterol-placebo difference of 170 mL for 150 mcg dose and 150 mL for 300 mcg dose, which exceeded the minimally clinically important difference of 120 mL. Both indacaterol 150 and 300 mcg resulted in noninferiority compared to tiotropium with the indacaterol–tiotropium differences of 40 and 30 mL, respectively. The overall rates of adverse events were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 150 mcg 31.4%, indacaterol 300 mcg 29.5%, tiotropium 28.3%, placebo 28.5%) the most common adverse events were cough (6.8%, 4.9%, 2.5%, 2.4%) and COPD worsening (5.1%, 3.3%, 8.3%, 8.9%). The authors concluded that the bronchodilator effect of indacaterol appears to be at least comparable to tiotropium and may be useful in patients who require treatment for COPD with 1 or more long-acting bronchodilators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012460828">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although 150 mcg was the most commonly studied dose of indacaterol, the FDA approved only the 75 mcg dose. The FDA Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee reviewed the outcomes of patients studied (n = 11 755) in all indacaterol-related COPD studies. In the Safety Addendum to Clinical Review of the FDA Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee, it was noted that there appears to be a numerical trend of increasing incidence of acute-respiratory-related events (death, intubation, COPD-related hospitalization) as the dose of indacaterol increases from 75 to 300 mcg (75 mcg, 0.9% 150 mcg, 1.3% 300 mcg, 2.9%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012460828">16</xref></sup>

<title>Roflumilast Studies</title>
<p>Although bronchodilators can improve health status and reduce the frequency of exacerbations, there is a need for novel agents in the treatment of COPD. Roflumilast is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor approved by the FDA in March 2011 for the treatment of COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012460828">17</xref></sup> Inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 increases intracellular cAMP concentrations, which, ultimately, reduces cellular inflammatory activity. The recommended dose of roflumilast is a 500-mcg tablet by mouth daily, with or without food.</p>
<p>Rabe et al (2005) performed a 24-week, randomized, multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg daily compared to placebo. Change in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and health-related quality of life by St George’s respiratory questionnaire were the coprimary end points. Key secondary end points included changes in spirometry measurements and the rate of COPD exacerbations. Patients (n = 1157) with stage II and stage III COPD and at least a 10-pack-year smoking history were included. Patients were excluded if they had asthma, other lung diseases, were on chronic oxygen or had a recent COPD exacerbation. Postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> improved significantly with roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Compared with placebo, roflumilast 250 mcg daily increased FEV<sub>1</sub> by 74 mL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and roflumilast 500 mcg daily increased FEV<sub>1</sub> by 97 mL (<italic> P</italic> &lt; .0001). Differences in health-related quality of life between roflumilast and placebo were not statistically different. Roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg reduced the overall mean number of exacerbations per patient compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> = .0029). Adverse events were similar between patients treated with roflumilast and placebo. Exacerbation of COPD was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation (4% and 3% for roflumilast 250 and 500mcg, respectively), though this was not significantly different than the placebo group. Diarrhea occurred in 5% of patients receiving roflumilast 250 mcg daily and in 9% of patients receiving roflumilast 500 mcg daily compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012460828">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Calverley et al (2009) conducted 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials with identical design evaluating the efficacy of roflumilast 500 mcg orally/d compared with placebo. Primary end points were change in prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and the rate of moderate (requiring corticosteroid treatment) or severe (hospital admission or death) exacerbations. A total of 3091 patients with stage II or stage III COPD with at least a 20-pack-year smoking history were followed for 52 weeks. Overall, the prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> improved by 48 mL in patients treated with roflumilast compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The RR of moderate exacerbation for patients treated with roflumilast compared with placebo was 0.83 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0003) there was no difference in the risk of severe exacerbation (<italic>P</italic> = .1334). Adverse events were more common with roflumilast (67%) compared with placebo (62%) with the most common adverse effects being diarrhea (roflumilast 8% and placebo 3%) and weight loss (roflumilast 12% and placebo 3%). The mean weight change with roflumilast was −2.09 kg and +0.08 with placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012460828">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The roles of indacaterol and roflumilast in clinical practice are yet to be determined; however, they represent additional treatment options for COPD. Indacaterol could be considered for patients with a history of nonadherence to twice-daily, long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists. Roflumilast is a unique option with its mechanism of action and oral dosage route; it could be considered in the treatment of stage II and stage III COPD, especially for patients who struggle with multiple inhalers.</p>

<sec id="section10-0897190012460828">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current focus of COPD treatment should be on risk factor reduction, including smoking cessation, and improvement of lung function, symptoms, quality of life, and reduction in exacerbations. It is reasonable to consider tiotropium as the first-line, long-acting bronchodilator for patients without contraindications to anticholinergic agents based on results from the UPLIFT and POET-COPD studies. The TORCH study illustrated that the combination of long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists and ICSs is more effective than placebo or respective monotherapies at reducing moderate-to-severe exacerbations in patients with severe COPD. Although data regarding combination of multiple bronchodilators (anticholinergics and beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists) with ICS are limited, this represents a reasonable strategy for severe and very severe patients. At this time, the role of indacaterol and roflumilast will be limited due to their cost and limited outcomes data. The new agents will likely be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate other medications, those with adherence issues, and those who have uncontrolled symptoms with current therapy. Large-scale outcomes studies should continue for existing therapies to elucidate the best combination regimen for COPD patients and novel therapies should continue to be developed.</p>
