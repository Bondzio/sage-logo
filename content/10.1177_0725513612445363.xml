<p>Insofar as we understand music to convey feelings rather than thoughts, to consist of ceaseless movement rather than fixed materials, or to communicate meaning through performance rather than with reference to reality, it is hard to imagine that music can say anything about anything. Music seems to have something sterile and insular about it, as Georg Simmel once put it: it either draws us into or leaves us outside its fugitive forms, and so Simmel himself had very little to say about the musical arts, in contrast to his voluminous studies of sculpture, poetry, and painting. With this in mind, we might say that the ‘and’ in the title of this fascinating and readable book by Eduardo de la Fuente, himself a frequent commentator on Simmel, implies a promise that can hardly be kept: if ‘twentieth century music’ is distinguished from previous musical eras by its deliberate retreat from familiar rhythms and formulaic tonalities, by its purposeless drifting and noisy dissonance, then it seems ill-equipped to pose (much less answer) ‘the question of modernity’. A remark by the economist, EU civil servant, and music theorist Jacques Attali, which De La Fuente cites in his conclusion, offers an efficient summary of the ambiguous problem that contemporary music presents to any complacent assumptions concerning the modernity of the last century:<disp-quote>
<p>When power wants to make people <italic>forget, </italic>music is ritual <italic>sacrifice</italic>, the scapegoat; when it wants them to <italic>believe</italic>, music is enactment, <italic>representation</italic>; when it wants to <italic>silence</italic> them, it is reproduced, normalized, <italic>repetition</italic> … Today, in embryonic form, beyond repetition, lies freedom … the arrival of new social relations. Music is becoming <italic>composition</italic>. (Attali, in De La Fuente 2011: 50; subsequent page references are to De La Fuente’s book)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Highlighting some of the prominent themes and objectives of what is anachronistically or misleadingly called the ‘classical’ as opposed to ‘popular’ music of the last century – from forgetting and enacting (Stravinsky and Schoenberg?) to silencing and repeating (Cage and Stockhausen?) – Attali’s remark also stresses the active and collective dimension of musical composition. In a similar way, De La Fuente is more concerned with composers and the cultural-technical forces that produce them than he is with audiences (who cannot be assumed to be mere passive consumers) and their technologically mediated musical tastes.</p>
<p>In the broad historical and generic sweep of De La Fuente’s book no special place is assigned to the musical culture of Weimar, although in an important sense the stylistic and technical innovations of this period animate both its guiding theoretical frame and its pivotal empirical examples. Max Weber’s posthumously published sociology of music written the previous decade had anticipated the refinement and resistance of the modern ‘musical capacity’ (<italic>musikalisches Gehör</italic>) with respect to the intellectual destruction of tonality, and also noted that the artistic will (<italic>das künstlerisches Wollen</italic>) of future great composers might be expected to overcome the technological means available to them. In De La Fuente’s words, ‘to put it metaphorically, full-blown dissonance is that point at which Weber’s “comma” [that is, the irrational interlude which the principles of harmony can never fully eliminate] becomes more than a punctuation point; it becomes an expressive tool for the construction of full sentences’ (p. 61). While these insights are drawn upon throughout the book, it is Weber’s sociology of religion which provides De La Fuente with his primary leitmotif for characterizing the <italic>calling</italic> of the 20th-century composer: as a prophet of doom, a high priest of culture, an ascetic devoted to purification, or a mystic open to the influence of the divine. Writing in the decades after Weimar, and thus profoundly under its spell, Theodor W. Adorno developed his Weber-inspired philosophy of modern music (<italic>neue Musik</italic>) with special attention to the dynamic ‘mediations’ between musical and social forms, and between musical producers and consumers, in attempting to show a relationship between the regression of critical listening and the myth-making practices of the culture industries more broadly. Following Adorno’s diagnosis, De La Fuente considers whether perhaps ‘one of the greatest delusions on the part of the twentieth century composer [is] that some twentieth century works can lay claim to being their own paradigm, with their own set of technical and stylistic rules’ (p. 44). Taken together, the social theories of Weber and Adorno offer case studies of the hopes and fears, frustrations and aspirations of the experience of modernity which are otherwise expressed in the refined and apparently remote spheres of its constantly changing musical styles.</p>
<p>Arnold Schoenberg epitomizes the ideal type of ‘the composer as prophet’, specifically in announcing ‘the emancipation of dissonance’ in his <italic>Treatise on Harmony</italic>, as if to affirm that a certain euphoric emotionality may emerge from the tension between the sacred mission of the artist and the tragic fate of the modern world. His <italic>Second String Quartet</italic> (1907–8) is often taken to mark a paradigm shift which builds upon the ‘suspended tonalities’ of Wagner’s <italic>Tristan and Isolde</italic> (1857–9) and Debussy’s <italic>Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun</italic> (1894), although here tonality is dispensed with altogether as the autocratic ‘faith’ of a constraining and uniting bond. For Schoenberg, dropping this bond would favour the release and independence of other bonds, not so that ‘anarchy would ensue, but a new kind of order’ (pp. 23–4, quoting Schoenberg). His musical messianism reaches its fullest expression toward the end of the Weimar period in <italic>Moses and Aaron</italic> (1930–2), which projects a curiously acoustic rather than a visionary figure of modern-day prophecy.<disp-quote>
<p>The rejection of vision for hearing, amongst the prophets, creates an interesting proto-type for the avant-garde composer as someone searching for new kinds of auditory experiences. Interestingly, in Schoenberg’s unfinished opera, <italic>Moses and Aaron</italic>, Moses is only able to speak rather than sing. Aaron sings, but even this is a suspect activity. It is he who is responsible for the golden calf episode (i.e., the turn to idolatry). (p. 96)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, the risk taken in the experimental ‘new music’ is that the 12-tone method may itself become a cultural fetish for self-proclaimed disciples, or that its founder may become the idol of the avant-garde. In Schoenberg’s case, the price paid for violating the authoritative rules and transgressing the sacred boundaries of music was his withdrawal from the public world into private performance. As De La Fuente asks, ‘What are we to make of a composer who claimed to have “enjoyed” his “splendid isolation” and who saw his “offering to the world” as a “music that had been found to be ugly at first” but which bore “promise of a new day of sunlight in music”?’ (p. 100, quoting Schoenberg). </p>
<p>If Schoenberg is the Hebrew prophet of 20th-century music, his student Anton von Webern might be called its Protestant ascetic, insofar as he chose to adopt a kind of inner-worldly restraint which favours abstraction over figuration and functionality over ornamentation in the course of advancing an impersonal, frugal, and sober style of composition (pp. 116–24). Webern’s <italic>Three Spiritual Folk Songs</italic> (1925) and<italic> String Trio</italic> (1927), along with other pieces from this period, exhibit a kind of ‘balanced control’ and ‘disciplined play’ (taken up by Boulez a generation later) in which an austere, ‘esoteric neo-Medievalist exercise in sound’ attempts to extend control over tonality to include the regulation of rhythm, timbre, and even the passions themselves:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was Webern, with his short and hyper-ascetic serial pieces, who was the ‘harbinger of a new music’. The Webern whose formula for composing was captured in an epigram where the serial principles of horizontal and vertical forwards and backwards were equally important:</p>
</disp-quote>

</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>This enigmatic Latin palindrome suggests a type of ‘magical square’ in which any number of words can be built from the combination of any number of individual rows in the square. (p. 120, quoting Webern)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Webern’s play on the Sator Square – a cryptic if banal inscription found in the ruins of Pompeii, usually translated as ‘the farmer Arepo has [as] works wheels [a plough]’ – suggests an allegorical expansion on and rule-bound intensification of atonality through the subjection of sound to an alternative order of intervals and sequences. Rather than enchaining music by liberating its dissonances, as Adorno would later accuse Schoenberg of doing, Webern seems even more determined to emancipate music by mastering its sonic material and managing its emotional effects.</p>
<p>The aspirations of the musical prophets and ascetics of the 1920s and early ’30s have their counterparts in the compositional principles adhered to by the priests who preceded them, as in Stravinsky’s commitment to traditional form and doctrinal clarity through professional collaborations and commissions, and by the mystics who came later, as in Cage’s sober, solitary quest for silence and sensibility beyond the meaning of notes and words. Although De La Fuente’s project does not leave room for a closer examination of other Weimar musical masterpieces – such as Berg’s <italic>Wozzek</italic> (1925), Hindemith’s <italic>Kammermusik</italic> (1921–7), or Weil’s <italic>Threepenny Opera</italic> (1928) – his discussion of the post-Second World War experiments in machine music, serialism, and neo-classicism on the one hand, and of recent classification struggles among musical genres, subcultures, and venues on the other, are arguably traceable to these earlier ‘moments musicaux’ of the interwar period. Thus, in his last chapter ‘the question of modernity’ turns into the question of whether the irrationality recovered through the quotation, re-enactment, revival, and recombination of older forms may provide an impulse to a kind of ‘re-enchantment’ through music: ‘Musical re-enchantment, therefore, may very well be a case of the “return of the repressed”; but it cannot be reduced – despite its obvious significance in registering a change in mood – to composers rediscovering the virtues of tonality’ (p. 163). As De La Fuente reminds us, before we surrender to the postmodern streaming of musical culture into professional networks and popular channels, or accept its assimilation into academic frameworks and technocratic filters, we would do well to reflect critically on these earlier experimentations with the timing and tone, performance and composition of our musical modernity.</p>
