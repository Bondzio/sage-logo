<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to examine job strain and family well-being among public health nurses. A total of 239 public health nurses participated in the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire. One-way ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to assess the association of each factor with family well-being. It was found that there was a correlation between job strain and family well-being. Individual and family factors were also associated with family well-being. In all, 67% of nurses had a high rating for family well-being. A large portion of nurses belonged to the category of “active job” (51.5%). More than 50% of nurses were exposed to high “job demand” and 97.5% were in high “job control.” The study suggests that nurses should be promoted with the ability to be in authority and display decision-making skills and should receive support and encouragement from supervisors and coworkers in order to improve family well-being.</p>

<title>Introduction and Literature Review</title>
<p>Family well-being is a dynamic process with a connection between stress and happiness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511415093">1</xref></sup> A high level of family well-being may lead family members to achieve happiness and satisfaction in their life. When a family’s well-being is hampered, stress can affect such families resulting in family dysfunction, such as family members feeling isolated, poor communication, and unclear family roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511415093">2</xref></sup> In Thailand, the warmth in a family has decreased over time, from 67.9% in 2001 to 63.4% and 58.8% in 2004 and 2006, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511415093">3</xref></sup> The Thai divorce rate from 2001 to 2007 reflected the fact that there were an increasing number of divorces, especially in metropolitan Bangkok. As a result, more women have become household leaders: from 27.9% in 2004 to 29.7% in 2005, and 31.0% in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511415093">4</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the number of Thai women who work outside the home has been gradually increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511415093">3</xref></sup> These family construction and function changes have resulted in changing roles for family members, leading to women taking up leadership roles in family and work simultaneously. Super<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511415093">5</xref></sup> asserted in life-space theory that an individual’s combination of life roles may lead to either satisfaction or strain.</p>
<p>Public health nurses must balance work outside the home while maintaining important family roles. Quite often, overlapping family and occupational responsibilities and roles increase stress for some nurses. According to role theory, nurses may be faced with role conflicts when work and family role expectations are incompatible, resulting in job stress and dissatisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511415093">6</xref></sup> Family and work imbalance arises when the demands of work are incompatible with the demands of the family, and this conflict can affect the quality of both work and family lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511415093">7</xref></sup> Currently, we know very little about individual and organizational factors that enable public health nurses to achieve a good balance between their work and family lives.</p>
<p>Karasek and Theorell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup> identified the 3 major aspects of work situations as job demands, job control, and social support. These elements have been combined into a job strain model. Facing high job demands combined with low control in meeting those demands poses the greatest risk for physical and mental health. Job strain was examined in this study in terms of the interaction of the 3 dimensions in the model of Karasek and Theorell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup> Job demands are the psychological stressors present in the work environment, which have been identified in terms of workload, time pressure, and role conflict. Job control refers to the extent to which nurses can exert influence over tasks. This dimension has 2 components: skill discretion (the degree to which the job involves learning new things, creativity, and the development of the individual’s abilities) and decision authority (the individual’s ability to make decisions about his/her own job). Social support is defined as the overall levels of helpful social interaction available on the job from supervisors and coworkers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511415093">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A job characterized by a combination of low job demands and low control authority is labeled a passive job, leading to lost ability to make judgments, resulting in a gradual decrease of performance. The active job is characterized by high job demands and high control. Workers feel that they have freedom to use their skills and have a large measure of control over jobs of high intensity. Then, they transfer their energy into action through effective problem solving, resulting in little residual job strain. A job with a combination of low demands and high control is called a low-strain job and leads to an optimal response to each challenging task. A high-strain job involves high job demands and low control. This results in health complaints and a decrease in the psychological well-being, manifesting itself as anxiety, depression, and physical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the rapid changes in the health care system of Thailand, there are increasing demands on the Public Health Center and public health nurses in order to achieve health service standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511415093">10</xref></sup> Several studies indicated that nurses with excessive workloads can experience pressure, high levels of stress, and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511415093">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511415093"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511415093"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511415093"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511415093">15</xref></sup> The work itself and also the work environment can place a great deal of burden on public health nurses. This may lead to certain negative reactions influencing not only nurses and organizations but also their families.</p>
<p>Although some studies have examined the job strain and individual well-being among nurses, little attention has been directed toward exploring the relationship between job strain and family well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511415093">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511415093">15</xref></sup> This study draws on Karasek and Theorell’s model to examine job strain among public health nurses. Family well-being was determined by evaluating the 3 elements of family structure, family functional role processes, and family vulnerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511415093">1</xref></sup> This study aimed to determine job strain and the family’s well-being among public health nurses. The correlation between individual and family factors and job strain on family well-being among public health nurses was also examined. Research hypotheses included the following: (1) individual and family factors will be related to family well-being and (2) job strain will be related to family well-being. The intention is to help management to encourage a pleasant work environment that will ultimately lead to family well-being among public health nurses.</p>

<sec id="section2-1010539511415093" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The cross-sectional study was done in the Public Health Center (PHC) in the Bangkok metropolitan administration. This study design was suitable for examining the current condition of samples to achieve research aims. Samples were the 239 public health nurses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511415093">16</xref></sup> who were proportionally stratified and randomly recruited from all 68 Public Health Centers in Bangkok. A potential extraneous variable was considered and identified as a selection criterion, and that was gender.</p>
<p>According to the research instrument, a survey questionnaire was developed to examine 4 main constructs:</p>
<list id="list1-1010539511415093" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Part 1</italic>. Individual and family data comprised age, marital status, educational level, work position, work experience in PHC, additional training, job assignments, overtime work, family type (ie, single family and extended family), family income, number of sick family members, concern of caring for family members (responsibility of nurses to spend time and money to take care of family members), and crises events in the family.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Part 2</italic>. Job strain was measured by 33 items that reflected job demands and job control. This part was modified from the job content questionnaire and translated into Thai by Beapetch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511415093">17</xref></sup> The job demands scale included workload, time pressure and role conflict. The job control scale included decision authority and skill discretion. The reliability of the validated job content questionnaire (Thai version) for job demand was 0.71, and for job control, it was 0.79.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511415093">16</xref></sup> The coefficient αs for the job demands and job control in the present study were .70 and .84.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Part 3</italic>. Social support was developed and measured by 21 items that reflected supervisor and coworker support based on Thoits’s concept regarding socioemotional aid, information aid, and instrumental aid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511415093">18</xref></sup> The coefficient αs for supervisor support and coworker support in the present study were .96 and .95.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Part 4</italic>. Family well-being including 46 items modified from the family well-being assessment tool of Caldwell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511415093">1</xref></sup> The 3 components of family well-being included family structural components, family functional role processes, and family vulnerability. In the present study, family well-being yielded a coefficient α of .94.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Instrument content validity was established through expert reviews. Three experts in the area of family health, 1 expert in nursing, and another in management were invited to review the questionnaires. A pilot study of the 4-part questionnaire was carried out prior to the study among public health nurses in Bangkok. In this pilot, 30 public health nurses were randomly selected. Following the pilot study, some sentences that the participants did not understand were amended before conducting the study. Then, Cronbach’s α coefficients were tested for reliability at a significance level of .05.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research, Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University (MUPH2009-081) and the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (Registered number 042.52). After approval was received, the researcher sent a letter to the director of the selected Public Health Centers to ask for permission for data collection. Once data collection was allowed, the researcher contacted a nurse director from each PHC to provide them with information about the type of methodology being used, what would be expected of them, and the number of qualified public health nurses. Voluntary respondents gave written informed consent. Questionnaires were distributed to the selected nurses by the nurse director. Data collection was conducted from June 1 to 30, 2008.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including percentage distribution and arithmetic mean. One-way ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation analysis were applied to analyze the correlation among variables. All statistical tests were carried out using a significance level of .05.</p>

<title>Individual/Family Data and Family Well-Being</title>
<p>A total of 250 public health nurses were included in the study and 239 completed questionnaires. All respondents were female. The majority were aged 41 to 50 years old (51.9%), were married (79.5%), and had graduated with a bachelor’s degree (86.6%). Most respondents had 15 to 21 years of work experience in the PHC (30.1%). A majority of respondents worked as family nurse practitioners (58.2%), followed by school nurses (11.3%). Nearly two thirds (65.7%) had received additional training, and 29.3% were specialists. The majority of the sample was assigned extra jobs, such as risk assessment committee members and knowledge management committee members (81.6%), and 85.4% worked overtime. Regarding income, most respondents earned between 30 001 and 40 000 baht monthly (43.9%). About 60% were single families. One third (33.1%) showed minor concerns about caring for family members, while 8% had strong concerns regarding caring for family members. Another 41% had encountered a crises event in the family where a majority of family members had to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>With respect to the first hypothesis, a correlation was found between some individual/family factors and family well-being. Single nurses had lower levels of family well-being compared with married nurses. Family income levels also affected family well-being. Nurses who had sufficient family income and savings had higher levels of family well-being compared with nurses who had insufficient family income with debt.</p>
<p>With respect to concerns about caring for family members, nurses who had different concerns of caring for family members experienced different family well-being levels. No significant correlation was found between the position of nurses and family well-being (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539511415093">Table 1</xref>). It was also found that age, work experience in PHC, and job assignments had significant positive correlations with family well-being. Also, the number of sick family members and crises events in the family had significant negative correlations with family well-being. However, overtime work did not correlate with the family well-being of nurses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539511415093">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In line with the second hypothesis, a significant correlation between job strain and the 3 components of family well-being was found. Nurses who were in the low strain group had higher levels of family well-being compared with nurses who were in the active and high strain groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539511415093">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1010539511415093">6</xref>). Job control had significant positive correlations with family well-being, and job demands had significant negative correlations with family well-being.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Balance between work and family lives will exist when demands are compatible, thus leading to the satisfaction with work and family lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511415093">5</xref></sup> In this study, the hypothesis was accepted that job strain was related to family well-being among public health nurses. A high level of family well-being was found. This result implied that public health nurses perform well when their work life is balanced with their home lives. Following Karasek and Theorell’s job strain model, the highest strain arises in work when job demands are high, job control is low, and social support is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup> In this study, although the majority of nurses had jobs with high demands, the high job control and high social support factors could be the buffer to decrease job strain. It was consequently found that more than half of the nurses were in an “active job.” Karasek defined an active job as the highest level of performance in which both job control and job demands are high. Nurses feel that they have the freedom to use their skills and the ability to control their jobs. Then, they can translate their energy into effective performance, resulting in little residual job strain. In the present study, nurses who belonged to the low-strain job group had higher levels of family well-being compared with nurses who were in active and high-strain jobs. These findings were in accordance with the job strain model that showed that low strain jobs led to a situation of relaxation and thus could predict a lower than average level of strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511415093">19</xref></sup> Nurses who had few job demands and a high level of job control were actually made both happier and healthier than average by their work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup> Consequently, nurses could receive high satisfaction from work and life.</p>
<p>The job strain model predicted that the greatest risk for stress exists among workers facing an excessive workload or time pressures, combined with low control. In this study, a majority of public health nurses were found to have a low workload, and more than half of them belonged to the high-time-pressure and high-role-conflict groups along with high job control. Findings from this study indicate that even public health nurses working under time pressure and high role conflict but having high control over their low workload could be at low risk of job strain.</p>
<p>Another explanation could be related to the effect of social support, which is one of the key components of the job strain model. Findings showed high levels of social support from both supervisors and coworkers. Karasek indicated that social support is an important resource or coping mechanism that can reduce the effect of time pressure and role conflict stressors. Results also found a positive correlation between social support from supervisors and coworkers and family well-being. Karatepe and Uludag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511415093">20</xref></sup> previously found that social support helped reduce the strain between work and family and also had a positive correlation with family satisfaction. The same finding appeared in the study of Thomas and Ganster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511415093">21</xref></sup>—namely, social support from the supervisor should help the nurse control both job and family problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511415093">22</xref></sup> Several studies indicated that social support from coworkers helped reduce strains and conflicts between work and families among women workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511415093">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511415093"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511415093">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most nurses had high job demands. They also had high job control, which included high decision authority and high skill discretion. It is as Karasek indicated: where the demands of the job are high and the decision authority is also high, then workers can influence the planning and execution of work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511415093">8</xref></sup> Moreover, they would be able to perform with greater efficiency and thus reduce job strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511415093">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, workers with high job control are better able to develop a plan to execute work tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539511415093">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hypothesis that individual and family factors of public health nurses are correlated with family well-being was partially supported in this study. Married nurses and nurses who had sufficient family income and savings had higher family well-being levels compared with that of married nurses and nurses who had insufficient income. This finding was consistent with the findings of Kim and McKenry that married couples were happier than other groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511415093">27</xref></sup> This is because couples could share burdens or stress from dealing with problems and conflicts. As regards income, the majority of nurses received adequate income to cover their family expenses. A similar result was found in the study by Kahn and Pearlin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511415093">28</xref></sup> as well as Jacobs and Gerson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511415093">29</xref></sup>—people who had sufficient income could reduce their perception of stress and also increase levels of well-being.</p>
<p>It was found that nurses who had low concern of caring for family members experienced greater family well-being than those with high concern of caring for members. Moreover, work experience in PHC, job assignments, the number of sick family members, and crises events in the family were associated with family well-being. Similar results were found in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539511415093">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539511415093">31</xref></sup> One explanation may be that these variables could generate stressful circumstances for public health nurses resulting in role conflict, role overload, and family stress. These findings are consistent with the Caldwell family well-being conceptual model that family well-being is a dynamic process with a relation between stress and happiness. When stress is transmitted throughout the family system, family well-being could be threatened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511415093">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the nurses in this study were mainly in an active job. Even where high job demands were found, most of the nurses belonged to the high job control group. Nurses who have job control are more likely to experience low job strain, which supports the finding of a high level of family well-being.</p>
<sec id="section7-1010539511415093">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The study was a cross-sectional one, and thus, changes over time were not observed. No male nurses were sampled. In terms of social support, only support from the public health organizations was considered. Other forms of support from either social agencies or individual families themselves were not considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539511415093">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Further study of the long-term effects of job strain on family well-being is warranted. Research of a broader scope should be conducted to clarify issues raised in this study and to provide more data, so that intervention programs might be crafted and designed to assist workers in dealing with and minimizing job stress.</p>
