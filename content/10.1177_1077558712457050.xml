<abstract>
<p>The Affordable Care Act aims to substantially increase public health insurance eligibility among low-income childless adults. The literature suggests that public health insurance may have important implications for labor market participation. With data from the March supplement to the Current Population Survey, difference-in-difference multivariable regression modeling is used to examine the association between state-level public health insurance expansions and the likelihood of full-time employment, part-time employment, and not working among eligible childless adults. Results indicate that public health insurance eligibility is associated with a 2.2 percentage point decrease in full-time employment, a 0.8 percentage point increase in the likelihood of part-time employment, and a 1.4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of not working. These associations were greatest among those with worse health and those aged from 50 to 64 years. This analysis provides important insights into the potential labor market repercussions of health insurance expansions under the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Employment based health insurance is the most prevalent form of health insurance in the United States. In 2007, 62% of the nonelderly population had employment based health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457050">Fronstin, 2008</xref>). Availability of health insurance through an employer is strongly associated with full-time work status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712457050">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Given the high and variable level of health care costs and strong ties between health insurance and employment, health insurance availability can be a key determinant in labor supply decisions. While public health insurance has generally not been available to nonelderly childless adults, federal policy changes in recent years provided states with more opportunities to expand public insurance coverage. For example, states could expand coverage to adults through 1115 waivers and Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability waivers, providing either free or heavily subsidized public health insurance to the eligible population. Additionally, states could pursue expansions without a federal waiver if they funded the full cost of the expansions.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to examine the association between childless adult public health insurance eligibility and labor force participation, namely, the likelihood of full-time employment, part-time employment, and not working. Low-income childless adults are among the most likely group of Americans to be uninsured, comprising 58% of the nonelderly uninsured population in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712457050">Hoffman et al., 2009</xref>). An aim of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to expand Medicaid to all citizens less than 133% of the federal poverty level regardless of parental status. Given this potential policy change, it is important to have an understanding of the association between public health insurance expansions and the labor supply behavior of those in the newly eligible population.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Findings regarding the impact of public health insurance on labor supply are mixed in the empirical literature. A large portion of the literature focuses on the effect of Medicaid on the labor force participation of low-income single mothers. Since Medicaid participation has historically been collinear with public assistance participation, studies have had to confront the issue of identifying the marginal impact of Medicaid on labor supply. One such approach is to exploit the variation in the generosity of state Medicaid programs to identify the value of Medicaid to potential recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457050">Blank, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712457050">Montgomery &amp; Navin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712457050">Winkler, 1991</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457050">Blank (1989)</xref> finds no effect of the value of Medicaid coverage on labor market behavior, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712457050">Winkler (1991)</xref> finds small negative effects of Medicaid on labor force participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712457050">Montgomery and Navin (2000)</xref> find that the effects of Medicaid are sensitive to the treatment of state effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712457050">Moffitt and Wolfe (1992)</xref> take a different approach using a family specific measure of Medicaid value based on expected medical spending, finding that increased Medicaid benefits led to lower rates of labor force participation. Several studies have attempted to exploit a series of legislative initiatives severing the link between Medicaid and welfare participation as a way to identify the effect of Medicaid coverage on labor force participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712457050">Yelowitz (1995)</xref> finds that Medicaid eligibility expansions led to small increases in the labor force participation of single women. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712457050">Meyer and Rosenbaum (2000)</xref> find that the labor force participation effects are driven entirely by Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and not Medicaid expansions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712457050">Ham and Shore-Sheppard (2005)</xref> reexamine the evidence presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712457050">Yelowitz (1995)</xref> and find no effect of Medicaid expansions on labor force participation.</p>
<p>Evidence regarding the effect of Medicare eligibility on retirement is limited. In theory, Medicare eligibility should provide a strong retirement incentive for individuals without access to retiree health insurance. However, the identification of the Medicare effect on retirement is difficult due to Medicare eligibility closely coinciding with the social security retirement age. Much of the literature examining the impact of Medicare on labor force participation uses either dynamic programming or structural models, finding that Medicare increases retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712457050">French &amp; Jones, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712457050">Johnson, Davidoff, &amp; Perese, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712457050">Madrian &amp; Beaulieu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712457050">Rust &amp; Phelan, 1997</xref>). In contrast to these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457050">Lumsdiane, Stock, and Wise (1994)</xref> incorporate the value of Medicare in their structural model of retirement and find little effect of new Medicare eligibility on retirement decisions.</p>
<p>Another group of studies in the literature examine the impact of retiree health insurance on labor force participation, consistently finding that individuals with access to retiree health insurance leave the labor force earlier than individuals without such coverage. However, many of these studies have suffered from the potential endogeneity between retiree health insurance availability and pension incentives associated with retirement and preferences for leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712457050">Karoly &amp; Rogowski, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712457050">Madrian, Burtless, &amp; Gruber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712457050">Rogowski &amp; Karoly, 2000</xref>). Two approaches have been taken in the literature to deal with these potential simultaneity issues. One such approach is to develop a structural model of retirement decisions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712457050">Gustman and Steinmeier (1994)</xref> estimate a model that incorporates both pension and health insurance retirement incentives and find that retiree health insurance reduces the age at retirement by approximately 1.3 months. Taking a similar approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712457050">Rust and Phelan (1997)</xref> estimate that retiree health insurance increases the probability of retiring before age 65 years by 12% to 29%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712457050">Blau and Gilleskie (2001)</xref> find that the availability of retiree health insurance increases exits from employment by 2 to 6 percentage points per year. Another approach to deal with the potential simultaneity is to find variation in insurance availability after retirement that is exogenous to retirement preferences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457050">Gruber and Madrian (1995)</xref> use this approach to examine the effect of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act on retirement. They find a 30% increase in the probability of retiring among those eligible for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act benefits, relative to those not eligible for such benefits. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712457050">Boyle and Lahey (2010)</xref> exploit the expansion of the Veterans Affairs health care system and find that the expansion of coverage resulted in reductions in full-time work and increases in both part-time work and nonwork.</p>
<p>Although most of the research on labor force participation has focused on older workers and welfare recipients, another group of studies has examined the labor supply of married couples. Identification of the effect of labor supply comes from comparing labor force participation and hours worked of married women whose spouses have employer sponsored coverage with women whose spouses do not have such coverage. Identification rests on the strong assumption that a husbandâs employer sponsored insurance is exogenous to a womanâs labor market participation decisions. Findings suggest that married women with health insurance through their spouse are 6 to 20 percentage points less likely to work than women without such coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457050">Buchmueller &amp; Valletta, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712457050">Olson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712457050">Schone &amp; Vistnes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712457050">Wellington &amp; Cobb-Clark, 2000</xref>). Additionally, these studies find that women with spousal insurance are less likely to work full-time jobs or jobs offering health insurance, while they are more likely to work part-time jobs and fewer hours. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457050">Chou and Staiger (2001)</xref> identify the labor force participation effect of health insurance by exploiting the availability of dependent health insurance coverage through the National Health Insurance program in Taiwan. The authors find that the availability of insurance for nonworkers was associated with a 4 percentage point decrease in labor force participation among married women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457050">Chou &amp; Staiger, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While public health insurance availability may lead to reductions in labor force participation, it may also lead to increased employment among those in the labor force and worker productivity. Evidence of this effect has been demonstrated in Canada, in which employment increased following the implementation of national health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712457050">Gruber &amp; Hanratty, 1995</xref>). In addition to increasing labor supply, public health insurance availability also has the potential to reduce job-lock, allowing individuals to change jobs without fear of losing their health insurance. State laws mandating continued access to employer provided health insurance for the nonemployed have been shown to increase job switching among those eligible for such benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457050">Gruber &amp; Madrian, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712457050">1997</xref>). The authors suggest that these mandates may increase worker productivity by providing the worker with a broader job search and the ability to find a higher paying job.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>As shown, findings in the literature have been mixed regarding the impact of public health insurance on labor force participation. The natural experiments provided by state level public health insurance expansions to childless adults provide an excellent opportunity to build on the current literature and further examine the relationship between access to health insurance and labor force participation. Variation in expansion implementation timing and eligibility criteria provides a relatively clean source for identifying the association between public health insurance eligibility and labor force participation. It also allows for the examination of younger versus older groups, where theory would predict differences as confirmed in prior literature. Unlike many previous studies, the source of identification in this study is independent of omitted personal characteristics that may be correlated with post employment health insurance and incentives to alter labor force participation behavior. The source of identification is also independent of omitted job characteristics and pension plan availability that may be correlated with employer provided coverage and post employment insurance.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077558712457050">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Our conceptual framework is based on a model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457050">Buchmueller and Valletta (1999)</xref>, which examined the effect of employer-provided health insurance on the labor supply of married women. In that article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457050">Buchmueller and Valletta (1999)</xref> show that an exogenous offer of health insurance to a working individual will unambiguously cause a utility maximizing worker to substitute leisure for consumption. They argue that this substitution is due to a âthreshold effectâ that occurs because, at most firms, there is a minimum number of hours worked required to receive health insurance.</p>
<p>Under the expansions, once eligible for health insurance that is unrelated to employment, workers will no longer be required to work the minimum number of hours to have access. Thus, public health insurance eligibility essentially acts as a nonwage income transfer, increasing an individualâs budget constraint. Given this increase in income, economic theory would suggest a reduction in labor hours. We argue that the full effect of expanded public coverage on labor supply combines the threshold effect and income effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457050">Buchmueller and Valletta (1999)</xref> show that both full-time workers and those working less than full-time will reduce the number of hours spent working. Thus, we hypothesize that the availability of health insurance unrelated to employment status will reduce the probability of working full-time while increasing the probability of not working and/or the probability of working part-time.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1077558712457050">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The primary data source for this analysis is the March annual demographic supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) for the years 1998-2008. The March supplement to the CPS provides a large database with detailed demographic, employment, and health insurance information. Detailed information on family structure, household income, and state identifiers make it possible to impute eligibility for the childless adult public health insurance expansions given each states eligibility criteria. In addition to information on labor force status in the current year, the CPS includes information on labor force participation and job characteristics in the previous year, allowing for the examination of labor force participation over a 1-year period. Similar to previous studies, the sample is limited to individuals who report working at least one week in the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457050">Gruber &amp; Madrian, 1995</xref>). With detailed information on labor participation status it is possible to examine the probability of working full-time, part-time, and not working. State level economic data were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>
<p>The sample is limited to childless adults aged 19 to 64 years with family incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level. Further exclusions include pregnant women and individuals reporting coverage through Medicare or TRICARE as they may have access to other forms of public health insurance. Students younger than 23 years are excluded because of their potential eligibility for private insurance through a parent. Also excluded are noncitizens as they may not be eligible for state programs. Childless adult programs of interest are limited to public health insurance expansions implemented from 1998 to 2008 unrelated to employment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712457050">Table 1</xref>). The final sample consists of 118,587 childless adults in both expansion states and nonexpansion states.</p>

<title>Multivariable Analysis</title>
<p>When examining the association between insurance expansions and labor force participation, it is important to consider the possibility of biased estimates due to self selection and unobserved heterogeneity. Even with a rich set of explanatory variables in the model, unobserved heterogeneity may be an issue if insurance is treated as exogenous. Differences in outcomes will reflect a combination of the casual effect of insurance and the effect of unmeasured characteristics that are correlated with insurance coverage. This problem can be mitigated through the use of difference-in-difference modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712457050">Buchmueller, Grumbach, Kronick, &amp; Kahn, 2005</xref>), in which changes in the outcomes from the control group are subtracted from those of the treatment group, controlling for any group-specific and time-specific effects that may have affected labor force participation during the study years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457050">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). The treatment group includes childless adults eligible for the public insurance coverage expansions, while the control group consists of childless adults at or below 300% of the federal poverty level in states without childless adult health insurance expansions. In addition to the use of a control group, a rich set of covariates are included in the model to control for the different characteristics between the treatment and control groups across the study period. Labor force participation is a function of the individualâs eligibility for coverage, sociodemographic characteristics, employment characteristics, and local area characteristics.</p>
<p>To examine the association between expansion eligibility and labor force participation, a logistic regression model and an ordered logistic regression model were examined. The multivariable regression models have the following specification:</p>

<p>where the subscripts <italic>i, j</italic>, and <italic>t</italic> stand for the <italic>i</italic>th individual in the <italic>j</italic>th state in the <italic>t</italic>th time period. In the ordered logistic regression model, LFP<sub><italic>ijt</italic></sub> is an ordered variable coded as either not working if the individual is not employed at the time of the survey, part-time if employed, and working less than 35 hours per week at the time of the survey, and full-time if employed and working 35 hours or more per week at the time of the survey. In the logistic regression model, LFP<sub><italic>ijt</italic></sub> is coded as 1 if the individual is not working and 0 otherwise. All independent variables are the same across both models. Post<sub><italic>ijt</italic></sub> is an indicator of whether the observation is in the post expansion period. Eligible<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> indicates whether an individual is eligible for the expansion. The primary variable of interest in this model Post * Eligible<sub><italic>ijt</italic></sub>; the interaction term of time difference (pre/post) and group difference (treatment/control), represents the association between expanded public health insurance eligibility and labor force participation. The vector <italic>X</italic>
<sub><italic>ijt</italic></sub> contains a set of individual sociodemographic and employment characteristics, as well as local area characteristics: age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, employer sponsored health insurance availability in the previous year, pension availability, industry and occupation controls from the longest job held in the previous year, and county level urban/rural status.</p>
<p>A full set of state and year fixed effects are also included in the model to account for trends and differences across states not related to the expansions. The models are identified by variation in program eligibility across several dimensions, cross-state variation in the timing of expansion implementation, as well as cross-state and within-state variation over time in the income eligibility criteria for the expansion programs. Such differences in eligibility provide plausibly exogenous variation that can be used to identify the association between the health insurance expansions and labor force participation. In addition to the core analysis, subgroup analyses stratified by age-group (19-34, 35-49, and 50-64 years) and self-reported health status (excellent/very good, good/fair/poor) were examined. All subgroup analyses were examined with ordered logistic regression models and included a full set of control variables.</p>
<p>The estimation approach will not produce unbiased estimates if state decisions concerning health insurance expansions were based on anticipated state-specific trends in the insured status of childless adults. For example, at the time of implementation, states expecting strong economic growth may provide more generous expansions than states with weaker expected growth. To address the potential problem of policy endogeneity in the models, state level unemployment rates in years <italic>t</italic> and <italic>t</italic> â 1 and state level per capita income in years <italic>t</italic> and <italic>t</italic> â 1 are included. These policy relevant variables vary across state and over time and should capture the effect of potentially confounding state-specific trends.</p>
<p>All analyses were conducted in Stata version 11.1. The marginal effects of each of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable were computed using the margins command. The marginal effect of each explanatory variable on labor force participation can be interpreted as the percentage point change in the probability associated with a one unit change in the explanatory variables. The difference-in-difference marginal effect can be interpreted as the percentage point change in the probability of a given labor market participation outcome associated with expanded public insurance eligibility.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics of the low-income childless adult sample pooled over the 1998-2008 time period are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712457050">Table 2</xref>. The first column includes childless adults eligible for insurance expansions, while the second column includes characteristics of the control group; low-income childless adults in states without expansion programs. As shown, the demographic characteristics between the eligible childless adults sample are reasonably similar to those in the control group. For example, the proportion of female, race/ethnicity, self-reported health status, and employment characteristics are similar across the two groups.</p>

<p>Among eligible childless adults in expansion states there was a reduction in full-time employment after expansion implementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712457050">Figure 1</xref>). For eligible childless adults in expansion states, the average full-time employment rate was 56.1% prior to expansion implementation and then declined to 51.6% in post expansion years. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712457050">Figure 1</xref> also shows moderate increases in part-time employment and not working among eligible childless adults in expansion states after program implementation. For example, among eligible childless adults in expansion states, the average part-time employment rate increased from 21.5% prior to expansion implementation to 23.5% after implementation, while the average percent not working increased from 22.4% to 24.8% after expansion implementation.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712457050">Table 3</xref> displays the results from the ordered logistic regression model examining the association between the expansions and the probability of working full-time, working part-time, and the probability of not working. The table presents the marginal effects of the main variables of interest as well as several covariates included in the model. Health insurance expansion eligibility is associated with a 2.2 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of working full-time, a 0.8 percentage increase in the likelihood of working part-time, and a 1.4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of not working. Covariate estimates are presented for several of the covariates included in the model and are in the expected direction, for example, those in better health, and with higher education levels are more likely to be employed full-time and less likely to not be working. Those with employer sponsored insurance in the previous year and a pension are more likely to report working full-time and less likely to report working part-time.</p>

<title>Limitations and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>While this study provides interesting insight into the association between public health insurance eligibility and labor market participation, it is also subject to certain limitations. The study only includes low-income childless adults, and hence, the results are not likely generalizable to the population as a whole. Another limitation to our approach is the assumption associated with the ordered logistic regression model. This model relies on the proportional odds assumption, in which the relationship between the lowest versus all higher categories of the response variable is the same as the relationship between the next lowest category and all higher categories. We tested the sensitivity of our results to this assumption by first employing a logistic regression model examining the probability of not working. As shown, the results from this model were robust. We also examined a multinomial logistic regression model estimating the probability of full-time employment, part-time employment, and not working. While this particular model has its own assumptions (independence of irrelevant alternatives) and limitations, the results were very similar to those from the ordered logistic regression model. We also examined difference-in-difference-in-difference specifications with a control group comprised of low-income childless adults in states without expansions. However, these particular models, which added several additional interaction terms to capture the difference-in-difference-in-difference effect, suffered from collinearity among variables serving as controls. Specifically, the expansion state/eligible interaction term was collinear with the eligible variable, thereby not estimating a true difference-in-difference-in-difference effect.</p>
<p>Another issue is that difference-in-difference results could be substantially affected by the choice of control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712457050">Marquis &amp; Long, 2003</xref>). To test the robustness of the results, multiple control groups were employed. The same analysis was conducted using a control group comprised of near eligible childless adults within the states with childless adult insurance expansions. The models were also examined including noncitizens as some state programs do not factor citizenship status into eligibility determination. Additionally, analysis was conducted in which the definition of those working in the previous year is altered to include those who worked more than 10 weeks in the previous year. The results from all the alternative model specifications are the same as those found in the core model providing support for the robustness of the findings by choice of control group and inclusion criteria. Results from the sensitivity analyses are available from the authors on request.</p>
<p>Another limitation in our analysis involves the calculation of the marginal effects from the ordered logistic regression model. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457050">Ai and Norton (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712457050">Norton, Wang, and Ai (2004)</xref> have noted, marginal effects and their standard errors cannot be obtained directly from the coefficients of interaction terms in nonlinear models. While we corrected for this issue in our logistic regression model using the margins command in Stata, we were unable to do so for the ordered logistic regression model. An additional limitation to our analysis is that of endogeneity. This issue arises since eligibility for childless adult health insurance expansions is reliant on income, and thus endogenous with respect to labor force participation. It is possible that individuals seek to reduce their income by cutting back on hours worked or stopping work altogether in an effort to achieve public health insurance eligibility, thus biasing the effect of eligibility on the extent of involvement in the labor force. Given this limitation, it is important to note that our results, while informative, do not suggest causation. Future work in this area could examine health insurance expansions in which eligibility is not dependent on income directly or expansions with additional eligibility criteria in an effort to alleviate such bias from the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section10-1077558712457050" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results indicate that childless adult public health insurance expansions were associated with a reduction in the likelihood of full-time employment and an increase in the likelihood of part-time employment and not working. As previous research has demonstrated, similar childless adult health insurance expansions have been shown to be associated with increases in health insurance coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712457050">Guy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712457050">Guy, Adams, &amp; Atherly, 2012</xref>). There are many possible contributing factors that could lead to the observed changes in labor market participation among those eligible for public health insurance expansions. One such possibility may be explained by the differential availability of employer sponsored health insurance among full-time and part-time employees. Employers seldom offer health insurance to part-time employees, typically only offering coverage to full-time employees. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712457050">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2010)</xref>, 86% of full-time workers have access to health insurance benefits, while only 24% of part-time workers have access to such benefits. Consistent with the threshold effect, some employees who would otherwise work part-time may be working full-time to acquire health insurance coverage. However, once public health insurance unrelated to employment becomes available, it is possible that employees either exit the labor force or switch to part-time work as they no longer require the health insurance benefits associated with full-time employment. This behavior may be even more prevalent among individuals in a poorer health state as suggested by our subgroup analysis. Individuals in poorer health may be holding on to their full-time job in an effort to remain insured. These individuals may be unable to afford the required premiums in the individual market or unable to qualify for coverage because of preexisting condition restrictions. However, once eligible for a childless adult expansion, it is possible to leave full-time employment while remaining insured. It may also be the case that individuals do not work or work part-time in an effort to avoid increasing their income enough to lose public health insurance coverage. By not working full-time, individuals would be able to keep their income below the income eligibility threshold and remain eligible for public insurance.</p>
<p>The availability of public health insurance may also have an impact on the nature of the transition out of the labor force. Eligibility for public insurance should reduce job-lock making it easier for workers to change jobs, leading to more productive employeeâemployer matches. Part-time employment can be used as a bridge job, an important intermediate step in the labor force withdrawal process of many individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712457050">Quinn &amp; Kozy, 1996</xref>). Once eligible for public health insurance, individuals can move from full-time employment to part-time employment, making a gradual withdrawal from the labor force. Reduction in job-lock among older workers allows for an easier transition out of the labor force and into retirement. Given public health insurance availability, this transition can be made without losing health insurance coverage. We see some evidence of this in our analysis, especially in our subgroup analysis stratified by age. Among those eligible for public health insurance and nearing retirement (aged 50-64 years), we see a larger reduction in the likelihood of full-time employment along with an increased likelihood of part-time employment.</p>
<p>Similar studies in the literature support our findings that the availability of health insurance unrelated to employment is associated with changes in labor force participation. For example, men with health insurance not reliant on continued employment have been shown to be less likely to work full-time and more likely to work part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712457050">Rust &amp; Phelan, 1997</xref>). Spousal health insurance has been shown to reduce the probability of working full-time and increase both the probability of working part-time and the probability of not working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457050">Buchmueller &amp; Valletta, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712457050">Schone &amp; Vistnes, 2000</xref>). Additionally, health insurance offered through the Veterans Affairs health care system and Medicaid eligibility for women have been shown to reduce the probability of working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712457050">Boyle &amp; Lahey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712457050">Winkler, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that childless adult public health insurance eligibility is associated with a reduced likelihood of full-time employment and an increased likelihood of part-time employment and not working, particularly among those in a worse health state and those nearing retirement age. These results have important labor market implications given the potential health insurance expansions in the ACA. The intent of the ACA was to expand Medicaid coverage to all citizens, including childless adults, up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Our analysis, of a population inclusive of many who may be newly eligible under the ACA, suggests that such expansions may be associated with important changes in labor market participation. Given these implications, it is clear that further research is needed to better understand how low-income individuals value health insurance coverage and labor market participation. This knowledge can help policymakers strengthen public health insurance programs and policies aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans while maintaining high levels of employment and the health and productivity of workers.</p>
