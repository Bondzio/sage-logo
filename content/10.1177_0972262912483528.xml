<abstract>
<p>The present study is an attempt to develop a theoretical framework of career oriented attitudes (COAs) and employability of technology graduates from Indian institutions and also to develop scales to measure the same. Secondly, in this study, (<italic>a</italic>) the existing levels of such attitudes (viz., career-task involvement, career-goal sensitivity, career-purpose social networking and career-linked self-efficacy) and competitive strength for employability (CSEMP) have been measured and (<italic>b</italic>) the impact of such career oriented attitudes on competitive strength for employability of those graduates has been assessed. The two scales were administered to 222 technology graduates from three different segments of selected technology institutions. Career-purpose social networking was found very strong and the other three attitudes as well as CSEMP were found strong among the technology graduates. Correlation analysis shows that all the four attitudes are correlated with each other and regression analysis reveals that such attitudes have positive impact on Competitive Strength for Employability of the Indian technology graduates. The theoretical framework presented in this article and the measures developed for COAs and CSEMP are significant value addition to the body of knowledge in the organization and management area.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Attitudes to work, before entering a job, are perhaps more important, as they are antecedents and precursors to work-place performance and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0972262912483528">Josiam et al., 2009</xref>, p. 5). In a study by Flynn (1994), a majority of human resource managers reported the significance of attitude in the choice of qualified candidates. In general, attitude is a psychological component that expresses an individual tendency towards an expression of either positive or negative degree of inclination to a particular entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0972262912483528">Eagly and Chaiken, 1993</xref>). Career theorists have proposed that under normal circumstances, people will experience four career stages: exploration, establishment, maintenance and disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912483528">Cron, 1984</xref>). Fresh graduates clearly appear in the exploration stage of their careers. The authors argue that the students carry their existing attitudes to their workplace while being employed and it can have significant impact on their job performance. Organizations generally inculcate conceptual and technical skills in new entrants, but it is not possible for them to develop desired attitudes in them in short period. Therefore, the attitudes that the new entrants bring with them to the workplace are carried forward particularly in the exploration and establishment stage of their careers. Hence, the existing attitudes of the new entrants are taken as significant antecedents to their job performance. Viewed thus, the authors of this article argue that at the time of judging employability of the fresh graduates, their existing work attitudes should essentially be measured. Second, in the current era of highly competitive and turbulent environment, students need to develop their competitive robustness in order to enhance the strength of their employability. Employability of the students (fresh graduates) is related to not only the extent to which they possess the conceptual knowledge and technical or technological skills but also to the attitudes and other attributes and skills (for example, behavioural). Extant research (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0972262912483528">Gokuladas, 2010</xref>) indicates that non-technical part of education which includes training for soft or behavioural skills development is a strong predictor of employability in the changing world of work. Earlier research (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0972262912483528">Feldman and Ng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0972262912483528">Griffeth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912483528">Josefek and Kauffman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0972262912483528">Joseph et al., 2007</xref>) also indicates that individual attributes strongly influence career decision of the individuals. Jain et al. (2006) observe that career oriented attitudes have a significant role in effective implementation of career plans and particularly in the success garnered by individual careerists. Careerists often feel and talk of their career oriented attitudes but seldom do they put in systematic efforts to identify, measure and modify them; and to make effective use of them to obtain the desired results. In order to take sound career decisions, the professional graduates (careerists) should be aware of their ‘career oriented attitudes’ and they should make concerted efforts to develop such attitudes. Career counsellors are expected to facilitate them in this context.</p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>It is a well established proposition that individual capability or competence should be matched with organizational job requirements. Individual capability or competence is a set of observable performance dimensions which include individual knowledge, skills, attitudes and other personality factors and behaviours. The study of Gokuladas (2010) revealed that training in non-technical aspects has an impact in ensuring the employability of engineering graduates. Josiam et al. (2009) found that with increasing age and experience, students’ positive work attitude was enhanced, while their negative attitudes were ameliorated. Orpen (1998) found that performance measurability moderated the relationship between careerist attitudes and career success, with such attitudes more closely related to success among employees in jobs where performance is difficult to measure. Jarlstrom’s (2002) study indicates that personality has influence on career orientations of the students. Jarlstrom (2000) examined the relationship between the personality and career expectations of business students. She reported that Business students’ career expectations were mostly seen as belonging to the Technical Competence (26 per cent), Managerial Competence (17 per cent) and Independence (14 per cent). Jain et al. (2006) found various career oriented attitudes of Indian IT graduates (viz., career sensitivity, career independence, career outgoingness, tolerance for career ambiguities, toughness in careerism) at moderate level across the various segments of the institutions and they found career competitiveness of such graduates at high level. Gunkel and Schlaegel (2010) examined the country-specific influence of the Big Five personality traits on career decisiveness and its determinants (viz., career related adaptability, career related optimism and career related knowledge) among Chinese and German students and their study show that personality traits affect career decisiveness and its determinants and that the effects partly differ across countries. A study carried out by Rasdi et al. (2011) shows that networking behaviour is positively related to both objective and subjective career success and they also revealed that both career planning and career tactics contributed significantly to variance in all measures of career success. The study of Messarra et al. (2009) suggests that a strong relationship exists between goal orientation and career anchors. Generally, meta-analyses and reviews of earlier researches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0972262912483528">Betz and Luzzo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0972262912483528">Hackett and Lent, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0972262912483528">Lent et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0972262912483528">Multon et al., 1991</xref>) strongly support the role of self-efficacy as a predictor of academic performance as well as career decision-making intentions and behaviours.</p>
<p>The review of literature indicates that rare research endeavours in the field of personality and attitudes of the students in relation to their career concerns, competitive strength and employability have been done so far. Only a few conceptual frameworks, for example, Career Anchor Concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0972262912483528">Schein, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0972262912483528">1978</xref>), Vocational Identity Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912483528">Holland et al., 1980</xref>), Career Orientation Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912483528">DeLong, 1982</xref>), Career Commitment Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0972262912483528">Farmer, 1985</xref>), Career Decision Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0972262912483528">Osipow et al., 1987</xref>), CDMSE: Career Decision-making Self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0972262912483528">Taylor and Betz, 1983</xref>), Career Orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0972262912483528">Feldman and Weitz, 1991</xref>), Career Success Outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0972262912483528">Baruch, 2004</xref>) and Career Future Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0972262912483528">Rottinghaus et al., 2005</xref>) have been developed and validated only in the context of career planning and development of the already employed people. None of these concepts/measures (except CDMSE) has been validated for the purpose of studying career issues and concerns of students and new entrants in the organizations. Such observations trigger the interest of the authors of this article to develop and validate a fresh framework as well as a measure for studying career oriented attitudes of the students in relation to their competitive strength for employability. In this article, the authors classified and defined the attitudes of careerists (technology graduates), developed a measure (Likert type scale) for the same, tested the validity and reliability of such a measure and also assessed such attitudes of the fresh graduates of the selected Indian professional institutions.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework of Career Oriented Attitudes and Employability</title>
<p>Combined analysis of the views expressed by the recruitment managers, employed graduates and candidates selected in IAS was exercised and based on the outcomes of such analysis, a theoretical framework of career oriented attitudes and employability was developed. Such a framework has been presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483528">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The issue of employability has become critical in current competitive environment. Due to fast pace of globalization of world’s economies, the work context has changed dramatically. As a result, career scene has also changed and it moved away from the traditional context to boundary less careers. The knowledge, skills and attitudes required from fresh graduates, existing employees and other career aspirants who intend either to enter in the world of work or to change their existing jobs have also been changed tremendously. The fewer job opportunities, reduced job security, skills shortage in the employment market and challenge of recruiting and retaining talented employees have led to an emphasis on developing career competencies including career oriented attitudes to improve employability of the fresh graduates (new entrants) as well as the existing employees. Marock (2008) suggested that people should take responsibility for managing their careers and posits that people who have higher levels of psychological career resources are generally more able to manage their careers and adapt to changing circumstances. Fugate et al. (2004) and Griffen and Hesketh (2005) also support such views and they found that people who have a wide range of psychological career resources are generally more able to adapt to changing circumstances and to have higher levels of employability attributes. People need to learn how best to present themselves before the prospective employers and how to make careful decisions about their careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0972262912483528">Coetzee and Beukes, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is important to help career aspirants to nurture, develop and modify their career oriented attitudes. Potgieter (2012), in his recent study, found that career meta-competencies do influence employability attributes significantly. In fact employability is influenced by many factors including career management practices.</p>
<p>The students may handle the challenge of enhancing level of their employability not only through the accumulation of more knowledge and sharpening their technical skills to suit the potential employers but also through developing their inner strength by the way of grasping career linked attitude orientation and behavioural skills development. The institutions of higher education need to assume greater responsibility in this context. They should not be confined to play the only role of knowledge provider and technical skills developer. Providing career related information to the students and making them aware of career opportunities and coordinating campus placement drives are also not enough. With the devising of the systems of on-line placement or recruitment portals, placement or recruitment agencies/consultancy services and pooling of corporate recruiters for campus placement, etc., the system of placement cells of the institutions is gradually becoming less and lesser relevant year after year. In such a scenario, the institutions need to focus on improving their development oriented climate on one hand and on the other, they need to provide the services of well trained counsellors to the students. Career counsellors are expected to focus on (<italic>a</italic>) developing inner strength of the students by providing attitude orientation and development; and (<italic>b</italic>) enabling the students to develop their career plans which must match with their competitive strength and the ground realities of employability. In order to increase the choices and chances of more and better employability, students need to enhance the level of their competitive strength on incremental basis. They must understand that inner strength is the most significant source of the competitive strength and that focusing upon the external career aspects is not sufficient. Schein (1993) suggests that ‘regardless of your present career, your future decisions will be easier and more valid if you have a clear understanding of your own orientation toward work, your motives, your values, and your self-perceived talents’. In this context, the proposed framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483528">Figure 1</xref>) explains better the entire conceptualization.</p>

<title>A Brief Description of the Key Variables of the Framework</title>
<p><bold>Development Oriented Institutional Climate (DOIC):</bold> The following are the key characteristics of favourable institutional climate: an open culture where effective communication in all directions is ensured; a live environment where open-ended activities are going on with the active involvement of both students and faculty; an encouraging milieu in which creativity and innovativeness flourish; a positive atmosphere in which informal interaction, collaboration for mutual development and experimentation for learning is promoted; a learning climate in which opportunities for the students to have mutually satisfying interactions with the relevant experts and practicing professionals are available; and a favourable setting where learning is reinforced by the system and practice of active reception , supportive feedback and timely appreciation of favourable results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483528">Jain and Chatterjee, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Career-tasks Involvement (CTI):</bold> It is the prime attitude of a student to work for a career which is fairly challenging; to get himself highly involved in career oriented work; to work on a continuous basis; to like to work independently; to get much satisfaction on achieving career related success; and to desire positive feedback/appreciation from other related people on their career related performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483528">Jain et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Career-goal Sensitivity (CGS):</bold> It is eccentricity of a student towards pursuing career goals. It is the tendency of the student to be emotionally engaged in his/her career development endeavours and often become anxious about the outcomes of such endeavours and career sensitivity provides the students with a rich diet of career issues/problems and points to ponder, keeping them keenly motivated at all times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483528">Jain et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Career-purpose Social Networking (CPSN):</bold> It refers to developing social and mutual help relationship with all those who can provide information related to career opportunities and potential employers and with all those who can provide necessary resources and other support required for the development of the competencies and competitive strength for employability. High involvement in industrial training and project work and active participation in academic events, career counselling/career training sessions, extra-curricular activities and other socio-cultural functions generally help in developing productive social networking.</p>
<p><bold>Career Linked Self-Efficacy (CLSE):</bold> It refers to belief in one’s competencies with respect to the behaviours necessary in a particular career endeavour. It is the ability of a student which helps him/her to develop fully the potential of career or employability related ideas and insights as well as the ability to develop action plans with or without the consultation of the faculty members and relevant professionals. It is the confidence of a student which provides him/her inner strength to work independently for his/her career success. The students with self-efficacy generally have a ‘can do’ tendency toward challenge of getting desired employment. Students having high self-efficacy tend to make positive internal attributions about their successes and they tend to attribute setbacks as situational or as a fluke. The students with high self-efficacy have self-reliance to recover from a setback of undesirable results of his/her career endeavours and they tend to respond to negative feedback with increased motivation and additional or better efforts.</p>
<p><bold>Career Counselling:</bold> It refers to providing individuals and groups of career aspirants information related to career opportunities and competencies required for a variety of employment connected with career aspirations of the target group as well as to provide them all kinds of support including resource sharing and moral and emotional support with the aim to enable them realize their full potential for a successful career. It generally emphasizes the use of rational strategies for the purpose of promoting vicarious learning of desired attitudes and behaviours among career aspirants. Career counselling helps the students in understanding their strengths and weaknesses, insights of their attitudes and behaviours, level of a variety of their competencies, competitive strength for employability, etc. Information sharing, resource sharing and a variety of support helps the students in setting their career goals and formulate appropriate career plans which match with the ground realities of the relevant employment market.</p>
<p><bold>Career Planning (CP):</bold> It refers to what must be accomplished to identify a person’s career goals and to attain those goals. Career planning encourages individuals to explore career opportunities and collect career related information which enables them to set career goals and systematically match their career goals and competencies with career opportunities and ground realities of the relevant employment market for the purpose of gaining career success.</p>
<p><bold>Competitive Strength for Employability (CSEMP):</bold> It is the feeling of being empowered, enthusiasm and eagerness of a student towards putting his/her sincere efforts with aim to be more successful than his/her competitors. It is the ability of a student to do more hard and smart work than his/her competitors to explore the career options as well as to increase the chances of his/her being successful in career related endeavours.</p>
<p><bold>Employability:</bold> It refers to a set of competencies of the career aspirants including conceptual, technical, attitudinal, behavioural and ethical knowledge and skills which the potential employers generally look for. Employability is generally understood in terms of those basic skills necessary for getting, keeping and doing well on a job and more so are skills that can be taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0972262912483528">Robinson, 2000</xref>). Viewed thus, Employability is a critical requirement for enabling the students or fresh graduates to gain career success.</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>The research work was completed in four phases. In Phase I, a measure for Career Oriented Attitudes and a measure for Competitive Strength for Employability were developed. In Phase II, reliability and validity of both the measures were tested. In Phase III, a simple framework of Career Oriented Attitudes and Employability was conceptualized. In Phase IV, empirical assessment of Career Oriented Attitudes of the professional graduates of selected Indian engineering and technology institutions were done using such measures and a part of the proposed framework was validated.</p>
<p><bold>Development of the Scales:</bold> The entire process of development of the two measures was divided in seven stages which are as follows: In Stage I, 15 recruitment managers were interviewed in an unstructured way to understand their views on what do they look for in fresh engineering and technology graduates for their employability in terms of their career oriented attitudes and their views were recorded. In Stage II, 50 students from three leading engineering and technology institutes of Madhya Pradesh State of India (one national level institute, one state level Government institute and one state level private sector institute) were interviewed in an unstructured manner to understand their perceived career oriented attitudes and behaviours which might have helped them in getting desired employment in leading software companies through the system of campus recruitment during 2011 and their views were recorded. In Stage III, interviews of successful candidates in UPSC selections for Indian Administrative Services (IAS) published in various newspapers and magazines were analyzed and results of such analysis were recorded. In Stage IV, using ‘EBSCO Data Base’ and ‘Google Search’ earlier research published in various research journals was reviewed. In Stage V, considering the views expressed by the recruitment managers, employed graduates and candidates selected in IAS and keeping in view the results of earlier research on career related issues and the measures used for the same, 60 statements as regards to fresh graduates’ career oriented attitudes and 10 statements regarding their competitive strength for employability were articulated for the purpose of developing four point Likert type Scales. While doing so, Singh’s (1986) ‘Seven Point General Guidelines for Item Writing’ were kept in mind. In Stage VI, further combined analysis of the views expressed by the recruitment managers, employed graduates and candidates selected in IAS was done and based on the outcomes of such analysis, (<italic>a</italic>) 60 statements as regards to fresh graduates’ career oriented attitudes were classified into four categories (sub-scales), viz., career-tasks involvement, career-goal sensitivity, career-purpose social networking and career linked self-efficacy keeping 15 statements under each category (sub-scale); and (<italic>b</italic>) all 10 statements were kept under competitive strength for employability. In Stage VII, five faculty members, three training and placement coordinators and two career counsellors drawn from university teaching departments, training institutions and engineering and technology institutions were requested to participate in discussion on relevance, appropriateness and language of the seventy statements. Based on the outcomes of such discussion, (<italic>a</italic>) out of 60 statements, 24 statements (six from each sub-scale) were dropped and remaining 36 statements (nine in each sub-scale) were retained and thus, construction of Career Oriented Attitudes Scale (COAS) with four Sub-scales viz., Career-tasks Involvement (CTI), Career-goal Sensitivity (CGS), Career-purpose Social Networking (CPSN) and Career Linked Self-Efficacy (CLSE) were finalized; (<italic>b</italic>) out of 10 statements related to competitive strength for employability, four were dropped and thus the construction of six items Competitive Strength for Employability Scale (CSEMPS) was finalized. Such scales items are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0972262912483528">Table 5</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>Sampling Design:</bold> The above mentioned two scales, viz., COAS and CSEMPS were administered to 222 professional graduates of the three selected institutions of Madhya Pradesh State of India [one national level institute (41 respondents), one state level Government institute (37 respondents) and one state level private sector institute (144 respondents)] at the time of their passing out and thus data were collected. Out of 222 graduates, 114 (51 per cent) were males and 108 (49 per cent) were females. Sampling data are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912483528">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>Reliability and Validity of the Scales:</bold> The reliability of Competitive Strength for Employability Scale (CSEMPS) and Career Oriented Attitudes Scale (COAS) as a whole as well as of four Sub-scales viz., Career-tasks Involvement (CTI), Career-goal Sensitivity (CGS), Career-purpose Social Networking (CPSN) and Career Linked Self-Efficacy (CLSE) separately have been tested by the method of obtaining reliability coefficient [Cronbach’s Alpha (α)] using SPSS which are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483528">Table 2</xref>. The full scale reliability coefficient (α = .74) of the Career Oriented Attitudes Scale (COAS) indicates the overall reliability of the measure. Similarly, the full scale reliability coefficient (α = .51) of the Competitive Strength for Employability Scale (CSEMPS) indicates the overall reliability of the measure. Cronbach’s Alpha (α) of sub-scales (taking each sub-scale separately) show that the sub-scales were also found reliable (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483528">Table 2</xref>). The relatively low values of reliability coefficient [Cronbach’s Alpha (α)] which are above 0.5 but less than 0.6 as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483528">Table 2</xref> are acceptable on two grounds: (<italic>a</italic>) reliability coefficient [Cronbach’s Alpha (α)] between 0.5 and 0.6 are considered adequate in the early stages of scale development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0972262912483528">Nunnally, 1978</xref>) and (<italic>b</italic>) similarly low reliability coefficient [Cronbach’s Alpha (α)] have been reported in a number of earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912483528">Bae and Lawler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483528">Sun et al., 2007</xref>) which seem to have followed Nunnally’s observation in developing new scales. The fact which is worth noting is that in the present study, the new scales have been administered to Indian students for the first time.</p>

<p>Using AMOS version 6.0 Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was exercised for determining the construmct validity of the four sub-scales [viz., Career-tasks Involvement (CTI), Career-goal Sensitivity (CGS), Career-purpose Social Networking (CPSN) and Career Linked Self-Efficacy (CLSE)]. The standardized covariance estimates and critical ratios for the same are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0972262912483528">Table 3</xref> which indicates that the relationship among the sub-scales was found to be significant.

<p>Subsequently, structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed using the AMOS version 6.0 to test the COAs and CSEMP parts of the proposed model and the relationship between the four sub-scales and CSEMPS. The standardized regression weights for the relationships and SEM fit indices are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4a-0972262912483528">Tables 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4b-0972262912483528">4B</xref>. RMR, RMSEA, AIC and PNFI values indicate that the resultant model (the part which has been tested) was found fit. However, in view of the GFI value (.774), the tested part of the model was not found fit fully to the sample data as an omnibus cut-off point of 0.90 has been recommended for the GFI. It is to be noted here that there are no golden rules for assessment of model fit, reporting a variety of indices is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483528">Crowley and Fan, 1997</xref>) because different indices reflect a different aspect of model fit. Hu and Bentler (1999) empirically examined various cutoff values for a variety of indices and suggested that to minimize Type I Error and Type II Error under different conditions; one should use a combination of model fit indices. Given the complexity of structural equation modelling, it is not uncommon to find that the fit of a proposed model is not fully appropriate. And therefore, some experts do agree that strictly adhering to recommended cutoff values of various indices may lead to instances of Type I Error (the incorrect rejection of an acceptable model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0972262912483528">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>). In the present study, data were collected from the heterogeneous sample of small population of the students who belong to three different segments of the institution and hence they appear as differing in their competence level. In the authors’ opinion, on conducting yet another study with homogeneous sample of comparatively larger size, GFI value may more likely to touch the cutoff point and hence it is hoped that the proposed model will be found more fit in future research.</p>

<p><bold>Notes:</bold> If the value of r (coefficient of correlation) is more than six times the probable error (r &gt; 6 p.e.) the coefficient of correlation is certain, i.e., the value of r is significant. Instances are quite common where a correlation coefficient of 0.5 or 0.4 is obviously considered to be a fairly high degree of correlation. A correlation coefficient of 0.5 means 25% of the variation and a correlation coefficient of 0.4 means only 16% of variation. In view of these standard interpretations, the researcher considered correlation coefficient of 0.5 or higher as a fairly high degree of correlation and correlation coefficient less than 0.3 as low degree of correlation.</p>

<p>Perceived Career-tasks Involvement, Career-goal Sensitivity and Career Linked Self-Efficacy of professional graduates were found strong and perceived Career-purpose Social Networking was found very strong (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0972262912483528">Table 7</xref>). On making comparison between Career Attitudes of male and female graduates by applying t-test, all the attitudes except Career-tasks Involvement were perceived at same level between both the groups (males and females) without any significant variation (at 0.05 level of significance). Career-tasks Involvement of the professional graduates was found with significant variation (at 0.05 level of significance) among male and female graduates; it was found slightly stronger in case of male graduates (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0972262912483528">Table 8</xref>). On making comparison between Career Oriented Attitudes of professional graduates of various segments (viz., National level institute, Government institute and Private sector institute), all the study attitudes were found without any significant variation (at 0.05 level of significance) between the three segments. It means that the perceived career attitudes of the professional graduates are independent of the segment of the institute (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0972262912483528">Table 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Implication</title>
<p>Career oriented attitudes (COAs) and competitive strength for employability (CSEMP) are among the significant determinants of self-management of students including their career and employability management and competencies development management. Employers benefit by providing employment to the graduates who are well equipped with COAs and have CSEMP. It is an established fact that the more competent and effective individuals are in the workplace, more improved the organizational effectiveness can be. Individuals use organizational learning to augment their own personal competence which can be used in or outside their current employers’ organization; on the other hand organizations use competencies of their individual employees to learn further and to build knowledge repositories. Cheong and Tsui’s (2010) study shows that values of personal knowledge management (PKM) for individuals are correlated with the values of PKM for organization. In the light of all these observations, it may be stated that COAs and CSEMP of the graduates after their employment are more likely to appear contributing to organizational effectiveness. Therefore, the theoretical framework presented in this article and the corresponding measures developed for COAs and CSEMP (key components of the framework) should be seen as significant value addition to the body of knowledge in the organization and management area. Well tested, reliable and valid scales were already available for measuring some elements of the framework such as DOIC, Individual Career Planning, Career Counselling and Employability. For measurement of DOIC, individual career planning strength and employability, a 60 items Institutional Climate Audit Scale (ICAS) comprised of eight sub-scales validated by Chatterjee (2006) and Jain and Chatterjee (2006); a five items Individual Career Planning Instrument—ICPI validated by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0972262912483528">Murat and Metin, 2009</xref>) and a 19 items Employability Skills Measure (ESM) comprised of six dimensions developed by Mishra and Mishra (2011) are available. Intention to Seek Counselling InventoryISCI validated by Cash et al. (1978). Attitude toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help—ATSPPH validated by Fischer and Farina (1995) and Counselor Skills and Personal Development Rating Form developed by Torres-Rivera et al. (2002) are available for the purpose of studying career counselling related aspects. For other two elements of the framework to measure, COAS and CSEMPS have been made available through this article. Future research projects need to be taken up to validate the theoretical framework presented in this article across the variety of settings and cultures using the measures referred above.</p>
<p>In the present study, perceived competitive strength and perceived career oriented attitudes of the students were found by and large strong (not very strong). Such a finding indicates that students need to further strengthen the same. It might be possible that while perceiving their attitudes, a large number of students (respondents) might have kept in their mind only the national scenario and not the diverse career opportunities and various dimensions of competition in the employment market across the world’s economies. Due to which they might have perceived the level of their attitudes toward somewhat higher side. Employment market particularly for technology graduates is increasingly becoming boundary-less in the sense that more occupational, organizational and cultural boundaries are now being crossed over in the matter of career and employment opportunities. In order to gain maximum advantage of such a boundary-less employment market, the Indian graduates need to enhance the level of their career oriented attitudes and other dimensions of inner strength in multiple ways. In this context, Bandura’s (1994) self-efficacy ways may be considered to be part of the development strategy:
<disp-quote>
<p>people’s beliefs in their efficacy are developed by four main sources of influence. They include mastery experience, seeing people similar to oneself, manage task demands successfully, social persuasion that one has the capabilities to succeed in given activities, and inference from somatic and emotional states indicative of personal strengths and vulnerabilities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The present study takes a step forward and sheds some light on the complexity of the issues linked to competitive strength for employability and its determinants. The study shows that career oriented attitudes of the professional graduates have positive impact on their competitive strength for employability and thus such attitudes may mediate their employability. Keeping such a finding in view, it is suggested that students should be made aware of the need for identification, measurement and reinforcement of such attitudes to enable them for taking up appropriate career paths and sound career decisions. In this context some planned efforts should be done by the higher education institutions preferably in collaboration with some potential employers. Earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912483528">Miller and Liciardi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0972262912483528">Sturges et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912483528">Ayranci and Oge, 2011</xref>) suggests that career training is extremely valuable in the matter. Some institutions initiated career counselling system. Some institutions have started career education programmes. Some others have started short term training programmes for the benefit of final year students of various professional, vocational and job oriented courses. Some institutions established career counselling cells with employment of well qualified and trained career counsellors or career mentors to support the system. Some institutions established Assessment Centre for the benefit of both students and employees and their organizations. Some kind of these interventions and systems in the matter will certainly help both students and potential employers. The potential employers may use the theoretical framework and the above mentioned scales for assessing the employability of the fresh graduates on one hand and on the other hand, career counsellors in the institutions may also use the same in order to have the concrete base for the required counselling on specific parameters.</p>
