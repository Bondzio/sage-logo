<sec id="section1-0363546513477828">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a routine procedure for patellar instability. The majority of the techniques require hardware fixation or a bony procedure at the patella. However, most of the complications described in the literature can be attributed to patellar fixation. The “superficial quad technique” uses the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon as the graft material, which provides a better anatomic match to the native MPFL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513477828">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The superficial quad technique provides anatomic patellar fixation without a bony procedure and without patellar complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513477828">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513477828">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The study included 32 patients (10 male, 22 female; mean age, 25 years) who underwent MPFL reconstruction using the superficial quad technique and who were followed for a mean duration of 38 months. Objective assessment was performed and Kujala scores were obtained preoperatively and at the time of final follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513477828">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were no patellar complications, including redislocation, in the present study. The mean Kujala score improved to 91.25 (range, 73-100) from a preoperative score of 49.31 (range, 23-62).</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The results were comparable with those of other studies in the literature that used hamstring grafts, but without associated patellar complications.

<p>Studies have proven that the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is ruptured in nearly all the cases after acute patellar dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513477828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477828">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513477828">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513477828">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513477828">43</xref></sup> Medial patellofemoral ligament insufficiency is also present in trochlear dysplasia cases that can lead to patellar instability over the years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513477828">48</xref></sup> Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is an important landmark technique from the classic approach of arthroscopic stabilizing techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513477828">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513477828">37</xref></sup> However, the majority of the graft materials used for MPFL reconstruction do not meet certain basic features of the anatomic MPFL. Hamstring tendon grafts are thick and cord like, and are much stronger than the native MPFL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513477828">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513477828">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref></sup> These grafts necessitate a bony procedure at the patella. A nonanatomic graft fixed with a bony procedure can be a source of a few of the patellar complications; patellar fracture, violation of the anterior cortex or chondral surface of the patella, irritation due to hardware, and gradual stress riser effects are reported problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513477828">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513477828">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513477828">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513477828">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513477828">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513477828">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513477828"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513477828">45</xref></sup> Patellar complications can be attributed to graft fixation and indirectly to the choice of the graft. An improper point of isometry at the femur and failure to keep the optimum length of the graft are other reported important reasons for the development of complications like patellofemoral overload,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref></sup> medial patellofemoral arthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513477828">4</xref></sup> persistent lateral instability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513477828">36</xref></sup> and loss of postoperative movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513477828">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The “superficial quad technique” is the name given to the present technique, which uses the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon as the graft material. The graft is a better anatomic match to the native MPFL and is less strong and stiff than the hamstring tendon graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513477828">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513477828">45</xref></sup> This technique eliminates hardware fixation at the patella and thus patellar complications. Steensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477828">41</xref></sup> used a partial-thickness graft from the quadriceps tendon, and the present technique is a further refinement of their technique.</p>
<p>A total of 32 patients with patellar dislocations who underwent reconstruction with the present technique were studied, with an average follow-up period of 38 months. The hypothesis was that the superficial quad technique would provide anatomic patellar fixation without a bony procedure and would give equally good results as historic results of hamstring tendons but without patellar complications.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The present series included cases of patellar instability that were operated on from October 2006 to June 2011. Detailed clinical, radiological, and magnetic resonance imaging evaluations were carried out in each patient, and predisposing factors such as trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, and abnormal tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove (TTTG) distance were documented. Regional and generalized causes of patellofemoral instability were also examined and documented (see Appendix 1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>). Patients requiring bony correction of the predisposing factors were excluded from the study. There were a total of 39 cases. However, 32 patients (32 knees; 10 male, 22 female) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513477828">Table 1</xref>) and were available at the time of follow-up. The mean age was 25 years (range, 10-48 years; with only 3 patients above the age of 30 years). Twenty-seven knees had recurrent patellar instability due to underlying predisposing bony causes, while 5 had a primary dislocation of the patella that progressed to clinical instability after nonoperative management. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 68 months (mean, 38 months). The Kujala scores were recorded preoperatively, at 1 year, and at 5 years (or at the time of final follow-up, if the follow-up period was less than 5 years). Apart from the Kujala score, objective assessments of the patients were also carried out. The patients were assessed for clinical instability, complications, and need for reoperation.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 1: Arthroscopic Surgery</title>
<p>Arthroscopic examination was performed as the first step before MPFL reconstruction to conduct a detailed assessment and to manage the intra-articular injuries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 2: Graft Harvest From the Superficial Slip of the Quadriceps Tendon</title>
<p>The graft was harvested from the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon. This slip is composed of the anterior lamina of the quadriceps tendon, which is the rectus femoris tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513477828">11</xref></sup> The dissection interval between the anterior and middle laminae of the quadriceps tendon was most readily identified a few centimeters (2-3 cm) proximal to the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477828">41</xref></sup> More distally, where the rectus tendon inserts into the anterior aspect of the patella, the surgical plane was difficult to follow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477828">41</xref></sup> After an interval was identified between the superficial and middle laminae, an approximately 10- to 12-mm-wide superficial slip was dissected proximally for the required length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513477828">Figure 1</xref>). The approximate native MPFL length was measured from the medial border of the patella to the medial epicondyle with the knee in 30° of flexion and the patella located. Another 3 cm was added to this length as some length was lost in rotating the graft, and an extra length of 2 to 2.5 cm was required for intraosseous fixation of the graft at the femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513477828">Figure 2</xref>). The width of the graft was kept as 10 to 12 mm. The proximal edge of the graft was grasped with forceps, and Ethibond No. 2 (Ethicon, Johnson &amp; Johnson Ltd, Aurangabad, India) was used to suture the graft in a whipstitch fashion.</p>

<title>Step 3: Preparing the Graft for Repositioning</title>
<p>The points of attachment of the most superior and the most inferior fibers of the MPFL to the patella were approximately at the superomedial corner of the patella and at the midpoint of the medial margin of the patella, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477828">42</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513477828">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513477828">3B</xref>). Keeping these anatomic considerations in mind, subperiosteal dissection of the distal end of the graft was performed to a point that was at the level of the superomedial corner of the patella, with care taken not to thin or amputate the graft. From this point, the graft was further dissected subperiosteally with a sharp knife in an oblique manner. The oblique dissection was targeted so that the graft was elevated from the patella at its midpoint on the lateral side. This way, an oblique attachment was created on the patella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513477828">Figure 3C</xref>). The graft was then rotated medially so that the deeper part of the graft became the superficial part. Similarly, the lateral border of the graft became the inferior border, and the medial border became the superior border after rotation. The superior and inferior edges of the rotated graft then matched the anatomic points of the native MPFL as per the Steensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477828">42</xref></sup> study.</p>

<sec id="section12-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 4: Creation of the Subvastus Space</title>
<p>As the MPFL is a structure in the second layer on the medial side of the knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513477828">9</xref></sup> a subvastus tunnel was created. It is important to be extremely careful and avoid penetration of the joint. The best way is to carefully dissect the medial retinaculum off the capsule and create a wide space to the medial epicondyle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 5: Graft Delivery</title>
<p>A 2-cm incision was centered at the medial epicondyle of the femur, and dissection was carried out to locate the adductor tubercle and medial epicondyle. An artery forceps was passed from the patellar side through the subvastus space created in step 4. The artery forceps’ point was felt near the epicondylar incision and penetrated out. Another artery forceps was clamped on the tip of the first artery forceps, and the second artery forceps was pulled out at the patellar side. The sutures fixed on the graft were grasped with the second artery forceps, and the graft was pulled out medially through the incision over the medial epicondyle. Thus, graft delivery occurred from the patellar side through the subvastus space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513477828">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513477828">5</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 6: Stay Suture at the Patellar Anatomic Attachment</title>
<p>It was important to put a stay suture on the graft at the medial border of the patella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513477828">Figure 3D</xref>). Using Ethibond No. 2, a single suture apiece was put on the superior and inferior borders of the graft near the native MPFL attachment on the patella. Additional sutures were also put in the central part of the graft. These stay sutures anchored the attachment of the graft at the anatomic position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 7: Identification of the Point of Isometry at the Femur</title>
<p>As the femoral insertion of the MPFL is not as wide as that at the patella, a single site of fixation at the isometric point was identified using the technique described by Farr and Schepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513477828">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0363546513477828">
<title>Step 8: Femoral Fixation</title>
<p>At the isometric point, a Beath pin was passed from the medial side and taken out on the lateral side. The Beath pin was overdrilled for 3.5 cm with a 6-mm reamer. The intraosseous tunnel was made slightly longer than required so that the optimum length of the graft could be achieved by keeping a controlled pull from the lateral side. Sutures on the graft were passed through the eye of the Beath pin and the pin pulled out laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546513477828">Figure 6</xref>). After keeping the optimum length as described in the next step, the graft was fixed using an interference screw (7 × 25–mm titanium interference screw; Hib Surgicals, Mumbai, India) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546513477828">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Step 9: Optimizing the Correct Length of the MPFL Graft</title>
<p>Rather than tensioning, the technique aimed to optimize the correct length of the graft. We concurred with studies that the MPFL is at its maximum length at 30° of flexion and thus should be fixed at this angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513477828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477828">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513477828">14</xref></sup> The length of the graft was optimized at 30° of flexion, and the graft was fixed at the femur while keeping a controlled pull from the lateral side.</p>

<title>Postoperative Protocol</title>
<p>Patients were placed in a full-length fixed brace without a foot piece postoperatively, and weightbearing was allowed from day 1.

<p>All 32 patients were followed until final follow-up. The follow-up period was a mean of 38 months (range, 12-68 months), with 10 patients having less than 2 years of follow-up and 16 being followed up for more than 3 years.</p>
<sec id="section22-0363546513477828">
<title>Objective Knee Examination</title>
<p>None of the patients reported redislocation of the patella at the time of the final follow-up. On examination, it was not possible to subluxate or dislocate the patella in any of the cases. One patient had slight maltracking of the patella on clinical examination, but maltracking did not cause any pain or discomfort to the patient. There were no cases of a patellar complication reported through the final follow-up. Seven patients had difficulty in gaining full flexion that gradually resolved with the help of physical therapy. Three patients had hypertrophic scar formation, but none of the patients required cosmetic intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The superficial quad technique gave very good results with a mean Kujala score of 91.25 (range, 73-100) at the time of final follow-up. The results were compared with those of previous studies that have used hamstring tendons as the graft source, with description of the patellar fixation method, and had used the Kujala score as the end point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513477828">Table 2</xref>). Of 7 such studies, the study by Deie et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513477828">14</xref></sup> did not give preoperative Kujala scores. The mean preoperative scores of the remaining 6 studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513477828">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477828">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513477828">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513477828">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513477828">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546513477828">49</xref></sup> ranged from 41.4 to 70. The mean end-point Kujala score in these studies ranged from 82.6 to 96. Our mean Kujala scores also ranged from a preoperative value of 49.31 to an end-point value of 91.25. On qualitative analysis, these results were found to be comparable. A recent study published by Deie et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477828">13</xref></sup> also had nearly the same number of patients and the same duration of mean follow-up. The study also did not use any patellar hardware and sutured the graft at the patellar anatomic site. A bone plug was used to fix the graft at the point of isometry on the femur. The postoperative mean Kujala score of 91.2 in the present study is comparable with a similar score of 94.5 in the study of Deie et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477828">13</xref></sup> but the mean preoperative score of 49.3 in the present study was much lower than the similar score of 64 in their study. In the study by Deie et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477828">13</xref></sup> a free graft was sutured to the patella. However, in the present study, the graft was not detached from the patella, but additional sutures were inserted. This was a distinct advantage as the strength of patellar fixation should be much higher in the present technique than with sutures alone.</p>

<p>An ideal MPFL graft should have anatomic and biomechanical similarities with those of the native MPFL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref></sup> Patellar fixation should be anatomic and without any bony procedure, so as to minimize complications related to patellar fixation. A broad patellar fixation strip should provide better rotational control of the patella in different ranges of flexions. It should also have an anatomic course in the subvastus space. Femoral fixation should be isometric to avoid abnormal stresses. It is equally important not to tension the graft but keep its length optimum for the same reason.</p>
<sec id="section25-0363546513477828">
<title>Anatomic Considerations</title>
<p>The literature confirms that the MPFL is a thin, broad, sheet-like ligament with a length varying from 45 to 65 mm and width varying from 10 to 32 mm. Smirk and Morris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513477828">40</xref></sup> and Nomura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513477828">30</xref></sup> both found average lengths of 58 mm. Studies by Tuxøe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513477828">47</xref></sup> and Philippot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477828">33</xref></sup> found average lengths of 53 and 57.7 mm, respectively. The study by Tuxøe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513477828">47</xref></sup> showed an MPFL width of 1.9 cm (range, 1.0-3.0 cm). The study by Philippot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477828">33</xref></sup> showed that the width at the patellar insertion was 24.4 ± 4.8 mm (range, 17-32 mm) and at the femoral insertion was 12.2 ± 2.6 mm (range, 8-16 mm). Almost all studies confirmed that it is a thin ligament. Average lengths of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were 235 to 280 mm and 200 to 251 mm, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513477828">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546513477828">51</xref></sup> Thus, average lengths of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons are much longer than required, and these are cord-like grafts. According to Andrikoula et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513477828">3</xref></sup> the mean length of a superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon was 68 mm (range, 50-85 mm) with the knee flexed and distance measured from the superior border of the patella to the myoaponeurotic junction of the rectus femoris. The average width was 41 mm at the superior aspect of the patella and 22 mm at the middle of the tendon. Hence, the mean length and width of the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon used in the present technique were more appropriate anatomic matches. In addition, the slip was also a thin structure.</p>
<p>Patellar insertion of the MPFL was found to be at the proximal two thirds of the medial margin of the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477828">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513477828">47</xref></sup> Steensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477828">42</xref></sup> noted that the insertion of the MPFL onto the patella in the vertical dimension averaged 38.8% of the total patellar height. The vertical distance from the superior pole of the patella to the superior edge of the MPFL averaged 6.1 mm. This point was approximately at the superomedial corner of the patella. The vertical distance from the superior pole of the patella to the inferior edge of the MPFL averaged 23.1 mm. This point was approximately at the midpoint of the medial margin of the patella.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477828">42</xref></sup> The wide area of attachment at the patella would have better rotational control during flexion and extension movements. Hamstring tendons, being cord-like structures, cannot provide broad continuous fixation on the medial border of the patella. In comparison, the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon provided broad anatomic fixation.</p>
<p>The MPFL is a structure on the second layer of a 3-layered system on the medial side of the knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513477828">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477828">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513477828">47</xref></sup> and hence, the graft should also traverse the subvastus space during MPFL reconstruction. At the femur, the ligament inserted proximal to the insertion of the medial collateral ligament and distal to the insertion of the adductor magnus tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513477828">9</xref></sup> However, the femoral fixation points described in the literature were based on dissection studies and were quite variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513477828">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513477828">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546513477828">50</xref></sup> As there is no final consensus about the exact location of the MPFL insertion at the femur, the point of isometry seems to be the best option at present. Various studies have confirmed that the MPFL provides 50% to 60% of the medial patellar stabilizing force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513477828">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513477828">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513477828">25</xref></sup> According to Bicos et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513477828">6</xref></sup> the MPFL moved the patella into the central trochlea from full extension to 30° of flexion and was then at its maximum tension at 30°. The study further stated that the MPFL relaxed after 30° of flexion, while the trochlea took over to stabilize the patella. Hence, the superficial quad technique fixed grafts in 30° of flexion while applying a controlled pull to achieve the optimum length and tension.</p>

<sec id="section26-0363546513477828">
<title>Biomechanical Considerations</title>
<p>Biomechanical properties of the MPFL have been described in studies by Amis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513477828">2</xref></sup> and Mountney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513477828">28</xref></sup> The mean strength of the MPFL is 208 N with a mean stiffness of 24 N. Hamner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513477828">23</xref></sup> published the tensile properties of hamstring tendons in cadaveric specimens. Single- and double-stranded hamstring tendon grafts were much stronger and stiffer than the native MPFL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513477828">23</xref></sup> (Appendix 2, available online). No studies that measured the strength and stiffness of the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon could be found in the literature. However, Adams et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513477828">1</xref></sup> in their cadaveric study, reported that after removal of the central part of the quadriceps tendon, the strength of the remaining intact quadriceps tendon reduced by 34%. This would leave the strength of the harvested full-thickness graft (7 mm thick and 10 mm broad graft) as mean 1244 N. The superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon is also 10 mm wide but is a thin sheet. Hence, the strength of the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon should be much less than 1244 N.</p>
<p>The strengths in various fixation methods of MPFL reconstruction have also been studied by Mountney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513477828">28</xref></sup> While the strength of the sutures alone was on average 37 N, that of the bone anchors combined with sutures was 142 N. Both were remarkably less than the strength of the MPFL itself, which was on average 208 N. When using a blind tunnel tendon graft, it was 126 N, and with a through tunnel graft, it was a mean 195 N. Hence, it was evident from the study of Mountney et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513477828">28</xref></sup> that the strengths in various fixation methods of MPFL reconstruction were remarkably less than the strength of the MPFL itself (208 N). Therefore, a graft that is fixed at the patella using any means is more likely to fail at the patellar fixation point, rather than the midsubstance, even if its strength and stiffness are similar to the native MPFL. On the other hand, a graft material that is stronger and stiffer than the original MPFL will put more loads on the patella when subjected to severe stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513477828">44</xref></sup> The loads will be much higher in the presence of other anatomic abnormalities like trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal TTTG distance, among others. To avoid such overload and overstress at the patella, the stiffness and strength of an ideal graft should be as close as possible to those of the native MPFL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477828">16</xref></sup> Although there are no studies at present to confirm the strength and stiffness of the superficial slip, they should be much less than the hamstrings and nearer to the MPFL.</p>

<sec id="section27-0363546513477828">
<title>Patellar Complications Due to Bony Fixation of the Graft</title>
<p>Analysis of various studies revealed that a majority of the complications reported in the literature can be attributed to patellar fixation of the graft (Appendix 3, available online). As hamstring tendons were used as the graft material, patellar fixation was required in all these studies. Patellar fracture was the most devastating complication reported after MPFL reconstruction with a hamstring graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513477828">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513477828">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513477828">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513477828">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513477828">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513477828">45</xref></sup> According to one study, up to a 90% reduction in the strength of the bone can occur depending on the geometry and size of the bony defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513477828">10</xref></sup> Thus, a weak medial patellar ridge has a potential for late patellar fractures. As discussed previously, a stronger and stiffer graft puts more load on the patellofemoral joint as opposed to the native MPFL. The extra load put on the graft-patella junction by a stronger graft will have further deteriorating effects on a weak medial patellar ridge. This continuous load over a period of time can also cause stress riser effects and can lead to late patellar fractures after many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513477828">44</xref></sup> Other reported complications like violation of the chondral surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513477828">18</xref></sup> can result in poor postoperative results and the early onset of patellofemoral arthritis. Fixation devices such as anchors or buttons can lead to foreign body reactions or other hardware-related intraoperative or postoperative problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513477828">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513477828">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513477828">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513477828">43</xref></sup> The superficial quad technique eliminates bony fixation at the patella and thus indirectly eliminates complications associated with patellar fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0363546513477828">
<title>Superficial Slip of the Quadriceps Tendon as a Graft Choice</title>
<p>The superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon is purely aponeurotic and matches the anatomic profile of the MPFL as far as the width, breadth, and length are concerned. Furthermore, embryologically, the MPFL and quadriceps tendon are from the ventral mesenchyme, as opposed to hamstring tendons that belong to the dorsal mesenchyme. This method also ensured anatomic fixation of the graft at the medial border of the patella. Further, because of better fixation at both ends, it allowed an early range of motion postoperatively. The hamstrings were spared, which could be used for future major reconstructions of the knee, if the need arises.</p>
<p>There were 2 methods in the literature that used the quadriceps tendon as a graft and kept its patellar attachment intact. While Noyes and Albright<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513477828">32</xref></sup> used a full-thickness quadriceps tendon autograft, Steensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477828">41</xref></sup> used a partial-thickness graft from the quadriceps tendon. The graft used in their study was approximately 10 to 12 mm in width and typically involved the central one third of the tendon. However, their technique did not meet certain important criteria. The location of attachment of the graft at the patella was kept at the anterior midpatellar area instead of the medial border of the patella. This could lead to severely abnormal biomechanics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513477828">32</xref></sup> because forces will work on the anterior surface rather than the medial border. This could also cause poor rotational control during flexion-extension movements. Steensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477828">41</xref></sup> passed the graft from a subcutaneous tunnel that was a nonanatomic path. They sutured the graft at the point of isometry; however, intraosseous aperture fixation is found to be more secure and accurate. As described previously, the pull-out strength of the sutures alone was a mean 37 N, compared with a mean strength of 195 N in through tunnel graft fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513477828">28</xref></sup> They tensioned the graft in midflexion. The present technique was modified substantially to overcome these deficiencies. Detailed dissection steps on the anterior surface of the patella were established that provided anatomic fixation at the medial border without the use of any hardware. The graft passed through the anatomic subvastus space. Femoral fixation was isometric but with an intraosseous aperture. In the modified technique, the graft was not tensioned, but a controlled pull was kept on the graft while fixing it at the femur to achieve an optimum length of the graft.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge certain limitations of the present study. Strength and stiffness values of the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon were not assessed. Further study comparing biomechanical properties of various grafts of MPFL reconstruction will help on the subject. Many new studies have been published during the past few years describing better fixation points at the femur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513477828">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513477828">38</xref></sup> Because the present study investigated cases that underwent surgery before these new methods, the role of these fixation points could not be ascertained. Symptomatic, hypertrophic scarring that formed in 3 patients was not an ideal situation. Use of a small incision for the graft harvest can be an added advantage. Work is in progress for the development of a technique that can harvest the superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon with a smaller incision. The current study only documents the short-term results of this procedure and did not include radiographic follow-up.</p>

<p>The superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon allows anatomic fixation of the graft at the patella without a bony procedure and helps avoid complications associated with bony fixation at the patella. The present study confirmed the hypothesis that the superficial quad technique would provide anatomic patellar fixation without a bony procedure and without patellar complications. The technique produced equally good short-term results as compared with hamstring tendons.</p>
