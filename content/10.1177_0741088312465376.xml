<abstract>
<p>Common topics are words or phrases used to develop argument, and commonplaces aid memory or catalyze frames of understanding. When used in argumentation, each may help interested parties more effectively communicate valuable scientific and environment-related information. This article describes 12 modern topics of environmental rhetoric, identified from 125 interviews, and discusses them in relation to their topical fluidity and managerial, generative, and encapsulated utility: “Al Gore,” “balance,” “common sense,” “environment as setting,” “experience,” “extremism,” “man’s achievements,” “pragmatism,” “proof,” “religion,” “recycling,” and “seeing is believing.” Findings suggest that “environment” is a complex topic with many potential implications—using topics common to environmental rhetoric to shape argumentation may facilitate more productive environment-related communication.</p>

<body>
<p>Rhetors use common topics to develop effective arguments, and they use commonplaces to actuate an audience’s existing understanding of a situation to lend credence to complex ideas. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312465376">Campbell (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0741088312465376">Pantin (1951)</xref>, for example, note that Darwin’s audience for <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic> would have been familiar with concepts such as “species,” which Darwin appears to have used as both topic and commonplace. More recently, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741088312465376">Frank Luntz’s (2002)</xref> now (in)famous memo to GOP lawmakers on the framing of climate change suggests, using commonplaces such as “global warming” or “climate change” to frame environment-related arguments has the potential to dramatically alter stakeholder response.</p>
<p>As these brief examples suggest, common topics and commonplaces may be effectively used in science-related argumentation to allow audiences culturally relevant access to potentially complicated ideas. Despite this effectiveness, the nature of topical argumentation is ambiguous at best.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741088312465376">1</xref></sup> Aristotle never clearly defines the common topic, or <italic>topos</italic>, as noted by Kennedy in his translation of Aristotle’s <italic>On Rhetoric</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312465376">2007</xref>, p. 45), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741088312465376">McKeon (1973)</xref> tells us that the topics and commonplaces were just as ambiguous in Greek as in English (p. 199). Generally, however, a common topic is used to develop argument, and a commonplace brings an audience to a place of shared understanding through “applicable in common” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312465376">Aristotle, 2007</xref>, § 1.2.21) elements.</p>
<p>Complex, science-based information has to be shaped for multiple stakeholder audiences in topics from climate change to pollution, from oil spills to nuclear energy. Studies and collections examining social representations of scientists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088312465376">Christidou, Dimopoulos, &amp; Koulaidis, 2004</xref>), perceived knowledge deficits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312465376">Bensaude-Vincent, 2001</xref>), visual representations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088312465376">Dobrin &amp; Morey, 2009</xref>), and transmission of scientific information both within the sciences and from the sciences to nonscientist publics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088312465376">Calsamiglia &amp; Ferrero, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088312465376">Charney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312465376">Ciapuscio, 2003</xref>) suggest that representation of information plays a significant role in crafting scientific/environmental arguments. Because of topical argumentation’s utility in shaping rhetoric and bringing audiences to a place of shared understanding, common topics and commonplaces may serve vital roles in the presentation or design of environment-related information for differing stakeholder audiences.</p>
<p>My purpose in this article is to identify modern environment-related topics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741088312465376">2</xref></sup> which appear to be culturally viable rhetorical tools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741088312465376">3</xref></sup> These topics emerged as a result of my dissertation research, where I coded data derived from 125 interviews to answer the research question “What are commonplaces of environmental rhetoric?” I identify these topics from their appearance in arguments made to me about environment-related concerns as respondents attempted to bring me to a place of shared understanding,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741088312465376">4</xref></sup> and I argue that the topics I discovered appear to function as both common topics of environmental rhetoric and commonplaces. I describe these 12 multipurpose, or “fluid,” topics in relation to their generative, managerial, and encapsulated natures, language borrowed from both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088312465376">Carolyn Miller (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Michael Leff (1996)</xref>, though set to different purpose.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that the seemingly innocuous word “environment” carries multiple complex meanings dependent largely on audience interpretation and understanding, suggesting that rhetors should carefully choose their phrasing when attempting to motivate an audience to action in relation to environment-related communication. The 12 commonplaces I identify may offer culturally viable approaches to strategically shaping environment-related communication to motivate decision making, and they are defined and explained on the basis of respondents’ use.</p>

<title>Common Topics, Commonplaces, and Their Roles in Environmental Rhetoric</title>
<p>Numerous studies are dedicated to an examination of the mediation of environment-related information,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741088312465376">5</xref></sup> yet debate still exists on how best to communicate environment-related information to diverse audiences. Topics and commonplaces may provide a piece to this important puzzle because of their value for both rhetor and audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741088312465376">6</xref></sup> The potential multitudinous roles of each topic discovered in this project suggests generic applicability strongly reminiscent of Aristotle’s “common topics” but applicable only—in the framework of this article—in relation to environmental rhetoric. Since the 12 topics I discuss apply generically to environmental rhetoric and contain many potential permutations and possibilities for application, I define these topics as “common topics of environmental rhetoric,” not “common topics” in general. They appear to be neither fully fledged, entirely generic common topics applicable in any argument field nor purely special topics used for forensic, epideictic, or deliberative argumentation; rather, they appear to be practical common topics specific to an exceptionally broad area of discourse. In addition, the topics I identify in this article seem capable of functioning as commonplaces.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088312465376">C. R. Miller (2000)</xref> discusses, Aristotle wrestled with the topic’s concrete-versus-concept nature. She notes that we could possibly reconcile this disjunct through consideration of the <italic>topos</italic> as Toulmanian warrants (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088312465376">Bird, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741088312465376">Conley, 1978</xref>), but doing so shuts out our consideration of topics as concepts or propositions. The Latin approach struggles to reconcile the conceptual/propositional nature of topical argumentation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff’s (1996)</xref> consideration of the Ciceronion approach, for example, sees the <italic>loci</italic> (topics) as resources for the discovery of elements of argumentation, with the <italic>loci communes</italic> (commonplaces) acting as single structures that integrate logic, emotion, and style. This view offers a practical approach that may close a few doors for theoreticians but may also allow practitioners greater access to these potentially valuable tools. My own approach derives from an examination of both the theoretical value of the Aristotelian and the practical nature of the Ciceronian, as filtered through both Miller and Leff (among others).</p>
<p>The topics I discovered appear to function as both common topics of environmental rhetoric and commonplaces, and they appear to be situated hierarchically in a fluid position between <italic>topoi</italic> and <italic>konoi topoi</italic>, between <italic>loci</italic> and <italic>loci communis</italic>—that is, they appear operational as both generic, inventional topics and context-sensitive, argumentative heuristics. My argument for considering these structures as embracing multiple complex dimensions, what we might call “fluid topics,” is as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0741088312465376" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Classical Aristotelian rhetoric holds common topics as general, universal lines of reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff, 1996</xref>, p. 446), which are supposed to be applicable in any given situation. They are common to all bodies of knowledge, not one particular subject (Aristotle, 1997, p. 45). In the Latin tradition, the topics (<italic>loci</italic>) are resources for argumentative discovery, with potential for use in argumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff, 1996</xref>, p. 447). In both cases, the common topic is an inventional, generative tool used as a way to discover/invent argument.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In classical rhetoric, special topics are species of topic unique to topic and intent (i.e., judicial, deliberative, and ceremonial). These are, essentially, recurrent lines of argument within particular exigencies. In Latin rhetoric, the commonplaces take this role, to some extent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff (1996)</xref> notes, Quintilian opposed their use as set pieces but considered the <italic>loci communes</italic> effective as models (p. 450). The Latin commonplaces, like the classical special topics, can be seen as efforts to combine rhetorical structures with heuristic memory (p. 450).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both common topics and special topics are used to shape speeches and communicative acts. A communicative act, to pull from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312465376">Aristotle (2007</xref>, p. 47), consists of a speaker, a subject, and an objective that relates to a particular audience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Each special topic has its own time and audience (i.e., judge, jury, peers) in the communicative act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312465376">Aristotle, 2007</xref>, p. 48), which suggests a practical, context-driven approach to argumentation. The Latin commonplace also takes this practical, context-driven form; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff (1996</xref>, p. 451) notes, they offer models for viable argumentation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The topics I present here are “common” (from a classical perspective), in that they cross judicial, deliberative, and ceremonial boundaries and, from a Latin perspective, each can be used in the discovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Leff, 1996</xref>, p. 448). Generally, the classical common topics are definition, division, comparison, relationship, circumstances, testimony, and notation and conjugates (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312465376">Burton, 2012</xref>)—general categories that indicate a particular way of thinking or speaking about a subject. The topics I identify and discuss in this article (“Al Gore,” for which we might substitute “famous persons,” “balance,” “common sense,” “environment as setting,” “experience,” “extremism,” “man’s achievements,” “pragmatism,” “proof,” “religion,” “recycling,” and “seeing is believing”) may be used similarly and, I argue, with the same level of generality, when functioning as common topics of environmental rhetoric. From point 1, while they are concerned with an underlying subject, that subject is enormous. These topics could individually serve as the inventional starting place, or fulcrum, for an entire communicative act (in 2008, for example, CNN published an article titled “Yellowstone Seeks to Balance Nature, Cell Phones”), which makes them universal lines of reasoning in relation to environmental rhetoric.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Each topic identified in this article also could be applied in different ways to a single scenario based on timing, audience, and intent (the practical, context-driven exigency for the classical special topics or the Latin commonplace). In the classical model, for example, we could discuss the rightness of recycling or the wrongness of not recycling (judicial), the advantages of recycling (deliberative), or the virtues of recycling or those who recycle (epideictic/ceremonial). From the Latin perspective, each topic is specific enough to serve as the memetic heuristic needed for an argumentative set piece that may be injected into argument. In discussion, a rhetor might, for example, invoke Al Gore’s name and, by virtue of the context (and tone, body language, facial expression, even font) effectively encapsulate an entire argument in relation to the need to conserve energy or change light bulbs (for an extended argument on the nature of two commonplaces, “balance” and “common sense,” see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0741088312465376">Ross, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fluid topics that I describe in this article are thus identifiable as both “common topics of environmental rhetoric” and “commonplaces.” In practice, each description refers to a different intended use (inventing an argument vs. injecting into an argument). Their multipurpose, fluid nature, however, allows description of each under the tripartite structure of <italic>generative, managerial</italic>, and <italic>encapsulated</italic>, language borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088312465376">Carolyn Miller (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Michael Leff (1996)</xref>, though set to different purpose. I define this tripartite topical structure of the fluid topic as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0741088312465376" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Generative</italic>: The topic identified may be used to literally generate an argument. For example, an argument generated from “man’s achievements” might focus on environmental regulations, structures, or failures/successes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Managerial</italic>: The topic identified may be used to restructure, direct, or influence existing arguments. For example, a debate on climate change might be managed through the topic of “balance.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Encapsulated</italic>: Each topic can function as a commonplace through its injection into an existing debate. The function here is neither to generate new argument nor fully manage existing argument but instead bring an audience to a place of understanding through shared awareness of a situation/topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741088312465376">7</xref></sup> For example, in relation to the impacts of mountaintop mining, a rhetor might simply say, “We have proof that toxic chemicals are released into the environment,” thereby encapsulating an entire argument of scientific legitimacy/“proof” without needing—at that time and place—to actually provide legitimate facts and figures.</p></list-item>
</list></list-item></list>
<p>When a rhetor enters into topical argumentation or invokes a commonplace, she or he gives the audience an encapsulated decision-making framework, which it may use as a heuristic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0741088312465376">8</xref></sup> Topics shape an audience’s perceptions and influence decision making because of the way they catalyze frames of understanding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088312465376">Lakoff (2010)</xref>, for example, describes frames as “unconscious structures” that “include semantic roles, relations between roles, and relations to other frames” (p. 71). They are ideological systems that are unconsciously created and reified through social, political, and cultural interaction. When certain words or phrases activate a frame, a system of associations begins that allows complex concepts to be rapidly processed against previously established knowledge.</p>
<p>Framing allows a rhetor to highlight or obfuscate conceptual elements to influence response<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0741088312465376">9</xref></sup> through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312465376">Entman (1993)</xref> describes as “selection” and “salience” (p. 52). Thus, for the purposes of this project, when I refer to a “frame” or “frame of understanding,” I refer to an unconscious structure that a rhetor may deliberately activate (catalyze) through use of topics or commonplaces to highlight or obfuscate specific concepts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312465376">Dombrowski (2000)</xref> notes, rhetoric associated with environmental communication often results from assumptions situated between “competing value systems” (p. 4). Thus, the choice of framing an argument with either “global warming” or “climate change” is important because each activates a different frame and emphasizes different elements, leading to different emotional processes and decision-making strategies.</p>
<p>Topics have shelf lives, though the more general the topic, the less likely it is to fall out of use. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741088312465376">Killingsworth (2005)</xref> shows, for example, commonplaces—which are more situation specific than general topics—resonate with an audience at a particular place and time and can be common for only as long as society colonizes a place. Thus, commonplaces can fall out of fashion. For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312465376">Beloit College’s 2010</xref> “Mindset List,” students “have never heard an attendant ask, ‘want me to check under the hood?’” This suggests that rhetoric like Ross Perot’s 1992 campaign commonplace of fixing what’s under the hood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0741088312465376">Tonn &amp; Endress, 2001</xref>) becomes less and less viable as cultural shifts mediate language usage.</p>
<p>One way to discover timely, culturally sensitive topics and commonplaces would be to analyze environment-related texts using methods similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741088312465376">Fahnestock and Secor’s (1988)</xref> examination of <italic>topoi</italic> in literary criticism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741088312465376">C. R. Miller and Selzer’s (1985)</xref> examination of engineering discourse, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741088312465376">Prelli’s (1989)</xref> categorization of scientific <italic>topoi</italic>. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0741088312465376">Walsh’s (2010)</xref> examination of STEM discourse<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0741088312465376">10</xref></sup> using Aristotle’s description of <italic>konoi topoi</italic>, as filtered through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741088312465376">Prelli’s (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741088312465376">Perlman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s (1969)</xref> interpretations, extends these text-based approaches. Such approaches are valuable but can yield only topics and commonplaces employed by a writer, media, or institution (i.e., what a writer thinks should work), not the elements necessarily cognitively processed and employed by a decision-making public. For this study, common topics and commonplaces of environmental rhetoric are, in effect, reverse engineered from the elements of debate that resonate most strongly (and thus are offered in response to research probes) with touring members of the American public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0741088312465376">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The common topics and commonplaces that I examine derive from the transcription and coding of 125 interviews with American citizens collected at the Carl Hayden Visitor Center at the Glen Canyon Dam in May 2007. Each interview was conducted according to an interview protocol (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088312465376">appendix</xref>) designed to answer the research question “What are commonplaces of environmental rhetoric?” The interview protocol was designed to be as general as possible to attempt to avoid activating any one particular cognitive frame<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0741088312465376">12</xref></sup> and to force respondents to articulate answers from within their own frames of understanding. Per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312465376">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref>, I conducted my interviews until I reached “theoretical saturation” (p. 61), the point at which I was not hearing unique responses as a result of my interview questions.</p>
<p>The Glen Canyon area was selected because dams represent concrete human-nature intersections that can be studied both as places of environmental impact in and of themselves and as human-nature interaction access points. Because of the physical environment and storied history of the dam (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0741088312465376">Ross, 2008b</xref>, and my discussion in the Implications section of this article), research questions could be tailored to look for commonplaces and arguments without as much need to offer potentially biasing explanations.</p>

<sec id="section3-0741088312465376">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>I applied grounded theory to the data to develop categories and descriptions of recurrent thematic structures in respondents’ discourse. Grounded theory allows a highly granular approach in which found categorical associations inform secondary assumptions, which then allows for revisitation of idea and structure, necessitating constant rethinking and reproblematizing of data until categories and understandings finally gel. This approach appeared valuable in relation to understanding and unpacking American tourists’ responses to questions designed to elicit underlying assumptions about the environment and environmental debate.</p>
<p>Grounded theory is a method of comparative analysis that leads to the systematized discovery of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312465376">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). The method calls for a lack of preconceptions—that is, evidence from empirical findings leads to generation of categories and hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741088312465376">Lewis &amp; Whitely, 1992</xref>). To do this, a systematic process is followed. As articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088312465376">Creswell (2003)</xref>, the systematic steps of grounded theory involve <italic>open coding</italic>, the generation of categories from data; <italic>axial coding</italic>, the theoretical positioning of categories; and <italic>selective coding</italic>, connection of categories to form a narrative (p. 191). I note that, following the precepts of grounded theory, I explicitly did not search for structures representative of common topics previously identified by Aristotle, Cicero, or modern researchers, in responses.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for previously identified <italic>topoi</italic>, I coded data by importing each transcript into NVivo 8 and examining each question individually. In the open coding process, I read each transcript closely and identified items of interest related to the question associated with each response. This was the “what is happening here?” aspect of coding. Once I had identified what I took to be the interesting, unique, and important aspects of respondents’ answers, I moved to axial coding. In axial coding, I read and reread the elements previously identified during open coding, looked for relationships, and sorted each open-coded piece into descriptive categories. So, for example, if I have three people responding to the question “If I say the word ‘environmental,’ what is the first thing that comes to mind?” I am likely to have three different responses. Person A might say “skiing”; Person B might respond “treehuggers”; and Person C might state, “The government needs to do something about it.” In coding these, I would first pull out these responses as categories in and of themselves: Categories A, B, and C. If another respondent responds to the question by saying “hiking,” however, I now have two items that appear to be alike, so I group them. We now have Category A, which contains responses including “skiing” and “hiking.” Add another person who says “kayaking,” and I have a third addition to the category. As responses continue to accumulate, I can look at these and see that they are similar: They all describe activities, suggesting that these respondents associate “environment” with “outdoor activity.” This “activity” then becomes my category into which other responses may then be coded.</p>
<p>In the selective coding part of the process, I sorted the categories developed through open and axial coding into narratives. The first two processes generated 10 categories of response (1 for each question) and 275 total categories and subcategories within these 10 categories. I selected categories that either contained large numbers of responses (generally over 10 responses per category) or were thematically recurrent across multiple questions. I looked for similarities and matching categories from question to question and combined my results in relation to their similarities. To keep this project manageable, I then further culled my resulting categories, removing any categories with fewer than 20 sources (interviews generating response). This final selective coding process left 12 categories, which I describe here as topics and commonplaces of environmental rhetoric.</p>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312465376">Cantrill (1996)</xref> in his summary of perceptions of environmental advocacy, people turn to broad but identifiable categories of human activity when asked to report on topics of environmental discourse. My findings support this argument, as analysis of the corpus yielded 12 overarching categories, each of which is a meaningful, composite portrait of respondents’ thoughts. While each served as a category during coding, reflection and analysis suggest use as a common topic or commonplace when put to use. The categories after the extended coding process are identifiable as topics/commonplaces of environmental rhetoric because they are amalgamated perceptions of environment and environmental debate generated by condensing repeated, similar thematic elements from 125 interviews—many with more than one individual, all conducted on the same theme. So, for example, to go back to my highly abbreviated example, if the “activity” category made it through the selective coding process—perhaps because numerous respondents mentioned outdoor activity in some shape or form during other parts of the interview—I would have a category filled with similar responses (skiing, hiking, kayaking, snowboarding, camping, fishing, etc.) from many respondents. It becomes a functional topic/commonplace because, when invoked by a rhetor, it brings an audience to a place of shared understanding or can be used to generate/manage argument. Thus, while I cannot be sure that the skier kayaks or the hiker skis, I do know that the generalized topic of “outdoor activity” should suggest “skiing” to the skier or “hiking” to the hiker. The general category that holds various individually realized meanings works as a common topic from which argument may be developed (with clarification, examples, etc.) or as a commonplace, which, given context, stands in for all activities under its purview when we stop using it as a container and start using it as a rhetorical tool.</p>
<p>Given the dissertation aspect of this study, I was the only coder on this project, though the selection and coding process progressed with extensive feedback from members of my dissertation committee, particularly my chair. While every effort was made to be objective and impartial in moving through the stages of grounded theory, future iterations of this study should utilize either multiple researchers or comparison to previously conducted studies using these methods.</p>

<title>Findings: Snapshot of a Decision-Making Public</title>
<p>These results are derived from coding 125 interviews, which yielded 577 unique coded references.

<p>When respondents were asked to articulate their stance on environmental issues (Question 4, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088312465376">appendix</xref>), their answers indicated association with ambivalence/conflict, politics, blame, concern about specific issues, importance, finance, the future, pragmatism, and stewardship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0741088312465376">Figure 5</xref>). I describe these categories, which emerged from the coding process, as follows: The “ambivalent-conflicted” group contains responses that indicated uncertainty, such as “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure.” “Associated with politics” means that respondents defined their environmental stance through political associations, such as references to liberalism or a need for government mediation. “Blaming” responses held humans as responsible for ruining the earth, as in the rather pithy “We shit all over this planet every day.” The “concerned about specific issues” group contains answers specifically related to issues such as fossil fuels, global warming, litter, pollution, and so on, and the “environmentalism is important” group contains answers where the respondent indicated that something—often something ambiguous—needs to be done. “Financially oriented” responses were those that indicated the primacy of money, and “future oriented” responses were those suggesting that we need to keep future generations in mind. “Pragmatic” responses were those that indicated that any environmentalism needed to be considered against human lifestyles, and “stewarding” responses placed humankind in charge of the maintenance of the earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0741088312465376">14</xref></sup></p>

<p>These results suggest that respondents were not caught completely off guard by my environment-related questions—most were able to articulate a defined stance on environmental issues, and more of my respondents were positively predisposed toward environmentalism than not. Perhaps more important, responses to the question on environmental stance suggest that environmental communicators have a lot of work to do if they wish to move perceptions of environmentalism away from politics, ambivalence, or blame and into the realm of personal importance, stewardship, or an eye toward the future.</p>

<title>Results: Twelve Commonplaces of Environmental Rhetoric</title>
<p>The 12 topics identified in this article are “Al Gore,” “balance,” “common sense,” “environment as setting,” “experience,” “extremism,” “man’s achievements,” “pragmatism,” “proof,” “recycling,” “religion,” and “seeing is believing.” For consistency and reference sake, I present these alphabetically.

<sec id="section6-0741088312465376">
<title>Al Gore</title>
<p>References to Gore and his work appeared in 23 interviews (18%), with a total of 66 references, and were readily separated into four primary categories: general references to <italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic>, positive references, negative references, and ambivalent references. One 48-year-old male from Nevada told me, “I loved Al Gore’s nature.” This phrasing suggests Gore as in possession of a particular way of thinking in relation to the environment, and it encapsulates an emotionally tinged argument of ownership. References to Gore often appeared to be judgmental—for example, a 54-year-old female’s note that “He, he’s mentally ill! He’s not a scientist, he’s latched onto an emotional issue, and he’s gone ballistic with it.” A 54-year-old male from Washington told me, “I just heard a comedian comment recently on the radio, he says there’s not enough global warming to melt Al Gore’s ice cream, which I tend to agree with.” In the first statement, Gore serves as a common topic that manages argument. In the second, Gore generates argument. In the “ice cream case,” Al Gore is used as a commonplace to tell a story of hypervigilant environmental extremism by encapsulating the argument that global warming is a farce and certain people or groups are overreacting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741088312465376">
<title>Balance</title>
<p>Balance, in one form or another, was referred to in 38 interviews (30.4%), with 86 individual references. Discussions of “sidedness,” “pros and cons,” “sides of a coin,” and comparisons asking for equal and opposite information as a necessary part of the decision-making process fit into this topic. In its topical, generative role, balance offers a starting place for argument similar to that of cost-benefit analysis. In terms of management, balance mediates argument by suggesting moderating/different opinions. As encapsulated commonplace, balance suggests tempering emotion for logical comparison of arguments.</p>
<p>A 37-year-old man from California told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>I certainly enjoy National Parks and treasure the nature that America was blessed with. At the same time, I realize that we all have a standard of living that we tend to enjoy, and if you wisely make choices you oftentimes can have both.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This phrasing uses balance as a topic to generate an argument that places potentially competing ideologies (nature vs. standards of living) in commensurate positions.</p>
<p>A 54-year-old man from California told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of these environmentalists are kind of off the reservation. I mean, they’re to the point where if they had it their way we’d still be living in caves, we’d be in the Stone Age. . . . You’ve got to have a delicate balance. You can’t go from one extreme. I, you know, you’ve got to be realistic, and all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His argument uses balance topically to manage ongoing argument by suggesting a moderate course of environment-related action and, as a commonplace, to encapsulate an entire ideology of comparative decision making. Similarly, a man in his 50s from Washington, DC, told me that he is “obviously in favor of, you know, having a clean environment, recognizing the practicalities of modern life, that we’re not going to just walk everywhere, and give up automobiles, airplanes, everything else.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0741088312465376">
<title>Common Sense</title>
<p>In varying iterations, common sense was referred to in 21 interviews (16.8%), with a total of 35 individual references, and it topically generates and manages argument through an ideology of rational, shared worldviews. The topic includes responses suggesting that decision making could be based on “sense,” “rationality,” obvious logical choices, and so on. As a commonplace, it encapsulates an entire narrative of us versus them, camaraderie, and, often, amazement that someone would take an alternative, nonsensical approach. The worldviews that this topic invokes, however, may be dated or based on personally held beliefs. For example, in the following interplay, between a 55-year-old woman and a 55-year-old man, both from Arizona, common sense is used first to generate, then to manage, an entire argument based on personally held values. As the argument progresses, however, common sense is used as a commonplace in a one-line interjection (the second time the woman speaks) to convey an entire narrative of disbelief that a person might have “uncommon” values:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>FEMALE:</speaker>
<p>Common sense things I think of, when he was a younger man he was a scoutmaster, uh, in Utah, he came out, he was driving up the canyon to get his scout camp at [the] lake, and a deer ran out and hit the side of the van, and killed the deer instantly. The meat was fine. The deer was dead, so he throws it in the van and takes it up there with him to dress it out, that could be their week’s meal! A week. And they wouldn’t let him—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MALE:</speaker>
<p>The game warden—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>FEMALE:</speaker>
<p>Common sense—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MALE:</speaker>
<p>The Game Warden told me that technically he could arrest me for slitting, you know the deer was, its throat, and dressed it out, and he says, “Because you’re a scoutmaster and because you did it with innocent intent, he says, well, I, to avoid having to arrest you, I admonish you to take the deer back and bury it where you got it.” Where’s the logic in that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>FEMALE:</speaker>
<p>You see, it just doesn’t seem logical. Common sense. Something’s happening to us—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MALE:</speaker>
<p>There’s an agenda out there that stinks. We need to go back a few generations and look at how our fathers took care of things.</p>
</speech>
<p>The third time the woman speaks, common sense appears to be both an encapsulated argument and a way to manage the discussion. Many respondents did not offer this level of detail to their sense-making actions, offering only common sense as the basis for their environmental values (use as a commonplace) or suggesting that an effective argument would simply have to “make sense” (topical management). As a 23-year-old male from Utah told me, for him to be convinced of an argument, the speaker would “have to have some facts” and “make sense,” not argue on the basis of “some crazy idea.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0741088312465376">
<title>Environment as Setting</title>
<p>Statements describing the environment purely as setting occurred in 21 interviews (16.8%), with a total of 23 individual references. These responses generate and manage argument by indicating that the environment is no more than the place in which things happen or, in a more Burkean sense, a scene. This scene is decorated with “trees,” as indicated by four responses; “water,” as offered by a woman in her 60s from Wisconsin; “air,” as mentioned by a 77-year-old woman from Pennsylvania; and the like. As a topic, environment as setting frames the environment as just a place where other things happen.</p>
<p>As one 63-year-old woman from Minnesota told me, the environment is “just the habitat and the weather, and all, and everything that goes into different areas.” She uses the concept of setting to manage her environment-related discussion. This sentiment is echoed by a 35-year-old man, also from Minnesota. To him, the environment is simply “the stuff we breathe and the place you live in.” As a commonplace, one might simply say that “the environment is a setting” or that the environment is “everything around us,” as noted by several respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741088312465376">
<title>Experience</title>
<p>Experience was referred to in 83 interviews (66.4%) and mentioned 97 times. This topic generates and manages argument by referring to life events. Six basic experiences appeared in responses: living places, being in nature, travel, education, family members, and growing up.</p>
<p>As a generative and managerial topic, respondents tried to help me understand how their environmental values were shaped. One 34-year-old woman from Michigan told me that “[place she lives] is an extremely, I think, progressive, liberal environment and . . . they really kind of promote those types of things,” suggesting that environmental values are created or enhanced by social circumstance. A 60-year-old woman from Wyoming told me, “I would say I’ve gotten my environmental values more from, like, hiking. I’ve noticed that, in general, people are slobs until they have to walk somewhere.” Their arguments use their experiences to generate a sense of real-world awareness for environment-related values.</p>
<p>As a commonplace, respondents encapsulate entire environmental belief systems by simply saying that they are the result of, for example, “the way I was brought up” or “the way I was raised.” Rarely was further explanation offered, which suggests the perception that experience or “my experiences” can, in some cases, serve as an entire historical backstory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0741088312465376">
<title>Extremism</title>
<p>Extremism or environmentalism as extreme was referred to in 35 interviews (28%), with a total of 55 individual references. References were almost always negative. Respondents indicated opposition to extremism by generating argument from the suggestion that environmentalists are “out of control,” “antihuman,” “not leading by example,” or just plain crazy (one respondent referred to environmentalists as “whackos”). Other respondents managed the conversation by using extremism to argue that environmentalism or even references to the environment in general were over-the-top or exceptionally ill-advised.</p>
<p>Use of extremism as a way to cast aspersion is not necessarily constrained by education levels. A 54-year-old woman from Arizona, for example, made sure that I knew she was an environmental scientist. She told me that environmentalism
<disp-quote>
<p>is currently a movement out of control. What used to come to mind is I could work to accomplish things that had concrete results, like remediation, water quality, improvement, things like that. Conservation. Now it’s sort of like a religion. I’ve been in the field 20 years, so I’m pretty disappointed about how things are now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While she uses extremism to both generate and manage her argument, a 52-year-old Michigan man’s statement shows an encapsulated use of “extremism” as a commonplace: “I was an environmentalist,” he told me, “but I kind of feel that, to some degree they’ve become somewhat extreme. I was a member of the Sierra Club, but I am no longer a member.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0741088312465376">
<title>Man’s Achievements</title>
<p>Man’s achievements were referred to in 20 interviews (16%), with 22 individual references.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0741088312465376">16</xref></sup> This topic generates and manages argument by building arguments from the basis of human ability and ingenuity. As a commonplace, man’s achievements celebrate patriarchal human imposition on nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0741088312465376">17</xref></sup> Responses indicate an appreciation of the domination of nature<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0741088312465376">18</xref></sup> through human resourcefulness. Nine (40.9%) references in this category specifically referred to “man,” “mankind,” or “manmade” work. The rest indicated human achievement or collective engineering prowess.</p>
<p>Man’s achievements carry with it the narrative of domination and colonialism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0741088312465376">19</xref></sup> and the sense that mankind can overcome natural, spiritual, and humanly created hurdles. It is often quite celebratory. Using achievements to manage her discussion, a 58-year-old Montana woman told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>The canyon is just incredibly beautiful, makes you think of, you know, eons and eons of time. And the dam makes you think of our engineering and scientific achievements, in a short, relatively short time compared to the age of this land.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A 35-year-old Utah woman used the topic to generate her discussion. She described the area as
<disp-quote>
<p>magnificent. Really. It’s a modern day miracle. It really is. You look at this man-made thing [the dam] that one person, or one conglomerate of people, had the idea to create power out of our natural resources and to provide for the people that are living here. There’s a lot of plusses to this situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0741088312465376">
<title>Pragmatism</title>
<p>Pragmatism—a sense of practical awareness—was indicated in 35 interviews (28%), with 38 individual references. Respondents used pragmatism topically to generate or manage argument by pointing to the value or lack thereof of environmental endeavors. Many respondents plainly stated that they did not see the value of certain environment-related actions, or they questioned the benefits of such actions. For example, a 66-year-old woman from Utah told me, “It’s silly to try to save one little tiny squiggly snail and not build a dam that’s going to benefit millions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0741088312465376">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arguments of pragmatism often appear financial. However, value may also be registered by showing how environmental concerns affect a person’s livelihood or lifestyle, by assigning value to nature based on aesthetics or by placing value on biological systems or recreation. Many arguments combine financial and nonfinancial elements. A Washington man told me, for example, that the spotted owl controversy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0741088312465376">21</xref></sup> was a real problem. When asked why, he responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>Because that devastated a livelihood that my father-in-law was in, logging, for years. That whole thing, trying to protect a bird that they say needed, you know, so many hundred acres to nest in and to live in, and yet there’s, to me, it never made sense when they had a pair living in the Seattle Park Zoo. So you know, I thought that whole issue was very blown out of proportion and it caused devastation in the forest products industry.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, pragmatism is used to both generate and manage argument. When pragmatism was used as a commonplace, respondents encapsulated entire environment-related narratives, as did this 63-year-old New Jersey woman, by simply saying things like “It may be bad for the environment, . . . but at the same time [it’s a] good thing for a lot of people.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741088312465376">
<title>Proof</title>
<p>Forms of proof appeared in 46 interviews (36.8%), with a total of 53 individual references. As a topic, proof both generates and manages argument from the underlying narrative of objectivity while suggesting that T(t)ruth can be discovered through uncovering factual evidence. As a commonplace, proof encapsulates an entire argument of legitimacy. The idea of factual evidence—such as asking for “the good facts”—constitutes proof. Respondents’ articulations of proof were not necessarily evidence based.</p>
<p>A 20-year-old Colorado male told me that an effective argument would “show me some proof, facts, like, cold hard facts,” which suggests management of argumentation through proof. The problem is in determining what someone will accept as a fact. For example, when asked what would constitute an effective argument, a 20-year-old man from Wyoming answered, “Well, I don’t know, just scientific, actually scientific proven facts, like not just what the news says, because that’s not always accurate.” He uses proof as a framework for viable argumentation but appears skeptical of fact-dispensing institutions. His friend, also 20 and from Wyoming, added,
<disp-quote>
<p>Like for example, there’s a road in St. George, the city bought for the environmentalists or something. They built a really small, like one foot, fence lining the entire road, and there’s an endangered turtle that lives there, and if they cross the fence and they get run over it’s a really big deal. Like they actually killed one while constructing the fence. A big mistake, but I don’t see how that turtle has a big effect on anything. I’ve never seen them in that area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0741088312465376">22</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Proof, for him, has to be gained as a result of one’s own senses (a corollary of both the “experience” and “seeing is believing” commonplaces), and he uses proof—in this case, asking for evidence—to generate his response. His response suggests that “proofiness” is determined individually. As a commonplace—which also draws value from context—a rhetor who simply claims to have proof may encapsulate an entire argument of positivistic legitimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0741088312465376">
<title>Recycling</title>
<p>Recycling was referred to 20 times (16%), with 20 individual references, and carries with it the narrative of accessible environmental action. Recycling is topically generative in that it serves as an entry to environment-related discussion, and it is managerial in that ongoing discussion is enhanced or maintained by the recycling narrative. For example, a 54-year-old man from California told me, “I save my beer bottles and plastic bottles so I guess to that extent I’m an environmentalist.” This move toward acknowledgment of recycling as positive environmental action<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0741088312465376">23</xref></sup> suggests utility in generating positive environment-related discourse.</p>
<p>One response in particular stands out in relation to the accessibility of recycling and its value as both topic and commonplace. A 16-year-old girl from Colorado (with permission from her father) told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>In my school, we have a world activists club. Yeah, it’s pretty cool because they like always are trying to recycle like plastic and papers, and they’re like always trying to keep our community kind of like, cultivating this environmental, kind of, um, attitude to other people. Yeah, so, I mostly hear all my friends and people around me are like yeah, let’s do something for the environment. It’s more positive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I asked her if she felt the club had a positive effect, to which she replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I would think so, because actually like, at the first when we started like recycling, um, students were like, yeah, whatever, I don’t care, and they just, like, throw in to the trash can, no recycle. . . . But for some reason they could not recycle for a week, and everybody in the school was like, where’s the recycle can? Where’s the recycle can? Where can we put our trash, recycle our trash. So everybody was like, yeah, worried to recycle. They’re not involved in the club, but they are like worried about recycling.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her narrative uses recycling (a) to show how groups of people may be introduced to positive environmental action and (b) to embody the power of shared positive action. A more concise commonplace use in relation to environmental action is simply “I/we recycle,” a response offered by a number of my respondents to entirely encapsulate their narrative of environmentalism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0741088312465376">
<title>Religion</title>
<p>Religion was referred to in 20 individual interviews (16%), with a total of 24 individual references, and carries the narrative of religiously mandated environmental action. Respondents often indicated that their environment-related values came from reading the Bible, which both generated and managed discussion from these teachings. Religion was also indicated as directly managing perceived obligations toward the earth.</p>
<p>A 59-year-old man from Arizona told me, “I’m a God-fearing man, and I believe God put us here to take care of this earth.” In this case, the respondent uses religion, specifically “God,” to encapsulate an entire argument of stewardship. The commonplace ties religion-based logic and emotional values to mandated environmental action. Similarly, a 54-year-old woman from South Carolina told me, “Well, first of all, our Maker, our Heavenly Father, He has created the earth and has put us here as stewards to take care of it, and not to destroy it.” Conversely, a man from Washington, who left before I could ask how old he was, told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I think, I’m a man of faith, I think God will take care of this planet because He made it, I think it’s important for everybody to do their part, but that’s, as far as being an environmentalist, I think it’s a personal thing, I think we need to be conscious of it, you know, for sure, but on the other side of that I think that God will take care of it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this response, religion is used as a way to both generate and manage responses, suggesting that it doesn’t matter what humans do in relation to preservation and protection; in the end, everything is in God’s hands.</p>

<title>Seeing Is Believing</title>
<p>Reference to “seeing is believing” occurred in 81 interviews (64.8%), with 104 individual references. Respondents either topically generated and managed argument by basing entire discussions around a need to “see” or encapsulated full arguments in brief statements like “You just kind of got to see it for yourself” (from a 20-year-old Wyoming man) in relation to the dam or natural areas such as the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>A 65-year-old man from Oregon told me, “If there’s things that I can observe and notice and reinforce my own observations they’re much more effective than something that’s contrary to what I’m observing,” which manages argument from the “seeing is believing” topic. This sentiment is echoed in a 54-year-old South Carolinian woman’s response to my question about good or bad environmental arguments, where she generates argument based on seeing:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I guess the latest one would be we either do or don’t have global warming. And it’s obvious that it is there. We’ve traveled to other countries, we’ve traveled to where there were once glaciers and they are no more because they have melted and you can see the visible effects of global warming, um, you can see that our, we no longer have winters where I live in South Carolina, there’s no more snow, when I was a little girl we used to have lots of snows, and now there aren’t, some people want to argue that’s just a little trend that we go through every so many years, but I disagree because of the pollution, and because of the way that we don’t try—people drive these big cars, and they don’t even try to do anything to save our environment and it just hurts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeing constitutes belief because personal observation appears incontrovertible. These respondents refer to the evidence of their eyes to generate discussion.</p>
<p>Other respondents note that arguments about the environment need to be accompanied by visual cues (or personal experience) to be effective. For example, a 20-year-old man from Colorado told me,
<disp-quote>
<p>A good environmental argument is anything that has to do usually with water pollution, because the arguments are usually won when you can shock somebody into not being able to come up with a response, and water pollution seems to be the ugliest thing that you can really see. It may not be the worst thing, but it’s one of the worst looking things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His argument encapsulates the visceral emotional response initiated by seeing something dirty or ugly with the logic that shocking an audience into action still creates action.</p>

<title>Implications and Limitations</title>
<p>The topics identified here are composite structures generated from narratives shared by my respondents. Thus, “religion” is the distillation of many conversations that used religion to bring me to a place of shared understanding; “pragmatism” is a distillation of conversations using issues of practicality and awareness of human need; and so on. Invoked, each topic should serve to contribute to the development of discourse. A rhetor, for example, could invoke Gore’s name as a way to associate an audience with a particular way of thinking or to polarize a situation, while use of “balance” could invoke the narrative of the possibility of a one-for-one negotiation of information. Similarly, “common sense” should evoke the narrative of logical action. Use of “environment as a setting” could set the scene for “important” actions. Portraying the environment as <italic>only</italic> a setting—as a “blanket term,” to pull from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312465376">Burke (1969</xref>, p. xvi)—could convey to an audience that its surroundings are value-free stages, places where action can take place but not places that are intrinsically valuable in and of themselves.</p>
<p>A rhetor could draw from standpoint theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741088312465376">Kirsch, 1999</xref>) to use “experience” as a commonplace to have people cognitively place themselves within an argument, and “extremism” could be used to generate arguments that question everyday practices or subvert common ideologies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312465376">DeLuca, 1999</xref>). Conversely, “extremism” could be used to galvanize an audience by deliberately associating action with an adventuresome, rage-against-the-machine philosophy of environmental ideology.</p>
<p>A rhetor could use the “man’s achievement’s” topic as a modern Manifest Destiny argument or “pragmatism” to associate environmentalism with practical value systems or capitalism (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0741088312465376">Tietge, 2008</xref>). Publics often have a difficult time deciding who or what authority to trust (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312465376">Gelpe &amp; Tarlock, 1974</xref>), and so decisions often become a matter of establishing viability from within social contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741088312465376">Lach &amp; Sanford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0741088312465376">Wynne, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0741088312465376">1993</xref>): Using “proof” to generate and manage argumentation could encourage a skeptical public to accept a rhetor’s view. In some cases, the data suggest that simply framing findings as proof would be sufficient.</p>
<p>As motivations for proenvironmental behavior differ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088312465376">Cameron, Brown, &amp; Chapman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312465376">Kassing, Johnson, Kloeber, &amp; Wentzel, 2010</xref>), a rhetor could simplify the argument that proenvironmental action is easy by invoking “recycling,” and since religion is a strong motivator for environment-related action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088312465376">Greeley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0741088312465376">Stoll, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0741088312465376">Wardekker, Petersen, &amp; van der Sluijs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0741088312465376">White, 1967</xref>), generating an environmental argument with the “religion” topic has the potential to be quite powerful. Last, the “seeing is believing” topic asks for audiences to trust what they can see for themselves, and while this is potentially problematic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312465376">Allen, 1996</xref>), guiding an audience toward desired associations by asking members to remember a visit to the Grand Canyon, for example, or even how frustrated they get when they have to clean trash out of their front yards, could prove useful.</p>
<p>Each commonplace category was developed as a result of respondents attempting to bring me to a place of shared understanding in relation to their own perceptions of environment-related discourse. Thus, an important lesson here is that “environment” itself is a powerful, complex, unwieldy topic that encapsulates many different emotional and logical arguments. For example, in the early testing phase of this project, one couple’s response to my initial question, which asked for them to work directly with environment-related associations, was more dramatic than any other. The woman glared at me, grabbed her husband’s arm, and stomped off, quite visibly upset. As they left, I heard her saying, “Come on honey, we don’t want none of this crap.” In short, a key message offered here is that “environment” itself is a muddy term that means different things to different people.</p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of environment-related discourse, the act of interviewing people at an environmental site with such a strong background in environmental rhetoric brought out an interesting and important side of environmental communication: People do not respond to external stimuli as expected. By the time the Glen Canyon Dam was finally completed in the 1960s, growing groups of environmentalists had begun to view its construction as a “tragic mistake” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088312465376">Billington &amp; Jackson, 2006</xref>, p. 296), and over the years the dam has become a focal point in relation to modern environmentalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088312465376">Khagram, 2004</xref>). Natural ecosystems within the Grand Canyon have been significantly affected by the dam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741088312465376">Meretsky, Wegner, &amp; Stevens, 2000</xref>), and construction of the dam significantly altered native people’s way of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312465376">Begay, 2001</xref>). Notably, the dam served as the backdrop to Edward Abbey’s 1981 speech titled, simply, “Remarks, Glen Canyon Dam, Spring Equinox 1981” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741088312465376">Philippon, 2004b</xref>). Abbey’s speech, given just after activists unrolled 300 feet of black plastic from the top of the dam to simulate a crack, marked the first public action of Earth First! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088312465376">Philippon, 2004a</xref>) and became a galvanizing force for the burgeoning environmental movement. More recently, the dam has become the focus of a number of groups interested in studying and practicing adaptive management—a system of ecosystem management that accounts for multiple stakeholder viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741088312465376">Meretsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741088312465376">Pulwarty &amp; Melis, 2001</xref>). Despite this complex and highly visible background, few respondents brought up any of these issues when responding to questions. I anticipated lengthy discussions about Abbey’s book <italic>The Monkeywrench Gang</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088312465376">1999</xref>), first published in 1975, in which the dam figures prominently, or arguments about how the dam affects the Native American way of life, but these sorts of comments were few and far between. I believe this lack of discussion occurred because I did not specifically ask questions about the history of the dam—I left respondents on their own as they attempted to bring me to a place of shared understanding in relation to the environment. This suggests that the way we draw attention to environment-related details is of prime importance when making arguments to a decision-making public. As rhetors, we cannot expect our audiences to draw the “obvious” conclusion or make “obvious” associations, even when circumstances seem to lead to forgone conclusions.</p>
<p>The way that respondents acted and responded on the basis of how I presented myself and my topic has implications for reception research. Perception of a rhetor influences the frames activated during communication, so the way that a rhetor initiates contact (see my interview introduction in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088312465376">appendix</xref>), dresses, carries oneself, and so on, influences perception and reception of the message just as much as rhetorical accommodation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088312465376">Fahnestock, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312465376">2004</xref>) or metaphor use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312465376">Baake, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312465376">Ceccarelli 2004</xref>). Additionally, research on threats to internal validity suggest that respondents may have been answering under the aegis of the Hawthorne effect, where those being interviewed deliberately construct their responses in such a way as to impress (either negatively or positively) the interviewer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312465376">Adair’s (1984</xref>, p. 341) meta-analysis of studies on the Hawthorne effect, in fact, suggests that subjects involved in any clearly defined situation assess the situation on the basis of their own understanding, then respond accordingly. In this study, I had respondents bond with me because we shared an “obvious” Democratic bond—they defined me as a democrat studying environmental issues, then responded accordingly. To my great delight, however, I also had a woman tell me that since I was obviously Republican, she felt that she could really let me know how she felt.</p>
<p>The “we don’t want none of this crap” response, the perception of being both a Democrat and a Republican, and respondents’ sometimes unexpected responses lead to an important lesson from this study: Multiple confounding factors play a role in any study that involves interaction with human subjects. As noted by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312465376">Cantrill (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0741088312465376">Walsh (2009)</xref>, interviewing a subject may predispose him or her toward your viewpoint. Additionally, the responses I received were likely framed, either consciously or unconsciously, to fit into respondents’ perceptions of what an academic would like to hear. Because respondents knew that I was (a) a student, (b) researching communication, and (c) interested in environmental issues (this element came out approximately halfway through the interview, if they didn’t immediately catch on with my first environment-related question), their answers likely came from frames activated in response to a request for help. As one reviewer of this article noted, the respondents were likely activating their “I’m talking to an academic, and academics love to discuss broad/important philosophical themes” frame, rather than frames specifically related to difficult decision making. In short, most respondents likely understood that their answers were academic and would not result in direct, immediate change in their own lives, which could explain many respondents’ willingness or comfort to discuss broad philosophical topics such as “balance,” “religion,” and “man’s achievements.” Further research on how perception activates response frames, then, may provide important information useful to theoreticians and environmental activists and advocates alike.</p>
<p>The methods used and data collected for this study formed the heart of my dissertation, <italic>The Commonplaces of Environmental Rhetoric: Resonation and Perception of Environmentalism in American Tourists</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0741088312465376">Ross, 2008a</xref>). Given the exigency of obtaining my doctorate, I explored a method (grounded theory), then put it to use coding this body of data. In the intervening years I have become familiar with additional methods, some of which might have yielded different result. These have been brought to my attention by reviewers, at conferences, and in my reading. One reviewer, for example, noted that generating a word frequency list might have served as a functional starting point, as might semantic field categories from the Linguistics Lab at University of Texas, Austin. I agree, but when I developed this project, I was deeply invested in utilizing a grounded theory approach, which would allow me to read for concepts, rather than find words, then conceptualize later. These are essentially back-to-back processes, although the order in which analysis occurs does matter, as a researcher’s own framing will shape results. In this case, I began at the searching-for-concept level.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312465376">Michael Leff (1996)</xref> points out, commonplaces “function to punctuate the speech, rendering it ‘distinguished’ or ‘brilliant’ by refreshing the audience or rousing it emotionally at the right moment” (p. 447). The fluid topics identified here seem usable in this capacity and appear to be potentially valuable components in framing environment-related discussions and shaping environmental ideology. The 12 discussed here, however, likely do not represent all of the topics of environmental rhetoric. “Green,” for example, is missing, simply because it rarely came up in my interviews and, when it did, was typically in reference to color. Further interview-based research will serve to construct more elaborate explanations of the commonplaces described here, as well as add to this list of concepts for rhetors to utilize to motivate an audience.</p>
<p>Many of the commonplaces identified in this project are interrelated, such as “scene,” “experience,” “seeing is believing,” and “proof”; “Gore”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0741088312465376">24</xref></sup> and “extremism”; and “pragmatism,” “balance,” and “common sense.” As this Commonplaces of Environmental Rhetoric Project progresses, a refined coding scheme is being developed to dispel ambiguity, where possible, and highlight the interconnected nature of the categories. This continued work is being developed in collaboration with multiple coders to refine categories through the establishment of interrater reliability. In addition, public uptake, process, and use/reuse should be addressed. The commonplaces presented here are filtered in that they are the result of memetic transference,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0741088312465376">25</xref></sup> specific worldviews, cultural identification, and embedded ideology. An interesting and potentially valuable study might include following an argument from inception to uptake, much in the vein of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088312465376">Fahnestock’s (1998)</xref> “Accommodating science,” to map the trajectory of a topic from rhetorical activation to public memetic duplication—a researcher could apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088312465376">Bengston, Fan, Reed, and Goldhor-Wilcock’s (2009)</xref> “rapid issue tracking” approach as a way to track topics through culture.</p>
<p>Further research is needed on the way that these commonplaces are used or can be used in environmental discourse. Examining headlines in the popular media, for example, shows that these topics are prevalent and deserving of attention. A discussion on the Kyoto Protocol in a 2011 issue of <italic>Science</italic> tells us that “China looks to balance its carbon books” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0741088312465376">Li &amp; Stone, 2011</xref>); according to CNN, “Yellowstone seeks to balance nature, cell phones” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088312465376">CNN.com, 2008</xref>); and an op-ed piece in the <italic>Naples Daily News</italic> titled “Common Sense Environmentalism” discusses the lack of common sense shown by “pseudo-environmentalists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741088312465376">H. I. Miller, 2004</xref>). An article in <italic>Nature</italic> suggests that “Carson no ‘beacon of reason’ on DDT” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0741088312465376">Trewavas, 2012</xref>), which invokes both Rachel Carson as the “famous person” around which the article is framed and “common sense” in relation to her perceived lack of reason; in North Dakota, apparently, “voters should reject Crabtree’s radical environmental agenda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312465376">Christmann, 2012</xref>), which uses the “extremism” topic; and, in the United Kingdom, <italic>The Guardian</italic> proclaims, “The new environmentalism: Where men must act ‘as gods’ to save the planet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741088312465376">Kingsnorth, 2012</xref>), a single headline that invokes the environment as a savable setting, “man’s achievements,” and, of course, “religion.” In the few examples that I provide here, topics are invoked to catalyze frames of understanding to generate argument. Each headline alone tells a story because of the immense amount of value-added information contained by these topics. Examining sets of headlines might provide us with insight into the way that particular types of media frame environmental discussion, while an in-depth analysis of a single body of environmental artifacts, such as a series of letters written to a congressperson on a particular subject, would also likely yield valuable data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the topics identified in this project suggest that generating or managing environment-related argument from a specific narrative (e.g., “balance”) may prove more valuable than beginning environment-related discussion with the overly large commonplace “environment.” The 12 commonplaces identified here should prove useful to writers as they design environment-related arguments with specific motivational goals. Because environmental argument is strongly shaped by sociopolitical climate, however, motivating an audience to action by framing an argument based on common shared narratives has an ethical component. Use of pop-culture elements, public events, or, more terribly, disasters should be carefully considered in relation to audience, purpose, and the potential outcomes of any communication situation before using them as tools to deliberately motivate an audience toward action.</p>

<p>My approach shares some similarities with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0741088312465376">Walsh’s 2009</xref> analysis of stakeholder beliefs in the Mexican Blue Wolf Reintroduction Project, though her project had not yet been published when I designed my study. A study that combined my approach with Walsh’s filter theory would likely prove interesting. In fact, several topics that I identify in my study are similar to the topical stakeholder filters she identified during her examination of 944 public comments to the Mexican Wolf Blue Range Reintroduction Project during its interim federal review. These similarities reinforce my argument that there are “common topics of environmental rhetoric” likely to resonate with a stakeholder public. Most notably, her “human dimensions” appear analogous to my “experience,” and her “evidence” appears analogous to my “proof.</p>

<p>While responses that indicated stewardship put humankind in charge of the maintenance of the earth, not all of these responses are commensurate.
