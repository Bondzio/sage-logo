<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent advances in instruments and techniques have resulted in laparoscopic/endoscopic procedures now being performed in nearly every surgical field. Gagner first described endoscopic parathyroid surgery in 1996,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612447694">1</xref></sup> and endoscopic thyroid surgery with gas insufflation and gasless methods was introduced to Korea in the late 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612447694">2</xref></sup> Since then, endoscopic thyroid procedures have been performed at many institutions in Korea, and various approaches are currently used, including axillary, bilateral-axillo-breast, breast, chest, and neck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612447694">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Breast augmentation with implants is the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure among women in Korea. Breast augmentation techniques continued to evolve since the first report of adipose delivery to the breast in 1895 by Czerny.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612447694">4</xref></sup> The silicone implants technique is the most common procedure for breast augmentation today.</p>
<p>Endoscopic thyroid procedures present a possible risk of damage to cohesive gel implants, especially if breast approaches are used rather than axillary approaches. Furthermore, the circumareolar incisions required for the breast approach are also considered undesirable by patients with breast augmentation.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of gasless transaxillary endoscopic thyroidectomy in patients with augmented breasts.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Of the 3673 patients who underwent thyroid surgery at the Thyroid Cancer Center, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, between January 2009 and December 2010, 120 patients (3.3%) underwent endoscopic thyroidectomies by the transaxillary, gasless approach, which was mostly performed at our institution.</p>
<p>Approval to conduct a retrospective review of the patients was obtained from the institutional review board of Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine.</p>

<title>Operation Method for Transaxillary Endoscopic Thyroidectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612447694">5</xref></sup></title>
<p>Patients were placed in a supine position while under general anesthesia. The neck was slightly extended, and the lesion-side arm was raised and fixed for the shortest distance from the axilla to the anterior neck. A 4- to 6-cm vertical skin incision was made in the axilla for the insertion of an endoscope and endoscopic instruments. The route to the anterior neck area was dissected through the anterior surface of the pectoralis major muscle using electrical cautery under direct vision, until the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was exposed. Exposure of the thyroid was made through the space of the sternocleidomastoid branches (between the sternal head and the clavicular head) and beneath the strap muscle until the contralateral lobe of the thyroid gland was identified. An external retractor was inserted through the skin incision in the axilla and the flap was raised using a lifting device to create a working space. A second skin incision (0.5 cm in length) was made on the medial side of the anterior chest wall for the insertion of endoscopic instruments on an imaginary horizontal line beginning at the lower end of the axillary incision, extending from 5 to 6 cm. The operation was performed as per a conventional open thyroidectomy.</p>

<title>Assessment of Augmented Breast</title>
<p>Augmented breasts were assessed by a plastic surgeon (JWH) preoperatively and postoperatively.</p>
<p>The maximal breast projection was measured from the chest wall to the breast surface (anterior–posterior projection), and the angle of the upper pole of the breast at the chest wall was also measured and termed the internal angle of the breast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612447694">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>All 6 patients were female, and their ages were 30, 32, 37, 41, 50, and 55 years; the mean patient age was 40.8 years. All patients had undergone breast augmentation using silicone cohesive gel, and those procedures were performed 3, 2, 7, 4, 4, and 10 years prior to the thyroidectomy, respectively.</p>
<p>All patients underwent an endoscopic hemithyroidectomy: 4 patients for papillary thyroid cancer and 2 patients for follicular adenoma and adenomatous hyperplasia. The mean tumor size was 0.65 cm, with a range of 0.2 to 1.3 cm.</p>
<p>The results of the anterior–posterior projection and internal angle of breast are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612447694">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative anterior–posterior projections and internal angles.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Breast augmentation is the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure, and breast augmentation techniques have continued to evolve.</p>
<p>Since the first report of adipose delivery to the breast in 1895 by Czerny,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612447694">4</xref></sup> 5 methods of breast augmentation have been developed: saline implants, silicone implants, autologous fat injections, external tissue expanders, and tissue flaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612447694">6</xref></sup> All the patients in this study had undergone breast augmentation with silicone implants.</p>
<p>After the US Food and Drug Administration moratorium on silicone breast implants in 1992, implant manufacturers developed fourth-generation cohesive gel silicone implants, which offer significant technological advances in reducing systemic leakage or “gel bleed.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612447694">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Common incision sites for breast augmentation include the inframammary fold, periareolar region, and axilla. Other options include the umbilicus and through the upper margin of an abdominoplasty flap.</p>
<p>There are 4 possible pocket planes for implant insertion: the subglandular plane, the subpectoral or partial submuscular plane, the subfascial plane above the pectoralis major muscle, and the total submuscular plane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612447694">6</xref></sup> The subpectoral (partial submuscular, dual-plane, and biplanar) pocket is created immediately beneath the pectoralis major muscle and above the rib cage and pectoralis minor muscle. The subfascial pocket is a potential space between the pectoralis major and serratus muscles and their overlying fascia. The submuscular pocket is essentially a subpectoral pocket with no division of the pectoralis major fibers along the lower pole of the breast. The pocket also partially mobilizes the serratus anterior muscle fibers along the inferolateral pocket margin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612447694">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The plane and route of endoscopic thyroidectomy via the transaxillary approach means that the pocket planes used for implant insertion are not transgressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612447694">5</xref></sup> While most of the pockets for implant insertion are the under-space of the pectoralis muscle, in endoscopic thyroidectomy, the route to the anterior neck area is the anterior surface of the pectoralis major muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612447694">5</xref></sup> Therefore, there is no risk of implant damage when performing an endoscopic thyroidectomy via a transaxillary approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the incision site for the breast augmentation was the axilla, the endoscopic thyroidectomy surgeon can also use that as an incision site.</p>
<p>Not all endoscopic thyroidectomy approaches pose risk to breast implants. Breast approaches that use the circumareolar incision and subcutaneous space over the breast tissue may present a risk of damage to the augmented breast.</p>
<p>Assessment methods for augmented breasts are not well established. Thus, new breast parameters including anterior–posterior projection and internal angle were used for the present series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612447694">8</xref></sup> An expert plastic surgeon assessed the augmented breast preoperatively and postoperatively. The results of those assessments showed that there were no postoperative differences in the measured parameters, nor was there any indication of change to the breast appearance or instability postoperatively.</p>
<p>In conclusion, based on current trends, the number of women requiring an endoscopic thyroidectomy who have previously undergone breast augmentation will increase in the future. Endoscopic thyroidectomy via a transaxillary approach was found to be safe and effective in women who had undergone implant breast augmentation.</p>
