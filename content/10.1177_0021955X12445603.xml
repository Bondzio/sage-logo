<p>Native and modified starches from non-conventional sources could be used as raw materials that represent appropriate bio-matrices to support diverse bioactive substances when formulating composite edible films or foams. In order to be used as raw materials, the starch and the starch-based films or foams obtained have to be characterized.

A native <italic>D. trifida</italic> starch with high purity was obtained, as well as a cross-linked modified starch with a 0.002% of degree of substitution. Significant statistical differences in the film thickness, color profile, deformation, and stress to puncture were found in both types of films. The modified starch-based films exhibited higher width and opalescence than those formed with native starch. The water vapor permeability, water retention, and water solubility differed also between both bio-matrices. The results suggested, in spite of these differences, that both of them could be proposed for gasification in order to obtain foams.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X12445603" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The natural polymers are resources widely found in the environment. Indeed, because of their polymeric structure, they can easily be modified and they tend to be readily biodegradable. They are also ubiquitous and cheap. Cellulose, starch, lignin, chitin, and various polysaccharides are included in this group.</p>
<p>Starch consists primarily of <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose polymers linked by α-1,4, and α-1,6 glycosidic bonds. Glucose polymerization in starch results in two types of polymers: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is considered to be an essentially linear polymer composed almost entirely of a α-1,4-linked <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose or maltose units. Recent evidence has suggested that some branches are present on the amylose polymer, whereas the amylopectin molecule is much larger and more branched. The structural differences between these two polymers contribute to significant differences in their functionality and make possible their modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445603">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The best option, also an innovative idea, when developing a new biodegradable product is the use of natural resources as a source of conservation and recycling. The entire replacement of synthetic plastics by biodegradable materials for the foam elaboration has not been obtained until the present; however, some synthetic polymers have been replaced by other natural ones for specific applications. Such replacements have allowed product development with specific characteristics related to the barrier, mechanical, and thermal properties in certain packing such as films, covers, foams, envelopes, plates, spoons, and bags.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12445603">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12445603">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Native or modified starches are some of the polymeric substances considered to be used as bio-matrices appropriate for films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12445603">4</xref></sup> or these starches could be processed into foam by applying suitable methods<bold>.</bold> Additionally, starch is cheap, abundant, easy to handle, and biodegradable. They also provide supporting matrix for many of the composite foams and films studied, and generally, when they are mixed with plasticizers and lipids, they offer good barrier properties to gases and water. Moreover, mixing them with other kinds of polymeric components can also provide a selective barrier to the oxygen and carbon dioxide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X12445603">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, a variety of crystalline, fibrous, amorphous, or metallic additives may be incorporated into the foam structure to produce lightweight composite materials with enhanced strength and insulating properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12445603">2</xref></sup> Moreover, its native structure is very effective when producing foams, but most efficient when modified by cross-linking.</p>
<p>The ability of starch to undergo modification using different methods has been investigated extensively to obtain starch with improved functional properties for diverse uses. In fact, the use of modified starches as bio-matrices has been investigated in order to optimize some of the functional properties considered as limits for its uses in the formation of foams, edible films, and coatings. Therefore, the use of physical and chemical modifications, such as extrusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12445603">6</xref></sup> oxidation, acetylation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12445603">7</xref></sup> and the use of starch with high and low amylose content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445603">8</xref></sup> have been investigated in terms of the functional properties of the starch-based films. On the other hand, some applications of native<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12445603">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12445603">11</xref></sup> and modified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12445603">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12445603">14</xref></sup> starches for the elaboration of bio-foams have been reported in literature. Results have shown that modifications have improved the functional properties on foams and films, such as its anti-leakage ability for vegetable oil, good stability in acid aqueous medium, gas permeability, cell development, density, tensile strength, sealing resistance, expansion, and compression stress.</p>
<p>The use of edible films and coatings in staple food may improve and keep their functional properties. Also, the films can be carriers of bioactive substances that will improve the nutritional or nutraceutical properties of the food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12445603">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12445603">17</xref></sup> and stability. In addition to the increasing concerns about environmental protection and garbage handling, renewable natural materials such as starches are becoming popular in the manufacture of packaging materials, especially bio-foams.</p>
<p>In the tropics, there are numerous sources of starch that can be suitable for such uses. <italic>Dioscorea trifida</italic>, a sub<bold>-</bold>utilized agricultural commodity of the Venezuelan Amazons, is an important specie of the <italic>Dioscoreaceae</italic> family that grows in tropical areas, especially in the northern region of South America. Tubers of <italic>D. trifida</italic> are an important source of starch (58–64% db)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12445603">18</xref></sup> and their exploitation should be considered for commercial uses. Biopolymers extracted from agricultural non-conventional commodities, such as <italic>D. trifida</italic>, can be excellent raw materials for edible biologically degradable plastics. A very important feature is that starch from this crop has been analyzed and reported as a waxy starch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12445603">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The goals of this study were first to isolate starch from <italic>D. trifida</italic> and modify the native starch by cross-linking to characterize and compare both starches as well as produce and characterize edible films. And finally with the starch-based films, formulated in terms of physicochemical properties, evaluate its potential as an ingredient to produce foams.</p>

<p>Two batches of native starch were isolated from <italic>D. trifida</italic> tubers grown in Venezuelan farms. The cleaned tubers were peeled and their edible portions were sliced. Approximately 0.5 kg of the edible portion was mixed for 2 min in a waring blender with twice their volume of distilled water. This procedure was repeated six times to process approximately 3 kg. The collected homogenate was passed through a 200-mesh sieve. The grinding and screening operations were repeated four more times. The resulting slurry was centrifuged at 1500 r/min for 15 min, at ±28°C, to facilitate separation of the starch from the viscous mucilage. After carefully removing the remaining mucilaginous layer, the sediment was washed several times by suspending in distilled water and centrifuging until it appeared free of non-starch material. The sediment was then dried in a ventilated oven at 45°C. Starches were blended, passed through a 60-mesh sieve, and stored at room temperature in sealed plastic bags inside hermetic glass containers until subsequent analysis<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12445603">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>Starch modification with sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) was performed following a wet procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12445603">19</xref></sup> with some modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12445603">Figure 1</xref>). Native starch (300 g) and 15 g of sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) were suspended in 300 mL of distilled water. The solid content in the suspension has to reach 24 B° (Baumé degree). The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 11 with 2.5% NaOH solution. The slurry was heated at 45°C to proceed with the addition of 2 g of STMP. The slurry was held under agitation for 3 h. The pH of the slurry was adjusted every hour to 11, if it was necessary. After 3 h, the pH was lowered to 7 with 2.5% HCl solution. The slurry was washed three times by suspension in distilled water, centrifuged at 1500 r/min for 15 min, and dried at 45°C. The dried modified starch was milled and sieved through a 60-mesh sieve.

A decrease of the amylose content by the effect of the treatment with STMP was observed. Some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021955X12445603">34</xref></sup> have shown that the identity of the major chromophore formed in the amylose–iodine reaction was a pentaiodide anion I<sub>5</sub><sup>−</sup>. Then, it is inferred that cross-linking represents in the modified starch a steric effect that prevents the formation of the chromophore and hence provide a non-optimal quantification of the amylose. The amylose content obtained by DSC in the native starch was more realistic (waxy starch) than that obtained by the chromophore formation.

<p>Values of <italic>a<sub>w</sub></italic> of both types of films are low as expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X12445603">Table 3</xref>). Both starches have similar moisture contents, and there are no evidences or arguments indicating that the modification procedure should change <italic>a<sub>w</sub></italic> values. Myllärinen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021955X12445603">36</xref></sup> reported that amylose films at high relative humidity (RH%) absorb more water than amylopectin films. These authors also report that crystallization is known to decrease water sorption of the hydrophilic polymer and also that the lower water content in the amylopectin films may be explained by the amylopectin crystallization. Since amylose is mainly linear, whereas amylopectin is highly branched, the crystallinity of starch films is primarily associated with amylose, even if amylopectin accounts for the crystalline regions in the native starch granules. Consequently, starch films containing more amylose show higher crystallinity, which is contrary to the fact that native starch containing more amylose has a lower degree of crystallinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021955X12445603">36</xref></sup> Since, in this study, both the starches used (native and modified) have relatively low amylose contents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12445603">Table 1</xref>), a lower crystallinity should be expected accordingly. Also, García et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021955X12445603">37</xref></sup> studying the micro-structural characterization of plasticized starch-based films, found that as the degree of crystallinity increased, the gas permeability of the film decreased.

<p>Significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the width, color profile, deformation, and stress to puncture are found in the native starch based films, when comparing them with their modified counterparts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X12445603">Table 3</xref>). The modified starch based films were wider and whiter than films from native starch, with lower tendencies to deformation. McHugh et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021955X12445603">38</xref></sup> in a study of the effect of the thickness of films on water vapor permeability values, reported that as the thickness of the film was augmented, the water vapor permeability increased.</p>
<p>Several explanations have been provided for such thickness effect. Biofilms containing hydrophilic components, such as polysaccharides, have an extremely complex transport through them due to non-linear water sorption isotherms and water-content-dependent diffusivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021955X12445603">39</xref></sup> Thus, water vapor flux through hydrophilic films varies non-linearly with water vapor pressure gradient. It has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021955X12445603">40</xref></sup> that this anomalous effect occurred because the swelling of hydrophilic matrix results in different structural changes in the films with different thicknesses. In this way, it is expected that hydrophilic films exhibit an increased permeability to water vapor, which is augmented by its thickness. The water solubility and water retention also were different between both films.</p>
<p>The water vapor permeability was higher in the modified starch, as compared to values of the native one. It could be explained by the augmented thickness of the films produced with modified starch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021955X12445603">38</xref></sup> This behavior may be related to the structural network produced by the modifications on the starch. In addition, starch concentration and botanical source of the starch used may affect the water permeability properties of starch films.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12445603">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021955X12445603">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The water solubility values at 25°C of the films elaborated with native starch (0.30 ± 0.22) were significantly lower (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than those reported in the films elaborated with modified starch (0.54 ± 0.22). Some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12445603">20</xref></sup> have reported values of water solubility for films obtained with non-conventional native starches; 32% (okenia), 23% (plantain), and 25% (mango). These authors had used conventional gelatinization with heat and cold gelatinization. Other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021955X12445603">40</xref></sup> report water solubility values ranging from 22.7% to 29.86% in films elaborated with oxidized potato starch, varying the glycerol concentration. López et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021955X12445603">42</xref></sup> working with films produced with corn starch, reported that when using a large amount of glycerol, the water solubility increased. Sothornvit and Krochta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021955X12445603">43</xref></sup> suggest films with high water solubility for potential applications as edible wrappings for foods such as candies, because they can dissolve easily in the mouth.</p>
<p>The water retention is an important property to be measured on the films for food or pharmaceutical industries, because it defines the stability of the products where they are applied. In this study, there are differences between both the starches.</p>
<p>It is evident by the use of a magnifier that films were non-porous and transparent. However, the films produced using the modified starch was more opalescent than those produced with the native starch. As demonstrated through the procedure for film production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12445603">Figure 2</xref>), the degasification of the gel suspension was necessary to obtain a non-porous film. A relatively simple mixture of native or modified starch and plasticizer agents could integrate the conceive functions of foam production. The foam stability depends on numerous kinetic and non-equilibrium processes related to viscosity, surface tension, drainage, diffusion, capillarity, etc. The initial formation of foams or bubbles is facilitated by the reduction in surface tension, especially in the aqueous systems, and amphiphilic molecules can reduce this effect by forming (mono) layers at the interface, exposing less polar functional groups to the air while presenting a more water-compatible surface to the bulk liquid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021955X12445603">44</xref></sup> Since this property was observed in the gelatinized starch–glycerol suspension before the degasification step, the speculation about its possible applications in the production of foam can be proposed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021955X12445603" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is feasible to use non-conventional native and modified starches with appropriate physicochemical properties as bio-matrices for the elaboration of the edible films. Modifications brought about by cross-linking have an effect on the functional properties of the films, making them more white and more water permeable than their native counterpart. However, other specific uses can be proposed. More studies are required and the potential uses of waxy starches, native and modified, in foam should be investigated.</p>
