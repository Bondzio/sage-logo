<sec id="sec1-1030570X13485394" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 25 January 1959 the newly elected Pope John XXIII surprised many when he announced the Second Vatican Council. The arduous work of preparing texts for discussion and voting commenced. The Council began on 11 October 1962, gathering from around the world 2400 bishops, 500 theologians, 50 observers and 200 auditors. It was thought by some that the texts prepared by the committees would be discussed, edited and approved, with the expectation that the duration of the Council would be just a few short weeks. In the end the Council gathered in four sessions from 1962 to 1965, producing four ‘constitutions’, nine ‘decrees’ and three ‘declarations’, addressing a wide range of issues and topics.</p>
<p>In 2005 Pope Benedict XVI met with the Roman Curia and identified that there were three circles of questions at the time of the Council. The first was the relationship between faith and modern science. The second concerned the relationship between the church and the modern state, particularly addressing the need for mutual respect, tolerance and religious freedom. The third circle of questions focused on the relationship of Christianity to other major religions.</p>
<p>The reception, implementation, and interpretation of the Council have been the subjects of intense debate over the last 50 years. Benedict identified two opposing streams of interpretation: a hermeneutic of reform on one hand, and a hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture on the other. His own contention is that in any true reform there will be elements of both continuity and discontinuity, even if the church remains fundamentally true to its basic call ‘to proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes’ (1 Corinthians 11:26).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1030570X13485394"><title>Fruits and Future Symposium 19–21 September 2012</title>
<p>The reception of an ecumencal council is a complex and lengthy process and the 50th anniversary of Vatican II provides an opportunity to reflect on what was achieved in the Council, and what has yet to be done. In discussions that took place between Australian Catholic University, Catholic Theological College, Jesuit Theological College and Yarra Theological Union, all in Melbourne, Australia, it was decided to jointly sponsor a symposium entitled: ‘The Fruits and Future of Vatican II’. Keynote addresses were requested from Professor Alberto Melloni, from the John XXIII Institute in Bologna, Archbishop Mark Coleridge, Professor Gerald O’Collins and Professor Anne Hunt. The publication of an Australian Catholic University study of the implementation and reception of Vatican II in Australia was timed to coincide with the symposium and provided the opportunity for contributors to that work to present the results of their study to the wider theological community. The symposium took place in Melbourne on 19–21 September 2012 with a series of public lectures and the presentation of papers. We are delighted that <italic>Pacifica</italic> has agreed to publish three of the keynote addresses and a selection of other papers presented at the symposium in this special edition.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1030570X13485394"><title>An overview of the articles</title>
<p>Benedict's address to the Roman Curia in 2005 highlighted the ongoing debate regarding the interpretation of the Council. Professor Melloni’s paper ‘Vatican II and the History of Vatican II’ provides an opportunity to hear first-hand from one who has been intimately involved in that debate as a historian. As a contributor to the research project that culminated in the publication of a five-volume history of the Second Vatican Council he is ideally placed to reflect on the fruits of that lengthy and complex task.</p>
<p>Melloni outlines the contours of the debate on the role of the historian, and makes suggestions regarding the appropriate hermeneutics required for the adequate interpretation and implementation of the Council. He explores the methodological questions for historians that have emerged during the writing of this history, as well as the various responses to its particular interpretation of the Council. In a sense his article is a history of the writing of a history, and it brings into relief the ideological, methodological and historical responses to that endeavour. All history is interpretation, and the interpretation of Vatican II has been, and will continue to be, a battleground often marked by false dichotomies. Like Benedict, Melloni rejects the unhelpful and facile retreat into such dichotomies, suggesting that the problems encountered in interpreting Vatican II are the same, or similar to, the same challenges that were experienced and addressed during the Council itself.</p>
<p>Archbishop Mark Coleridge is uniquely placed to write on the fruits and future of Vatican II as one who has lived in Rome, worked in the Secretariat of State and studied at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He has been involved in the implementation of the Council as an Auxiliary Bishop in Melbourne and then as Archbishop of Canberra and Brisbane. ‘A Different Fire: Vatican II and the New Evangelization’ addresses the connection between Vatican II and Pope John Paul II’s call to a new evangelization, that is, an example of how reform can contain elements of both continuity and rupture. The present challenges facing the church in its encounter with, and mission to, the modern world are outlined. As an example of continuity in the midst of a process of reform, the current call to a new evangelization is seen to be part of a journey that began at Trent, continued into Vatican I, and then shaped the work of Vatican II. It is argued that the Council responded to the fires of Auschwitz and Hiroshima and that this has been continued by the call to a new evangelization, setting hearts on fire through encounter with the Risen Lord, inviting us all to be part of Jesus’ intense desire ‘to bring fire to the earth’ (Luke 12: 49).</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the groundbreaking work of the Council highlighted by Benedict was the positive and appreciative stance towards other religious traditions, articulated and clearly expressed in ‘The Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions’ (<italic>Nostra Aetate</italic>)<italic>.</italic> Professor Gerald O’Collins’s article, ‘The Second Vatican Council on Other Living Faiths’, suggests that the Council’s reflections on the Church’s relationship to other religions should not be limited to that document. The article provides helpful and concrete indications of the reflection of the Council in three other documents: ‘The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy’ (<italic>Sacrosantum Concilium</italic>), ‘The Decree on Missionary Activity’ (<italic>Ad Gentes</italic>), and ‘The Dogmatic Constitution on the Church’ (<italic>Lumen Gentium</italic>). The Council reflected on the situation of all human beings, and O’Collins brings into relief the universal mindset that emerged in these documents: that seeds of the word are found in all traditions since the Son reveals the Father to all creation.</p>
<p>One of the observations made in Melloni’s article is that the call for a Vatican Council so soon after the election of John XXIII came as a great surprise to many. Max Vodola’s article, ‘I met Charles Borromeo… and he Brought me to Vatican II’, provides a well-argued presentation of the impact of Charles Borromeo on John XXIII’s call for a Council, as well as some of its primary pastoral concerns. Vodola indicates that, while the call for a Council was a surprise to many, it was influenced and shaped by John XXIII’s ongoing conversation with the past, lending support to Benedict’s own contention about continuity in a hermeneutic of reform. In 1906 the future pope found archival material about Charles Borromeo and his apostolic visitation to the diocese of Bergamo in 1575, and he received permission to publish these materials in preparation for the 300th anniversary of Borromeo’s canonization. The article argues that working on these archival materials up until just before the Council helped to construct an historical framework and language that shaped John XXIII’s vision of Vatican II. In entering the world of Trent and Borromeo over five decades, he found meaning in the past and shaped his sense of the church’s mission in the present and the future.</p>
<p>Peter Price’s article, ‘The Diaspora Church: Laity and Laicity in the Post Vatican II Era’ clearly argues that, while much was initiated during the time of the Council in drawing laity into the central life of the church, much yet needs to be done. If some of the other articles in this collection have stressed continuity in the task of interpreting and implementing the Council, this article sets out to examine the inertia and resistance encountered in the process of reform as it applies to the laity. The article suggests that such resistance can be partly explained as being due to ambiguity present within the ‘Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity’ (<italic>Apostolicam Actuositatem</italic>) itself. In addition, the article provides a timely reminder that Councils take a long time to be received, suggesting that the Catholic Church is still largely in a state of transition. As well as offering indications of the work that still needs to be done to implement the Council, the proposal is made that the current exodus of Catholics may be a blessing in disguise, inviting a more profound appreciation of the mission of the laity in the heart of a sacred world.</p>
<p>One of the key areas of concern and reflection during Vatican II was that of the Catholic Church and its relationship to the state. Bruce Duncan’s article ‘Tackling Capitalism: What Vatican II Achieved and What Still Needs to be Done’ clearly addresses both the fruits and future of Vatican II from the perspective of its engagement with, and critique of, capitalism. Duncan rightly points out that the Council said little about economics. The article provides a helpful overview of papal views on capitalism, before engaging with the ‘Pastoral Constitution of the Church in the Modern World’ (<italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic>). While the church did not engage in a thorough critique of capitalism and communism, it did provide a theological grounding for the pursuit of social justice as a key element of the its mission in the world. Duncan examines the 1967 social encyclical on ‘The Development of Peoples’ (<italic>Populorum Progressio</italic>), arguing that the concern for social justice and development is one that continues unabated, despite what neoconservative economic theorists within the Catholic Church would wish to argue. At the time of the Council there were few church leaders with expertise in economics and little has changed. This leads Duncan to argue that suitable structures need to be developed to engage the largely untapped resource of lay expertise. More work needs to be done in freeing up resources so that the Catholic Church can be part of ongoing and much needed conversation among theologians, philosophers and economists.</p>
<p>Mary Rhyllis Clark’s article ‘The Nuns and Vatican Two – Pandora’s Box or Goldmine?’ focuses on the radical impact of the Council in the lives of religious women in Australia. Clark brings into relief the enormous impact for religious women as they interpreted and implemented the directions that had been set. The changes are interpreted in a positive light, while not glossing over the cost of these changes in the lives of many individual women and their religious communities. Anecdotal and instructive, this article is deeply grounded in the documents of the Council and the lived and sacred experience of religious women in an extended period of transition and change.</p>
