<abstract>
<p>This manuscript examines police officer decision making during automobile stops to determine whether Black and Hispanic drivers are searched at parity with nonminorities, with particular focus on officers’ legal authority to search and controlling for other explanatory factors. Using data collected by a large Midwestern police department, we observe Blacks are overrepresented among searches overall and among searches involving greater officer discretion to search. However, neither race nor ethnic effects were observed after introducing other explanatory variables into multivariate models, suggesting factors other than minority status provide greater understanding of officers’ decision making. Results indicate minorities are differentially involved in searches because police engage minorities under characteristics consistent with searches. This suggests that it is the social context of the stop, rather than the race or ethnicity of the driver, that primarily influences searches.</p>

<p>Awareness of racial and ethnic disparity and bias in automobile stops has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Reactions to “racial profiling” has focused public, political, legal, and sociological interest in examining the manner in which police officers and minorities interact during automobile stops by evaluating whether officer decision making is racially and ethnically neutral. Racial profiling involves the police differentially using race and/or ethnicity rather than behavior as the primary factor that directs officer decision making during self-initiated encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986211425734">Ramirez, McDevitt, &amp; Farrell, 2000</xref>). Typically, this term has been applied to police–public encounters during automobile stops, including the assertion that police stop minorities more often or subject minorities differentially to searches, citations, or arrest. The nonneutral use of race and/or ethnicity comes at a substantial cost to public trust and erodes law enforcement legitimacy.</p>
<p>A variety of analytic approaches have been employed to examine the racial profiling phenomenon in a relatively short amount of time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986211425734">Fridell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986211425734">Tillyer, Engel, &amp; Cherkauskas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2004</xref>). Strategies include examining public perception on the extent of racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425734">Gallup Organization, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986211425734">Higgins, Gabbidon, &amp; Vito, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986211425734">Reitzel &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986211425734">Reitzel, Rice, &amp; Piquero, 2004</xref>), citizens’ accounts of experiences during traffic stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986211425734">Allen &amp; Monk-Turner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986211425734">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986211425734">Harris, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986211425734">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986211425734">Lundman &amp; Kaufman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986211425734">Warren, Tomaskovic-Devey, Smith, Zingraff, &amp; Mason, 2006</xref>) and officers’ perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425734">Barlow &amp; Barlow, 2002</xref>). The primary focus among previous evaluations has been to examine disparity in officer decision making through data collected by police departments during routine traffic encounters with the public.</p>
<p>Racial profiling within automobile stops has focused on three distinct officer-initiated decision-making points that can measure the presence of racial and/or ethnic nonneutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer, Carter, Katz-Bannister, &amp; Wells, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986211425734">Barnum &amp; Perfetti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986211425734">Ridgeway, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986211425734">Tillyer, Engel, &amp; Cherkauskas, 2010</xref>). The first is the officer’s decision to initiate a stop. This decision-making point typically considers the propensity of racial and ethnic minorities to be stopped or whether Blacks or Hispanics are stopped at a higher rate than their community representation (Cordner, Williams, &amp; Zuniga, 2000; Lamberth, 1996; Lange, Blackman, &amp; Johnson, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425734">Meehan &amp; Ponder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Petrocelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425734">Roh &amp; Robinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2004</xref>). The latter utilizes a “benchmarking” strategy that has proved to be problematic in part because of the challenges associated with accurately estimating the racial and ethnic characteristics of driving populations (Tillyer et al., 2009) and assumptions that officers accurately identify the race and ethnicity of the driver prior to encounter initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986211425734">Alpert, Dunham, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986211425734">Walker, 2001</xref>). The second officer-initiated decision-making point considers an officer’s application of formal sanctions or the exercise of coercion. Research from this decision-making point considers the propensity of racial and ethnic minorities to be warned, cited, arrested, and have force used against them (Engel, Calnon, &amp; Bernard, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425734">Novak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986211425734">Tillyer &amp; Engel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2006</xref>). The third decision-making point considers minority representation in searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425734">Gaines, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425734">Novak &amp; Chamlin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill, Mosher, &amp; Pratt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425734">Parker, Lane, &amp; Alpert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986211425734">Vito &amp; Walsh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425734">Williams &amp; Stahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425734">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986211425734">Zingraff, Mason, Smith, Tomaskovic-Devey, Warren, &amp; McMurray, 2000</xref>). An extension of this line of inquiry involves analyzing the contraband hit rate or outcome test during searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425734">Engel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986211425734">Knowles, Persico, &amp; Todd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425734">Persico &amp; Todd, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, racial profiling research indicates that minorities are more likely than Whites to be searched during their encounters with police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425734">Cox, Pease, Miller, &amp; Tyson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986211425734">Knowles et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986211425734">Langan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425734">Rojek, Rosenfeld, &amp; Decker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986211425734">Zingraff et al., 2000</xref>). However, these conclusions are based on inconsistent definitions of searches and have varied in terms of depth of analysis, making it difficult to make firm conclusions regarding the relationship between drivers’ race and/or ethnicity and the decision to search.</p>
<p>The current manuscript focuses on the third decision-making point. Using data collected by a large Midwestern police department, this research focuses on whether Black and Hispanic drivers were the subject of searches at a disparate rate to nonminorities. Furthermore, this manuscript also examines whether minorities are searched differentially—after controlling for other relevant factors that influence the decision to search—and after searches are disaggregated across dimensions of legal authority to search (e.g., encounters where officers enjoy a high-level of discretion compared to those in which they enjoy less discretion). In doing so, this research contributes to the overall understanding of the influence driver race and ethnicity has on the decision to search.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043986211425734">
<title>Race, Ethnicity, and the Decision to Search</title>
<p>A large national survey of citizens indicates that searches are relatively rare occurrences during automobile stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986211425734">Durose, Smith, &amp; Langan, 2007</xref>). Citizens report being searched in approximately 4.8% of all traffic stops. Furthermore, this survey indicated that the likelihood of a search varies by the race and ethnicity of the driver: 9.5% of Blacks and 8.8% of Hispanic/Latino drivers indicate being searched during traffic stops, whereas Whites reported being searched only 3.6% of the time. Yet simple descriptive statistics do not tell the whole story. Two critical elements must be considered when determining the presence of racial or ethnic bias in searches: whether minorities are searched at a disparate rate when considering different legal authority and whether minorities are searched at a higher rate net other explanatory factors.</p>
<p>Legal authority for searches varies and the government has the burden to support the initiation and scope of all searches. Thus, the level of discretion an officer enjoys is dependent on the legal rational of the search. For example, once a suspect has been arrested, officers may search an individual as an incident to the arrest, or if a vehicle is to be impounded, officers may search the vehicle to inventory its contents. Similarly, if an occupant of a vehicle is discovered to have an existing warrant(s), a search is permissible. Additionally, officers may conduct a search when they have probable cause to believe the vehicle or individual(s) within the vehicle possess contraband and this is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. Canines that alert officers of the presence of contraband would indicate probable cause of contraband possession. Officers also have the legal authority to conduct a search when contraband is observed in plain view. Furthermore, when officers have reasonable suspicion to believe a suspect or suspects to be dangerous, officers may conduct a “Terry” or pat-down search of the individual or individuals for the officers’ safety. Finally, officers may conduct a search if consent is given, irrespective of probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Each of these search types is ordered from least to most discretionary.</p>
<p>Simply recognizing that minorities are searched differentially is not enough. To demonstrate nonneutrality, it is necessary to determine whether searches occur when officers have the greatest discretion and subsequently, the lowest legal authority (e.g., during searches triggered by consent or mere reasonable suspicion).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043986211425734">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, identifying bias would be aided by controlling for other relevant legal or extralegal factors and add explanatory power to results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986211425734">Fridell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986211425734">Ramirez et al., 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986211425734">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986211425734">Lundman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425734">Novak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Petrocelli, 2001</xref>). Durose et al. (2009; p. 5) expounds on this issue:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[B]lacks were more likely than whites to be searched during a traffic stop. However, the apparent disparities documented in this report do not constitute proof that police treat people differently along demographic lines. Any of these disparities might be explained by countless other factors and circumstances that were not taken into account in the analysis.</p>

<p>Other police–public explanatory factors must be accounted for when examining whether there is bias in search behaviors.</p>

<title>Research on the Decision to Search</title>
<p>Previous examinations have reported that minorities were more likely to be the subject of searches. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425734">Smith and Petrocelli (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425734">Gaines (2006)</xref> reported that Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be searched than Whites but emphasized differences were not statistically significant. Officers also tend to initiate searches on drivers whom they had preexisting knowledge of, regardless of drivers’ race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986211425734">Vito &amp; Walsh, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425734">Williams and Stahl (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986211425734">Barnum and Perfetti (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425734">Withrow (2004)</xref> reported that Black and Hispanic drivers were significantly more likely to be searched, even after controlling for other explanatory factors, but did not consistently disaggregate searches by level of discretion or officer legal authority. Withrow went on to observe that searches appeared to more likely be conducted when citizens were under arrest (and the search was conducted as an incident to that arrest). He noted that minorities were more likely to be arrested, which could explain the high prevalence of minorities being searched overall. The temporal order of searches and arrests is not entirely clear and when search types are disaggregated across levels of discretion, the pattern of minorities searched becomes even more confusing. For example, a multiyear study concluded that Blacks were two times more likely to be searched than their White counterparts but when examining highly discretionary search conditions, Blacks were nearly as likely as Whites to be involved in consent searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425734">Scheb, Lyons, &amp; Wagers, 2009</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425734">Higgins et al. (2008)</xref> reported that Blacks and males were significantly more likely to be the subject of a police search, even after controlling for other relevant factors. In fact, they reported that Blacks were 28% more likely to be searched than non-Blacks. However, they noted that other nonracial factors were as or more explanatory in interpreting their results, concluding that “racial differences are not present for searches in the context of racial profiling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425734">Higgins et al., 2008</xref>; p. 37) and later goes on to question the utility of examining searches in the racial profiling context.</p>
<p>Additional examinations further underscore the importance of disaggregating automobile searches across legal authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425734">Smith and Petrocelli (2001)</xref> reported minorities were searched during 8.3 % of stops and Whites were searched in 7.1% of stops. They went on to note that these differences were nonsignificant and that Whites were more likely than Blacks to be the subject of a highly discretionary consent search than other types. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al. (2006)</xref> utilized multivariate modeling to examining search decisions and found that Blacks and Hispanics were significantly more likely to be searched in general, and that minorities were significantly more likely to be the subject of consent searches in particular. They observed that Black and Hispanic drivers were “more likely to be searched when stopped by the police, but these searches were more likely to be nondiscretionary in nature (e.g., incident to arrest or tow inventory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>; p. 200). Like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425734">Tillyer, Klahm, &amp; Engel, 2012</xref>), they too reported that age (young) and gender (male) were highly correlated with searches. They went on to state that without “broader contexts within which to interpret traffic stop data, these findings should not necessarily be viewed as evidence of impropriety on the part of the police. They do, however, suggest that outcomes are a function of more than one variable and future studies need to reflect this reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>; p. 202). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al. (2009</xref>) reported that Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be searched and that race and ethnicity significantly influences the decision to search, regardless of whether the search was characterized as high or low level of officer discretion. They too emphasized that numerous factors beyond race and ethnicity offered far more predictive value (e.g., age, gender, and other contextual factors).</p>
<p>Previous examinations do not demonstrate consistency in the nature, strength, or in some cases, the association of race and/or ethnicity in predicting searches. Furthermore, although research on racial profiling has proliferated in recent years, automobile searches remain an underdeveloped area of importance. By directing sustained attention to these issues, these analyses seek to better understand officer decision making during automobile stops. The current research follows the extant research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425734">Higgins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2004</xref>) by examining variations in the legal authority to search as well as utilizes multivariate modeling to control for contextual factors that influence the decision to search.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043986211425734" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The research strategy employed to gather, manage, and analyze officer decision making is in keeping with the quantitative research tradition. Although this study does not attempt to explain individual incidents of racial profiling, it does identify systemic issues where officers systematically used race and/or ethnicity in their decision making. By utilizing a large data set on police–citizen encounters, these analyses provide an aggregate look at automobile searches. Pursuant to Missouri Revised Statue (MRS) 590.650—the statue requiring law enforcement agencies to annually report indicators of racial profiling to the Missouri Attorney’s General Office—the Kansas City (Missouri) Police Department (KCPD) has surveyed traffic, car, and pedestrian encounters. The more than 1,400 sworn officers with the KCPD, report information associated with their encounters through field—utilizing mobile data terminals and personal digital assistants—and precinct reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986211425734">Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1043986211425734">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The KCPD conducted 122,209 stops in 2009 but many encounters were eliminated from the current analyses for a variety of reasons. Encounters where the driver was discovered to have an outstanding warrant are excluded from these analyses because they are highly correlated with searches. A search is axiomatic to the discovery of an outstanding warrant and we were primarily interested in examining police–public encounters where officers had greater discretion to conduct a search. Furthermore, pedestrian stops were also omitted from these analyses because the current study focuses on searches pursuant to vehicle stops. The third type of cases that were removed from the sample was nonpatrol officer cases. The police department’s organizational structure contains two types of officer assignments: “Patrol” and “Traffic.” Patrol officers service the community’s general needs and are the responders for calls for service (i.e., the 911 police responders) whereas traffic officers are free from calls for service and primarily enforce traffic regulations. In addition to differing in their organizational duties, traffic and patrol officers engage in different search patterns. Although searches by all officers are relatively rare events, patrol officers proportionately conducted nearly all searches. This is due in part to the fact that traffic officers are primarily tasked with enforcement of traffic laws and as such, rarely conduct searches. Subsequently, in practice (at least in this jurisdiction) officers assigned to traffic duties rarely exercise their discretion to engage in searches. Examining patrol officer encounters with the public provides a more appropriate sample of cases where officers are free to exercise their discretionary authority. The resulting data set contained 45,695 police–public encounters. Finally, a 10 % simple random sample was utilized to provide the appropriate statistical power to the forthcoming method of data analyses, resulting in 4,569 cases under analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043986211425734">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>This research utilizes a deductive approach to understanding the nature and quality of automobile searches. Three dichotomous dependent variables are used to understand the extent to which race and/or ethnicity influence an officer’s decision to engage in automobile searches. The first dependent variable measures whether any search occurred. Furthermore, typologies that identify instances of greater and lesser search discretion are also evaluated. The second dependent variable contrasts stops that involved nondiscretionary search responses (i.e., “Incident to Arrest” and “Inventory”) against discretionary search responses (i.e., “Consent,” “Drug Dog Alert,” “Odor of Drugs/Alcohol,” “Other,” “Plain View Contraband,” and “Reasonable Suspicion”) and instances where a search did not occur. The final dependent variable contrasts stops that involved discretionary search responses against nondiscretionary search responses and instances were a search did not occur.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this racial profiling research is to gauge the effects of driver race and/or ethnicity on the likelihood of being the subject of an automobile search. Two dummy variables were constructed to reflect this objective: (a) Black (<italic>Black/African American</italic> = 1, <italic>American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, White</italic>, and <italic>Other/Unknown</italic> = 0); and (b) Hispanic (<italic>Hispanic/Latino</italic> = 1, <italic>American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, White</italic>, and <italic>Other/Unknown</italic> = 0). It should be noted that the <italic>White</italic> categorical response accounts for the majority of the reference category responses in this data set.</p>
<p>Additionally, the drivers’ gender and age were distinguished from the impact of race and ethnicity. Due to the fact that males and younger citizens are overrepresented at every stage of the criminal justice process, it would be reasonable to deduce that the driver’s gender and age may induce a more coercive officer response independent of the influence of race and/or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986211425734">Barnum &amp; Perfetti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986211425734">Brown &amp; Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986211425734">Brown, Novak, &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986211425734">Mastrofski, Worden, &amp; Snipes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425734">Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986211425734">Paoline &amp; Terrill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickrill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425734">Scheb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425734">Tillyer et al., 2012</xref>). The gender of the driver was operationalized as <italic>Male</italic> = 1 and is referenced against <italic>Female</italic> = 0 responses. Additionally, two dummy variables were constructed out of the age categorical responses: (a) Age: Below 18 (ages <italic>below 18 years</italic> = 1, <italic>18-29, 30-39</italic>, and <italic>40 or above</italic> = 0); and (b) Age: Between 18 and 29 (ages <italic>18-29 years</italic> = 1, <italic>below 18, 30-39</italic>, and <italic>40 or above</italic> = 0). The reference category for both of the age dummy variables is drivers that are 30 years old and older.</p>
<p>The final driver demographic variable included in these analyses is the residency status of the driver. Residency status in the form of a states license plate is the most outwardly visible personal identifier with the potential to generate bias treatment. Subsequently, drivers who live outside the jurisdiction “may carry less political clout than do those who live within the city; thus, outsiders could represent to officers less risk of being criticized for disparate enforcement practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425734">Novak, 2004</xref>, p. 84). The residency status of the driver is operationalized as <italic>yes</italic> = 1 and is referenced against <italic>no</italic> = 0 responses.</p>
<p>In an effort to understand officer decision making across each of the dependent variables, several explanatory variables are included in these analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043986211425734">3</xref></sup> Six legal variables are included in these analyses. First, vehicle stops are categorized by officers as being “Traffic” or “Investigatory.” Traffic stops are encounters where a traffic regulation has been violated and the officer is ostensibly stopping the vehicle for this violation. Alternatively, investigatory stops function as part of a continuing investigation and are encounters where the driver, passenger(s), car, or combination of some or all entities is known by the police. In these situations, officers are stopping motorists because they (or their vehicles) fit the description of someone wanted for questioning by the police. Even though traffic and investigatory stops may be initiated under different pretenses of racial and/or ethnic biases, their poststop dispositions should be racially and/or ethnically neutral. Thus, the decision to search in both traffic and investigatory car stops remains a proactive decision made by officers. Stop type is operationalized as <italic>Investigatory</italic> = 1 and <italic>Traffic</italic> = 0.</p>
<p>In addition to the stop type, several control variables identifying the reason for initiating the stop are utilized. There are several highly discretionary violations that may be more indicative of officer pretextual motivations. Officers may indicate multiple responses when identifying six types of violations: Commercial Vehicle Equipment (CVE) violation, “Failure to Signal,” “Following too Close,” “Lane Violation,” “Other Moving Violation,” and “Speed” “Other Moving Violation” it will serve as the reference category for the remaining violations. Subsequently, five dummy variables were constructed out of these responses indicating whether the violation was present during the stop (<italic>yes</italic> = 1) or absent from the stop (<italic>no</italic> = 0).</p>
<p>Two environmental variables are utilized to control for the physical context of the stop. Police–citizen encounters on highways are typically the result of traffic violations. In addition to enforcing traffic codes, surface streets provide an extra opportunity for community engagement. As a result, the application of social control may be different on surface streets than on highways. A dummy variable was constructed out of these categorical responses to isolate surface street responses: <italic>City Street, County Road</italic>, and <italic>Other</italic> = 1, <italic>Interstate Highway, State Highway</italic>, and <italic>U.S. Highway</italic> = 0. An additional variable is utilized to control for the time of day in which the stop took place. Officers approach nighttime encounters with citizens with increased suspicion; hence, searches may be more prevalent during nighttime hours. A single dummy variable was constructed to identify nighttime hours: <italic>0:00-6:00</italic> and <italic>19:00-23:59</italic> = 1, <italic>6:01-18:59</italic> = 0.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Given the current state of the data and the fact that each of the variables is dichotomous, a sophisticated layered methodological approach is necessary. First, descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions and population percentages, provide a framework for understanding the data set and address how often automobile searches occur. Second, to evaluate the correlative relationship between race and ethnicity and each of the dependent variables, cross-tabulation and chi-square analyses are utilized. Third, bivariate correlations are presented comparing all independent variables. Finally, multivariate logistical regression will be utilized to estimate explanatory models that control for the effects of other variables. This statistical approach demonstrates the influence of race and ethnicity—net the influences of the other independent variables—at the various levels of discretion afforded to officers during automobile searches.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986211425734">Table 1</xref> provides the frequency distribution and population percentages for the sample. Of the 4,569 automobile stops in the sample, 525 or 11.5 % cases resulted in a search (overall). Additionally, on further disaggregation of searches into categories the sample yielded 282 (5.3%) nondiscretionary searches and 243 (6.2 %) discretionary searches. Furthermore, race and ethnic minorities comprise a preponderance of police–citizen encounters in the sample: Blacks were involved in 49.7 % of the automobile stops whereas Hispanics were involved in 5.6 % of the automobile stops. In addition to race and ethnicity, males (64.9 %), city resident (75.0 %), nighttime stops (60.1 %) and stops made on surface streets (88.8 %) comprise the majority of police–public encounters. Investigatory stops encompass 32.7% of the sample.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425734">Table 2</xref> explores the bivariate relationships of searches and the primary variables of concern; driver race and ethnicity. Each cross-tabulation demonstrates that the proportion of Blacks and Hispanics searched, including nondiscretionary and discretionary categories, exceeded the proportion of non-Blacks and non-Hispanics that were searched. The proportion of Blacks searched (12.8%) is greater than the proportion of non-Blacks searched (10.2%) and the chi-square test statistic (7.656) was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 threshold. Similarly, Blacks were more likely to be the subject of discretionary searches than non-Blacks (6.0% vs. 4.6%; χ<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043986211425734">2</xref></sup>=4.513, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, the observed proportion of Blacks involved in nondiscretionary searches was not significantly different than expected. In other words, Blacks were more likely to be the subject of searches overall and searches based on high levels of officer discretion (e.g., consent); however, race was unrelated to the occurrence of nondiscretionary searches (e.g., searches incident to arrest). Although the observed proportions of Hispanic drivers searched were higher than non-Hispanics (15.1% vs. 11.3%; 7.8% vs. 6.1%; 7.4% vs. 5.2%), none of these comparisons were significantly greater than expected. This preliminary analysis suggests that ethnicity is not significantly related to officers’ search behavior.</p>

<p>The bivariate relationships between exogenous variables are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043986211425734">Table 3</xref>. Although several variables are correlated to each other, none of these relations demonstrate the presence of harmful collinearity, suggesting it would be permissible to include them in the multivariate model-building process. Focusing on race and ethnicity, drivers identified as Black were positively correlated with age (19-29), residential status, nighttime stops and investigatory stops. Blacks were less likely to be stopped for following too close, lane violations and speeding and Blacks were less likely to be juveniles. Hispanic ethnicity was positively correlated with gender (male), juvenile status and investigatory stops, while like Blacks, ethnicity was negatively correlated with speeding violations.</p>

<p>Model B presents the results of the multivariate analysis where nondiscretionary searches were regressed on the predictor variables. Similarly, race and ethnicity was not observed to be related to nondiscretionary search behavior in Model B, which was expected due to the null relationships observed between race and ethnicity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986211425734">Table 2</xref>. However, there were several control variables that offered predictive value. Males (<italic>b</italic> = 0.536), investigatory stops (<italic>b</italic> = 1. 277) and following too close violations (<italic>b</italic> = 2.095) were predictive at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 threshold. When considering risk factors at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 threshold in Model B, lane violations (<italic>b</italic> = 1.002) and speed violations (<italic>b</italic> = −1.459) were also significant predictors. In addition to race and ethnicity, several other factors were observed to be unrelated to nondiscretionary searches and include driver age and residency status, time of day, street type, commercial vehicle violations, and failure to signal violations. Overall results from Model B were fairly consistent with results presented in Model A.</p>
<p>Finally, results of discretionary searches are presented in Model C. Neither race nor ethnicity was observed to be significantly related to discretionary search behavior. However, several of the control variables were risk factors. At the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 threshold, males (<italic>b</italic> = 1.191) and investigatory stops (<italic>b</italic> = 1.272) were significant predictors. Additionally, drivers between the age of 19 and 29 (<italic>b</italic> = 0.389), nighttime stops (<italic>b</italic> = 0.407) and failure to signal violations (<italic>b</italic> = 1.151) were significantly related to discretionary searches. Like the other models, drivers stopped for speeding violations were significantly less likely to be searched (<italic>b</italic> = −2.513; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In addition to race and ethnicity, several other factors were observed to be unrelated to discretionary searches and include driver’s age (below 18) and residency status, street type, and commercial vehicle, following too close and lane violations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics were overrepresented in nearly every aspect of the automobile searches. But the chi-square analyses of the cross-tabulations only revealed that the observed difference for Blacks and searches (overall) and discretionary searches was significantly different than expected; no significant difference was observed for Hispanics. Moreover, the influence of race and ethnicity differs in the final layer of analyses after controls were introduced. Although Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be the subject of search, the multivariate logistical regression analysis found that the influence of race and ethnicity was a nonsignificant predictor in each event. For Hispanics, the multivariate logistical regression analysis reinforces the null findings from the chi-square analyses. For Blacks, these results do not provide compelling evidence to suggest race could be used to predict a search. Furthermore, these results fail to identify any systemic racial and/or ethnic animus among the officers. Collectively the results indicate that searches were primarily a function of other contextual factors that surround the encounter. Although minorities were searched (overall) more often, including discretionary searches, it was not due to driver race or ethnicity but the differing circumstances under which the citizen encountered the officer. These results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425734">Higgins et al. (2008)</xref> findings and are incongruent to the “driving while black/brown” phenomenon that appears throughout the automobile racial profiling research literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043986211425734">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results deviate from the extant research because these results indicate a further diminishing influence of race and ethnicity for discretionary decisions. Several similar research endeavors reported other extra-legal, legal, contextual, or environmental factors were correlated with the decision to search <italic>in addition to</italic> driver’s race and/or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425734">Higgins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425734">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Petrocelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425734">Williams &amp; Stahl, 2008</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al. (2009</xref>, p. 20) stated that “age, sex and contextual factors are as good as—and perhaps better than—race as predictors of searches” and “factors in addition to race” increases the likelihood of arrest because officers may believe the driver is concealing contraband. Prior research emphasized the importance of considering other correlates of searches; however, the current results indicate a diminishing direct influence of race and ethnicity on searches. Blacks and to a lesser extent Hispanics, appear to be differentially involved in searches because police engage minorities under characteristics consistent with searches. Any racial and/or ethnic disparity observed in rudimentary analyses dissipates once proper controls are introduced into predictive models. There is little evidence presented here that suggests race or ethnicity is a meaningful correlate of the officers’ decision-making processes and the current research supports the position that this is due to minorities being overrepresented in automobile encounters whose contextual characteristics are associated with searches (including discretionary searches). We noted factors with the greatest explanatory influence on discretionary searches include stops involving males, those 19-29 years old (e.g., younger) and stops occurring at night. Race was highly correlated with age and nighttime stops, though not gender. Furthermore, investigatory stops were significantly more likely to include discretionary searches, which make sense given the fact that the basis for these stops is a function of an ongoing investigation. Investigatory stops were highly correlated with the driver being Black. Taken in totality, these results suggest that it is the social context of the stop, rather than the race or ethnicity of the driver, that primarily influences discretionary searches.</p>
<p>Although race and ethnicity were nonsignificant predictors in the multivariate logistical regression analysis, these results are not void of relevant implications. The perceived improper use of race and ethnicity places the legitimacy of any law enforcement agency in jeopardy. Thus, it is important for administrators of those agencies to be mindful of the impact racial profiling has without compromising law and order in the community. Individual law enforcement agents are the only persons who know when, if, and to what extent race and/or ethnicity was used lawfully within their policing procedures, they should be properly trained to “understand which specific verbal, behavioral and contextual clues are more successful than others in determining reasonable suspicion or probable cause” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986211425734">Engel &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; p. 615). Furthermore, law enforcement agents need to be trained to articulate why a stop was initiated and why the officer made the decisions they did. Even if officers are not actively engaged racially biased decision making, minorities may still perceive police to be acting in a biased manner. Although these result do not support those perceptions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986211425734">Alpert et al. (2007)</xref> contended that law enforcement agents need “training in proper communication [that] can help officers alleviate some potentially negative situations and turn others from a bad to a neutral or positive experience” (p. 52). Opening up a dialog with citizens stopped by the police is the first step toward breaking down inaccurate perceptions and increasing the legitimacy in law enforcement.</p>

<title>Future Analyses</title>
<p>Future analyses would benefit from considerations of variable interactions, organizational structures, neighborhood contexts, and a triangulation of sources. Also, future analyses should evaluate differences in search decisions across environmental contexts (e.g., divisions, sectors and beats) as well as across officer characteristics (e.g., officer race, gender and length of service, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425734">Tillyer et al., 2012</xref>). Though the level of aggregation becomes increasingly more difficult the further down a researcher drills into the data, there are some indications that organizational structures create workload and occupational norms that may impact individual officer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986211425734">Klinger, 1997</xref>). From a practical aspect, department administrators would benefit from analyses that address these issues. Additionally, future analyses should take into consideration the neighborhood context in which police–citizen encounters occur. Although this study includes a variable that identifies the physical location that the stop took place, further explorations into the influence of differing neighborhood contexts may be beneficial to understanding officer behavior. Differing neighborhood profiles may consider community social organization (e.g., area poverty rates, residential stability, and racial and ethnic heterogeneity), community structures (residential, commercial, and industrial), and community crime rates, which in turn impact search decisions during automobile encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425734">Novak &amp; Chamlin, 2008</xref>). Finally, future analyses would benefit from data triangulation among “police reported, citizen-reported and observer-reported data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986211425734">Lundman, 2004</xref>, p. 343; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425734">Paulhamus, Kane, &amp; Piquero, 2010</xref>). Single-source data explorations, such as this, are often riddled with invalidity, inconclusiveness and worst of all, biases. A triangulation of data sources would best inform stakeholders about the etiology of the racial profiling phenomenon.</p>

<p>Here we focus on whether bias exists in searching motorists across racial or ethnic classifications, which is one of several ways to examine search behavior. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425734">Smith and Alpert (2002)</xref> contended that the legal authority to engage in a search does not mean police will perform individual searches with the same depth and veracity in every situation. To address this issue, it may be prudent to determine whether the length of the stop varies by race or ethnicity and how long the motorist is delayed when a search is preformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986211425734">Batton &amp; Kadleck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2006</xref>). Also, it should be noted that engaging in a search does not necessarily amount to a “productive search” and that the validity of the search is not necessarily dependent on the contraband hit rate across races or ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425734">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425734">Engel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986211425734">Withrow, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The representation of dependent and independent variables within the sample is not significantly different than the population from which it was drawn (searches = 11.3%; nondiscretionary searches = 5.7%; discretionary searches; Black = 50.1%; Hispanic = 5.6%; male = 65.5%; under 18 = 3.3%; age 19-29 = 45.2%; city resident = 75.2%; nighttime stop = 60.3%; surface street = 88.4%; investigatory stop = 33.2%; CVE = &lt;.01%; failure to signal = 1.9%; following too close = 0.2%; lane violation = 3.2%; speeding = 11.7%). Additional 10% random samples were selected and we replicated the model building process on these new sets of data—the results of these new models mirrored those presented in this manuscript. These steps increased our confidence that the analyses conducted here were performed on a representative sample of the population.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1043986211425734">
<label>3.</label>
<p>It is acknowledged that these models are incomplete in that all influences on officer decision making are not included, primarily because officer-reported data are incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425734">Engel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1043986211425734">
<label>4.</label>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425734">Pickerill et al. (2009</xref>) noted other contextual factors are perhaps better than race when predicting search behavior. It should be noted that the results presented here differ in that our analyses do not reveal a direct impact of race or ethnicity on the decision to search, where they noted that race still directly impacts the likelihood of a search.</p>
