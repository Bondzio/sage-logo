<abstract>
<p>This article explores dynamic capability formation in new ventures examining technology commercialization at the microlevel of entrepreneurs’ actions and decisions. The research reflects a longitudinal, qualitative, multi-case study design to build theory. Findings reveal two interdependent micro-level patterns that reflect dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities. First, prospecting problems or the capacity to identify problems in industrial settings that a commercially untried technology might solve. Second, openly sharing technological features with prospective customers in order to jointly design prototype products. Revealing technology helped ensure new venture survival in contrast with conventional wisdom that links firm survival to the insulation and protection of technology. Moreover, micro-level patterns shaped macro-level change in venture/customer dyads and in related customer’ industries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The new venture creation process is recognized as fundamentally critical for global economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611431092">Harris, 2011</xref>). Early research into this process was predominantly conceptual and descriptive, generating development models that depicted a series of linear stages which began with an idea for a business and culminated in initial sales to customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611431092">Bhave, 1994</xref>) or profitability and growth beyond first sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611431092">Kazanjian and Drazin, 1990</xref>). Other research identified key activities and milestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611431092">Liao and Welsch, 2008</xref>) that potentially differentiated successful from unsuccessful start-up ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611431092">Carter et al., 1996</xref>). However, the empirical data suggests a richness and complexity to the venture creation process that was not captured by prevailing development models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611431092">Rasmussen, 2011</xref>). More recent work illustrates these complexities when describing entrepreneurs as improvisers who enact multiple development model stages simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611431092">Evers and O’ Gorman, 2011</xref>), or users of bricolage who omit development model stages such as resource-seeking and information-gathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611431092">Barney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611431092">Di Domenico et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, entrepreneurial actors are described as effectuators who negotiate with prospective customers to design products without first having a goal to found a particular business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611431092">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611431092">Corner and Ho, 2010</xref>). Similarly, non-linear approaches to the venture creation process portray multiple sub-processes converging to form a new venture thereby, calling into question the singular, unitary process of development models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611431092">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>). The process complexities revealed to date are only the tip of the iceberg when considering the diversity reflected in new ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611431092">Barney et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our purpose is to extend the research on the sub-processes involved in the venture creation process. In particular, we focus on that which the strategic management literature argues is crucial to new venture survival and entrepreneurs’ ability to reap the benefits of their innovations: dynamic capability development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>). Dynamic capabilities have been defined as specific processes (i.e. product development, alliancing) by which managers configure and reconfigure their resource base to ensure at least a temporary competitive advantage relative to rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>). Most research on dynamic capabilities explores these processes in established firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>), examining how incumbent firms with an existing competitive advantage could sense and seize opportunities and mitigate threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611431092">Teece, 2007</xref>). Thus, more research on the dynamic capabilities in younger, emerging ventures and, in particular, the processes whereby these important capabilities are born and nurtured, is now required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, we build on the extant literature utilizing the notion of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities to provide a framework for exploring dynamic capabilities in the new venture context. We define dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities as the capacities that entrepreneurs use to identify, amass, integrate and potentially reconfigure resources as needed in the creation of new ventures. Such an approach is consistent with the more granular view of dynamic capabilities, where dynamic managerial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611431092">Adner and Helfat, 2003</xref>) and dynamic marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611431092">Bruni and Verona, 2009</xref>) capabilities for large established firms have been proposed. Given the lack of research on dynamic capabilities in emerging ventures, we implement an inductive study that addresses the question: ‘How do entrepreneurs develop dynamic capabilities in the process of creating a new venture?’</p>
<p>The context for this study is nascent entrepreneurship and the commercialization of new technologies generated within a research laboratory. We adopt a micro-process view, focusing on entrepreneur decision making and behaviour, in order to build theory from longitudinal, qualitative evidence collected within a multi-case study design. The study also reflects practitioner engagement in forming research questions, ensuring the veracity of data, selecting frameworks for analysis and interpreting findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). In addition, our contribution moves beyond illustrating dynamic entrepreneurial capability development as an important sub-process in new venture formation. First, the findings illuminate the genesis of dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611431092">Hart and Dowell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611431092">Maritan and Peteraf, 2011</xref>) – an important consideration, given that longer term capabilities are shaped by their beginnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611431092">Garud et al., 2010</xref>). This genesis illustrates the idiosyncratic nature of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities thus, offering a potential explanation for the differential survival rates for new ventures and suggesting a source of firm heterogeneity that gives rise to competitive advantage, a central tenet of the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Second, the reported micro-level patterns help illustrate the relatively unexamined micro-foundations at the heart of the dynamic RBV of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611431092">Barney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611431092">Coff and Kryscynski, 2011</xref>). These micro-foundations potentially elucidate processes through which an entrepreneur’s actions and decisions aggregate into a collective outcome such as a new firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611431092">Foss, 2011</xref>) which, in turn, can create new or transform existing industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005</xref>). As such, this research implies a link between the dynamic RBV of the firm and the process of industry transformation, as theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611431092">Schumpeter (1976)</xref>.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section3-0266242611431092">
<title>Venture creation process</title>
<p>Initial studies of this process were predominantly conceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611431092">Liao et al., 2005</xref>) and described development models wherein founders progressed through a series of linear stages to create a business. Alternatively, venture creation has been explored from the point of activities engaged in, and milestones achieved by, founders including an entrepreneur’s time commitment, hiring new employees and receipt of external funding. This research identified activities that differentiated actual founders from the wider group of potential founders with ideas that never fully developed into a venture. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611431092">Reynolds and Miller (1992)</xref> investigated the number of activities undertaken and the amount of time between them, reporting that the probability that a nascent entrepreneur will fail to establish a business decreases as the number of business ‘gestation’ activities increases. Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611431092">Reynolds and Miller (1992)</xref> also concluded that the venture founding process involved many combinations of sequences not captured by development models.</p>
<p>While development and activity models have advanced understanding of new venture creation, they reflect limitations, as such models assume a linear process. However, empirical findings yield very limited support for the linear model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611431092">Liao and Welsch, 2008</xref>). More recent work conveys the non-linear, iterative, messy process of venture emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611431092">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611431092">Vohora et al. (2004)</xref> found that new ventures emerged through a series of phases but that each involved an iterative, non-linear process of development in which there was often a need to revisit prior decisions and activities. Other scholars have theorized three process notions that convey this non-linear messy process of venture emergence: first, improvisation, defined as founders planning and acting simultaneously, not in sequence as suggested by development models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611431092">Baker et al., 2003</xref>). Second, bricolage, which involves entrepreneurs eliminating the resource-seeking stage of development models and making do with resources already at hand when pursuing opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611431092">Baker, et al., 2003</xref>). Third, effectuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy, 2008</xref>), which is similar to bricolage in that nascent entrepreneurs start with the means at hand but not with the goal of founding a particular business. Finally, non-linear modelling principles have been applied to the venture creation process which imply that there are many layers to organizing and that multiple smaller processes often interact, transform and converge into an overarching form such as a new firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611431092">Boisot and McKelvey, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611431092">Lichtenstein et al. (2006)</xref> encourage researchers to consider sub-processes that may contribute to the emergence of a new venture. Thus, we suggest dynamic capability development as a crucial sub-process in venture creation.</p>

<sec id="section4-0266242611431092">
<title>Dynamic capabilities</title>
<p>The notion of dynamic capabilities grew from the RBV of the firm, which analyses a venture as a bundle of resources that is unique, relative to other firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>). In particular, dynamic capabilities extend the RBV to dynamic markets where competitive landscapes are continually shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611431092">Teece et al., 1997</xref>). In such markets dynamic capabilities are crucial because they enable the enhancement and reconfiguration of existing resource bundles and capabilities, such that firms can sustain competitive advantage or create a series of temporary competitive advantages in the face of an ever-changing environment. Various definitions of dynamic capabilities have been suggested; for example, Helfat et al. build on prior research with their definition, noting that ‘a dynamic capability is the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base’ (2007: 4). In addition, there has been an increasing focus on a more granular view of dynamic capabilities, emphasizing key aspects of this phenomenon. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611431092">Adner and Helfat (2003)</xref> introduce the concept of dynamic managerial capabilities that reflect the interactions among managerial human capital, social capital and cognition thereby, representing an important subset of wider dynamic capabilities that may explain in part, firm heterogeneity and variability in firm performance.</p>
<p>We contribute to this more granular understanding of dynamic capabilities by exploring dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities defined as the capacities that entrepreneurs use to identify, amass, integrate and reconfigure the resources needed in the creation of new ventures. This definition is consistent with research showing that venture creation is not a unique act but occurs over time through a number of phases, requiring an entrepreneurial capability to change the venture over time through reconfiguring resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611431092">Vohora et al., 2004</xref>). It is also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611431092">Helfat et al. (2007)</xref>, who suggest that dynamic capabilities include the capacity to create a resource base, not just to modify and extend resource configurations.</p>
<p>Dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities are embodied in the entrepreneur in the new venture context, just as managers are said to embody the dynamic managerial capabilities in established ventures (Adner and Helfat; 2003). Although conceptual research acknowledges that dynamic capabilities can be used entrepreneurially to create (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>) or shape markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611431092">Teece, 2007</xref>), the bulk of research focuses on large, established firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>). As such, little is known about these capabilities in younger firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611431092">Sapienza et al., 2006</xref>) and emerging ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611431092">Newbert, 2005</xref>) – those firms predominantly responsible for creating and shaping markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy, 2008</xref>). New designs and new technology can emerge endogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611431092">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>). The notion of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities captures the capacities needed for this creative process in the new venture context where, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611431092">Santos and Eisenhardt (2009)</xref>, markets are unformed, customers are unknown and product attributes are yet to be revealed. Accordingly, our focus is on the dynamic capabilities needed for endogenously creating and effectuating opportunities within a new venture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy et al., 2003</xref>), rather than those abilities incumbent organizations might use to discover or sense opportunities exogenous to firms, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611431092">Teece (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, dynamic capability research has developed through the analysis of the micro-foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611431092">Teece, 2007</xref>) or micro-processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611431092">Barney et al., 2011</xref>) underlying such capabilities. However, we contend that the micro-processes within new ventures are likely to be different from incumbent firms, as they are embodied in the entrepreneur and reflected in their actions and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611431092">Vohora et al., 2004</xref>). As such, exploration of micro-processes in the new venture context could help to explain heterogeneity in dynamic capabilities across new ventures. Moreover, exploration of the micro-processes in new ventures is likely to illuminate the genesis of dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611431092">Hart and Dowell, 2011</xref>). Emerging firms must decide what resources to amass and how to configure them to create customer value in a context of uncertainty regarding the end product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611431092">Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>). These situations reflect dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities that are patterned but also simple, experiential and iterative – useful for creating situation-specific knowledge instead of relying on existing knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>Given the lack of associated research, the study employs inductive enquiry suitable for under-researched and poorly understood phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007</xref>). Also, induction is appropriate for examining process research questions such as the ‘how’ question framing this study, and is particularly suitable for the ‘how’ questions pertaining to dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611431092">Helfat et al., 2007</xref>). We implemented a longitudinal design reflecting multiple cases of a focal event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611431092">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001</xref>). Focal events were ‘customer creation episodes’, wherein entrepreneurs attempted to attract customers by developing the commercial applications of a proprietary technology tailored to each customer’s unique production processes. Customer creation episodes made useful cases as securing initial customers is a milestone separating emerged from potential ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611431092">Liao et al., 2005</xref>). Multiple cases enabled a replication logic wherein each case was treated as an experiment and used to test emerging theoretical insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611431092">Yin, 2003</xref>). Additionally, the research design incorporates practitioner engagement in that entrepreneurs engaged in research question development, evidence collection and analysis, and interpretation of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). Such first-hand experience informs theory development as it suggests relationships that would go undetected without intimate knowledge of the studied phenomenon, particularly emergent phenomena. Consistent with practitioner engagement, we adopt a philosophical perspective that is captured most closely by critical realism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Research setting</title>
<p>The research setting was Shanghai Advanced Materials (SAM),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242611431092">1</xref></sup> a technology-based, family venture started in 1996 by a married couple. We chose a single organization to examine because dynamic capabilities are situation- or context-specific, tailored to the organizational setting in which they function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611431092">Helfat et al., 2007</xref>). As such, the single organizational setting helped to eliminate possible extraneous influences from other organizational contexts in our observations of dynamic capabilities. The entrepreneurs had an innovative new ceramic material initially developed by the husband in his role as a research scientist for a state-owned institute in China. The material, known as ‘TFC’, initially possessed two unique properties: it could endure abrupt changes in temperature from 20 to 1700 degrees Celsius and could withstand abrasion from contact with fluid moving at high speed. SAM successfully commercialized TFC and thus, offered a unique setting for theorizing about dynamic capabilities as the company commercialized a research-based technology which required development of specific capabilities to identify viable applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611431092">Vohora et al., 2004</xref>). The practical realities of commercializing a laboratory-based technology are so challenging that a fledgling venture with such intellectual property often outsources the development of actual products and markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611431092">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>), but SAM kept this development in-house. Conditions were encouraging for technology entrepreneurship in China when SAM was founded, given the changes in China’s political and economic environment in the early 1990s. Specifically, the intellectual property system formally came into being, thereby encouraging the commercialization of laboratory-based technologies by private organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611431092">Baark, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated previously, cases were customer creation episodes where each represented an attempt by SAM to create a customer for the fledgling business by developing a commercial application of its TFC technology that would improve the customer’s product or manufacturing process. These six cases were chosen because they cumulatively reflect SAM achieving the phase of sustainable returns – the fifth and final phase of venture emergence identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611431092">Vohora et al. (2004)</xref>. After the sheet metal case (the last case chronologically, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611431092">Table 1</xref>), SAM entered a growth phase wherein dynamic capabilities were likely to be qualitatively different from capabilities in venture emergence. The cases were the unit of analysis and enabled generalization to patterns across cases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611431092">Table 1</xref> provides expanded detail on the six cases.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from four sources. First, chronologies of key data were constructed for each case; this is consistent with existing research focused upon new venture processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611431092">Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>). Second, data were collected through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven (2007)</xref> calls ‘conversations’ with the entrepreneurs consistent with our practitioner engagement approach and which helps to identify the participant’s view of a phenomenon. Data-gathering sessions are considered conversations instead of interviews, given the interactive engagement between researcher and practitioner that is a hallmark of engaging practitioners in the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). The background of the SAM personnel providing data is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242611431092">Table 2</xref>. Conversations averaged 1.25 hours and were conducted over 18 months with a total of 18 interchanges. Conversations fell into two main categories: rich narrative description of SAM’s emergence as a viable venture, and analytical sessions wherein the researchers and entrepreneurs participated in shaping research questions, considering the applicability of concepts from the literature to the cases, identifying concepts appropriate for data analysis and reviewing and altering findings where appropriate. Third, data were obtained via email correspondence between the first author and one partner. Some 50 emails provided substantive data that further elaborated and clarified details regarding both narrative and analytical conversations. Fourth, archival data was used, including files on all of the research and development (R&amp;D) trials conducted in each case. These documents added rich detail to the customer creation episodes that ultimately developed SAM’s capabilities and a series of new product markets. Archival data was collected at the same time as events unfolded, helping to eliminate any potential bias due to the retrospective study design.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>We began with constructing individual case histories using the chronologies provided and data gathered from the narrative conversations. Case histories were validated through email correspondence with the respondents and analysed through the lens of our research question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611431092">Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>): ‘How do entrepreneurs develop dynamic capabilities in the process of creating a new venture?’ The analytical goal was to identify theoretical constructs and patterns within each case with respect to the research question. We used tables and other analytical devices to facilitate analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611431092">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>We then undertook cross-case analysis wherein insights from each case were compared to those from other cases in order to identify consistent patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007</xref>). Comparisons were made initially between pairs of cases, but as patterns emerged other cases were added to develop robust theoretical concepts and patterns. We noted discrepancies and agreements in the emerging patterns and investigated further by returning to the data, or by discussion in the analytical conversations with the entrepreneurs. As is appropriate for inductive theory building, we moved between emerging findings, the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007</xref>) and entrepreneur insight providing an insider’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611431092">Garud et al., 2010</xref>). Cross-case analysis produced patterns from customer creation episodes which we present in the following section.</p>

<title>Simultaneously creating capabilities, customers and macro-level changes</title>
<p>Analysis of the qualitative evidence suggested two overlapping micro-level patterns whereby the entrepreneurs identified, amassed, integrated and reconfigured resources for the new venture as well as simultaneously created customers for SAM: prospecting problems and revealing technology. The following sections depict these micro-process patterns in detail, illuminating the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of conventional development stages or activities in the new venture creation process. These micro-level patterns also show why and how SAM created certain customers, modified its production processes and the TFC technology and, finally, how SAM and several of its customers ultimately transformed two industries.</p>

<title>Micro-process pattern 1: Prospecting problems</title>
<p>SAM’s entrepreneurs faced nascent markets, which are ambiguous environments with unknown customers, unrevealed product attributes and unclear value chains. Confronted with this ambiguity, the entrepreneurs did not begin with product prototypes but first looked for potential customers who had problems that SAM might solve with TFC. A dynamic capability of prospecting problems emerged as SAM identified potential customers across the six cases. The evidence shows that the entrepreneurs used three mechanisms when prospecting problems as displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>:</p>

<p>Precise definitions of these mechanisms are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref> as well as documentation of how mechanisms emerged in each case. The mechanisms aggregated to reflect a pattern; a dynamic capability of prospecting for industries that had quality or cost issues which TFC might resolve (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>, first row in ‘outcomes’ column).</p>

<p>The glass bottle case provides an example of the product purity/quality mechanism underlying the prospecting problems of the micro-process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>). It was suggested that applying TFC to glass bottle production would be appropriate as this glass exhibited high levels of impurities due to the refractories used in the production process. The entrepreneurs discussed the issue with engineers from the glass bottling industry, and decided that this purity/quality problem was a good match to TFC’s technical properties because TFC worked well in high-speed fluid environments such as glass moulding. Moreover, the ceramic nature of TFC would not interact with molten glass, so impurities could be excluded. This matching of quality issues to TFC’s technical properties suggested a likely prospect for SAM and prototype refractories were developed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We heard about the impurities in glass bottles that came from the manufacturing process and we told them about the two properties of TFC. The manufacturer thought it was promising and gave TFC refractories a chance for trial use in their production line. It seemed like a good match. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second mechanism, identification of cost issues, is seen in the solar panels case (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>). The head of a small company that made solar panels containing glass tubes contacted the entrepreneurs after receiving a letter that SAM had mailed to all glass manufacturers listed in the Yellow Pages. The solar panel producer was in a niche specialty glass industry at the time, because the price of panels for the end user was very high due to high production costs. The entrepreneurs discussed the potential of TFC’s properties to lower the solar panel producer’s manufacturing costs, and it was felt that there was a good match between TFC’s properties and the prospective customer’s cost issues, so prototyping ensued. It was suggested that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the solar panel company wanted to build a new factory with higher volume production but it had to be very efficient, high volume for low cost, and they couldn’t do that with the technology they had been using. That’s why they were prepared to look at TFC. (Derong, female entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A third mechanism was openness to applying TFC in any Chinese industry that made sense (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>); this contrasts with the entrepreneurial behaviour envisioned by the rational/economic model of entrepreneurship wherein the entrepreneur discovers an opportunity in one particular industry and develops a product to exploit it. The challenge for SAM was to identify industries that were a likely match for the properties of the new technology. As such, the entrepreneurs were not sensing how technologies exogenous to the firm might evolve, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611431092">Teece (2007)</xref> describes for incumbent firms; instead, they were effectuating products endogenously by identifying the promising applications of their laboratory-created TFC technology. The following quote illustrates this openness and the effectual approach they used to create products:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We saw so many directions to go with TFC, we needed to narrow down where and how. We needed to work with a possible customer to find something doable as well as profitable – we learned a lot from customers. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The entrepreneurs became aware of potential industry applications in two ways. One was through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611431092">Baker et al. (2003)</xref> call ‘network bricolage’, a process wherein entrepreneurs rely on contacts they already have when founding a new venture. The entrepreneurs made use of a number of contacts through friendship, university colleagues and existing professional networks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611431092">Table 1</xref>). In addition, they became aware of potential customers through generating new contacts by attending industry and trade shows, and through mailings to companies in the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p>There was variability across cases in the mechanisms used to identify the problems that SAM might solve (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>). Not all prospective customers had quality/purity issues; the solar tube manufacturer and petroleum mining company did not have quality issues, although they both had cost issues, making them worthy of SAM’s consideration. Similarly, the art glass company case was not concerned with cost issues as it had product quality issues; it needed very pure glass to sell for artwork. The importance of such purity to the art glass producer is illustrated in this comment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She was from Taiwan, setting up a workshop in Shanghai specializing in high-end pieces of glass art. After hearing about TFC properties as well as our successful trial in glass bottle manufacturing, she told us that in art the competition is on how things look, and said she didn’t care how much it cost – just make her art pieces look crystal-clear. (Derong, female entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The micro-process of prospecting problems illustrates a pattern of activities that gave SAM a capacity for coping with the uncertainty of nascent markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611431092">Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009</xref>), what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611431092">Hamel and Prahalad (1994)</xref> called ‘white space’: the unarticulated, unserved needs of customers. The entrepreneurs began with no ideas for TFC products, but engendered a dynamic capability for exploring possible products by prospecting problems that TFC could solve. The evidence shows that prospecting involved patterned behaviour on SAM’s part which included being open to and identifying customers with product/quality or cost issues that TFC could resolve. As such, SAM was able to narrow the territory in the white space and pursue ideas which had a better than random chance of creating a customer for its commercially untried TFC technology. This narrowing of white space shaped decisions regarding which specific resources to identify, amass and integrate within SAM. Four of the six customers identified through this prospecting problems micro-process became customers following the successful design and testing of a prototype (i.e. all but the glass bottle manufacturers and petroleum mining).</p>
<p>This micro-process also illuminates the ‘how’ of customer identification for nascent ventures. Customer identification has been something of a black box, in that researchers have known that this important activity happens, but have relatively little insight regarding how. Finally, this micro-process demonstrates a reversal in the typical stages of development models, in that customers were identified before product prototypes were developed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We had to collaborate with customers, we simply couldn’t do it without them … before working with customers, TFC was just a material, not a product, we had to work with them to make it into products. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This lends additional support to the notion that the venture creation process incorporates many complexities not reflected in the broad, linear stages of development models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611431092">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0266242611431092">
<title>Microprocess pattern 2: Revealing technology</title>
<p>SAM faced substantial challenges regarding product development, given that TFC was untried outside of the laboratory and potential customers had already-established production processes. Any product that SAM developed needed to solve customer problems convincingly in order to ensure adoption by the customer and life-sustaining revenue for the new venture. Our evidence suggests that SAM initiated a revealing technology micro-process that was refined over time as it progressed through the six different cases presented in the current study. Revealing technology involved the three mechanisms presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref>. Collectively, these mechanisms constituted a pattern, a dynamic capability revealing properties of TFC and adapting this technology to potential customer contexts, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref> (see ‘outcomes’ column).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The data show three mechanisms underlying the micro-process pattern of revealing technology that ultimately created products for SAM. These mechanisms are demonstration of TFC’s properties, making sense of customer context, and joint design and testing of prototypes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref>). The first mechanism, demonstration of TFC’s properties, involved sharing detailed information about TFC’s properties once SAM had identified a prospective customer. Specifically, SAM presented data on the trials of these properties so that potential customers would be convinced of TFC’s performance; the chemical formula of TFC was not shared, but the firm did provide in-depth information regarding its properties and extensive reports that charted TFC’s performance. A quote from the marketing manager shows how much SAM revealed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We shared almost everything about TFC with customers when we were discussing possibilities – only the chemical formula was kept as a trade secret. (Jian, marketing manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This information-sharing was a risk for SAM, as it opened up the possibility for imitating TFC, a proprietary technology. Such a risk was calculated as a necessity to develop products that truly addressed customer problems.</p>
<p>Arguably, the best example of the demonstration of TFC’s properties mechanism is seen in the sheet metal case. After becoming aware of this prospective customer, SAM shared the proprietary information about its TFC material with the sheet metal engineers as well as the tests that validated these properties. This was a necessary first step in designing a TFC product that potentially could solve this prospective customer’s key problem (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Table 3</xref>, purity/quality issue column). The customer’s engineers needed this knowledge in order to design a prototype TFC roller that could solve the problem:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We weren’t sure if we could solve this problem at first, but the customer really needed help, seriously. We spent a lot of time telling them about TFC’s properties and why it might work for their situation in theory. Then we ran a lot of tests to be sure that the metal wouldn’t adhere to TFC and it didn’t, so that gave us the confidence to move on to the next stage. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second mechanism is ‘making sense of customer context for TFC’. This is defined as the customer sharing information regarding the production context so that the entrepreneur and customer achieve a shared understanding of how TFC could be implemented. A good example was the TV tube manufacturer: the senior engineer for this company provided extensive information regarding tube production so that SAM gained the knowledge necessary to customize TFC for the production line temperature and mechanical structure used by the manufacturer. SAM also gained important knowledge regarding the necessary quality of glass to facilitate production of large TV tubes that could expand the domestic Chinese market. As such, the entrepreneurs had comprehensive knowledge that enabled them to customize TFC for the TV tube producer:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In working with the TV tube customer, we gained some good knowledge about electronic glass manufacture application for TFC – a big step for the advancement of the TFC technology – and this is all thanks to the support from the customer. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The final mechanism within the revealing technology micro-process was ‘joint design and testing of prototypes’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref>). Prototype design and testing was undertaken once SAM had communicated TFC’s properties and the customer had revealed information regarding its production processes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref> provides detail regarding how the design and testing of prototypes was undertaken and who was involved across all six cases. Generally, this mechanism was enacted jointly by SAM and the customer, although the data show variability in this mechanism. For example, there was minimal design and testing for the TFC product (refractories) sold to art glass producers as the prototype developed for glass bottle makers worked well for art glass producers, while there was intensive joint prototype design and testing in both the solar panel and sheet metal cases. Importantly, the costs of this joint prototyping and testing were shared by the prospective customer in three of the cases, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611431092">Table 1</xref> (solar panel tubes, TV tubes and sheet metal). Joint design and testing, especially the shared investment in these activities by SAM and prospective customers, is consistent with the idea of negotiated commitments between entrepreneurs and customers reflecting effectuation logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy, 2008</xref>). Current empirical evidence also corroborates effectuation arguments that these negotiated commitments manifest products that neither the entrepreneur nor the customer had originally envisioned. A good example of such a product is the TFC rollers fashioned by SAM to fix the product quality issues of the sheet metal producer. SAM had never envisioned making rollers from TFC, and the sheet metal producer had never envisioned using rollers made of ceramic material.</p>
<p>There was variability across cases in the other two mechanisms within the revealing technology micro-process, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref>. For example, SAM demonstrated TFC minimally to the art glass producers because a viable product already existed through the work with the glass bottle makers. However, extensive description and documenting of TFC’s properties was necessary for other cases such as the solar panel tubes and TV tubes. Demonstrating the TFC required for the TV tube case is summarized as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was quite a big challenge for SAM to explain the technology to this customer because we had to get into the science of it. They had a real severe problem to solve. We are glad we resolved the problem, for them and for SAM’s future as well. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, there was minimal dialogue required to make sense of customer context in the art glass case because of the existence of a usable TFC product. However, the sheet metal case required extensive dialogue and interaction in order to make sense of the customer context, which was very different from other customers. The challenge faced in the sheet metal case is evident here:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We knew little about metallic material technologies and we knew, right from the start, that solving the knurl problem was going to be a long, hard journey – but the customer really needed the help, and it was a chance for TFC to create value for a whole new industry. (Yin, male entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, the micro-process of revealing technology shows patterned behaviour that reflects SAM’s capacity for identifying, amassing and integrating a key resource that it needed to develop commercially viable applications of TFC – knowledge. SAM revealed much about TFC to prospective customers in order to convince them of its potential. The revealing technology micro-process was an unexpected finding, given the traditional view of technology as the core of an organization that needs insulating and buffering from the external environment. This view is echoed in the RBV of the firm, which sees technology as a valuable resource that needs protection from imitation. In contrast with this traditional view, SAM revealed its technology, sharing commercially sensitive information about TFC with prospective customers.</p>
<p>Revealing technology was a two way-street: as mentioned previously, the evidence shows a pattern of prospective customers revealing much about their production processes in order to provide SAM with the knowledge needed to develop TFC applications for these processes. As such, the knowledge needed to develop viable products was a jointly developed by a dyad: SAM and a customer. The marketing manager alludes to the dyad:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [customers] learned about TFC, we learned about them – working together, we developed TFC into material solutions for their problems. (Jian, marketing manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This finding resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611431092">Dyer and Singh’s (1998)</xref> notion of inter-firm knowledge-sharing routines as a mechanism whereby dyads can generate profits that neither firm could generate singly. Current findings corroborate the notion of inter-firm knowledge-sharing but extend this to the context of new venture emergence wherein entrepreneurs are trying to generate initial customers. Our findings show a pattern of customers having a pivotal role in technology commercialization: they helped the entrepreneurs design products that the customers would want to purchase. Such action lends support to a notion of agency not restricted to the entrepreneur, but distributed across multiple actors. The present evidence shows why potential customers partnered with SAM; they improved product quality, lowered costs and increased product diversity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref>). In sum, the evidence points to technology commercialization as a collective process that is beyond the single entrepreneur; a single insight so often assumed in entrepreneurship research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611431092">Dimov, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Micro-processes converging, generating dyadic and industry-level effects</title>
<p>Together, the micro-process patterns of prospecting problems and revealing technology converged to support an overarching dynamic entrepreneurial capability of product development for SAM. Established firms usually implement product development capabilities through cross-functional teams wherein team members have diverse skills and are buffered from external contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611431092">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>). The current findings extend knowledge of product development capabilities to the emerging venture context, wherein entrepreneurs attempted to effectuate a market for an endogenous commercially untried technology. As such, the entrepreneurs constructed processes whereby they could endogenously evolve the TFC technology in conjunction with potential customers, building up the opportunities for TFC proactively from the inside, rather than in response to an external influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611431092">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>). In this way, the evidence supports the emerging view in the entrepreneurship literature that opportunities can be created through entrepreneur action over time, as opposed to being prompted by exogenous forces that get noticed by entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast with established firms, product development was enacted by teams with both internal and external members (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">Table 4</xref>), with external members providing crucial knowledge regarding the context within which any TFC-based product would be used. External members enhanced SAM’s absorptive capacity and its ability to acquire and assimilate knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611431092">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>). Micro-process convergence also generated customers. In contrast with development models of new venture creation, the current evidence shows that entrepreneurs identified customers before developing products and worked with prospective customers to ensure that products ideally suited the customer’s manufacturing processes. Product development and customer creation unfolded simultaneously from negotiated agreements between entrepreneurs and prospective customers, consistent with effectuation logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, the longitudinal evidence also shows that micro-process convergence manifested effects at more macro-levels. In particular, data show that micro-processes – patterns of actions and decisions by individuals such as the entrepreneurs and key personnel from prospective customers – created effects for higher level structures which, in turn, stimulated change at even more macro-levels such as industries. These are the cross-level emergence effects often theorized, but rarely illustrated empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611431092">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>). We found micro-process patterns engendering effects at the level of dyads formed by SAM and a series of customers, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref>. The dyads, in turn, wrought industry-level changes, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref> summarizes changes that resulted from the patterns unfolding through the series of dyadic relationships that SAM formed with prospective customers. Reading down the column labelled ‘SAM’, the reader can see the changes wrought as it evolved from a nascent venture with no product through to a more established venture with an emerging reputation for solving problems. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref> shows SAM gaining four customers through the multiple products successfully developed by the dyads. Importantly, the SAM column shows two other ways in which the emerging venture was transformed by the micro-processes interacting through a series of dyadic relationships. The first is seen in the petroleum mining case, where SAM modularized its production process to cope with the product diversity brought on by trying to generate another customer. This is an example of the ‘reconfiguring’ resources element of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities. In addition, modularization is an example of a dynamic capability, with product development bringing about changes in a substantive capability – the production of TFC products. The current empirical evidence supports the conjectured relationship between dynamic and substantive capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>), and illustrates how the relationship unfolded for an emerging venture. The second way in which SAM was transformed was through changes in the TFC technology itself. Specifically, TFC gained two important properties to extend the original two properties through experimentation in order to meet the needs of the TV tube manufacturer and the sheet metal producer. These properties were ‘application in a compact environment’ and ‘not allowing other metals to anchor on it’, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref>). TFC’s expanded properties empirically extend the transformation potential theorized in effectuation logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy, 2008</xref>) beyond products into the technology behind the products. The inventor of TFC had never envisioned the additional properties that were added to the technology; the ‘revealing technology’ micro-process and customer commitment added value to TFC and to SAM.</p>
<p>In reading down the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref>, the reader sees the transformations wrought for customers that formed dyadic relationships with SAM. The changes summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref> are reflected and extended in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref>, which specifically outlines the micro-processes of prospecting problems and reveals technology coalescing into an overarching product development capability. This engendered effects at the dyad level (as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref>), which fed back into the micro-processes (as depicted by the feedback loop in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref>). An example of this feedback is seen in the first case: initially the glass bottle manufacturer did not become a customer despite SAM’s successful fabrication and testing of TFC refractories, because glass purity was not a crucial issue for this company. However, the entrepreneurs refined the prospecting problems pattern based on this experience, and looked for a customer for whom glass purity was a vital issue:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We learned a lesson from our experience with the glass bottle makers: their top management did not perceive a real need for pure glass, so we searched for a customer with a real need for pure glass, one that was eager to solve a quality problem. (Derong, female entrepreneur)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result, SAM connected with the art glass manufacturer for whom glass purity was a major issue and who did become a customer. Another example of the feedback loop is seen for ‘revealing technology’. With each customer, SAM acquired additional knowledge on TFC and the technology’s performance that was used when revealing it to the next customer. SAM also acquired experience in making sense of the customer’s context and joint prototype design, which became part of the revealing technology micro-process for the next customer. All together, feedback from the dyad level helped to refine and solidify the patterns reflected in the micro-processes of prospecting problems and revealing technology.</p>
<p>Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref> shows that dyad-level changes brought about industry-level effects through the capacities created by the dyads. The most substantive effects emanated from SAM’s partnerships with the solar panel manufacturer and the TV tube producer. Before partnering with SAM, the solar panel manufacturer had been a small producer in a specialty glass niche because of very high production costs that led to expensively priced solar panels for end users. However, the partnership created a capacity for low-cost production of solar panels through the use of TFC refractories and other TFC consumables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref>). The price of solar panels fell and this, in turn, increased demand from residential and commercial energy customers. As a result, the solar panel producer grew to be a large manufacturer and became a player in the mainstream energy industry in China, able to challenge providers of traditional forms of energy.</p>
<p>In the TV tube producer case, the partnership with SAM greatly expanded a domestic industry. Before the partnership, the domestic television manufacturing industry in China was limited to production of small-sized TV tubes due to the need to use prohibitively expensive platinum-coated refractories to produce a poreless microstructure in the tube’s glass shell – extremely pure glass was needed. The SAM/TV tube maker dyad created the capacity to produce poreless, pure glass tubes at low cost. Moreover, large TV tubes could be produced, given the ability to make glass with a poreless microstructure. Armed with these new capabilities, the TV tube producer saw an opportunity to compete against what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611431092">Hart (2005)</xref> calls non-consumption in the domestic Chinese market. Vast numbers of lower-class urban and rural Chinese who previously were not able to afford televisions could now do so, due to the innovations engendered by SAM. The domestic TV tube industry thereby expanded greatly and offered product choice for customers. This domestic industry cannot compete with the imported liquid crystal technology televisions purchased by middle and upper-class Chinese, but it has forged additional markets in overseas developing countries. The findings conveyed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref> corroborate theoretical notions that organizational and societal level change can emanate from individual actions and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section16-0266242611431092">
<title>Implications of the study</title>
<p>Our findings provide initial empirical evidence that dynamic capability development is an important sub-process in the overall venture creation process, as implied but not yet researched in the strategic management literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611431092">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, the findings support the notion of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities as a more fine-grained view of dynamic capabilities at work in the new venture context. Specific findings revealed two micro-level patterns whereby the entrepreneurs identified, amassed, integrated and occasionally reconfigured resources as they developed their new venture. The micro-level patterns of prospecting problems and revealing technology converged to simultaneously develop products and generate customers; two key milestones that helped ensure SAM’s survival and a return on the innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611431092">Liao et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the micro-process perspective revealed rich detail about capability development that explains how entrepreneurs accomplished these milestones in this research setting. In particular, the entrepreneurs identified potential customers through the micro-process of ‘prospecting problems’ by looking for firms that had production problems which TFC might resolve. Also, entrepreneurs generated customers through the ‘revealing technology’ micro-process by sharing information and collaboratively designing and testing prototype products with prospective customers. The revealing technology micro-process illustrated the notion of absorptive capacity as a key knowledge capacity underpinning dynamic capabilities for endogenous product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611431092">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>). While development models and activity approaches to entrepreneurship depict customer creation as an important step in the venture creation process, these conventional approaches offer scant insight into how this important step is actually accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611431092">Liao et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, results show that customer creation and prototype or product development unfolded in ways not anticipated by these conventional models. For example, customers were identified before prototype products existed, which is the reversal of what conventional models suggest but in line with the negotiated agreements between entrepreneurs and prospective customers conjectured by effectuation logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005</xref>). Additionally, the present results provide detailed descriptions of how technology was transformed from a laboratory discovery to a viable commercial application – another important stage in conventional development models. Our evidence tells a story of entrepreneurs revealing technology to prospective customers and, in conjunction with customers, creating a shared understanding of how the TFC technology could be implemented in customers’ different production contexts. Our findings provide a thick description of the absorptive capacity process for acquiring and assimilating knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611431092">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>), as well as illustrating how conventional stages or activities were accomplished.</p>
<p>The story of SAM’s emergence illustrates how the technology commercialization process can diverge from the linear, relatively independent stages of development models. Specifically, SAM reversed development stages in that it identified customers before it had any prototype developed; it then improvised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611431092">Baker et al., 2003</xref>) by simultaneously working with prospective customers to jointly develop and test prototype products, secure resources by sharing the expense of these activities with prospective customers, and ultimately generate actual customers from prospective ones. The entrepreneurs also could be described as effectuating, in that prospective customers helped to develop products and provided partial funding for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611431092">Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005</xref>). Future research could examine the extent to which the micro-processes identified here would be at work in technology commercialization outside of the industrial context examined in the current study.</p>
<p>Beyond the insights about dynamic capability development in the new venture context, the findings have two implications for the wider management literature. First, that multiple actors shape change in the fabric of economic organization. This implication arises from evidence showing that SAM and its products emerged not only from the behaviours and decisions of the entrepreneurs, but also from the actions taken by personnel within customer firms. For example, customer personnel provided the knowledge essential for prototype design and testing and helped to cover the associated costs. As such, the findings corroborate venture emergence as the result of collective action; emerging from the actions of multiple actors, not just a solo entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611431092">Dimov, 2007</xref>). The current evidence documents the behaviours and decisions of the entrepreneurs and shows how these coalesced with the actions of key customer personnel in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242611431092">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266242611431092">4</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266242611431092">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref> illustrate the substantive changes that emerged from this interaction of behaviours and decisions of key actors. Future empirical research could examine whether micro-processes such as prospecting problems and revealing technology within established organizations can create product variety, new competitors in mainstream industries, and altered production functions, as seen in the research setting examined here.</p>
<p>Second, the findings have important implications for the role of entrepreneurs and the venture creation process in shaping wider patterns of economic organizing. In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611431092">Figure 1</xref> shows how the actions and behaviours of the entrepreneurs and key customer personnel not only supported a new venture, but also engendered cross-level emergence effects, including industry level changes. As such, the current findings indicate a role for individual-level entrepreneurial agency in the emergence of macro-trends. Or they could point to a socio-economic trend, suggesting that as industry expanded with China’s shift to a more market oriented economy, demand for energy increased and alert entrepreneurs noticed and exploited this trend. However, the findings support an alternative explanation, wherein entrepreneur behaviour and decision-making coalesce with customer actions so that over time, the macro-level effects emerged. This initial empirical evidence provides a rare glimpse of cross-level emergence effects for entrepreneurship that are acknowledged in conceptual research, but rarely investigated empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611431092">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>). Future research is needed to extend our understanding of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities and their role in transforming industries. For example, future studies could consider whether disparate dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities are needed to transform different stages in industry supply chains.</p>

<sec id="section17-0266242611431092">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>As with all research designs, the current design has strengths and limitations to consider when interpreting its findings. Specifically, the retrospective design was an advantage in that we knew how events ultimately unfolded; in this instance that a successful venture did emerge, which is helpful when interpreting events and constructing narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611431092">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, retrospective designs are open to filtering out events that do not fit with known outcomes – successful venture founding – and the findings are best interpreted with this in mind. Another possible limitation is that thick descriptions can suffer from locality and researcher-specific limitations. We acknowledge these cautions and encourage readers to view the findings as an initial step in exploring the entrepreneurial behaviours and decisions that enact new ventures and potentially transform industries.</p>
<p>Finally, this article responds to the call for more research on dynamic capabilities in the emerging venture context, given that this has been sorely lacking as scholars have focused on established or incumbent firms. Importantly, the findings provide an illustration of how the process of venture creation not only has the potential to create a new economic entity, but also can transform industries, as theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611431092">Schumpeter (1976)</xref> decades ago. A fuller understanding of dynamic entrepreneurial capabilities, and how these capabilities possibly transform industries over time, awaits future research.</p>
