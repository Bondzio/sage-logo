<abstract>
<p>Substance use is a pervasive health problem that contributes significantly to the recycling of offenders through the justice system. This study uses routine activities theory as a framework to determine whether the availability of illicit drugs in a probationer’s immediate residential environment is associated with their use of illegal substances. Combining narcotics-related calls for police service data, interviews with offenders, life history event calendars, and biological drug test results, a clustered-logit regression model of 250 drug-involved probationers indicates that the availability of drugs within the probationer’s immediate area is associated with a higher probability of testing positive for illicit substances. The results suggest a broader epidemiological framework to understand how environment affects drug use. Further research in this area will improve supervision practices of drug-involved individuals and interventions to reduce drug use.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug addiction is a serious problem affecting criminal justice populations with one third of male arrestees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022042612470643">National Institute of Justice, 2003</xref>) and nearly half of the prison population meeting the diagnostic criteria for drug dependence given in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612470643">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022042612470643">Mumola &amp; Karberg, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, 65% of arrestees test positive for an illicit substance at the time of their arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022042612470643">Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2011</xref>). This figure is far higher than the 8% of the general population that is estimated to use drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0022042612470643">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2008</xref>). Given that a large portion of those who use drugs are under community supervision, probation services offer an excellent opportunity to address substance use problems, especially given that community-based treatment has shown to have larger effect sizes than residential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612470643">Andrews, Zinger, Hoge, &amp; Bonta, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612470643">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>). However, the criminal justice field has struggled with meeting the demand for services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612470643">Garner, Knight, &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0022042612470643">Taxman, Perdoni, &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>) and drug treatment outcomes remain highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022042612470643">Prendergast, Podus, Chang, &amp; Urada, 2002</xref>). With more than 5 million adults under probation supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612470643">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2009</xref>), the need for knowledge about effective strategies to address substance use among probationers is a pressing problem that has not been adequately addressed. Although prior research has emphasized the impact of individual characteristics on health-related probation outcomes, research is emerging on the environmental factors that affect substance use and probation outcomes.</p>
<p>Place-based factors have been shown to help explain certain individual-level outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022042612470643">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>) to include several health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612470643">Elliott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022042612470643">Sellstrom, O’Campo, Muntaner, Arnoldsson, &amp; Hjern, 2011</xref>) and criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612470643">Chauhan, Reppucci, &amp; Turkheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612470643">Hipp, Petersilia, &amp; Turner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612470643">Kubrin &amp; Stewart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022042612470643">Lynch &amp; Sabol, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022042612470643">Sampson, 2006</xref>). For instance, Sellstrom and colleagues (2011) studied a sample of 76,693 adolescents for 12 years and found that the risk of being admitted to a hospital due to illicit drug use or abuse increased 73% in low-income neighborhoods compared with higher income communities. The tendency to disregard neighborhood effects in the literature derives from the belief that outcomes are individually determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612470643">Kubrin &amp; Stewart, 2006</xref>). The few studies that have explored health problems among criminally-involved populations and place have been predominately conducted at the macro level and fail to adequately control for individual-level influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0022042612470643">Weisburd, Bernasco, &amp; Bruinsma, 2009</xref>). An overlooked factor in understanding future conduct is the immediate environmental characteristics of where the probationer resides. Given these considerations, it is critical to identify the extent to which contextual processes account for variation in substance use among probationers left unexplained by individual-level factors.</p>
<p>The relation between drug accessibility within a drug-involved probationer’s immediate environment and substance use outcomes is unknown, but of interest. First, a spatial relation between drug availability and substance use may suggest that exposure to drugs makes some individuals more likely to use illicit substances. This may occur when the existence of visible drug markets mediates local demand in a community, or when the existence of drug users residing in an area mediates local supply. Even though the extant literature has not demonstrated that the availability of drugs in the community via drug markets is associated with drug consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Gruenewald, Johnson, Treno, &amp; Lascala, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022042612470643">Saxe et al., 2001</xref>), the methodological shortcomings of the existing studies and a focus on the general population overall (the majority of which is nonusers) limit the application to subpopulations, such as those involved in the justice system.</p>
<p>Second, if there is an association between drug availability and substance use, it might be appropriate for correctional programming to incorporate strategies for managing risks posed at the individual <italic>and</italic> environmental levels. In theory, individuals residing in areas that potentially increase their risk of relapse may benefit from specialized treatment services that prepare them for how to deal with environmental cues that promote relapse. Already a movement is afoot to develop place-based specialized control efforts within neighborhoods where probationers are concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612470643">Byrne &amp; Tusinski-Miofsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612470643">Clear, 2005</xref>). These interventions would be advanced if the ability to interrupt criminal behavior and drug use while under supervision were better understood.</p>
<p>This article explores how geography may affect substance use among criminal justice populations. In particular, this research will assess how a routine activities framework may identify relevant variables to understand how drug activity in a probationer’s immediate environment affects substance use. Although it may seem like common sense that one’s environment and drug use patterns would be associated, prior research has too often shown that such reasonable assumptions in criminology have been proven wrong by empirical research. With very few prior studies examining whether the environment may be related to the behavior of substance-abusing offenders, this study seeks to affirm that certain environmental contexts are related to unfavorable health-related outcomes and probation failure.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>A theoretical perspective in criminology attempts to understand and explain criminal behavior from a situational perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612470643">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612470643">Felson, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612470643">Brantingham and Brantingham (2004)</xref> stated, “[r]outine activity space places people in situations, both physically and temporally, where crime triggering events are more or less likely to occur” (p. 269). Furthermore, individuals are only aware of their activity space or the geographical area covered by their routine activities, and criminal events are more likely to occur within these activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612470643">Brantingham &amp; Brantingham, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612470643">2004</xref>). Routine activities theory contests that daily activities are important to understand criminal activity as the convergence of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the lack of capable guardians increases criminal opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612470643">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>The routine activities approach was initially intended to explain direct-contact predatory violations but was later amended to include victimless crimes, such as drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612470643">Felson, 1987</xref>). There are few studies that have applied concepts of the routine activities perspective to explore the role of daily activities and activity space in shaping drug involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612470643">Brantingham &amp; Brantingham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0022042612470643">J. Sherman, Spencer, Preisser, Gesler, &amp; Arcury, 2005</xref>). However, given that drug crimes are clustered in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Green, 1995</xref>), there is reason to believe that increased criminal opportunity within an individual’s routine activities may affect drug use. Although routine activities theory would suggest that the drug user’s behavior would be shaped by their environment, a relation between the two may also suggest that the behavior of drug users shapes their environment. The conceptualization of routine activities theory in this study is intended to be a compatible general opportunity model, similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612470643">Cohen, Felson, and Land (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612470643">Cohen, Kluegel, and Land (1981)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022042612470643">Pratt, Holtfreter, and Reisig (2010)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022042612470643">
<title>The Motivated Drug User</title>
<p>A central tenet of routine activities theory is that there must be a likely and motivated individual for a crime to occur. The conceptualization of a motivated individual, while often left unmeasured or held constant in prior tests of the theory, is dependent on the type of offense or situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022042612470643">Sasse, 2005</xref>). Different psycho-physiological processes govern drug use more than other criminal behaviors. For example, addiction is characterized as a neurological disorder where the person is chronically driven to obtain drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022042612470643">Neiman, Haapaniemi, &amp; Hillbom, 2000</xref>), but not all users have an addictive disorder.</p>
<p>There is a clear relation between drug use and biological risk factors that may be exacerbated by the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612470643">Denno, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612470643">Gordon, 2002</xref>). The drug user is conditioned to anticipate illicit substance use though various environmental stimuli, such as recognition of an area where prior use previously occurred or where one would gather to meet with other drug users. Furthermore, “self-reported urges are higher for people with addiction who have access to the drug,” and cravings subsequently increase probability of drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0022042612470643">Wertz &amp; Sayette, 2001</xref>, p. 5). These environmental cues are not easily overcome in that users often associate prior use with positive experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0022042612470643">Tiffany, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Drug urges and cravings due to perceived opportunity to use may not directly translate into action; this progression is mediated by how one copes with drug cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612470643">Carter &amp; Tiffany, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0022042612470643">Wertz &amp; Sayette, 2001</xref>). For instance, addicts may engage in cognitive or behavioral coping techniques to prevent relapse in high-risk environments, such as thinking about the benefits of abstinence or escape from the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0022042612470643">Shiffman, 1984</xref>). Other factors may increase drug use to include acute and chronic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612470643">Donovan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0022042612470643">Tate, Brown, Glasner, Unrod, &amp; McQuaid, 2006</xref>), criminal thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612470643">Knight, Garner, Simpson, Morey, &amp; Flynn, 2006</xref>), type of drug used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022042612470643">Mark, Vandivort-Warren, &amp; Montejano, 2006</xref>), genetic disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612470643">Beaver, DeLisi, Vaughn, &amp; Barnes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0022042612470643">Vanyukov et al., 2004</xref>), and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022042612470643">McLellan, Luborsky, Woody, &amp; O’Brien, 1983</xref>). Although individual differences in reactions to drug-related stimuli may attenuate, or intensify, substance abuse, these factors need to be understood within a situational context. Based on the existing literature, motivation to use drugs should include measures of propensity to engage in substance use, which may be biological (e.g., physical dependency) or environmental forces (e.g., peer influences).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022042612470643">
<title>The Suitability of Targets and Opportunity to Use Drugs</title>
<p>Another facet of routine activities theory is that there must be an available and suitable target. Although the target in prior tests of the theory is often the victim, the drug itself may be considered the target for known substance users. The availability of drugs within peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612470643">Mason, Cheung, &amp; Walker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0022042612470643">Sydow, Lieb, Pfister, Hofler, &amp; Wittchen, 2002</xref>) and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612470643">Levin, Hirsch, &amp; Roberts, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612470643">Mason et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022042612470643">O’Brien, Childress, McLellan, &amp; Ehrman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022042612470643">O’Brien, Childress, Ehrman, &amp; Robbins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022042612470643">Powell, 1995</xref>) is thought to contribute to drug use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612470643">Eck (1995)</xref> suggested that two marketing strategies of drug sales exist, which give rise to different opportunities to purchase drugs. The first type of strategy suggests that dealers rely on a social network of screened buyers for business. As the network provides a way for sellers and buyers to communicate, marketplaces may be spread over a wide area where any place is well suited for the transaction. The inherent invisibility of this private market makes it difficult for police to detect. In the second approach, a dealer may adopt a routine activities approach and maximize drug sales by selling to strangers. Because the dealer lacks a network of communication, competing drug dealers may operate out of the same location given that the larger the cluster of dealers, the more customers that are attracted to the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0022042612470643">Taniguchi, Rengert, &amp; McCord, 2009</xref>). Another technique to increase customer base is to locate near facilities that substance users routinely frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612470643">Rengert, Ratcliffe, &amp; Chakravorty, 2005</xref>), such as homeless shelters, drug and alcohol treatment centers, schools, bars, and liquor stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022042612470643">Rengert &amp; Chakravorty, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612470643">Rengert et al., 2005</xref>). The underlying assumption is that the availability of drugs will increase sales, which has the potential to increase substance use.</p>
<p>Many theorists suggest that easy access and availability to drugs is a strong determinant of actual use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612470643">Anthony &amp; Helzer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612470643">Clayton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612470643">Dembo, Farrow, Schneidler, &amp; Burgos, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0022042612470643">Storr, Chen, &amp; Anthony, 2004</xref>), yet empirical research on this association is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612470643">Crum, Lillie-Blanton, &amp; Anthony, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612470643">S. G. Sherman, Hua, &amp; Latkin, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612470643">S. G. Sherman and colleagues (2004)</xref> explored the effect of individual- and community-level characteristics on drug use cessation among heroin users in inner city, Baltimore, Maryland (<italic>N</italic> = 200). Participants were recruited through targeted outreach, such as ethnographic observations in the community and drug-related arrests, and then were provided drug treatment services and detoxification programming. At the 6th month follow-up, the participants reported on drug use since enrollment in the study. Drug availability was measured by asking participants to self-report on a 3-point scale whether drug selling is a severe problem in their neighborhood (<italic>not a problem, somewhat</italic>, or <italic>big</italic>). Although those who continued drug use were more likely to report drug sales as a problem in their neighborhood, the finding was statistically insignificant. Individuals who continued to use heroin were significantly more likely to purchase drugs within their own neighborhood, which “may suggest that the occurrence of drug availability within a drug users’ neighborhood plays a role in continued drug use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612470643">S. G. Sherman et al., 2004</xref>, p. 1208).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Gruenewald, et al. (2005)</xref> also conducted an exploratory study on the relation between illicit drug market sales and local demand. This research conducted telephone calls with people in neighborhoods using random digit dialing to obtain self-reports of use and availability of illegal substances (<italic>N</italic> = 16,083). Drug availability was measured by the percent of nonusers approached in their neighborhood to purchase illicit substances as the researchers hypothesized that using data from active users would overestimate the availability of substances in the community due to their drug seeking behaviors. All individual-level data were aggregated at the zip code level, and areas with less than 10 participants interviewed were combined with the largest adjacent zip code. The researchers found that drug sales are spatially unrelated to self-reported use. It could be interpreted that because these data were aggregated at the community level, the findings may be an ecological fallacy, particularly when drug use and offender concentrations are highly variable within a zip code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0022042612470643">Weisburd et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022042612470643">
<title>Lack of Capable Guardians</title>
<p>Individual-level risk factors associated with a higher likelihood of drug use may be mitigated by protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0022042612470643">Wills, Vaccaro, &amp; McNamara, 1992</xref>). Although protection may simply be considered the absence of risk, several protective variables in the individual’s environment have been identified in the literature, such as informal mechanisms of social control and participation in activities incompatible with drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612470643">Jessor et al., 1995</xref>). From a routine activities perspective, these protective factors are closely linked to the concept of guardianship, particularly with respect to handlers, which describes a person who discourages a potential offender from committing a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612470643">Felson, 1995</xref>). Positive drug treatment outcomes, for instance, have been found to be related to the perception of peer and familial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612470643">Havassy, Wasserman, &amp; Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612470643">Hawkins &amp; Fraser, 1987</xref>), those who spend more time with family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612470643">Duncan, Duncan, &amp; Strycker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022042612470643">Pope, Ionescu-Pioggia, &amp; Pope, 2001</xref>), and have positive peer influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612470643">Knight &amp; Simpson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612470643">Latkin, Forman, Knowlton, &amp; Sherman, 2003</xref>) are less likely to use drugs. In summary, personal handlers serve to decrease substance use because the “informal social interaction provides sources of social restraint” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612470643">Felson &amp; Gottfredson, 1984</xref>, p. 713).</p>
<p>Another type of guardianship, place managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612470643">Eck, 1994</xref>), can also be considered a protective factor. Place managers are those who monitor places where crimes may occur, such as a business manager, doorman, or janitor. A growing body of research finds that those who are employed are less likely to use illicit substances as it is often an activity that is incompatible with drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612470643">DeSimone, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612470643">French, Roebuck, &amp; Alexandre, 2001</xref>). However, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612470643">Bratt (2007)</xref> examined whether the presence of social workers in areas where teenagers socialize reduces adolescent drug use, he did not find a reduction in the level of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use among those who frequently participated in out-of-home activities.</p>

<title>Study</title>
<p>The growing body of literature discussed above suggests that the availability of drugs may be positively related to substance use. Guided by a routine activities framework to select key variables, this study poses the following research question:</p>
<list id="list1-0022042612470643" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Does the availability of drugs in a probationer’s immediate environment affect drug use?</p></list-item></list>
<p>This research uses baseline data previously collected for evaluating a seamless criminal justice and treatment system. The participants were probationers who were sentenced by the court to community supervision and were recruited from three probation offices located in the Baltimore County and Baltimore City, Maryland areas (<italic>N</italic> = 250). Participants were referred by their probation agent, or by researchers asking probationers who were reporting for supervision if they have a court-ordered condition for drug treatment. Several instruments were administered to probationers by trained interviewers within 6 months of beginning probation (referred to as the probation initiation period) to measure demographic, psychosocial functioning, and criminal history characteristics of the participants.</p>
<p>This study will rely on baseline measures to examine drug availability and substance use at the time of probation initiation. This time point was chosen because the use of drugs during the early phase of probation (i.e., a negative outcome of drug use) represents a problem worthy of consideration given that behaviors that define the onset of probation are often predictive of success on probation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612470643">Knight et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0022042612470643">Taxman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0022042612470643">Taxman, Rhodes, &amp; Dumenci, 2011</xref>). It must also be noted that individuals who are sentenced to probation tend to serve a short period of time detained in a correctional facility after their initial arrest, and then are released back into the community prior to being sentenced to community supervision. Probation differs from parole in that parolees are convicted of more serious offenses and are released back into the community only after completing a portion of a prison sentence. The majority of the sample (82%) in this study did not self-report being detained or incarcerated in the 30 days prior to their baseline assessment. Of those who were detained (18%), the average number of days incarcerated in the prior 30 days was 7.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.8). After including the portion of the participants who were not detained, the average number of days incarcerated was 1.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.2) days for the total sample. Furthermore, less than 4% of the sample attended inpatient substance abuse treatment (such as detox or residential treatment) in the 30 days prior to their baseline assessment, with an average of 2.5 days for those who attended inpatient treatment and 0.6 days once the entire sample is included. Given that the study participants served none or relatively few days outside the community prior to their baseline assessment, it is expected that the present sample has been exposed to their community long enough to produce geographic variations on substance use outcomes.</p>
<p>The demographics of the study population are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612470643">Table 1</xref>. The study sample comprised 75% males and 67% African American, 32% White, and 1% others. Almost half (47%) of the probationers had a positive biological drug test result at baseline. The sample had an average of 11 to 12 years of education completed (<italic>M</italic> = 11.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.7), with an average age of 37 (<italic>M</italic> = 36.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.5). The average participant had 10 prior arrests, 5 prior incarcerations, and 2 prior treatment experiences. As measured by the Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0022042612470643">Simpson, Knight, &amp; Broome, 1997</xref>), the study sample is characterized as having a low (24%), medium (27%), or high (50%) drug dependence.</p>

<title>Drug test outcome</title>
<p>Several prior studies on the association between neighborhood factors and illicit substance abuse relied on self-reported drug use as a measure of actual use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612470643">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Gruenewald, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Lascala, Gruenewald, &amp; Treno, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022042612470643">Saxe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612470643">S.

This measure is of importance given that those under the supervision of the criminal justice system or in drug treatment may not always be honest or accurate in reporting drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0022042612470643">Wish, Hoffman, &amp; Nemes, 1997</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022042612470643">
<title>Physical availability of illicit substances</title>
<p>Availability was measured by the physical accessibility of drugs within the probationer’s immediate area, as well as the perceived opportunity to use illegal substances. To identify drug markets, data were obtained from the Baltimore Police Department and Baltimore County Police Department Calls for Service Database on telephone calls requesting police service made to the departments or through 911 Emergency Service. A total of 178,064 narcotics-related calls for police service were examined the year prior to and during recruitment of participants for the experiment, between January 2006 and December 2007. The address of each incident, as identified by the caller, was geocoded in ArcGIS, which requires the geographic information system to assign an x-y coordinate to an alphanumeric address (e.g., 123 Main Street). The respective hit rates were 93% and 95% for Baltimore City and Baltimore County, which are reliable geocoding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022042612470643">Ratcliffe, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether probationers reside in high-activity drug areas, the location of each client’s residence at the time of their initial assessment was also geocoded. The sample has lived at their current address for an average of 6.9 years (median = 2.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.9). For a measure of drug availability, a 1-mile buffer zone was created around each individual’s residence, and then the number of narcotics calls for police service within this radius was calculated. This buffer is essential given that prior research has found that most addicts do not travel beyond 1 mile to purchase drugs as “the existence of a drug market more than a mile away from their main domicile will often either be unknown to them or deemed too far to travel” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022042612470643">Rengert et al., 2005</xref>, p. 56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022042612470643">Pettiway, 1994</xref>). The logarithmic transformation of the number of narcotics calls for service within this radius was used in the proceeding analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612470643">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the locations of probationers’ residences in relation to the density of drug calls for service in Baltimore City and Baltimore County via a point choropleth map, with darker shades indicating a higher number of narcotics calls for service within a 1-mile radius.</p>

<title>Primary drug of choice</title>
<p>The client’s preferred drug was determined by oral fluid test results at their baseline assessment for those who tested positive and self-reported drug of choice within the last 30 days for those who tested negative. For those that tested positive, 90% were positive for the drugs they self-reported to use within the 30 days prior to their baseline assessment. Polydrug users were coded as a heroin and cocaine user if the probationer tested positive for at least one of the substances, given that prior studies have shown an association between widespread drug use and criminal behavior among heroin and cocaine users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612470643">Anglin &amp; Hser, 1990</xref>). Heroin and cocaine users in the present sample also have more severe drug dependency issues than marijuana and barbiturate users, <italic>t</italic>(248) = −8.769, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000. Thus, probationers were dichotomized into marijuana and barbiturate users (34%) or heroin and cocaine users (66%), respectfully coded as 0 and 1.</p>

<sec id="section18-0022042612470643">
<title>Substance abuse treatment</title>
<p>Probationers completed “life history event calendars” to collect data on social bonds, risky behaviors, criminal offending, treatment experiences, and periods of incarceration, where the interviewer asked the client to retrospectively identify on a calendar when this activity occurred over the prior 90 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0022042612470643">Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992</xref>). This instrument was administered during a structured interview that facilitated the accurate recall of life events, and the event calendar approach has been shown to be more reliable for measuring self-reported data on drug use and criminal offending than alternative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612470643">Horney &amp; Marshall, 1991</xref>). This study used the instrument to calculate participation in drug treatment over the 90 days prior to their baseline assessment, where a treatment day is considered any day they attended self-help (e.g., alcoholics and narcotics anonymous meetings), outpatient (e.g., individual or group therapy), or inpatient (e.g., detox and residential treatment) treatment sessions.</p>

For the purpose of this study, two theoretically relevant social support items, support from family (α = .789) and support from friends (α = .679), were selected from this instrument as measures of offender handlers. Higher scores on these indexes indicate a greater degree of perceived support. The employment status of the client also served as a measure of place managers.</p>

<title>Analytical Plan</title>
<p>The 250 probationers in this study compose a purposive sample of men and women recruited by their probation officers for participation. To this end, this study is intended to serve as an exploratory research effort measuring the utility of incorporating a framework of routine activities theory in an attempt to better understand the impact of drug availability on the use of drugs by probationers. It is important to note that this is not intended to be a test of the full routine activities theory, as this had not been an intended goal during the primary data collection effort. Instead, this became a goal for exploratory analysis following the preliminary review of the collected data.</p>
<p>To better understand the relationship between the variables of interest and the dependent measure of drug use, a series of models are presented below (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612470643">Table 2</xref>). Each model is the result of a clustered-logit regression analysis calculated using the statistical software Stata (Version 9.0). A clustered regression model was deemed most appropriate for a number of reasons: (a) As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612470643">Figure 1</xref>, both Baltimore County and City were included in the analysis, as such the spatial clustering of the participants is clear; (b) due to the small number of the study, a more advanced nested model approach could not be utilized; and (c) prior analyses using Geographically Weighted Regression (not shown here) failed to find significant spatial variation between the probationers. However, although this spatial variation was not significant, a local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> statistic of spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s <italic>I</italic> = .53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) demonstrated that there was significant spatial clustering of drug availability. This suggested that it would be incorrect to assume the independence of the probationers, a requirement of the traditional logistic regression model. The clustered regression model, as presented here, attempts to eliminate intragroup correlations by the use of robust standard errors. Probationers’ responses were clustered by Census block group identifiers.</p>

<p>In Model 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612470643">Table 3</xref>), only demographic variables were included. Results indicate that being male (<italic>b</italic> = −.618, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) was only a marginally significant indicator of drug use, whereas increased age was strongly related to drug use (<italic>b</italic> = .040, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Model 2 included local measures related to the availability and access to drugs. The measure of availability of drugs (1-mile radius) was found to be significant (<italic>b</italic> = .165, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and indicates that probationers residing in areas with increased narcotics-related calls for police service are more likely to test positive for illicit substances. Although, clients who tested positive were significantly less likely to self-report perceived drug availability in their neighborhood (<italic>b</italic> = −.478, <italic>p</italic> = .01). In addition, both measures of the risk for recidivism and the probationer’s drug network were found to be marginally significant (<italic>b</italic> = .170, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 and <italic>b</italic> = .067, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, respectively), suggesting that probationers who had a higher risk of reoffending and those with more drug-involved associates were more likely to test positive for illicit substances.</p>

<p>Model 3 included measures related to the individual, including social network support, received treatment, and alcohol use. In this group of variables, all failed to be significant indicators of interest, with the exception of the measure of drug addiction, which focused on individuals who reported primarily using heroin or cocaine (<italic>b</italic> = 1.360, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). These results suggest that respondents who reported heroin or cocaine as their primary drug of choice were almost four times as likely (OR = 3.896) to test positive for drugs. Finally, Model 4 brings together the variables from the prior models. Here, it can be seen that two of the prior variables that were found to be significant, age and risk of recidivism, are no longer significant indicators of drug use. However, the measure of gender (<italic>b</italic> = −.674, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), narcotics-related police calls for service (<italic>b</italic> = .171, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), perceived drug availability (<italic>b</italic> = −.424, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the drug network (<italic>b</italic> = .089, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and cocaine or heroin as the primary drug of choice (<italic>b</italic> = 1.195, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) continue to be significant predictors of drug use.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior research focused almost exclusively on individual-level correlates of probation and substance abuse treatment outcomes and largely overlooked the role of place-based contextual factors. Although recent studies have shown how availability of resources in communities may affect outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612470643">Hipp, Jannetta, Shah, &amp; Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612470643">Hipp, Jannetta, Shah, &amp; Turner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612470643">Hipp et al., 2010</xref>), these studies did not look at a subset of substance abusers. This study’s findings suggest that this lack of attention is problematic given the pressing concerns about substance use among probationer. It is important to note that this study is exploratory in nature and should not be considered a formal test of routine activities theory. Instead, the goal is to apply themes of this theoretical perspective to a study of Baltimore probationers. Although the original data collection was not intended toward this goal, we believe that these results provide an initial step in examining this relationship.</p>
<p>The analyses indicate that, while controlling for individual-level factors, drug availability within a probationer’s immediate area is associated with a higher probability of testing positive for illicit substances. This may be explained by the consideration of the contextual factors. First, drug availability shapes local demand. Efforts to reduce drug sales, such as police targeting areas with decreasing substance use, particularly among offenders who have substance use disorders. Drug treatment programs may be improved by preparing users to deal with or change environmental cues that promote drug use. Although this study supports these implications, it must be acknowledged that the results are in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Gruenewald, et al.’s (2005)</xref> research, which found that drug use in neighborhoods is not coterminous with perceived drug sales among nondrug users. The dissimilar study findings may be demonstrating the importance of including aggregate measures of the context, or it may demonstrate a varying level in knowledge of illicit activities by probationers versus nondrug users. However, these conflicting findings further highlight that a greater understanding of the demand-availability dynamic is a useful direction for future research.</p>
<p>A second explanation is that substance users reside in drug markets because drugs are more readily accessible. This issue of individual selection bias limits the study of contextual effects due to the need for a greater understanding of selection decisions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022042612470643">Sampson and colleagues (2002)</xref> noted further, “[h]ow do we know that the area differences in any outcome of interest . . . are the result of neighborhood factors rather than the differential selection of adolescents or their families in certain neighborhoods?” (p. 466). In addition, numerous measures of community processes are intercorrelated, which may suggest high-order social constructs. Although drug users may shape the availability of drugs in the area, there may still be a potential for the police to reduce substance use by targeting high-risk areas.</p>
<sec id="section24-0022042612470643">
<title>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Researchers are beginning to examine how one’s likelihood of illicit substance use is affected by proximity to drug markets. Although this line of research is beginning to be pursued, there remains a significant lack of understanding about the potential role of opportunity in continued use of illicit substances. As suggested by this study, furthering this research agenda may have much to offer as the availability of illicit substances in the community may be relevant to other probation outcomes, such as criminal activity or success in substance use treatment, which will be of use when designing programs to improve likelihood of success on probation and overall health. For example, knowledge that client participation in treatment deteriorates drastically when the center is located more than four miles away from the client, but increases when clients travel less than a mile to a treatment center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612470643">Beardsley, Wish, Fitzelle, O’Grady, &amp; Arria, 2003</xref>), allows interventions to reduce program attrition by ensuring that clients receive treatment in close proximity to their home.</p>
<p>Empirical findings on this area have been mixed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612470643">Freisthler, Gruenewald, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022042612470643">S. G. Sherman et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that criminologists need to approach this research question with more rigorous methods. Several key individual-level characteristics interact with drug exposure to make some individuals more vulnerable to substance use, which needs to be accounted for in multivariate models. Other place-based mediating factors that may influence probation outcomes should be explored as well. Much research in the field of criminal justice has focused on crime and incivilities at locations and has failed to consider other areas of interest, including health and psychology to name a few.</p>
<p>This study’s results suggest that this initial effort to apply the underpinnings of an opportunity model is a promising avenue for research. Additional work should be conducted to expand upon this study in several ways. First, drug availability within other contexts needs to be measured, as one’s activity space extends far beyond the environment immediately around their residence. Second, future research in this area needs to explore not only if drugs are available to the user (target availability), but also if the drug the client uses is available (target suitability). Third, the exact relation between one’s likelihood of substance use and their social network of drug users remains unclear from the study findings due to the need to determine whether a client’s drug-involved associates must be geographically near to affect substance use. On a similar note, it must be considered that the family and friends who provide the client support may also be abusing substances, rendering them unsuitable to assist the client in their recovery. Each of these suggests more appropriate ways of applying an opportunity model perspective to the question of drug use. Fourth, finding that those who tested positive were less likely to perceive drug availability was unexpected, and this relation needs to be explored further. It may be that those who are using drugs are less aware of their neighborhood or that these respondents were less honest in reporting their perceptions. Another possibility is variations in what probationers perceive as a neighborhood and different perception of drug availability.</p>
<p>Finally, even in light of experimental literature confirming the influence of place on individual-level outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022042612470643">Sampson et al., 2002</xref>), conclusions drawn from neighborhood effects research must still be made with caution due to selection bias. This study examines a small group of convicted criminals currently on probation. Referring back to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612470643">Figure 1</xref>, it is clear that this is not a sample randomly distributed throughout the Baltimore City/County area. Therefore, in absence of sufficient evidence derived from experimental designs, future studies need to better understand neighborhood selection decisions to estimate the true effect of environmental influences on substance use.</p>
<p>This study uses calls for service data to characterize the availability of drugs in the areas surrounding the probationers’ residence. A strength of using calls for service, as opposed to crime rates, is that it provides the exact location of the crime. Although research so far suggests similar proportions of narcotics-related calls for service and arrests inside (86% vs. 81%) and outside (14% vs. 10%) drug market boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Mazerolle, 2000</xref>), the use of calls for service as an indicator of drug activity is preferable over arrest data because calls for service are less affected by patterns of policing given that the number of arrests may be overrepresented in areas that receive more police attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0022042612470643">Warner &amp; Pierce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Mazerolle, 2000</xref>) and are considered more reliable measure of criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022042612470643">Pierce, Spaar, &amp; Briggs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0022042612470643">L. Sherman, Gartin, &amp; Buerger, 1989</xref>). Although calls for service is commonly used to examine the spatial dynamic of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612470643">Braga &amp; Bond, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022042612470643">L. Sherman &amp; Weisburd, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Green, 1995</xref>) and is a well-established indicator of drug markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612470643">Mazerolle, Kadleck, &amp; Roehl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022042612470643">Nunn, Quinet, Rowe, &amp; Christ, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Mazerolle, 2000</xref>), these data have several shortcomings. Underreporting and overreporting of crime may occur if more than one call is generated for the crime or when the call was made in error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0022042612470643">L. Sherman et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, the variation in calls for service may be a factor of community characteristics of the areas; thus, research in this area is needed to determine the extent to which open-air drug markets generate more calls for service than indoor markets. Another limitation of using narcotics-related police calls for service is that drug markets are defined by drug type(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0022042612470643">Weisburd &amp; Green, 1994</xref>). Even though any drug may be readily available around the client’s residence, it does not mean that the type of drug used by the individual is available; if the probationer is a heroin user, but the only drug in proximity to their residence is marijuana, the use of calls for service as a measure of availability is deceiving. As such, the measure used in this study more appropriately gauges target availability, rather than suitability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research adds epidemiologic support to the idea that environment affects drug use and that daily activities may hinder change processes among those under community supervision. The study must be replicated in other areas to corroborate that context matters. To develop appropriate interventions for these clients, the extent to which individual factors and social context are interrelated must be understood. Continued research to this end will contribute to our assessment, and understanding, of environmental risk factors for those under community supervision.</p>

<p>Oral fluid tests provide accurate drug test results within 5 to 48 hr of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0022042612470643">Verstraete, 2004</xref>), which is a short detection period in comparison with other testing procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612470643">Dolan, Rouen, &amp; Kimber, 2004</xref>). Of the total sample, two participants’ oral fluid tests results were unavailable as one refused to be tested and the other had a contaminated test. To prevent these cases from being excluded in the preceding analysis, the urinalysis test results obtained from the probation office will replace the missing data for these two clients. The urinalysis testing procedure, which has a longer detection time than oral fluid tests, was not used as the primary testing method in the study as not all probationers had urine samples collected by the probation department at the time of their initial assessment for the experiment.</p></fn>
