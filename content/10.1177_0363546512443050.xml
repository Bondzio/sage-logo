<sec id="section1-0363546512443050">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Currently, there is an ongoing debate regarding the optimal graft choice between autograft and allograft tendons in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It has been reported that allograft tendons have a slower onset and rate of revascularization compared with autograft tendons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512443050">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Allograft tendons might have inferior graft maturity compared with autograft tendons in ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512443050">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512443050">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 52 participants with ACL reconstruction were recruited in this study, including 30 using allograft tendons and 22 using autograft tendons. All of them had unilateral ACL reconstruction and were followed up using 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least 2 years postoperatively. Clinical examination was performed on the same day when the MRI examination was performed, including subjective functional examinations (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale [TLKS]) and physical examinations (anterior drawer test and Lachman test). Four measurements based on MRI were focused on graft orientation (including tibial tunnel position and graft angles), the edematous condition of the graft, intra-articular graft width at different sites, and signal intensity of the ACL graft using the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) from a region of interest analysis. Differences in each measurement were compared between the allograft group and the autograft group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512443050">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>All the participants returned to normal sports activities at the follow-up time point, as all of them acquired full functional strength and stability. There was no significant difference between the autograft and the allograft group with respect to IKDC or TLKS score. The knees in both of the groups were confirmed stable by physical examination before MRI. On MRI measurements, the allograft group displayed no significant difference in graft orientation compared with the autograft group (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Moreover, there was also no significant difference between allograft group and autograft group in graft width of the distal site (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05), middle site (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05), and proximal site (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). However, the mean SNQ value of the allograft group was significantly higher than that of the autograft group in the distal site (6.54 ± 6.58 vs 2.98 ± 5.48; <italic>P</italic> = .0173), the middle site (7.21 ± 6.31 vs 3.56 ± 4.62; <italic>P</italic> = .0149), and the proximal site (6.61 ± 8.08 vs 2.45 ± 8.12; <italic>P</italic> = .0018).</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546512443050">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The allograft group had a significantly higher SNQ value compared with the autograft group in this study, indicating that allograft tendons might have inferior graft maturity than autograft tendons in ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively.</p>

<p>Regarding potential risks, harvest of an autograft tendon will increase surgical time and may cause donor site painful syndrome or morbidity, whereas use of an allograft tendon may be associated with immune reactions and risks of disease transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512443050">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512443050">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512443050">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512443050">23</xref></sup> With respect to patient satisfaction, knee functional score, and clinical failure rate, it has been reported that allografts have a comparable result with autograft tendons after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512443050">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443050">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512443050">12</xref></sup> By comparing hamstring tendon autografts and allografts in ACL reconstruction, Sun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512443050">24</xref></sup> also found no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups according to the evaluations of the clinical outcome, and they concluded that both the autograft and the allograft group achieved almost the same satisfactory outcome at an average follow-up of 7.8 years. However, these investigations did not mention the problem of graft maturity between the allograft tendon and the autograft tendon. As known to all, graft maturity has a great association with long-term stability in the knee joint. Because intra-articular graft maturity is an important concern after ACL reconstruction, there is a growing interest to know whether there is any difference in graft maturity between the allograft tendon and the autograft tendon in the human body, particularly at 2 years postoperatively.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive powerful tool in analyzing and evaluating knee joints preoperatively and postoperatively, including ligaments, menisci, and cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443050">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512443050">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512443050">28</xref></sup> It can provide relatively useful data on meniscal healing status after meniscal repair,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512443050">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512443050">14</xref></sup> define the morphological characteristics of the chondral graft repair process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512443050">6</xref></sup> evaluate tendon-to-bone healing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443050">5</xref></sup> and determine graft integrity and graft remodeling of the reconstructed ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512443050">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512443050">10</xref></sup> Several investigations have described the use of MRI in the evaluation of the reconstructed grafts postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512443050">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443050">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512443050">17</xref></sup> Muramatsu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443050">15</xref></sup> examined 24 knees with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) allografts and 20 knees with central-third BPTB autografts using 1.0-T contrast-enhanced MRI. They used the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) value of the graft on MRI to compare graft revascularization between groups. More recently, Ntoulia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512443050">16</xref></sup> evaluated the biological healing process of the BPTB autografts using the SNQ value on 1.5-T MRI, and they found revascularization of the graft occurs gradually along its length according to SNQ values on MRI at 6 and 12 months after surgery. As known to all, 3.0-T MRI has higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), better resolution, and shorter scan time when compared with 1.5-T MRI. It has been stated that routine imaging at 3.0 T increases diagnostic confidence, especially for evaluations of cartilaginous and ligamentous structures. To our knowledge, there is a lack of research noninvasively using 3.0-T MRI to evaluate and compare graft maturity between the allograft tendon and the autograft tendon at 2 years postoperatively.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare graft maturity between the tibia anterior allograft tendon and the hamstring autograft tendon at 2 years postoperatively. We hypothesized that allograft tendons might have inferior graft maturity compared with autograft tendons in ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively.</p>

<p>For the present study, we recruited male patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction. Female patients were excluded because of the different hormonal levels, which might influence graft maturity. The inclusion criteria were (1) a unilateral ACL reconstruction, (2) no history of reinjury of the reconstructed knee, and (3) age of 18 to 50 years. The participants were excluded if they had any of the following: (1) instability, (2) osteoarthritis, and (3) combined ligament reconstruction.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546512443050">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>One senior surgeon performed all the operations using arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction techniques. After the advantages and disadvantages of the autograft and the allograft were described by the senior surgeon at each time, the patients chose the graft themselves. After diagnostic arthroscopy, associated meniscal injury and cartilage damage were treated before ACL reconstruction. For the autograft reconstruction, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were harvested and prepared as a 4-stranded double-looped hamstring autograft with a minimum of 12 cm in length. In the allograft group, a fresh-frozen tibialis anterior allograft tendon (Osteolink Biomaterial Co Ltd, Hubei, China) was thawed in sterile physiological fluid at room temperature before preparation and prepared as a 4-stranded double-looped graft similar to the autograft. Subsequently, the tibial and femoral holes were made using a transtibial technique to fulfill the criterion of an anatomic reconstruction. After the graft was pulled into the holes, the femoral side graft was fixed with Endobutton CL (Smith &amp; Nephew, London, United Kingdom) (n = 9 in the autograft group; n = 12 in the allograft group) or Rigidfix pins (DePuy Mitek Inc, Raynham, Massachusetts) (n = 13 in the autograft group; n = 18 in the allograft group), and the tibial side graft was fixed with a Bio-Intrafix (DePuy Mitek Inc) augmented with a staple. All the patients were rehabilitated according to the same protocol postoperatively. They were allowed partial weightbearing with crutches for 3 weeks and began to perform sports-related activities at approximately 6 months postoperatively.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512443050">
<title>Clinical Evaluation</title>
<p>Clinical examination was performed by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon on the same day the MRI examination was performed, including subjective functional examinations and physical examinations. The clinical evaluating surgeon and the MRI reader were blinded regarding the type of graft (allograft or autograft). Subjective functional examinations included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (TLKS) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.orthopaedicscore.com">http://www.orthopaedicscore.com</ext-link>). The TLKS score was interpreted as poor if TLKS &lt;65, fair if 65 ≤ TLKS ≤ 83, good if 84 ≤ TLKS ≤ 90, and excellent if TLKS &gt;90. Physical examinations consisted of the anterior drawer test (ADT) and Lachman test. The ADT and Lachman test can be graded as follows: grade 0, normal with 0- to 2-mm displacement; grade I, nearly normal with 3- to 5-mm displacement; grade II, abnormal with 6- to 10-mm displacement; and grade III, severely abnormal with greater than 10-mm displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512443050">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section11-0363546512443050">
<title>MRI and Image Analysis</title>
<p>Imaging was performed in a relaxed extended position with a 3.0-T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Verio, A Tim system, Siemens, Munich, Germany). All the participants had at least a 1-hour rest before MRI. Sagittal images were obtained with oblique proton density–fat saturation: repetition time, 3000 msec; echo time, 28 msec; flip angle, 160°; matrix, 320 × 272; field of view, 15 × 15 cm; slice thickness, 3 mm; scan time, 2 minutes, 41 seconds. Images were also obtained with sagittal short time inversion recovery (STIR): repetition time, 5730 msec; echo time, 34 msec; flip angle, 150°; matrix, 256 × 230; field of view, 15 × 15 cm; slice thickness, 3 mm; scan time, 2 minutes, 2 seconds. All these images were imported into Siemens Software Packages (NUMARIS/4, SyngoMR B17, Siemens), and all the calculations were made from the middle sagittal slices of each graft using this software.</p>
<p>The MRI evaluation focused on 5 measurements: (1) The tibial tunnel location of the graft, measured using the position ratio of the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512443050">Figure 1A</xref>). (2) The orientation of the ACL ligament was measured using 2 angles: the sagittal ACL angle and the ACL–Blumensaat line angle. The sagittal ACL angle was defined as the angle between a line parallel to the ACL graft and a reference line parallel to a line perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512443050">Figure 1B</xref>). The ACL–Blumensaat line angle was defined as the angle between the posterior surface of the femur and the distal portion of the ACL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512443050">Figure 1C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512443050">1</xref></sup> (3) The edematous condition of the graft was assigned to a 3-level grading system based on the STIR MRI scans: grade I, normal-appearing strands of ligament and a low-intensity signal band with no edema; grade II, a low-intensity signal band with partial edematous; and grade III, full edema (100% edematous) without the continuity of a low-intensity signal band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512443050">Figure 2</xref>). (4) The width of the ACL graft. The intra-articular length of the ACL graft was divided into 3 zones to analyze the graft dimension. The length of the 3 lines perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the graft was calculated on 3 sites (the distal site, the middle site, and the proximal site), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512443050">Figure 3</xref>). This measurement included only the area of the ACL graft with a homogeneous and low-intensity signal. Because the primary tendon diameter varied among participants, the graft width was normalized by being divided by the diameter of the primary graft, described as the graft width ratio. (5) The signal intensity was calculated at the 3 aforementioned graft sites as well as the other 2 sites (quadriceps tendon site and the background approximately 2 cm anterior to the patellar tendon) using a 0.05-cm<sup>2</sup> circle region of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512443050">Figure 4</xref>). To quantify the normalized signal intensity of the ACL graft, the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) of each graft site was calculated using the following equation: SNQ = (signal of ACL graft – signal of quadriceps tendon)/signal of background).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512443050">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443050">15</xref></sup> All of the measurements were performed by the same investigator, and repeated measurements were made on 2 days at least 1 week apart. The MRI reader was blinded to the type of graft.</p>

<p>Data analysis was performed using Stata 10.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas), and the data were reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) for description. At first, post hoc power analysis was performed. If a minimal difference of 0.15 cm was found in the graft width between groups, it was considered a clinically significant difference of graft width. Given the SD of graft width in the data, the sample size of the allograft group (n = 30) and the autograft group (n = 22) has a power of 80% when level of significance was set at .05. To quantify the proportion of the variance for all the measurements, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was assessed by examining the intraobserver reliabilities. The ICC was interpreted as poor if ICC &lt;0.4, as marginal if 0.4 ≤ ICC ≥ 0.75, and as good if ICC &gt;0.75. A χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the allograft group and the autograft group for the categorical variables. Two-sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the continuous variables (including IKDC score and TLKS score) between the 2 groups. Differences in the SNQ of the ACL graft were compared between groups with a 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Statistical significance level was set at .05.</p>

<title>Clinical Findings</title>
<p>All the participants returned to normal sports activities at the follow-up time point, as all of them acquired full functional strength and stability. No infection and no synovitis were found in all the participants. For the allograft group, the mean IKDC score was 92.6 ± 5.9, and the mean TLKS score was 93.4 ± 5.2. For the autograft group, the mean IKDC score was 93.3 ± 5.2, and the mean TLKS score was 94.3 ± 5.4. No significant difference between groups was detected with respect to IKDC (<italic>P</italic> = .6448) or TLKS score (<italic>P</italic> = .5436). According to the TLKS grading criteria, there were 17 graded as excellent and 13 graded as good in the allograft groups, and there were 14 graded as excellent and 8 graded as good in the autograft group. Furthermore, the knees of the allograft group and the autograft group were confirmed stable by physical examinations. The ADT revealed 25 patients (83.3%) as grade 0 and 5 patients (16.7%) as grade I in the allograft groups and 19 patients (86.4%) as grade 0 and 3 patients (13.6%) as grade I in the autograft group. For Lachman tests, the allograft group had 24 patients (80%) as grade 0 and 6 patients (20%) as grade I; meanwhile, the autograft group had 18 patients (81.8%) as grade 0 and 4 patients (18.2%) as grade I.</p>

<title>MRI Findings</title>
<p>All the participants were once again confirmed on MRI that there were neither ligament tears nor obvious cartilage defects in the operated knees. The ICC indexes of intraobserver reliabilities were 0.71 for position ratio of the graft, 0.98 for the ACL angle, 0.97 for the ACL–Blumensaat line angle, 0.88 for the graft width, and 0.82 for the graft SNQ value.</p>
<p>The position ratio of the graft demonstrated no significant difference between the allograft group and the autograft group (0.42 ± 0.04 vs 0.43 ± 0.02; <italic>P</italic> = .5908). Additionally, there was no significant difference between groups with respect to the ACL angle (65.0° ± 7.2° vs 66.9° ± 7.1°; <italic>P</italic> = .3458) or ACL–Blumensaat line angle (20.9° ± 6.2° vs 21.9° ± 8.3°; <italic>P</italic> = .6444), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512443050">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After ACL reconstruction, the intra-articular region of the tendon graft begins its incorporation process to the new environment, undergoes histological rearrangement due to biomechanical action, and transforms into a structure similar to the normal ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512443050">21</xref></sup> The earlier this process is completed, the more mature the reconstructed graft will become and the sooner the ACL substitute graft will meet its new loading demands, allowing the patient to resume earlier his or her sport activities. In this regard, graft maturity is a main concern in the orthopaedic field when using an autograft or allograft tendon for ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p>Given that 3.0-T MRI has higher SNR, better resolution, and shorter scan time when compared with 1.5-T MRI, we used 3.0-T MRI in the present study to investigate whether there was any difference in graft maturity between autografts and allografts after ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively. Here, the graft position and orientation were compared between groups. In addition, the graft width was calculated, and the SNQ value of the graft was used to investigate graft maturity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512443050">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443050">15</xref></sup> Quantitatively determined and normalized MRI signal intensity may be useful to investigate the remodeling process and predict mechanical properties of the graft after ACL reconstruction in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512443050">27</xref></sup> In the postoperative situation, the graft is seen as hypointense, and the signal intensity of the graft changes as the graft goes through revascularization and resynovialization during the postoperative 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512443050">28</xref></sup> Evaluation of the graft by MRI is much better and proper at 2 years postoperatively, for the graft usually looks like a normal ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512443050">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to our present results, it was found that the graft width revealed no significant difference between the allograft group and autograft group at the distal site, middle site, and proximal site, whereas the mean SNQ value of the allograft group was significantly higher than that of the autograft group at each site. Given that the graft placement and orientation demonstrated no significant difference between the autograft group and the allograft group, the different SNQ values might not be caused by the graft placement, and there might be other factors leading to the differences in graft signal intensity between groups in this study. In an animal study using merino sheep, it was found that allograft remodeling is delayed in ACL reconstruction and results in reduced long-term stability and mechanical function compared with autologous ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512443050">20</xref></sup> Malinin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443050">13</xref></sup> investigated entire allografts and observed that the central portions of the grafts remained acellular even at 2 years postoperatively, and they thought that the complete remodeling and cellular replacement of the entire allograft might require 3 years or longer. Thus, we concluded that the higher SNQ of the allograft tendons had a direct association with the poorer remodeling process after implantation when compared with the autograft tendons.</p>
<p>As reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512443050">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512443050">26</xref></sup> the remodeling process consists of 4 phases: initial avascular necrosis, revascularization, cellular repopulation, and finally remodeling. During this process, revascularization plays a key role by acting as a prerequisite for the other phases to be conducted and ensuring the long-term viability of the graft. Graft revascularization is present as early as 3 weeks after ACL reconstruction and increases in prevalence over the next 5 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443050">19</xref></sup> The synovial envelope–originated capillary vessels invade into the avascular graft tissue from the surface toward the center zone, reach the highest level after 6 weeks, and reach the vascular status of the native ACL after 24 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512443050">26</xref></sup> Revascularization is an important link in the intrinsic healing chain of the ACL graft. In a human study, Muramatsu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443050">15</xref></sup> used serial contrast-enhanced MRI to show that allogenic tendons become established and revascularize more slowly than do autologous tendons in ACL reconstruction. Given the different SNQ values between groups in our results, the difference in the revascularization between allograft and autograft tendons might have an influence on the graft remodeling process.</p>
<p>Earlier and better revascularization has a direct correlation with a reduction in signal intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512443050">10</xref></sup> It was believed that the difference in revascularization between the groups might have a direct influence on the signal intensity of the reconstructed graft postoperatively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the BPTB tendon or hamstring tendon graft undergoes ultrastructural reorganization in large and small fibrils at longer times after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512443050">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512443050">30</xref></sup> Given that the ultrastructure continues to undergo remodeling, the difference in ultrastructure resulted in the different SNQ values of the grafts between the allograft group and the autograft group, indicating that the allograft might have inferior graft maturity compared with the autograft tendon in ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively.</p>
<p>Weiler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512443050">27</xref></sup> compared the graft signal intensity and morphological characteristics on MRI with biomechanical and histological parameters in a long-term animal model, and they found that high-signal intensity on MRI reflected a decrease in mechanical properties of the graft during early remodeling. In our present study, all the participants in both of the groups had no sign of knee instability of the operated knees, whereas the 2 groups had different mean SNQ values postoperatively. It was presumed that the physical examinations, like ADT and Lachman test, might not completely reveal the mechanical property of the reconstructed graft. Furthermore, the higher SNQ value might indicate more inferior graft maturity and poorer mechanical property in the allograft when compared with the autograft. Caution should be given to the allograft-reconstructed participants with early full weightbearing in case of rerupture.</p>
<p>There were some limitations in this study. First, 2 types of fixation tools (Endobutton CL and Rigidfix cross pins) were used in the femoral tunnel. We admit that there would be an influence on tendon-to-bone healing in the femoral tunnel, whereas the distribution of the 2 types of femoral fixation was similar on the intra-articular site of the graft between groups. In addition, only hamstring autografts or anterior tibial tendon allografts were used in this cohort. It is unclear if there is any difference regarding other kinds of autografts or allografts, like BPTB. Given that the intra-articular site of different grafts is made of tendon fiber, there might be similar results when investigating other kinds of tendon grafts. Third, only male participants were recruited in this study. Therefore, our results might not represent the whole population. Future in-depth studies in this field would provide valuable information regarding female patients. Finally, all of the participants might have different activities. Given that not all of them are athletes and may return to normal sports activity as an amateur, it was presumed that the activity conditions were identical in this cohort.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Collectively, we found no significant difference in clinical findings between the allograft group and the autograft group, and there was also no significant difference between groups in graft width of the distal site, middle site, and proximal site. The allograft group had a significantly higher SNQ value compared with the autograft group in this study, indicating that allograft tendons might have inferior graft maturity compared with autograft tendons in ACL reconstruction at 2 years postoperatively.</p>
