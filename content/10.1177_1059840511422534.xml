<abstract>
<p>The school nurse plays a pivotal role in the assessment and treatment of selective mutism (SM), a rare disorder found in elementary school children. Due to anxiety, children with SM do not speak in uncomfortable situations, primarily the school setting. Diagnosis of SM is often missed in the formative years because the child does speak at home. Early diagnosis and treatment provide the key to addressing this rare disorder. The school nurse plays a critical role as a member of the Instructional Support Team (IST). The school nurse, as team liaison, provides communication between parents, school staff, and medical personnel. School nurses make a difference by advocating for the child with SM and possessing the necessary knowledge to effectively intervene. This article discusses a team approach to the assessment and treatment of SM and the role of the school nurse in the school setting.</p>

<body>
<p>Selective mutism (SM), a rare disorder found in children, was first documented in 1877 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511422534">Bergman, Piacentini, &amp; McCracken, 2002</xref>). Children diagnosed with this disorder participate in conversation in their home environment but remain silent in school and social settings. A child with SM presents with no underlying physical or psychological problems or speech and language disorders. Anxiety, often resulting from family genetics, contributes to the cause of SM. The silence becomes the child’s coping mechanism in an uncomfortable situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511422534">Joseph, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>SM occurs more often in girls than in boys, with onset generally occurring between the ages of 4 and 6. When the child enters school, usually between the ages of six and eight, the teacher identifies the silent child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840511422534">Sharkey &amp; McNicholas, 2008</xref>). SM occurs in 0.3 to 0.7 of every 1,000 school-age children. Many times pediatricians mistake SM for shyness or developmental delay. Often, this “wait and see” approach delays treatment and causes detrimental results for the child with SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840511422534">Schwartz &amp; Shipon-Blum, 2005</xref>). Treatment delays may occur until 4 years after a confirmed diagnosis often because the pediatrician is unfamiliar with the disorder and treatment regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511422534">Kumpulainen, Rasanen, Raaska, &amp; Somppi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840511422534">Schwartz, Freedy, &amp; Sheridan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The diagnosis of SM becomes evident when the child enters school and communication in the classroom is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511422534">Joseph, 1999</xref>). This article will address a team approach in the school setting for assessing and treating this uncommon childhood mental health disorder.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840511422534">
<title>History</title>
<p>SM was first described as the inability to speak in a person who was capable of speech. The disorder was called “aphasia voluntaria” because the individual voluntarily chose not to speak. The disorder was later defined as elective mutism as it was believed that the individual with this disorder elected not to speak. In 1980, the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM) identified SM as a separate clinical diagnosis and not a communication disorder. The name of this disorder changed to selective mutism in 1994 because the person was capable of speaking, but chose not to speak in select settings. In the 2000 DSM edition, SM is classified in “Disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence,” under “Other disorders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511422534">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840511422534">Selective Mutism Foundation, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Pediatric literature did not address this disorder until the late 1990s. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511422534">Joseph (1999)</xref>, most information on SM appears in psychiatric, psychology, social work, counseling, or communication journals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840511422534">
<title>Etiology</title>
<p>Theorists have addressed many reasons for the cause of SM. Psychodynamic theorists view SM as a result of unresolved conflict with parents or physical or psychological trauma. Children stuck in the oral or anal stage of development want to punish their parents by not speaking in certain situations. The mutism presents as a coping mechanism for the anger and anxiety the child exhibits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511422534">Giddan, Ross, Sechler, &amp; Becker, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavioral theorists view SM as negatively reinforced learned behaviors. The child’s refusal to speak does not draw the teacher’s attention as they conform to classroom behavior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511422534">Krysanski, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Other theorists identify social anxiety, conflict in family relationships, and heredity as contributing to the cause of SM. Many children with SM have a family member with social phobias. Theorists came to the conclusion that anxiety causes SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511422534">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511422534">
<title>Comorbidities</title>
<p>Social anxiety is a significant underlying factor in children diagnosed with SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511422534">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511422534">Dummit, Klein, Tancer, Asche, &amp; Martin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511422534">Kearney &amp; Vecchio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511422534">Kristensen, 2000</xref>). Current research supports other inhibitors that cause lack of speech in SM such as language and speech delays, developmental delays, oppositional disorders, and Asperger’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511422534">Cohan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511422534">Kristensen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511422534">Kumpulainen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511422534">Manassis et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511422534">Kumpulainen et al. (1998)</xref> conducted a pilot study regarding the prevalence of SM in second graders (34/2,434 or 2%) based on teacher’s response to questionnaires. Of the 38 children identified, 49% were average, 19% were above average, and 32% were below average in school performance. The development of language skills was normal in 66% of the children, 34% were considered below normal according to teacher’s input.</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511422534">Manassis et al. (2003)</xref> compared 23 children with a diagnosis of social phobia or SM for anxiety, academic ability, and language ability and comprehension. There was no difference between the groups in the areas of anxiety and academic ability, but the SM group displayed mild language impairment compared to the children with social phobia. The researchers noted the speech and language deficits can occur over time as a result of the SM.</p>
<p>In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511422534">Kristensen (2000)</xref>, 54 children with a diagnosis of SM by <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) and 108 children in a control group were evaluated for developmental disorder/delay in language and cognition, anxiety, and elimination disorders. About 68% of the children with SM met the criteria for developmental disorder/delay diagnosis compared with 13% in the control group, <italic>p</italic> = .000. An anxiety diagnosis was confirmed in 74.1% of the SM group compared with 7.4% in the control group, <italic>p</italic> = .000. Elimination disorders (enuresis and encopresis) were noted in 31.5% of the SM group compared to 9.3% in the control group, <italic>p</italic> = .000 to .003. This study concluded that developmental disorder/delay occurred with SM just as often as anxiety disorder and SM. It was further noted that SM is influenced by underlying comorbidities.</p>
<p>Studies done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511422534">Black and Uhde (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511422534">Dummit et al. (1996)</xref> disputed oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as contributing to SM. ODD was considered a coping mechanism not to speak versus an underlying cause of SM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511422534">Buzzella, Ehrenreich-May, and Pincus (2011)</xref> concurred that ODD was not a significant factor in SM when compared to a control group of children in their study.</p>
<p>Limitations of these studies need to be taken into consideration. Most participants were from psychiatric clinics or anxiety centers and currently in treatment for SM or anxiety. Children with SM from clinics and treatment centers may exhibit more severe symptoms than children with SM in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511422534">Kristensen, 2000</xref>). Although children with SM may exhibit other comorbidities, these conditions are often observed in addition to, but not in conjunction with, the underlying anxiety disorder that is the primary cause of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511422534">Cohan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1059840511422534">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>A review of the literature noted that SM presents a challenge regarding its initial diagnosis. In addition to lack of speech in uncomfortable settings, children with SM exhibit other symptoms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511422534">Giddan et al. (1997)</xref> noted extreme shyness, fearfulness, social isolation, impulsive traits, a negative outlook, dependency, temper tantrums, and controlling or oppositional behaviors in these children. The teacher praises the child who behaves and does not cause problems in the classroom. Children with SM do not bring attention to themselves and blend into the classroom setting and are often overlooked which contributes to delayed referral and diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511422534">Krysanski, 2003</xref>). With pediatricians often missing the diagnosis, schools must have programs in place to get SM students diagnosed quickly. Programs should include the educators who see these students in preschool and elementary school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell &amp; Marc, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840511422534">Schwartz et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Diagnostic criteria for SM are described in the 2000 <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>. The characteristics of SM include: Refusal to speak in public places although speech occurs in the home environment; absence of speech is longer than 1 month not including the first month of school; problems are not related to understanding the language or speaking disability; lack of speech affects children academically and socially; and absence of a communication, developmental, or psychiatric disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511422534">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511422534">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment for SM has proven difficult. While no single treatment can cure SM—a combination of cognitive behavior therapy and medication has proven effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511422534">Black &amp; Uhde, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511422534">Dow, Sonies, Scheib, Moss, &amp; Leonard, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-1059840511422534">
<title>Behavior Modification</title>
<p>SM children avoid speech to alleviate their anxiety in the school or social setting. This learned behavior provides comfort in an uncomfortable situation. The goals of a behavioral approach include decreasing anxiety and increasing verbalization in public places. Use of a behavioral approach to encourage the child to speak requires that the treatment progresses gradually. Initially, the child can communicate in the classroom via nonverbal responses (gestures, writing, cue cards), with progression to mouthing words, whispering, and the eventual response of speaking aloud. Teachers should reward eye contact, following directions, and participation in classroom activities even if they are nonverbal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840511422534">Schrum, 2002</xref>). Rewards can be verbal praise, a homework coupon, or a small prize.</p>
<p>Behavior therapy includes contingency management, stimulus fading, shaping, and response cost procedure. These interventions reward the child for interacting verbally in public places. Contingency management gradually provides the child with opportunities to verbalize and rewards the action when initiated. This could include activities such as ordering in a restaurant or talking on the phone. The goal involves eventual movement of the speaking situations to the school environment. The expected response results in a reward while the nonverbal response is not reinforced or rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511422534">Giddan et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimulus fading provides a controlled speaking situation where the SM child converses with a key person, usually a parent, in a familiar environment. As treatment progresses, a new environment, where the child does not speak, is introduced and the key person fades out as a new person enters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511422534">Cohan, Chavira, &amp; Stein, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Shaping rewards efforts of speech, such as mouthing words and whispering. Shaping is the process in which behaviors are gradually changed or shaped into the desired behavior (verbalization) by rewarding efforts to communicate aloud. This includes mouthing words, whispering, and the eventual goal of responding in a normal tone of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511422534">Hagermoser Sanetti &amp; Luiselli, 2009</xref>). Response cost procedures take rewards away for not speaking. A student may need consistent behaviors for a set amount of time to earn the reward. If the expected behavior does not occur, rewards are denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511422534">Cohan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavior modification includes cognitive behavioral therapy that utilizes six techniques: systematic desensitization, positive reinforcement, modeling, fading, guided imagery, and graded real-life exposures. All of these interventions involve building the child’s confidence and decreasing anxiety through a reward system, relaxation exercises, hypnosis, and role-playing with a clinical therapist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511422534">Krysanski, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Systematic desensitization is utilized as a therapeutic intervention to reduce anxiety and stress in social situations. In systematic desensitization, for example, close family members are invited to a social event at the child’s home. As the child becomes more comfortable with verbalizing at home, the next social event would include one or two children the child feels comfortable around. The goal is to widen the social circle to include a small group of neighbors or school friends. The home serves as a point of comfort for the child. Positive reinforcement uses praise and small rewards for behavior that reinforces verbalization. This technique is based on the behavioral principle that behavior that is rewarded will be replicated again. Modeling involves the therapist role modeling for the child how to react calmly in a stressful situation, first in a controlled situation then in real life. This technique also utilizes videotaped snippets as a tool for teaching. Fading is utilized after modeling is accomplished. In fading, the therapist’s primary role is gradually reduced until there is no involvement between the therapist and the child. In guided imagery, the therapist guides the child through a stressful situation using the child’s imagination. The child and therapist interact and decide how to handle the situation presented. This technique decreases the child’s anxiety level by preparing the child to cope with a stressful situation through imagination. Graded real-life exposure involves role-playing in public places between the SM child and the therapist. The child interacts in the least threatening social situation with the therapist and gradually moves to more stressful situations, each time gaining coping skills for the situation. According to parents, cognitive behavior therapy resulted in successful treatment of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840511422534">Schwartz &amp; Shipon-Blum, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840511422534">
<title>Pharmacotherapy</title>
<p>In addition to behavior modification, pharmacotherapy has proven beneficial in the treatment of SM. In a summary of the literature on treatments with medication, the results of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) drugs were encouraging. The studies did note limitations that included a small number of participants and short time frames. Prior research has used psychosocial therapy combined with medication administration for the treatment of SM. Their review found that SSRI drugs work on serotonin imbalance and reported improvement 4–6 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Follow-up at 6 months posttreatment showed no regression when off medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511422534">Carlson, Mitchell, &amp; Segool, 2008</xref>). It is of importance to note that pharmacotherapy is not a first-line choice of treatment in SM and should be used in addition to psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511422534">Kumpulainen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511422534">Black and Uhde (1994)</xref> conducted a double-blind study on the use of fluoxetine in 15 children with SM for 12 weeks. The control group consisted of nine children and the fluoxetine group had six children. Though the fluoxetine groups had significant signs of improvement on parent and teacher global change scales in the area of mutism and anxiety, both groups still exhibited many symptoms of SM. With minimal drug side effects observed, recommendations included further research.</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511422534">Motavelli (1995)</xref> discussed fluoxetine administration in a 12-year-old girl with SM for 8 years. She had not spoken to family members since age 4 and became a social recluse. Treatment consisted of a placebo for 13 days with no response. After treatment with medication, the child engaged in vocalization with family members and her doctor within 2 weeks. Observations revealed nonspecific drug side effects and discontinuation of drug at 6 weeks with positive results.</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511422534">Dummit et al. (1996)</xref> evaluated children with SM over a 9-week period. Of the children entering the study, 21 had psychosocial therapy with no change in symptoms. After treatment with fluoxetine, in addition to weekly psychotherapy visits, 76% of the participants showed significant improvement and a decrease in their anxiety.</p>
<p>Treatment of SM with SSRI drugs, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, or citalopram, has been effective and safe as long as the child is monitored closely by their physician for adverse side effects. Several studies on the use of fluoxetine in children with SM reported favorable results, including decreasing anxiety and increasing verbalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511422534">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). However, the use of SSRIs for treating SM has been limited as SSRIs are typically prescribed to children diagnosed with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511422534">Hamrin &amp; Seahill, 2005</xref>). Despite the success of these drugs, physicians choose not to prescribe SSRIs to children due to the potential risk of suicide or self-harm. The Black Box Warning issued in 2004, regarding suicidal thoughts and actions in children under 18, alarms and concerns parents. The stigma of a mental health diagnosis deters parents in seeking medication intervention. The American Psychiatric Association has published guidelines that children prescribed SSRI drugs must have frequent (weekly) follow-up appointments with their physician in the first 3 months of treatment. The package literature also suggests follow-up for 12 weeks. As of 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no recommendations for the treatment of SM and social phobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511422534">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511422534">Hamrin &amp; Seahill, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>A Team Approach to Treatment</title>
<p>A team approach should include reducing anxiety and gradually increasing the form of communication with the goal of vocalization. The team approach in the school environment to deal with students with SM has proven effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger, Bartley, Armstrong, Kaatz, &amp; Benson, 2007</xref>). The teacher refers a student to the Instructional Support Team (IST) because of limited verbal interactions in the classroom that interferes with academic success. The team’s primary members are the principal, the student’s classroom teacher, and the instructional support teacher. The secondary members are the school nurse, guidance counselor, and the speech and language teacher. The IST, a collaborative effort between the team educators and parents, enables the student to successfully integrate in the general curriculum in the regular classroom. The initial process includes a meeting between the classroom teacher, parents, and IST members. Collection of baseline data, input from parents, and no more than three measurable goals are established to assist the child in the classroom. Evaluation of vision, hearing, and speech assessment completed by the school nurse and speech pathologist rules out an underlying language disorder. Recommendation of evaluation by the pediatrician and completion of the evaluation also rules out any underlying medical causes. The team reevaluates the student’s progress after 30 days, and if interventions are unsuccessful, recommendations include counseling and referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist. This referral can be done sooner if warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840511422534">The Child Advocate, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Once diagnosed, the IST needs to consider a 504 plan and an Individual Health Plan (IHP) for the student. The 504 plan guarantees that strategies recommended will be followed in the classroom. This requires written parent authorization; either the school or the parent can make the recommendation for a 504 plan. A federal law, a 504 Education Plan, provides classroom accommodations for a student with a documented medical disability who does not qualify for special education. The school’s obligations include providing the student with a regular education in the least restrictive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511422534">U.S. Department of Education, n.d.)</xref>.</p>
<p>The IHP contains measurable goals that the school nurse completes for the student. The teachers involved in the child’s daily instruction receive a copy of the IHP goals and interventions. One measurable goal for a student with SM would be a decrease of the child’s anxiety level based on number of physical symptoms observed daily. The goal is to see a decrease in symptoms of anxiety in a specific time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840511422534">Schrum, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Several interventions used successfully in the classroom to decrease the student’s anxiety and provide situations for verbalization include: A nurturing environment, allowance of nonverbal responses initially, preferential seating, placement away from the center of the classroom, and small group sessions with a close friend. It is important for the IST to work with the parents to identify a teacher with the skills and motivation to meet the needs of the child diagnosed with SM. The principal has the final authority on teacher assignment. The teacher needs to establish a rapport with the student by allowing the student to visit the classroom with parents either before or after school. Further, the teacher needs to acknowledge the student’s fears and assure a safe environment. Other strategies that the teacher should use include allowing the child to use alternative forms of communication (writing, gestures, pointing) and remaining positive when interacting with the student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell &amp; Marc, 2006</xref>). Rewards for expected behavior could be a coupon for no homework or teacher’s helper for the day.</p>
<p>If interventions are not working, the teacher and IST need to reevaluate and use alternative ideas. The use of a therapeutic support specialist or teacher’s aide presents as another alternative. A therapeutic support specialist provides individualized service to the child with SM, directs the child to use appropriate behavior, and may be of value as the key person who helps the student comfortably interact in the school setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell &amp; Marc, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Classroom Interventions</title>
<p>Numerous school personnel are involved in the treatment of the student with SM. Students with SM benefit from a combination of a team approach in addition to classroom interventions instituted by the teacher. SM persists because of symptoms felt due to anxiety. In working with a child with SM, the teacher’s primary responsibility consists of reducing the feelings of anxiety within the child and rewarding success, no matter how small. This anxiety causes children with SM to withdraw and find comfort in their silence. Teachers need to display certain qualities when interacting with the child by providing a nurturing environment in the classroom and qualities such as kindness, patience, and understanding. Teachers need to convey an understanding attitude to the child with SM, and show support for efforts to speak aloud when ready. The teacher can assign the child to a buddy, usually a close friend or an outgoing student in small group activities, so that the child can develop a bond with that friend or student. The teacher should allow nonverbal responses but be consistent with the student that the final goal is vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell &amp; Marc, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511422534">Johnson &amp; Wintgens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840511422534">Schwartz &amp; Shipon-Blum, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511422534">Giddan et al. (1997)</xref> discussed several additional interventions to assist the teacher in the classroom. The teacher must establish a bond with the student and must encourage a progression of responses from nonverbal to verbal; have a reward system in place for the student; utilize various places in the school for speaking opportunities including the library, cafeteria, and computer lab without limiting opportunities to one area. Finally, if an intervention is unsuccessful, try a different approach.</p>
<p>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell and Marc (2006)</xref> identified five successful interventions utilized in the school setting. The reward system provided motivation and encouragement to speak. Involvement of important people in the child’s life, particularly parents helped ease transition into the classroom. Allow the child and parent to enter the school during off hours, either before or after school to practice speaking in unfamiliar areas. Once comfortable in an area move to a new location, this activity denotes fading. Obviously, provide the student with a variety of speaking opportunities. Finally, monitor the progress and evaluate interventions defined by the team for success in the classroom. Be consistent in your expectations from the child.</p>
<p>The teacher needs to establish classroom rules in regard to the student with SM. Children in the class may want to help the child with SM by intervening for them, but this reinforces the unhealthy behavior and should be discouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511422534">Giddan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511422534">Johnson &amp; Wintgens, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1059840511422534">
<title>The School Nurse Role</title>
<p>The school nurse plays a vital role in the treatment and success of the child with SM. School nurses make a difference by advocating for the child with SM and possessing the necessary knowledge to intervene effectively. The nurse’s knowledge of SM proves invaluable when providing guidance and education to parents, teachers, and classmates in helping the child with SM. Educate parents and teachers clarifying that the child suffers from anxiety and cannot speak, how this disorder impacts learning, and intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840511422534">Schum, 2002</xref>). This understanding encourages parents and teachers to offer support to the child and prevent further anxiety. Education can decrease the frustration felt by school personnel and parents in their interactions with the child. The school nurse can provide a lesson to the class on SM and how to effectively help their classmate. This includes not speaking for the child or answering for them, not making a big deal when they first speak, and not bringing attention to the student when other people enter the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511422534">Johnson &amp; Wintgens, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The school nurse acts as a liaison between the IST, parents, and medical staff (psychologist/psychiatrist), communicating necessary information regarding improvements observed in the child at school. The nurse conveys the teacher’s observations of the student in the classroom settings and report’s findings to the student’s parents and physician. It is important to have two-way communication between all individuals. Written parental consent is necessary for this to occur with any outside agency or individual. Through regular team meetings, goals of the behavior plan are reevaluated frequently and changed if necessary. Parents need reassurance from the school nurse when suggested interventions fail. If students are put on psychotropic medication, the school nurse monitors the student for side effects such as stomach upset, nausea, and behavior changes and the classroom teacher records improvement of behaviors. The school nurse needs to be aware that the student with SM may be a frequent visitor to the nurse and utilize this outlet to avoid anxiety-producing situations in the classroom. Once the disorder is identified, the IST must consider the development of a 504 plan and IHP for the diagnosed student with SM to succeed in the classroom, as well as the assignment of a teacher’s aide or therapeutic support specialist to assist the child. Additionally, the school nurse can assist parents in understanding the myriad of services available to assist them in helping their child academically, socially, and emotionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511422534">Borger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511422534">Crundwell &amp; Marc, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511422534">Omdal, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SM, a childhood disorder, often becomes misdiagnosed as shyness or a developmental delay. The diagnosis and treatment of children with SM must start at an early age before the silence becomes a conditioned behavior. <italic>DSM IV-TR</italic> (2000) has standard written criteria for diagnosis of SM. Since diagnosis of children with SM usually occurs when they enter kindergarten, the importance of educating teachers in recognizing this disorder becomes essential. Responsibilities of the school nurse include educating the staff on various medical disorders to serve the needs of the students. Parental involvement remains essential in treatment because many important decisions include them. The school nurse plays a pivotal role as educator, resource person, and team liaison between key personnel. Development of a 504 plan and an IHP guarantee that recommended strategies will be followed in the classroom.</p>
<p>Many theories to the successful treatment of SM have been addressed. Due to the nature and time frame of the studies, rarity of the disease, and small number of participants, these studies have provided inconclusive evidence. Trials of different treatments, such as behavior modification and pharmacotherapy, particularly SSRI drugs, have had positive outcomes. A team approach used for assessment and treatment has been successful in the school setting. Decreasing the child’s anxiety and promoting speech production remains the goal of treatment.</p>
