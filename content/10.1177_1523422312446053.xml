<title>Human Resource Development</title>
<p>Many definitions and contexts of Human Resource Development (HRD) have been articulated by various scholars. The understanding of HRD has evolved to include the notion of International Human Resource Development (IHRD), also known as National HRD (NHRD). This article will discuss NHRD within the context of the human trafficking phenomenon for the purpose of integrating HRD principles toward a solution. Specifically, the HRD principles of education and training and development will be explored in terms of utility for human trafficking prevention.</p>
<p>For the purpose of improving performance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446053">Swanson and Holton (2009)</xref> described HRD as a method to develop and release human knowledge. From a global perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312446053">Wang and McLean (2007)</xref> offered the following overarching definition for IHRD:
<disp-quote><p>International HRD (also known, perhaps more appropriately, as cross-national HRD, transnational HRD, and global HRD) is a field of study and practice that focuses on for-profit, not-for-profit, and/or governmental entities and individuals cooperating in some form across national borders. The purpose of this interaction is systematically to tap existing human potential and intentionally shape work-based, community-based, society-based, culture-based, and politically based expertise through multiple means for the purpose of improving cross-national relationships collaboratively across all involved entities through greater mutual understanding, improved individual and organizational performance, improved standards of living and quality of life, reduced conflict between entities and individuals, and any other criteria that would be deemed useful by the involved entities. International HRD is aspirational rather than realized and serves as a challenge for continuous efforts at improvement (p. 105).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This inclusive account of NHRD serves as the foundation to integrate HRD to guide antitrafficking efforts. From the global HRD lens, the challenges inherent in combating human trafficking are presented as well as applications for HRD, from a community development perspective, to address this global, societal issue that affects countries worldwide.</p>

<title>Statement of the Problem</title>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</p>
<attrib>Martin Luther King Jr., 1963</attrib></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Human trafficking, or trafficking in persons, is a form of modern-day slavery. Millions of people around the world are victims of this crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446053">DeStefano, 2007</xref>). Slavery is as old as human civilization. The conclusion of the Civil War helped to facilitate the ending of slavery in the United States. As such, in January of 1865, the Thirteenth amendment was passed and implemented to abolish slavery. Internationally, the practice of slavery was banned by several agreements and treaties, beginning in 1926 with the Slavery Convention of the League of Nations. However, human beings, including children, continue to be bought and sold in the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the literature, human trafficking is synonymous with modern-day slavery, the global slave trade, trafficking in human beings, and trafficking in persons. Human trafficking supplies human beings for prostitution, sex work, sweatshop labor, domestic work, marriage, agricultural work, construction, armed conflicts (child soldiers), and other forms of exploitive labor or services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446053">Jones, Engstrom, Hilliard, &amp; Diaz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312446053">United Nations General Assembly (2000)</xref> provided an internationally accepted definition of human trafficking:
<disp-quote><p>Trafficking in persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs (p. 32).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) and its 2003, 2005, and 2008 reauthorizations are the first comprehensive federal legislation in the United States to guide antihuman trafficking efforts and to assist victims of human trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2008</xref>). The TVPA defines severe forms of trafficking as
<disp-quote><p>a. sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age; or b. the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2008</xref>, p. 6)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Significance of the Problem</title>
<p>Every country in the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit, or destination. United Nations data indicate that, after Italy, the primary destination nation for human trafficking victims is the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446053">Hodge, 2008</xref>). Estimating with any accuracy the number of victims of human trafficking is a discouraging task and according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), accurate statistics may be unachievable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446053">UNODC, 2006</xref>). Despite this, organizations and scholars offer widely ranging approximations of its prevalence. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 12.3 million people in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, and sexual servitude at any given time around the globe. Other estimates range from four million to 27 million worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446053">Bales, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last decade, human trafficking has changed from an almost unknown and largely unreported phenomenon to a widespread global issue. Human trafficking is now considered the second largest and fastest growing illegal industry in the world, surpassing every other criminal enterprise except the drug and arms trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312446053">Schauer and Wheaton (2006)</xref> argued that human trafficking was even more lucrative than drug trafficking since it carried fewer risks. Moreover, unlike illicit drugs, humans may be sold and resold often countless times in one day. The direct cost to society from the crime of human trafficking remains difficult to quantify. Aside from representing a severe form of human rights abuse, human trafficking impacts multiple levels of society with implications for individuals, communities, and countries. From a global perspective, human trafficking jeopardizes the health, safety, and security of all countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Solution</title>
<p>Human trafficking is a complex problem. It is far-reaching, involves multiple dimensions, and necessitates an integrated approach. As such, we assert that an approach for addressing human trafficking must incorporate HRD practices, including training and development for communities and first responders as well as educational materials for outreach and awareness purposes. Because HRD has been acknowledged for its role in addressing societal and national issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446053">Cho &amp; McLean, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446053">McLean &amp; McLean, 2001</xref>), its integration is crucial in the plight to end human trafficking. This article seeks to offer a preliminary context for the use of HRD, and more precisely, NHRD, to build the foundation for its utility as an intervention strategy.</p>
<p>In examining potential solutions for the problem of human trafficking, we emphasize the need for the implementation of prevention strategies beginning at a community level. The best way to protect against human trafficking is to prevent it from happening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446053">Connelly, Sankaran, Swift-Morgan, &amp; Tengfei, 2004</xref>). Directing efforts on prevention, through HRD and community building, will help to form stronger communities, less susceptible to harm caused by human trafficking. Prevention efforts must focus on increased education and training to facilitate greater awareness and understanding of the problem and to help with victim identification.</p>
<p>The key stakeholders this article seeks to inform are service providers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community development and HRD practitioners, and first responders. These stakeholders have been identified as they represent groups of people capable of influencing work and/or best practices with this population or because they are most likely to come into contact with victims of human trafficking (i.e., first responders).</p>

<title>The Framework</title>
<p>This article poses a framework for the application of HRD to the human trafficking problem modeled by the U.S. State Departmentâs TVPA policy approach to combat human trafficking. Specifically, the authors posit the parallel between HRD and community development with NGOs and community members. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446053">Samarasinghe and Burton (2007)</xref>, preventative antitrafficking initiatives need to be skillfully integrated into existing community development practices for individuals and communities at risk.</p>
<p>The TVPA operates from a three-pronged, âThree P Approachâ to <italic>protect</italic> victims, to <italic>prosecute</italic> human traffickers, and to <italic>prevent</italic> human trafficking worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2008</xref>). Governments and international organizations have declared that an effective response to human trafficking must include these elements. For the purpose of this article and the relevance of HRD to human trafficking, prevention and the integration of HRD practices will be further explored as the basis of the framework.</p>

<title>National Human Resource Development and Human Trafficking</title>
<p>Severe poverty remains the single most dominant factor in becoming a target of human trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446053">Logan, Walker, &amp; Hunt, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446053">McLean (2004)</xref> described NHRD as encompassing health, culture, safety, community, and other considerations that expanded beyond employment, employment preparation, and generally are not included in human capital investment. More recently, many nations are including education, health, safety, and other factors in the meaning of NHRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446053">McLean, Bartlett, &amp; Cho, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446053">Lynham and Cunningham (2006)</xref> discussed the significance of NHRD focusing on developing human expertise to improve the health, wealth, and well-being of global communities. Furthermore, the idea of NHRD has been promulgated as an effective approach to reduce disparities around the world and to reach the United Nationâs Millennium Development Goals by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446053">McLean, 2006</xref>). Many of these goals, such as eradicating extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, and promoting gender equality, are directly related to conditions that parallel the human trafficking problem.</p>
<p>In exploring NHRD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446053">Cho and McLean (2004)</xref> challenge the field of HRD to refocus its research and devote greater attention to larger issues that affect entire countries. They posit the question, âWhy should we dream for less for our nations, our regions, and our common humanity than what we dream for individuals and organizations?â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446053">Cho &amp; McLean, 2004</xref>, p. 391).This vision guides the current article.</p>
<p>Drawing on the tenets of HRD, from a NHRD lens, we assert its importance and relevance to combating human trafficking, specifically beginning at the community level. The notion of NHRD represents a logical framework in which one can examine larger societal issues, such as human trafficking. For the purpose of this article, we argue for NHRD as a platform to improve humanity and combat human trafficking through leveraging valuable human resources.</p>
<p>Too often, human trafficking is hidden from sight and invisible to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of Education (2007)</xref>, one of the best methods to combat human trafficking is through awareness-raising and victim identification. Implementing HRD to foster greater education and training related to what human trafficking is, what it entails, and how to recognize victims is critically needed. Well-targeted awareness campaigns and educational strategies serve as the platform for preventative measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446053">Samarasinghe &amp; Burton, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1523422312446053">
<title>Education and Training and Development</title>
<p>Human trafficking involves severe violations of human rights paired with challenges in understanding the nature and complexity of the phenomenon. A significant barrier to this understanding is the lack of education and awareness of the issue. This lack of awareness and education about human trafficking renders service providers, community members, and law enforcement ill prepared with the requisite knowledge base to identify victims and to recognize it within communities. It is this deficit in knowledge and skills that validates the need to incorporate HRD techniques and practitioners.</p>
<p>Widely accepted, is the fact that vast disparities exist among individuals, communities, and nations. Some of these disparities include wealth, education, infrastructure, technology, safety, and employment, all of which play a role in human trafficking. It has become evident that typically the victim movement shifts from less developed to more developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312446053">U.S. Department of State, 2010</xref>). Human trafficking depends on there being source countries with people seeking better economic opportunities and destination countries with individuals or industries demanding cheap labor or cheap prostitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446053">Shinkle, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Roots of human trafficking are grounded in structural and systematic issues that make women vulnerable, with significant disadvantages in terms of poverty, education, and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446053">Samarasinghe &amp; Burton, 2007</xref>). Because statistics assert 80% of trafficking victims are female and 50% are children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446053">Jones et al., 2007</xref>), the issue of gender and vulnerable populations must be considered.</p>
<p>Increased education generally results in greater employment opportunities, both of which help to alleviate poverty. Fundamental to addressing the vulnerability of women and children is a focus on prevention strategies aimed at raising awareness as well as generating opportunity for a better quality of life. HRD principles, including universal education and vocational programs, can be leveraged to reduce vulnerability to human trafficking. Moreover, since the first step toward effective prevention of human trafficking requires awareness of the issue, educational campaigns, trainings focusing on victim identification and increased outreach to vulnerable populations serve as essential tenets of prevention.</p>
<p>The HRD principles of education and training and development are logically transferable to prevention of human trafficking. These tools are pertinent to increase awareness and outreach and provide training and development resources to service providers and other key first responders. Training and development must focus on both awareness (e.g., the human, social, and economic costs of human trafficking) and on the possible alternative actions toward the elimination of the problem (e.g., reducing the incentive for the source, both by economic and punitive disincentives). Of course, the expertise of HRD and training specialists should be brought to bear in the design of training and education in this area as in any element of professional endeavor. Careful planning and the engagement of those involved in dealing with the human trafficking problem are essential to any effective design.</p>
<p>Human resource and training specialists are well-equipped to work with human trafficking policy and prevention as well as law enforcement organizations by employing effective tools of the trade such as the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446053">Grafinger, 1988</xref>). There is a vital need for monitoring and follow up to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446053">Samarasinghe &amp; Burton, 2007</xref>). The ADDIE Model represents a viable HRD tool to examine sustainable preventative strategies, and further, to address the root causes of human trafficking. Regardless of the specific design and delivery methods, any training and development program should focus on the outcome of social, and probably, political change to assist in solving this global issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1523422312446053">
<title>Community Development</title>
<p>Historically, the practice of community development emerged during the middle of the 20th century in the context of European colonization and economic development of Third World countries in the Global South with a commitment toward raising the incomes of poor communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446053">Brokensha &amp; Hodge, 1969</xref>). The contemporary practice of community development has now been broadened to include training to promote literacy, leadership development, and the strengthening of community ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446053">Midgley &amp; Livermore, 2005</xref>). Relative to HRD, community development necessitates training and development, and is considered an alternative route to training and educating community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446053">van der Veen, 2003</xref>). In developing countries, HRD has been utilized for community development and nation building purposes. As well, it has been recognized for its utility to address social concerns and societal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446053">Cho &amp; McLean, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Community development is especially suitable for leveraging talent and addressing the problem from an integrated, effective platform. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446053">Budhwani and McLean (2005)</xref>, HRD efforts at the community level ultimately contribute to HRD efforts at the national level. Integrating HRD principles, especially education and training and development, builds a platform to address societal issues, specifically, human trafficking. Some of the most promising approaches to prevention involve training and collaboration among NGOs, communities, and government agencies to strengthen local capacity and to increase the knowledge and understanding of human trafficking and its detrimental effects on individuals and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446053">Connelly et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, community development and human trafficking prevention, involving coordination and close cooperation with local organizations, generally results in greater rates of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312446053">United Nations Childrenâs Fund, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Approaches and polices to address the structural causes of human trafficking are critically needed. Community networking, capacity building, and trainings for law-enforcement groups, legal professionals, educators, and community leaders are fundamental to the approach. Common prevention practices include awareness raising and information distribution, empowerment through education, income generation, and job training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446053">Samarasinghe &amp; Burton, 2007</xref>).Antitrafficking training and capacity building will assist in developing the capability of local communities to prevent trafficking and to strengthen the ability of key stakeholders with victim identification efforts. These mutually complimentary initiatives fit well within the HRD paradigm and serve as recommendations for NHRD interventions to address human trafficking.</p>

<sec id="section12-1523422312446053">
<title>Implications for Human Resource Development</title>
<p>The value of HRD and its application to the human trafficking problem remains to be fully explored and reviewed. There is a lack of research and literature around HRD efforts in connection with human trafficking. However, by expanding scholarship and current understandings of expertise and challenges in existing approaches, we offer an alternative solution.</p>
<p>The solution proposed includes leveraging well-known, proven techniques, tools, and practices widely applied within the HRD field for combating human trafficking at the community level. Education and training will lead to greater awareness and ultimately contribute to the prevention of human trafficking as well as better victim identification measures. The implementation of NHRD to address human trafficking challenges HRD scholars to work not only within a community context but also alongside community members and organizations. This notion provides a springboard for future research and for HRD practitioners to move beyond traditional frameworks toward more complex, global issues.</p>
<sec id="section13-1523422312446053">
<title>HRD Practice</title>
<p>This article contributes to HRD practice as practitioners require greater understanding and a larger knowledge base of the human trafficking phenomenon and its implications. Training and development efforts necessitate the acquisition of appropriate skills, tools, and techniques to address human trafficking. The facilitation of community development will help to build stronger communities, less susceptible to the harm and destruction of human trafficking. HRD practitioners will be in a unique position to inform stakeholders and provide training and education to first responders as well as NGOs, grassroots, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>Practitioners represent a group of people capable of impacting antihuman trafficking efforts, on many levels. Practitioners, equipped with the tools and skills, will be influential in the community development approach and in the change process. Community development requires community involvement and participation and HRD practitioners will provide the structure and support along with key resources for successful implementation. Through collaboration and partnerships, HRD practice will move forward in innovative ways to redirect focus on larger, societal issues that impact individuals and communities worldwide.</p>

<title>HRD Theory and Research</title>
<p>This article contributes to HRD theory by exploring the frequently misunderstood phenomenon of human trafficking that is nevertheless gaining presence in the research and literature. We present an initial framework for the theoretical development of HRD and human trafficking and expand on the theoretical understanding of the topic as well as the societal ramifications of its presence. Additionally, this article elucidates the theoretical underpinnings of HRD through the human trafficking lens. We build on the existing literature on the integration of HRD to societal development by introducing a new problem, human trafficking, and posing HRD as a solution. Specifically, a preliminary theoretical foundation for the use of NHRD in connection with the global issue of human trafficking is presented. As such, there are many opportunities to further theory development and to explore the various factors associated with human trafficking and the theoretical implications. A closer examination of slavery in modern society as well as the structural and systematic variables embedded in human trafficking will contribute to the theoretical foundation.</p>
<p>This article contributes to HRD research by covering a newly defined area of HRD. While research on human trafficking is increasing, literature from the HRD field remains weak. This article builds the case for the importance of HRD in addressing the growing societal concern of human trafficking. Further research will strengthen the body of knowledge on human trafficking as well as add new insight on a relatively contemporary topic for HRD. Explicitly, this article advances the research related to NHRD from a community development and human trafficking frame. By expanding on the current literature, HRD practitioners and scholars will be in a unique position to raise awareness and educate communities and stakeholders.</p>
<p>This article represents a new, introductory and exploratory approach to HRD research and its potential impact on the human trafficking problem. Because roots are embedded within structural foundations in society, which contribute to the vulnerability of women (e.g., poverty, education, and employment), many opportunities exist for NHRD research for societal development. The core HRD principles of education and training and development offer countless ways to improve the quality of life for women as well as to advance research in the area of gender studies and vulnerable populations, both of which deserve greater attention in the literature.</p>
<p>Next steps in research include an analysis of organizational development and its implementation to alleviate human trafficking. This important HRD practice may serve to foster enhanced coordination and collaboration within and among organizations and governments.</p>
<p>Moreover, economic factors that commonly impact human trafficking require deeper exploration, specifically addressing supply and demand. Demand for cheap labor and sex continues to fuel the market and directly fosters the exploitation of human beings. Future research must explore globalization as well as the impact of demand on the human trafficking problem. Increased awareness and education about the realities of human trafficking may aid in demand reduction. There is a critical need to educate communities about the atrocious infringements of human rights resulting from human trafficking and to espouse the significance of the problem and its detrimental effects on individuals, society, and the world as a whole.</p>
