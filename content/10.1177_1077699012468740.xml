<abstract>
<p>Studies of Orientalized portrayals of Muslims have generally been distinct from studies on the Othering of immigrant Americans. This study employs concepts of insider/outsider status, applying theories of Orientalism and representations of the Other to newspaper coverage of the Muslim and Pakistani American perpetrator of the 2010 attempted Times Square bombing. Newspapers constructed a seemingly contradictory representation of Faisal Shahzad, as the apparent insider/American who becomes the alienated outsider/Other. This portrayal of the Orientalized insider establishes an emerging discourse on the “homegrown” terrorist who exists at the boundary of self and Other.</p>

<p>On May 3, 2010, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Pakistan named Faisal Shahzad attempted to detonate a car bomb in New York’s Times Square. Though the attempt was unsuccessful because it was quickly discovered, failed to detonate, and injured no one, the idea that a would-be terrorist came so close to striking one of the most prominent U.S. landmarks alarmed the public and generated intense news coverage, in which Shahzad’s identities as a Pakistani American and a Muslim American were noticeably featured.</p>
<p>The question of Muslim American identity has received increased attention by media scholars since September 11, 2001. Such scholarship has often addressed Muslims and Muslim Americans as a group subjected to historical Orientalist stereotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012468740">1</xref></sup> or addressed Muslim and Arab Americans as a distinct identity group defined by religion and national origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012468740">2</xref></sup> However, few studies have applied theory and research on media portrayals of immigrant Americans to coverage of Muslim Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012468740">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the year before Shahzad’s attempted bombing and arrest, names such as Nidal Malik Hasan,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012468740">4</xref></sup> Najibullah Zazi,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012468740">5</xref></sup> and Al Shabab<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012468740">6</xref></sup> gave rise to stories about, and a vigilance for, the figure of the “homegrown” terrorist, who is characterized as both Muslim American and an immigrant American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012468740">7</xref></sup> Though U.S. media coverage of terrorism has been a robust area of academic research since the 1980s, relatively little has been published on U.S. media coverage of domestic terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012468740">8</xref></sup> The current study examines how major U.S. newspapers constructed Shahzad’s identity as an immigrant American and a Muslim American, and considers what effect his status as a homegrown terrorist may have had on newspaper representations.</p>
<p>The study builds on a previous analysis by Chuang<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012468740">9</xref></sup> of tensions between Asian American and foreign identity in news media coverage of the 2009 Binghamton, New York, mass shooting perpetrated by Jiverly Wong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012468740">10</xref></sup> Although Wong was a naturalized U.S. citizen, top-circulation newspapers routinely referred to him as a Vietnamese immigrant (as opposed to Vietnamese American or American). Likewise, newspaper characterizations of Wong emphasized qualities that were more “foreign” than “American,” such as his inability to speak English and his failure either to adapt to life in America or to achieve the immigrant’s “American Dream.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012468740">11</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with those of other recent studies on media representations of Asian Americans, which have adhered to historic “Yellow Peril” and enemy-alien stereotypes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012468740">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study examines, first, whether similar patterns of representation emerge in the Shahzad case as were found in the Wong case, such as Orientalist stereotyping and emphasis on foreign versus American identity. Second, it explores the overlap between the news coverage patterns of immigrant Americans as observed in the Wong study and news coverage patterns of Muslim Americans and domestic terrorism, including the trend of homegrown terrorism that arose in reaction to the Fort Hood shootings a few months prior to the Times Square incident. Third and finally, the study seeks to discern the role of insider and outsider cultural codes in news coverage of Shahzad as a means of better understanding how it might be distinct from previous patterns of representation of Muslim and immigrant Americans, as well as of post-9/11 domestic terrorism.</p>

<title>Orientalism and Media Constructions of the Other</title>
<p>Contemporary research on media and minority identity has focused on traditional racial and ethnic minority groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012468740">13</xref></sup> Yet Muslim Americans are not defined by race or nationality; they share a religious identity and are predominantly composed of first- or second-generation immigrants. In examining representations of Shahzad, this study addresses his identity as both a Muslim American and a Pakistani American. Consequently, theories on Orientalist media constructions and media representations of the Other provide a convenient and powerful means to synthesize religious and immigrant identity.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, postcolonial scholar Edward Said described Orientalism as a politically charged system of beliefs and representations by which the hegemonic West brings the “Orient,” or foreign East, into its collective consciousness and preexisting culture. Central to this system, which has its roots in the history of nineteenth-century Western colonization, is the implied “exteriority” of the Orientalist explorer, who “positions himself as outside the Orient” in terms of cultural identity while simultaneously subverting traditional boundaries of national, cultural, and even physical Oriental identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012468740">14</xref></sup> The white European West thus creates a powerful dichotomy through which it establishes and perpetuates its own dominance over the exotic and darker-skinned East. As Said explained, “Orientalism is a style of thought based upon the ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and . . . ‘the Occident,’ in which the West is constructed in opposition, and superior, to the Orient.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012468740">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the nuances of Said’s Orientalist theories have been heavily critiqued by postcolonial and feminist scholars in the years since their original publication,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012468740">16</xref></sup> they have nevertheless continued to provide a rich foundation for studies of Western representations of East and South Asian identity. In 1981, for example, Said himself applied the concept of Orientalism to coverage of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, demarcating the event as a “signifier,” or a starting point from which the West perceived the resurgence of Islam as a potential threat. News media coverage of the Iranian hostage crisis set the stage in particular for characterizations that reinforced the idea of Muslims “either as suppliers of oil or potential terrorists,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012468740">17</xref></sup> thus further dichotomizing the West and Islamic world.</p>
<p>Modern theoretical research has elaborated on mass media’s role as a powerful vehicle for the white European and white American majority cultures’ power to establish and disseminate Orientalist representations of nonmajority cultural groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012468740">18</xref></sup> Beginning in the late 1960s, semiotician Roland Barthes analyzed media representations by distinguishing between denotative meaning—the first, descriptive level—and connotative meaning—the second level, which relies on cultural codes and context for interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012468740">19</xref></sup> Media theorist Stuart Hall later applied Barthes’s ideas to media production and consumption, arguing that the media attempt to fix connotative meaning to reinforce the <italic>dominant cultural order</italic>, which by definition favors certain connotative codes over others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012468740">20</xref></sup> According to Hall, these codes in the media produce and perpetuate power relationships among hegemonic media producers, the audience, and language itself through the “attempt to fix meaning.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012468740">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>To Hall, binaries such as Said’s Orientalist–Orient, which delineate an in-group that controls the construction of meaning and an out-group that is the subject of such constructions, are essential to language itself. As he wrote, “The argument here is that we need ‘difference’ because we can only construct meaning through a dialogue with the ‘Other.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012468740">22</xref></sup> These representations of difference reinforce a “racialized regime of representation,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012468740">23</xref></sup> in which the term <italic>Other</italic> becomes code for the outsiders—those who are nonwhite; non-European or European American; not part of the hegemonic power structure; not producers of media; and, in some cases, female or not Christian. Communication scholars have applied this concept of hegemony to media representations and stereotypes, noting that they stem from a dominant white male point of view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012468740">24</xref></sup> Therefore, insiders who resemble groups in power are represented with cultural codes that imply that insiders are safe, normal, and rational, whereas outsider “Others” are represented with Orientalist stereotypes that imply they are alien and dangerous.</p>
<p>During the twentieth century, many media and cultural studies scholars observed shifting patterns in coverage of minorities, from overtly threatening representations to more benign-seeming stereotypes (stereotypical selection), and the historic media conflation of ethnic with foreign identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012468740">25</xref></sup> In reference to this latter shift, Gandy argued that the dominant culture’s fear of turn-of-the-century immigration in Western Europe and the United States established the news media’s association of ethnic with foreign, often leading to the conflation of the two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012468740">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Orientalism as Applied to Post-9/11 Coverage of Muslim Americans</title>
<p>In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, various scholars have applied Said’s concepts of Orientalism, as well as other related theory on representations of the Other, to the coverage of Islam, Muslims, and terrorism. Said’s theories regarding the dichotomy between self and Other as a product of colonialist and imperialist discourse can be seen in present-day constructions of Islam and Muslims as inherently primitive and violent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012468740">27</xref></sup> The repetitive Orientalizing of Islam creates an equivalency, which Powell described as, “since the 9/11 perpetrators were Arab, Muslim brown ‘others’ became the symbol of Islam to the agenda setters in media, thus becoming representative of Islam.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012468740">28</xref></sup> Since September 11, the use of framing and stereotyping in representations of Islam and Muslims has led to a monolithic understanding of “Muslim civilization,” which has been characterized as the opposite of “Western civilization” in accordance with Orientalist tendencies, as well as in revivals of Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” narrative,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012468740">29</xref></sup> which gained prominence in the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012468740">30</xref></sup> Kumar further argued that post-9/11 discourse establishes that “Muslim civilization” is in need of “Western intervention to bring about progressive change.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012468740">31</xref></sup> In other words, according to Kumar, “the West spreads democracy, whereas Islam spawns terrorism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012468740">32</xref></sup> Nacos and Torres-Reyna’s analyses of Muslim American representations in the news reveal persistent use of “explanatory frames” by “symbol handlers,” which associate Muslims and Islam with terrorism, violence, and anti-Americanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012468740">33</xref></sup> Several other studies of news media coverage of Muslims and terrorism have also based their analyses on theories of framing and/or semiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012468740">34</xref></sup> Likewise, the most prevalent frameworks and symbols from this literature ultimately point back to Said. As Jaysane-Darr explained, “The Orientalist frame activates a semiotic process that implies a variety of associated and historically contingent signs in reference to the Middle East,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012468740">35</xref></sup> and, it could be argued, South Asia and South Asians.</p>

<title>U.S. Media Coverage of Domestic Terrorism and “Homegrown” Terrorism</title>
<p>U.S. news coverage of international terrorism has been a robust area of research since 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012468740">36</xref></sup> In one of the few studies to specifically address U.S. media coverage of domestic terrorism, Powell found that if a perpetrator is found to be a non-Muslim U.S. citizen in domestic terrorism cases, media coverage tends to individualize and humanize the terrorist, depicting him as mentally unstable and exploring his reasons for the act (e.g., antigovernment sentiment). However, in cases where the terrorist is found to be Muslim, regardless of his citizenship, media coverage tends to depict the act as the work of larger terror cells and immediately attributes it to the larger war on America by Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012468740">37</xref></sup> This framing renders a Muslim perpetrator’s individual grievances irrelevant, since it is assumed that he has been radicalized and is part of a larger “jihad.” Jaysane-Darr observed similar patterns “defined by the frontiers of the self/other relationship,” describing them as indicative of how “discourse on terrorism always works to distance [the act of terror] from the self.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012468740">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Powell’s examples of news media representations of terrorists predate Fort Hood and the emergence in the discourse of the homegrown terrorist, other studies have begun to explore news coverage of homegrown terrorism subjects, such as Nidal Malik Hasan. For instance, in a comparison of coverage of the Fort Hood shooting to the May 2009 murder of “abortion doctor” George Tiller by Scott Roeder, DiMaggio concluded that “Islam is more than twice as likely to be associated with Hasan than Christianity is to be associated with Roeder.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012468740">39</xref></sup> In particular, DiMaggio noted that media commentators focused their attention on Muslim Americans serving in the U.S. military, questioning whether the religion of such soldiers might conflict with their duty to serve the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012468740">40</xref></sup> Kumar also spotlighted Hasan, citing columnist Tunku Varadarajan’s controversial Forbes piece “Going Muslim” as an example of an Orientalist response to the Fort Hood shootings. In the column, Varadarajan argues that “going Muslim” in the case of Hasan entailed “discarding his apparent integration into American society, and electing to vindicate his religion in an act of messianic violence against his fellow Americans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012468740">41</xref></sup> As noted by DiMaggio, by unquestioningly associating Islam with terrorism, the article sets up a discourse that places loyalty to Islam and loyalty to the United States as concepts of inherent conflict.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The emerging news media discourse on homegrown terrorism provides scholars with new opportunities to consider the theoretical frameworks provided by Said and Hall, as well as new research contexts. The current study applies concepts of Orientalism and media constructions of the Other to newspaper coverage of Faisal Shahzad, to determine whether relevant contemporary newspapers represented the perpetrator as American or foreign, and whether the characteristics used to describe Shahzad were more “American” or “foreign” in nature.</p>
<p>This study examines the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012468740" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> Were Orientalist discourses of Otherness deployed in newspapers’ post-arrest profiles of Shahzad?</p></list-item>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077699012468740" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study analyzes how Shahzad was depicted in the months of May and June 2010, using a mixed-methods approach. We selected this time period because the bulk of the coverage of Shahzad occurred in these two months, representing more than two hundred hits in a search of the top-five circulation newspapers. Through the lens of Orientalism and media representations of the Other, our analysis examines how Shahzad’s immigration status was represented through denotation (e.g., explicit references to him as a “Pakistani immigrant,” “Pakistani American,” or “U.S. citizen”) and connotation (e.g., references to his ability to blend in as a suburban Connecticut father and husband with an MBA, in contrast to his increasing adherence to Islam in the forms of eschewing alcohol and attending a mosque). According to Hall, the denotative/ connotative dichotomy is useful “for distinguishing . . . the different levels at which ideologies and discourses intersect.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012468740">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>We conducted both a quantitative content analysis and a qualitative textual analysis of selected news articles, an approach consistent with Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie’s definition of a mixed-methods data analysis as “the use of quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques, either concurrently or sequentially, at some stage beginning with the data collection process, from which interpretations are made in either a parallel, an integrated, or an iterative manner.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012468740">43</xref></sup> Our research design employed some elements of quantitative research, such as providing numerical comparisons for the frequency of certain coded categories (i.e., modes of representation), for those code categories representing the most concrete signifiers in the study, such as references to Shahzad’s U.S. citizenship. For aspects of the articles that operated on denotative and connotative levels, we employed qualitative textual analysis based on Barthes and Hall’s semiological approaches. Fairclough’s theories on discourse analysis also proved helpful to us in distinguishing layers of representation and meaning in the studied texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012468740">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>We performed this data analysis on U.S. newspaper articles that contained the phrase “Faisal Shahzad” and were published in May and June 2010, when coverage of the case was most intense. Articles were found using the Factiva, LexisNexis, and ProQuest Newsstand databases. We chose to analyze articles in the five U.S. newspapers with the highest circulation in 2010, as this selection reflects content consumed by a high proportion of U.S. readership: <italic>Wall Street Journal, USA Today, New York Times, Los Angeles Times</italic>, and <italic>Washington Post</italic> (in order of highest to lowest circulation). After duplicate articles were eliminated, 197 articles remained (<italic>N</italic> = 197) from the five newspapers. Once the relevant articles had been identified and collected, we conducted a content analysis of the sample using code categories to determine how Shahzad’s immigration status, nationality, ethnicity, religion, time in the United States, and citizenship status were represented. We also coded for stories that were specifically about Shahzad, in contrast to those that primarily addressed the political, legal, homeland security, or foreign policy ramifications of his arrest and prosecution. To determine additional themes in Shahzad’s characterization, we conducted an initial reading of the articles before a coding scheme was finalized. When consensus on key themes was reached, we inductively developed fifteen additional categories based on other key factors in Shahzad’s characterization. We then acted as first and second coders, analyzing each article in a second reading based on the seven predetermined categories (immigration status, nationality, ethnicity, religion, time in the United States, citizenship status, time since naturalization) as well as fifteen inductively developed categories, such as his Pakistani family’s affluence and high social status, his American degrees, his wife and two children, his financial analyst jobs with U.S. corporations, and descriptions of his personality and behavior as normal, quiet, and friendly, as well as those of his personality and behavior as erratic and unfriendly. In addition, five categories addressed factors that may have led to his decision to attempt the bombing, such as increasing adherence to Islam, grievances against the U.S. government or its policies, financial problems and the foreclosure of his home, connections to the Pakistani Taliban or other terrorist groups, and the influence of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Finally, we coded the articles for references to two other “homegrown” terrorists prominent in the news at the time: Nidal Malik Hasan and Najibullah Zazi.</p>
<p>Our findings post-coding were compared and found to be largely consistent in all but two categories: references to Shahzad’s Muslim religion and references to his anti–U.S. government and policy grievances. It appeared that while Shahzad was rarely described as “Muslim” outright, we found references to his religion variously implied in described allegiances to a radical Muslim cleric, mentions of his name alongside those of other Muslim American terrorism suspects, and quotes by Shahzad describing himself as a “Muslim soldier.” These partially implicit references to Shahzad’s religious identity were difficult to code and resulted in some discrepancies. The anti-U.S. government code category was similarly difficult to discern, as its article references were often deeply contextualized/recontextualized, as will be illustrated in the “Findings” section.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section7-1077699012468740">
<title>About Half of the Articles Focused Solely on Shahzad; Others Addressed Broader Legal and Policy Implications</title>
<p>Most of the coverage that mentioned Shahzad occurred in the week following the May 3 bombing attempt and arrest, with 80% of the articles analyzed appearing in the month of May. Initial coverage focused on the failed bombing, the search for Shahzad, his boarding of a flight to Dubai, and his pre-takeoff capture fifty-three hours after the bombing attempt. Also prominent were early stories about lawmakers’ concerns regarding the safety of Times Square, the implementation of Homeland Security measures such as the no-fly list, and Shahzad’s possible connections to the Pakistani Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the attempt. Within the two months studied, close to half the articles (90 of 197) focused on the broader legal, domestic policy, and foreign policy implications of Shahzad’s actions and identity, rather than on Shahzad himself. In the later weeks of the study, the arrests of several other U.S. citizen terrorists resulted in the recasting of Shahzad as an example of a new “homegrown terrorism” phenomenon.</p>
<p>The other half of the stories focused on Shahzad—his background, life, radicalization, and possible motivations, as well as the construction of the bomb, the bombing attempt, and his court appearances. As early as May 5, stories began appearing with detailed descriptions of Shahzad’s life leading up to the failed bombing, with newspapers utilizing information from Shahzad’s housing and financial records, as well as quotes from his neighbors, his landlord, employment records, former U.S. classmates, and acquaintances in Pakistan. As more details emerged, from interrogations as well as public statements made during his June 21 guilty plea in Federal District Court, stories about Shahzad focused increasingly on the motivation behind his terrorist involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077699012468740">
<title>Representations of Shahzad’s Identity Varied, but the Most Consistent Descriptor Was “U.S. Citizen”</title>
<p>The newspapers studied used a wide variety of wording for Shahzad’s nationality, ethnicity, and immigration/citizenship status, rarely demonstrating consistency even for articles by the same publications or reporters. Some of the descriptors included “Pakistani-born American citizen,” “American man of Pakistani descent,” “a Connecticut man originally from Pakistan,” “a Pakistani man,” “a Pakistani,” “a Pakistani who also held American citizenship,” “a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani heritage,” “naturalized Pakistani immigrant,” “Pakistani-American,” and “U.S. citizen from Pakistan.” Some articles even displayed variation among headline, lede, and body of the story. For example, the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>’s first-day story carried the headline “Pakistani Held in N.Y. Bomb Probe,” yet used “man of Pakistani descent” in the lede and “a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent” in the third paragraph.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012468740">45</xref></sup> Similarly, a second-day <italic>Washington Post</italic> story described Shahzad as an “immigrant” in its headline and a “U.S. citizen” in its second paragraph.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012468740">46</xref></sup> Overall, the newspapers analyzed were more likely to use foreign-sounding descriptors like “Pakistani man” or “naturalized Pakistani immigrant” in the first two weeks of coverage, and more American-sounding ones like “Pakistani-American” or simply “a Connecticut man” in later weeks.</p>
<p>The most consistent identifier used by the newspapers was references to Shahzad’s U.S. citizenship, which appeared in eighty-one of the articles examined, or more than 40%. In thirty-nine stories he was described as “Pakistani-American” or “an American” of Pakistani descent, from Pakistan, and so on. By contrast, only thirteen of the articles described him as a Pakistani immigrant or simply an immigrant. This pattern is the opposite of the one seen in newspaper representations of Jiverly Wong in the study of the Binghamton shooting, which found that thirteen of fourteen top-circulation newspapers referred to the perpetrator as a Vietnamese immigrant, while only five ever mentioned that he was a U.S. citizen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012468740">47</xref></sup> However, it is worth pointing out that Shahzad had been a U.S. citizen for only a year at the time of his crime, whereas Wong had been naturalized fourteen years prior to the Binghamton shooting. In Shahzad’s case, fewer than half of the articles that mentioned U.S. citizenship (thirty-two out of eighty-one) referred to the time of his naturalization, and those that did usually did so to make a point about the event’s proximity in time to this bombing attempt. An example of this can be seen in the following quote, from the lede of a May 8 <italic>New York Times</italic> article:
<disp-quote>
<p>When Faisal Shahzad took his oath of citizenship a year ago, swearing to “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies,” he seemed the model of a legal immigrant success story. . . . Now that he has admitted driving a car bomb into Times Square, every step of his path to citizenship is under fresh scrutiny. One key question is when Mr. Shahzad turned against his adopted country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012468740">48</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This <italic>New York Times</italic> lede ostensibly addresses whether Shahzad’s U.S. citizenship might have an impact on his legal prosecution. However, the invocation of signifiers loaded with cultural meaning, such as the oath of citizenship and the “legal immigrant success story” (aka American Dream), indicates that representational narratives are happening on deeper, connotative levels—those which Barthes refers to as dependent on cultural contexts and codes. Newspapers’ representations of Shahzad’s immigration status and ethnic versus American identity were far more ambiguous and conflicted that those observed in the study of Wong. This pattern diverges from the previous studies, which observed that news media tend to distance the Muslim terrorist from the self,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012468740">49</xref></sup> as in DiMaggio’s study of Nidal Malik Hasan.</p>

<title>Signifiers Used to Represent Shahzad Linked to Both Insider and Outsider Cultural Codes</title>
<p>To better understand the cultural contexts underpinning this study’s collection of newspaper stories, we observed the frequency of certain signifiers used in reference to Shahzad’s identity, isolating those that point to or appear to point to signs of ambiguity about Shahzad’s status as American versus Other, insider versus outsider. For example, we identified four signifiers with links to Shahzad’s “American”/insider identity: his U.S. bachelor’s and MBA degrees (seventeen references); his wife and children (nineteen references); his previous employment as a financial analyst at major U.S. corporations such as Elizabeth Arden and Affinion (eighteen references); and his description, courtesy of interviewed sources, as normal, pleasant, or quiet in an unalarming way (eleven references). These signifiers are associated with what Hall describes as signs reinforced by the dominant cultural order to represent insider status, and all of the associated qualities of that status, including familiarity, normality, and rational intelligence. Taken together they underscore perceived “American” values of higher education, particularly at U.S. institutions; capitalism, in the form of the MBA and a career as a financial analyst for major U.S. corporations; family; and friendliness, the last being a kind of cyclical quality, recognized by those within the dominant social order, in those who comfortably follow its social cues. A few isolated examples of such signifiers were also noted in our readings of the texts, such as the <italic>New York Times</italic> headline, “A Suburban Father Who Gave No Warning Sign.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012468740">50</xref></sup> Here, the phrase “suburban father” accomplishes what Fairclough describes as an act of classification<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012468740">51</xref></sup>—in this case, a specific classification meant to connote positive cultural codes that the dominant culture associates with the suburbs, family, and normalcy.</p>
<p>We also identified signifiers that link to “foreign” or Other/outsider signs: increased adherence to Islam over time (ten references), the influence of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (thirteen references), and descriptions by sources as erratic, unfriendly, or odd (seven references). These signifiers point to cultural codes that align neatly with both Said’s Orientalized outsider and the post-9/11 scholarship on renewed Orientalized constructions of Muslims as irrational, deviant, and dangerous.</p>
<p>One difficulty in analyzing signifiers within Shahzad’s newspaper coverage was the large number of references to Shahzad’s financial problems and the foreclosure of his house (twenty references). This particular signifier presented a semiotic conundrum, in that wealth and success typically constitute American/insider cultural codes, but lack of wealth—here, financial problems and foreclosure—does not necessarily connote Otherness. Furthermore, given the larger recession and a real-estate crisis that caused millions to lose their wealth and homes, it could be argued that Shahzad’s financial losses are signifiers of American inclusion. Yet as we saw in the Wong study, news media tend to cast an immigrant’s financial failings as part of a “shattered American Dream” narrative, in which the immigrant falls short of becoming truly American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012468740">52</xref></sup> In news coverage of Wong, for example, it was implied that Wong’s inability to learn English and fully assimilate contributed to his job loss and, ultimately, his deviance. Similarly, Shahzad’s financial woes and foreclosure were linked to his growing radicalization and anti-American sentiment. This can be seen in a May 16 <italic>New York Times</italic> article: “He had lost his home to foreclosure last year. At the same time he was showing signs of a profound, religiously infused alienation. . . . While Mr. Shahzad seemed eager to carve out a life in his host country, his anger at America flared early.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012468740">53</xref></sup> Such recontextualization of Shahzad’s identity—the switched significance of his loss of wealth, when filtered in the context of his radicalization—indicates a larger pattern within the news coverage of homegrown terrorists: radicalization in response to alienation from the American Dream.</p>
<p>The issue of recontextualization also arises in the contradictory “American” and “foreign” signifiers to describe Shahzad’s identity. Both the insider and outsider signifiers routinely appeared within the same stories, and at times were even attributed to the same sources. In a May 5 <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> article, “From New Citizen to Suspect in a Year,” a neighbor describes Shahzad as someone who “sometimes wore ankle-length traditional Muslim garb [at home] . . . but [who] wore a shirt and tie to work.” The same neighbor described Shahzad jogging at night because he disliked sunlight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012468740">54</xref></sup> A <italic>Washington Post</italic> article on the same day describes Shahzad wearing khakis and hosting barbecues, while his wife and her female friends wore veils and robes, as observed by another neighbor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012468740">55</xref></sup> The signifiers contained within these two passages link to a variable pileup of contradictory cultural codes. Khakis and shirt and tie versus “Muslim garb.” Barbecues versus veils and robes. Jogging—but at night, for fear of sunlight. These signifiers resonate with Shavit’s study of “symbolic and/or marginal issues” associated with Muslim immigrants: “The demands of receiving societies for Muslim assimilation commonly distinguish between two types of immigrants—the people who gradually relinquish outward signs of religiosity and the people who gradually adopt a religiously demonstrative demeanor.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012468740">56</xref></sup> Other studies also establish that in societies that receive Muslim immigrants, outward signs of assimilation and accommodation are constructed as inherently positive, whereas demonstrating cultural distinctiveness is associated with radicalization, threat, and terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012468740">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, the juxtaposition of conflicting cultural codes in the coverage gradually skews toward more references to alienation and terrorism (such as those referencing increasing adherence to Islam and financial troubles), culminating by mid-May. Though a dualism is always seen in these representations, the overall trajectory of newspaper representations of Shahzad is from an apparent inside/American to an alienated outsider/Other/radicalized Muslim, with all of the associated Orientalist stereotypes. It could be said that, in these news media constructions, Shahzad ultimately occupies the unique and unstable space of an Orientalized insider. That is to say, he appears to conform to a model of acceptability and success as deemed by the dominant culture, but his inability to escape the manifestation of his Oriental tendencies in turn allows the dominant culture to reestablish the firm boundaries between self and Other, insider and outsider, and, according to Hall, to construct meaning.</p>

<title>Shahzad’s Story Recontextualized through Other Acts of ‘Homegrown’ Terrorism</title>
<p>Fairclough describes recontextualizing as the act of “incorporating [a social event] within the context of another social event,” in which “elements of social events are selectively ‘filtered,’” according to a set of principles. These principles address how social events are included, excluded, and given greater or lesser prominence, and the ways in which they are represented, arranged, explained, or rendered concrete versus abstract.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012468740">58</xref></sup> The inclusion of other acts of terrorism or attempted terrorism in stories about Shahzad or, conversely, the inclusion of Shahzad in subsequent stories about terrorism arrests, reflects the dominant culture’s desire to delineate types of terrorism through recontextualization. As seen in Powell’s study, which predates Shahzad and the Fort Hood shooting, domestic terrorists tend to be non-Muslim and are represented with individualized explanations for their actions (be they mental illness or antigovernment grievances), whereas international terrorists who are Muslim are linked to a universalized “jihad” that defied rational explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012468740">59</xref></sup> Following this pattern, the terrorists most commonly mentioned in the stories collected for this study were Nidal Malik Hasan and/or Najibullah Zazi (thirty references), both Muslims and U.S. citizens. In the months following Shahzad’s arrest, two incidents prompted a total of nine references to Shahzad’s attempted bombing: the early June arrest of two New Jersey citizens attempting to join the Somali extremist group Al Shabab, and the late June sentencing of five Muslim Americans from Virginia in Pakistan, for attempting to fight against U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>By late May, stories such as the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>’s “Fighting Threats from Within; Homegrown Terrorist Plots Spur a Search for a Strategy, but How Does the Government Battle an Ideology?,” had already started recontextualizing the acts committed by Shahzad, Hasan, Zazi, and others by rendering them an abstraction, emphasizing their alikeness and their collective quantity over their distinctions and their separate motivations: “After more than a dozen homegrown terrorist plots involving American Muslims since President Obama took office, the administration is moving to step up its scattershot efforts to counter domestic radicalism, prompting a debate over the proper role of government in addressing ideological threats.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012468740">60</xref></sup> Phrases like “homegrown terrorist plots” and “domestic radicalism” reflect a nominalized phenomenon—through the pluralized “plots” and the addition of “-ism” on “radical”—that transcends individual acts and individualized motivations.</p>
<p>As early as May 11, the <italic>New York Times</italic> reported that the U.S. Senate was already sounding the alarm on “a new kind of attacker, who’s already here, able to hide in plain sight, and we need to think about new defenses.” This quote, from Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, continued, “Shahzad ‘was almost completely under the radar,’ and as a person living legally in the United States appears to represent a new wave of homegrown terrorists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012468740">61</xref></sup> Two and a half weeks later, in the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> article on “Fighting Threats from Within,” the term <italic>homegrown terrorist plots</italic> no longer required additional explanation. It had become its own context that moved beyond Powell’s constructions of domestic versus international terrorism, one that challenged prior assumptions about the insider versus outsider cultural codes previously associated with representations of terrorism.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Newspaper coverage of the Shahzad case was distinct from patterns of identity construction previously observed in the literature relating to immigrant Americans, Muslim Americans, and domestic terrorism. This study addressed the overlapping aspects of Shahzad’s identity as both an immigrant and Muslim, tracking how Orientalist semiotic codes were employed for both identity features to construct an outsider profile similar to those described in previous studies. The study also found challenges to the patterns observed in the existing literature on media representations of the Other, including the frequent use of signifiers to describe Shahzad that linked him to insider cultural codes, adding an American dimension to his portrayal. Finally, this study posited an explanation for this apparent contradiction. In sum, while previous news coverage of Muslim suspects of domestic terrorism explicitly emphasized ties between motive and Islamic identity, coverage of Shahzad attempted something more complex: to tie motive to a trajectory from American to Muslim identity.</p>
<p>In Shahzad, we see this dualism. He was a terrorist who wore khakis, had barbecues with his family, earned an MBA and worked for Elizabeth Arden, used social networking sites, and, for a while, lived the American Dream. Then he took his citizenship, his U.S. passport, his fluency in English, and his ability to blend in, and used his inconspicuousness to lash out at a country from which he had become alienated. So, by mixing insider and outsider semiotic codes, often juxtaposing them in close textual proximity, newspapers constructed Shahzad as an Orientalized insider. Ultimately, his insider characteristics, his appearance of being American, did not lessen his Otherness—or make him less threatening. Quite the opposite: his ability to “hide in plain sight” raised the question of how the public—from law enforcement to his unassuming neighbors—missed the “warning signs” that a radicalized Muslim terrorist was among them.</p>
<p>The concept of homegrown terrorism is not a new one in U.S. news media: In World War II, the figure of the Japanese American emerged in news accounts as the ultimate “enemy alien” disguised as citizen, ready to commit acts of sabotage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012468740">62</xref></sup> Likewise, before 2010, high-profile arrests of members of U.S. “sleeper cells” and the Fort Hood shooting established the concept of the post-9/11 homegrown terrorist. Yet, with coverage of Shahzad, the discourse of the homegrown terrorist gained traction as a nominalized concept and a distinct context for categorizing terrorism—and, inevitably, categorizing Muslim Americans and immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. In Europe, which has had a longer history with homegrown terrorism, the response to fears of Muslim terrorism has been a demand for greater assimilation, such as the bans on face veils and headscarves in Great Britain and France: “The prime motivation of recent demands for assimilation began in the wake of 9/11 and fear of further mass terror operations being executed on European soil by Muslim immigrants posing as loyal and peaceful citizens, commonly referred to as ‘sleepers.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012468740">63</xref></sup> This tension, between adherence to religion and assimilation to national culture, reflects a larger friction between a global “imagined Muslim nation (<italic>ummah</italic>)” and traditional nation-state identity (e.g., American) that manifests in the West as a debate over multiculturalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077699012468740">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further study could apply these concepts to U.S. news media coverage of homegrown terrorism, attempting to explore in greater depth the representations of assimilation versus multiculturalism as extensions of insider versus outsider status. This study on Shahzad had its limitations in that it examined only newspapers, not electronic media. Future studies of how television, radio, and online news media represented the Shahzad case could better illuminate coverage patterns.</p>
<p>This study found that the representation of the homegrown terrorist as Orientalized insider relies on recontextualizing the apparent contradiction between “homegrown” and “terrorist.” On one hand, the subject must be the “terrorist,” and possess the foreign, alien, Orientalized qualities of the Other that explain the irrationality and deviance of such violent intent. On the other hand, he must simultaneously <italic>appear</italic> as what Shavit describes as the assimilated immigrant, who embraces a new identity by eschewing outward signs of the old, becoming a de facto “American,” that is, “homegrown.” Hall describes media’s hegemonic power as reinforcing the “symbolic frontier between the ‘normal’ and the ‘deviant,’ the ‘normal’ and the ‘pathological,’ the ‘acceptable’ and the ‘unacceptable,’ what ‘belongs’ and what does not or is ‘Other,’ between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders,’ Us and Them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1077699012468740">65</xref></sup> In their construction, and validation, of representations of the homegrown terrorist, the news media suggest that the greatest threat, not just to Homeland Security, but to Hall’s dominant cultural order, is the subject who can straddle the divide between belonging and Other, Occident and Orient, Us and Them. However, as Shahzad’s story goes, so do most about homegrown terrorism. The perpetrator is caught, exposed, and punished (maybe after inflicting some damage or taking some lives, maybe not), and in the reporting and broadcasting of his true deviant nature, the dominant cultural order is in turn reinstated, the public warned to be ever more vigilant.</p>
