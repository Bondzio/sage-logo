<abstract>
<p>The study categorizes cultural background knowledge used by Latino students as they read history texts. The analysis revealed that participants made a large amount of connections attributed to their cultural experiential knowledge. The study also suggests reading ability does not limit the amount and quality of connections students make to their culture. The findings can help social studies teachers looking for additional ways to make social studies relevant and engaging for Latino students.</p>

<body>
<p>As a history teacher and history educator I am always discussing the importance of cultural relevance and using students’ background knowledge when possible in the social studies classroom. However, I had to admit to myself that while I knew I was teaching good theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711436084">Haviland &amp; Rodriguez-Kiino, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711436084">Pappamihiel &amp; Moreno, 2011</xref>), I really did not know for certain what kind of relevant background knowledge associated with Latino culture could be accessed among a majority of Latino students in social studies classes. Because the multicultural research states that Latino students have large amounts of cultural experiential knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711436084">Gonzalez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711436084">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711436084">Oughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">2006</xref>) I set out to discover if such knowledge (which I will call cultural knowledge) was available when engaging with social studies material. Thus the main research question was “What forms of cultural background knowledge are used by Latino college freshmen as they encounter culturally relevant historical texts?” The study also set out to determine if the use of such background knowledge was dependent on the reading level of students. I measured this through the purposeful recruitment of students with a variety of ACT/COMPASS reading scores.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538192711436084">
<title>Theoretical Frameworks</title>
<p>The type of background knowledge an individual has helps determine his or her interpretation of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711436084">Brozo, Cantu Valerio, &amp; Salazar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192711436084">Epstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711436084">Reynolds, Taylor, Steffensen, Shirey, &amp; Anderson, 1982</xref>). Thus the theoretical models used in this study are constructivist models used within reading research-schema theory and situated cognition. According to schema theory, students call up scripts based on previous experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711436084">Rumelhart, 1980</xref>). Situated cognition states that all schemata (individual units of past cognitive experiences) is influenced by the particular situation in which the knowledge is learned prior to entering the mind, so the schemata cannot be separated from outside influences. Therefore, according to situated cognition theory, the background knowledge Latino students activate has been previously influenced by their home cultures.</p>

<title>Significance of Study</title>
<p>This study fills the need of helping teachers understand the nature of Latino students’ background knowledge to maximize opportunities for making history relevant to Latino students. Such findings also help combat the deficit thinking often associated with Latino students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711436084">Oughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2006</xref>) while offering potential generalization that may help teachers as they contemplate the kinds of connections to home culture that their students might be able to make. The study is also significant in that it connects the established multicultural research on Latino funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711436084">Gonzalez et. al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711436084">Moll et al., 1992</xref>) with the more recent multicultural theory on Latino cultural wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">2006</xref>) to better understand the Latino experience within the field of social studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538192711436084">
<title>Research Surrounding Social Studies and Cultural Background Knowledge</title>
<p>When Latino households and communities are studied, researchers find that Latinos acquire multidimensional depth and breadth from their participation in household life and ethnic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711436084">Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">2006</xref>). Funds of knowledge research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711436084">Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711436084">Moll et al., 1992</xref>) describes the different kinds of knowledge students bring with them to the classroom, but limits the research to knowledge yielded from anthropological studies surrounding elementary core knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711436084">Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711436084">Moll et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711436084">Zipin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Though different from funds of knowledge research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso’s (2006)</xref> cultural wealth theory also provides evidence of many forms of knowledge capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso (2006)</xref> generalizes the various forms of cultural capital found in Latino communities under the term “cultural wealth.” Cultural wealth, as used by Yosso, refers to the aspirational, linguistic, navigational, social, familial, and resistant knowledge found in Latino communities. Cultural wealth theory holds much promise as a generalized theory of Latino cultural knowledge, though the theory is so new that there is little research, if any, to support its utilization in a classroom. This study uses both funds of knowledge and cultural wealth theory as foundational research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538192711436084" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This descriptive case study focuses on one form of data: think alouds (also known as verbal protocol research). In a think aloud, the student offers up verbally what pops into their mind as they are reading. Think alouds help researchers and teachers understand how students use their background knowledge as they verbalize their thinking while reading texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711436084">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192711436084">Garner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711436084">Pressley &amp; Afflerbach, 1995</xref>). Think alouds can be used with bilingual students by transcribing bilingual protocols and translating, as necessary. Though all the participants were bilingual, every participant read English-only texts. No texts in Spanish were provided because the research question revolved around connections between English reading scores and cultural knowledge connections. If proper methodology is used, think alouds will reflect most of what is available in a student’s conscious working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711436084">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1538192711436084">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>I decided to use culturally relevant historical texts so as to maximize the opportunities for students to use their cultural experiential knowledge. The study used think alouds with four different historical texts dealing either directly or indirectly with César E. Chávez and the United Farm Workers movement of the 20th century. This era was chosen because it signifies one of the few eras in which Latinos are generally mentioned within mainstream historical instruction. Each of the texts falls between the sixth- and ninth-grade reading level according to the Fry Readability Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711436084">Fry, 1968</xref>). Since I did not know, in advance, the readability levels of the students from this open enrollment institution, I chose texts with low reading levels. It was important that the reading level not be at the frustration level for the participants for it would limit the amount of working memory devoted to comprehension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538192711436084">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>There were three phases to the research. In Phase 1, I introduced myself to the participants, gave a general description of each of the phases, and secured consent forms. At the beginning of Phase 2, I briefly modeled a think aloud using passages from a science textbook so as not to directly influence their social studies connections. I modeled the process in the same manner to each of the participants. Participants were then asked to think aloud with the four historical texts. Each of the participants read all four texts. After the think alouds, I conducted a short semistructured interview about background knowledge with the students. All think alouds and interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed. For Phase 3, I invited each of the participants to review the transcripts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538192711436084">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 9 freshmen attending a 4-year open-enrollment state university in the Intermountain West. I believed that college freshmen would provide a full spectrum of the forms of cultural background knowledge students obtained from their home communities during their high school years. At the time of the study, the state university did not require a diversity component for its general education requirements. In addition, very few public schools in the state offered any kind of formal multicultural experience beyond voluntary student clubs. It was therefore unlikely that students attending the state university would have gained cultural knowledge outside of their home culture or personal acquaintances because the state public education system did not require multicultural education programs and there was little multicultural emphasis throughout the state’s core curriculums.</p>
<p>Though the main emphasis of the research was to document the forms of cultural background knowledge used by Latino students, I also wanted to identify whether English reading competence made a difference. Therefore, the participants in the study were recruited by colleagues who worked in the university’s multicultural center so as to keep student ACT/COMPASS reading scores blind from the researcher (COMPASS scores are used at the state university when a student has a below average ACT score). At the end of the study the multicultural center revealed that students in the lower third reading group had reading scores between 8 and 15 on the ACT/COMPASS reading test, middle third between 16 and 20, and upper third from 21 to 24 on the ACT reading test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538192711436084">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The participants’ think alouds went through three levels of analysis. The first stage was the initial open coding of transcripts that segmented the data into meaning units (short quotes, phrases, or summaries of longer phrases that can be understood apart from each other). The second level of analysis was the axial coding. The meaning units established during open coding were further categorized. Patterns were determined and relationships between categories were examined. The third stage of individual data analysis was elaborative (a priori) coding (Rubin &amp; Rubin, 2005) of the think alouds. Due to the subjective nature of qualitative analysis and the interrelatedness of the a priori categories dealing with cultural wealth theory, I established a coding rubric to properly categorize participant responses. The coding rubric summarized topics found within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso’s (2006)</xref> cultural wealth theory. I was expecting that the type of content area knowledge commonly identified as “funds of knowledge” would eventually be placed under one of Yosso’s cultural wealth categories so “funds of knowledge” was not listed as one of the main forms of capital in the rubric (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192711436084">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-1538192711436084">
<title>Forms of Cultural Knowledge Accessed by All Participants</title>
<sec id="section11-1538192711436084">
<title>Strong family bonds</title>
<p>The biographical sketch of César E. Chávez and the oral interview with Dolores Huerta both touched on issues of family, so it was a natural connection for most participants during the think alouds. The forms of background knowledge activated by the participants focused on relationships and values taught by family members. For example, Jay T recalled his brother trying to teach him through his own experiences and trying to save him from learning the “hard way.” Rafael noted the respect that his uncles had for his father because “he helped raise them.” Emma discussed the closeness and support within her family, as did Robby and Anita. Valeria noted that parents were role models who taught the type of values that get “in your blood.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1538192711436084">
<title>Respect for elders</title>
<p>Beyond connections to family members, the think alouds revealed a profound respect by all the participants toward family elders, especially grandmothers. The reading on César E. Chávez mentioned César’s love and respect for his own grandmother, <italic>Mama Tella</italic>. Connections among the participants were as basic as Jay T discussing his own <italic>Mama Lucita</italic> and as poignant as Emma’s recollection of helping her own grandparents by giving them 20 to 30 <italic>pesos</italic> so they would have enough to eat. Letty was incensed that some children from today’s generation would treat an elder as an equal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1538192711436084">
<title>Religion</title>
<p>Although the participants varied in their affiliation to organized religion and aligned with varying faiths, they all made connections to the excerpts associated with the traditional Catholic Church, and especially with <italic>La Virgen de Guadalupe</italic> (who is closely identified with traditional Catholicism to Mexicans and Mexican Americans). Cassandra noted that even though she is not Catholic “there is like a peace that <italic>La Virgen de Guadalupe</italic> brings to people.” Anita, Letty, and Robby, who are also not Catholic, noted the importance of <italic>La Virgen</italic> to Catholics. Anita states, “Yeah, this is true. The Virgin of Guadalupe is very important to the Mexican Catholics especially.” Letty noted that devotion to <italic>La Virgen</italic> is not as strong in her home country, the Dominican Republic, as devotion to <italic>La Virgen</italic> is in México.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1538192711436084">
<title>Bilingualism</title>
<p>The participants easily interpreted words in Spanish. Sometimes they expressed their thoughts aloud in Spanish to better express their thoughts. In Letty’s think aloud she agreed with the text’s view that Spanish unifies Latinos but felt incensed that modern Latinos did not value having two cultures and two languages. Anita discussed the abundance of bilingual people in the United States, and Robby made the connection between his bilingual abilities and job opportunities. Emma and Cassandra discussed the importance of having materials printed in Spanish for the benefit of their non-English-reading family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1538192711436084">
<title>Knowledge of machismo</title>
<p>All participants drew on their personal experiences with what may be considered traditional Latino views of gender, whether it was Valeria commenting that “men do play games with women” or Letty stating that “men take advantage of women.” Participants who described men seemed to be pointing toward the issue of <italic>machismo</italic> that is often attributed to men in Latin American culture. Rafael approached the issue directly when he stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Latinos, we are <italic>machistas</italic>. My dad is always a <italic>machista</italic>, . . . as a man, or as a leader, you are not allowed to break down . . . . Being a <italic>machista</italic> is just a part of Latin culture. We have always been <italic>machistas</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The think alouds may have provided more comments dealing with traditional Latino <italic>machismo</italic>, but the readings did not directly use the word <italic>machismo</italic>. Instead, the readings discuss dispositions associated with <italic>machismo</italic> but used the word “chauvinism.” Anita understood the concept of <italic>machismo</italic> during her interview but admitted that she did not comprehend the word “chauvinism” as it was used in the readings, which limited her connections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1538192711436084">
<title>Travel/migration</title>
<p>It seemed that participants in this study made connections to different areas of Latin America because they either came from those regions, moved into those regions for a short time, or had visited different geographical regions within Latin America (or areas containing a high population of Latin Americans). Many of the participants had moved several times, as is often the case with the children of first-generation immigrants. In connection with a textbook passage that discussed migration, Jay T commented, “His [Cesar Chavez’s] parents were always moving, looking for something better paying. That’s true. I know my parents did that.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1538192711436084">
<title>Unity</title>
<p>The concept of unity was a common concept for all participants. Jay T made consistent connections to the need for unity among Latinos throughout all four of the readings. The other participants also brought forth background knowledge about the unity that is either presently found within Latino communities or reflected on a unity that may have existed in the past but is no longer as strong as it used to be. Cassandra seemed to appreciate the readings bringing out positive notes about Latino history and pride. She stressed that “not forgetting where you came from . . . is so important.” Dolores pointed out that at times Latinos “forget what unity is all about.” Emma brings up the idea that Latinos need to unify and support each other because of common bonds. She stated, “We may all have the same types of problems.” On the other hand, Robby’s background knowledge concerning Latino unity was in a negative light. He stressed that there were only “two kinds in the Latin community; either they stick together or they look at you dirty and won’t talk to you for 20 years.” In Robby’s case, Latino unity was something that was an obstacle for him outside of the closeness and unity he shared with his family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1538192711436084">
<title>Knowledge of Latin American politics</title>
<p>A familiarity of political situations within Latin America was also expressed during the think alouds by all participants. Although in some cases, as in comments about Fidel Castro, it would be difficult to separate cultural knowledge from background knowledge gained from other media, it is clear that political subjects associated with Latin America are being stressed in the homes and communities of the participants. Although Anita has lived outside of México for some time, she is aware that “there is still corruption, looters, on the frontier right now.” Valeria brought up age discrimination in México because her father, who was in México at the time of the study, was having much difficulty finding a job in México because of his age (even though he had a high level of college and technical training). Robby and Jay T seemed to have the most knowledge of political situations within Latin America and therefore brought up issues of socialism and revolution as well as the reasons for which Che Gueverra should be someone who is highly regarded.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section19-1538192711436084">
<title>Forms of Cultural Knowledge Accessed by a Majority of Participants</title>
<sec id="section20-1538192711436084">
<title>Knowledge about immigration</title>
<p>Other than Robby, all the participants made close, personal connections to immigrants and equated immigration with economic necessity and political circumstances. At times participants made direct connection to the passage by using the pronoun “we” or “us” to connect to the text. When reading the textbook passage dealing with immigration, Dolores made the comment that there were more Mexican immigrants in the United States because “we can just cross the border.” Valeria declared, “The Americans really need us. We suffer more than others.” Rafael summed up his feelings toward immigration in general with a quote: “We didn’t cross the border; the border crossed us.” When speaking of immigration Anita stated, “We can’t find better jobs because we are not Americans. We are Mexicans and this is not our country. We are just here because of the necessity or having a better life, and it is not what happens . . . .”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1538192711436084">
<title>Racial/ethnic discrimination</title>
<p>Background knowledge associated with racial/ethnic discrimination was evident in most of the think alouds, though not from similar viewpoints. Anita noted that “a lot of immigrants still feel oppressed. They feel that they can’t have good jobs.” Anita also stated, “It is difficult not to feel the racism because you see it every day, but you have to learn to live and with lots of people and do like it says, ‘don’t let it paralyze you.’” Valeria, who is very light skinned, drew from her personal experiences in the local schools; she recalled, “They won’t even pick on you because you are Mexican. I was White; their attitude changed about me when they found out I was Mexican . . . . There are people that haven’t been there for me because I am Latino.” Letty brought up discrimination found within Latino communities: “Racism is everywhere, . . . racism is between Mexicans, Dominicans, people from Peru, everywhere . . .

<title>Poverty and class consciousness</title>
<p>Background knowledge concerning poverty and class consciousness was found in the majority of think alouds. Some of the comments came about as a result of reading about Chávez’s compassion toward the poor. Dolores agreed with Chávez when she said, “poor people are the ones that live a moral life; they do all the work.” Cassandra also agreed that “poor people appreciate things more.” Emma explained that the poor “have strong experiences and that makes them better than those that don’t have those kinds of experiences.” Emma explained that “because they [immigrants] come from ranches, they are used to working hard . . . . They know more things about villages or farms . . . . Farm people have more experiences than people from the city.”</p>
<p>Since Jay T and Rafael often brought up revolution and socialism, they were very much aware of class issues throughout the readings and discussed exploitation of the poor and the inability of the poor to move up the economic ladder. Jay T’s understanding of social class was viewed from the context of debates his family has about this subject. He stated that his family</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>always argue about how there is always the poor class and the rich class, and the rich class is always getting richer because it’s always exploiting the poor and that’s just not right. There has to be some kind of fairness, some kind of change and how they exploit the workers, too. We all are equal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, Anita, Robby, and Letty also commented on class/poverty issues but mainly in disagreement with César E. Chávez. They seemed to disagree with Chávez’s comment about the morality of the poor but instead made the point that it may be true for some but definitely not all. They also stated that morality was not confined to the poor. Opposite from the reaction of most of the participants were Robby’s think alouds. In response to a different passage concerning the unfairness of the plight of some immigrants in the United States, Robby stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know for whatever reason and they would always tell me how life was unfair, how it was always the White rich people that were exploiting them, and it just makes me laugh because I never had to live anything like that. And so, right here, César’s family tells him about the unfairness in life and that to me, it just pops into my mind, is just how a lot of them make that excuse like something doesn’t go their way. Something is unfair. That’s the unfairness in life, I think that’s bull.</p>

<sec id="section23-1538192711436084">
<title>Social activism</title>
<p>Connections to social activism through unity were also found in the think alouds. Valeria noted that if “we unify, we can make a huge difference, a huge difference beyond our communities; . . . get up and fight and give everything.” Emma stated, “I get involved when I feel I can do something about it or influence people.” Jay T and Rafael were well versed in social activism, citing Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lennon, and Che Gueverra. Letty added that the United Farm Workers was fighting for “basic human rights.” In one way or another, most of the participants saw the need for some kind of social activism on the part of underrepresented populations.</p>

<title>Dichos</title>
<p>Although not unique to Latin America, proverbs (or sayings) are passed along by Latin American families as <italic>dichos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2006</xref>). During the think alouds, participants either offered up their own <italic>dichos</italic> or reflected on <italic>dichos</italic> passed on to them by family members. Dolores commented that she heard the quote <italic>El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz</italic> (the respect of others’ rights is peace) all the time from her mother. Cassandra noted that her mother taught her similar lessons, especially telling her to love everyone. Valeria stressed that her family taught her to be <italic>humilde, tienes que ser humilde</italic> (be humble, you need to be humble). Robby recalled his grandmother always telling him stories to shape him up.</p>

<p>Based on frequency counts of the raw data, there did not appear to be differences in the number of connections made during the think alouds between participant reading levels. Emma (lower third group) made the fewest number of connections during think alouds. However, after her, the fewest number of connections came from Dolores and Robby, who were in the highest reading group. Cassandra and Jay T (middle group) made more connections than Robby and Dolores, who are in the upper third in reading scores. Thus, among the participants in the study, reading levels did not seem to make a difference in the number of connections made during the think alouds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1538192711436084">
<title>Discrepant Data Related to Number of Connections</title>
<p>An important area of discrepancy surrounded the connections made by Dolores in her think alouds. Throughout the think alouds, Dolores nodded in agreement, said something that showed she was agreeing with the text, or restated the text in a way that would make one think she was agreeing with the text. Though Dolores was in the highest reading group she made the fewest number of connections during the think alouds. Yet it may be that she made many more text connections but that such connections were in agreement with the text and, as a result, were not verbalized like those of other participants. As a researcher, I did not notice this enough during my think aloud with Dolores. However, something said by Valeria at the very end of her fourth think aloud made me think that agreement and restatement within the think alouds may be a form of connection. Valeria made the following statement after a long period of silence during her reading of the Huerta text:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The reason I am so quiet is actually, it’s just like about a bunch of opinions and talks about like that and stuff she thinks and I agree. So, I mean, I don’t really have very much to say; I just agree with what this is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That led me to think that perhaps Dolores, who was interviewed near the beginning of the study, might be doing the same thing. I then proceeded to analyze Dolores’ comments from this perspective. If the discrepant data were to be used, it would change the connection totals for many of the participants. However, this study was not designed to interpret such statements. In addition, it is difficult to ascertain if other participants were making similar connections but did not gesture or comment about such connections. Therefore, when analyzing the number of meaning units across cases, it was best to rely on statements that were quoted but not inferred or based on “agreements” or nonverbal expressions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Incorporating cultural background knowledge can potentially make the social studies classroom more relevant and engaging to the Latino student. Student comprehension and interest is often improved by incorporating elements that are tied to their own lives and in this case, there were several forms of cultural knowledge that these students connected to in all of the readings, regardless of their reading level. Thus the teacher who uses culturally relevant texts and brings up concepts with which Latino students can culturally connect may increase student interaction in the social studies classroom.</p>
<sec id="section28-1538192711436084">
<title>Culturally Relevant Texts</title>
<p>The results of this study point to the advantages of using culturally relevant texts with Latino students. Participants in the study used cultural knowledge to make a large number of varied and deep connections to culturally relevant texts. Thus the findings suggest that other culturally relevant texts may bring forth the use of traditional Latino cultural knowledge in social studies classrooms. High interest, culturally relevant texts can potentially help Latino students use their cultural knowledge while learning social studies content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1538192711436084">
<title>Cultural Background Knowledge and Reading Levels</title>
<p>The think alouds demonstrated that many cultural connections were present regardless of the reading level of participants. The discrepant data noted in this study does not hurt this finding; instead, it possibly strengthens it as additional connections could be counted for each of the participants. Though it is possible that participants made connections because of what they were explicitly asked to do in their think alouds, the think aloud research suggests that not to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711436084">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192711436084">Garner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711436084">Pressley &amp; Afflerbach, 1995</xref>). In addition, it is exciting to note that at least in this study, even participants with low ACT/COMPASS reading scores were actively using their cultural background knowledge, suggesting that English reading level does not seem to have a negative affect on the number of connections made with the texts, provided the texts are at an appropriate reading level. Thus even students who do not read at the grade level of the documents (even when translated into Spanish) may be able to use their cultural knowledge to participate in class discussions about the material. These implications will of course need additional research to determine their effectiveness, but the findings of this study do raise the possibility of such uses for cultural knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section30-1538192711436084">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations to this study need to be mentioned. First, the study examined only 9 participants from one particular university in the Intermountain region. As such, correlations to other Latino students at other universities cannot be made from this study. A greater number of participants chosen at random from other regions of the country and with greater demographic variance would need to be observed to form any kind of generalizations about the nature of traditional Latino cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>A second limitation I would like to address is what was actually studied. The term <italic>cultural knowledge</italic> cannot be absolutely defined. It may be that others within and outside Latino communities do not see the examples I have chosen as forms of cultural knowledge or as generally reflecting the richness of traditional Latino culture.</p>
<p>A third limitation concerns the grouping of students along reading levels defined by norm-referenced tests. The criteria for grouping participants according to reading levels were individual scores on the reading portion of the ACT exam and/or the COMPASS exam. However, intuitively, I questioned the validity of some of those scores being true reflections of participant English reading ability based on what I witnessed during the think alouds. Valeria was designated to be among the lowest level reading group. Yet, from her responses and interview, it is clear that she had a strong command of academic English, more so than some of the students in higher reading groups. I therefore question whether using one standardized test (or standardized subtest) is the best way to measure reading effectiveness among students with strong cultural and linguistic connections to their home country. Although there is no agreed on solution for this situation, it is important enough to be thought of as a limitation to this and future studies dealing with culturally and linguistically diverse participants and the reading of texts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1538192711436084">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>This study suggests numerous avenues of future research related to Latino cultural knowledge. First is the issue related to the breadth of cultural knowledge among Latinos. What other forms of cultural knowledge exist within Latino students? Does cultural knowledge extend throughout different nationalities within Latin America? Does cultural knowledge extend throughout different generations of immigrants? Does cultural knowledge among Latino communities change with geographical boundaries?</p>
<p>A second area of research might be conducted using different types of texts. Are the findings similar when using different types of culturally relevant texts? Do expository texts or narrative texts affect the activation of culturally relevant knowledge to different degrees? Within historical texts, do primary sources or secondary sources influence the activation of cultural knowledge? Does cultural background knowledge become activated with mainstream historical texts that stress concepts/themes found in this study? Does the proximity of historical era make a difference in the types of cultural connections made by students?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although deficit views connected to Latino culture have been refuted by the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711436084">Delgado Bernal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711436084">Garcia &amp; Guerra, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192711436084">Villenas &amp; Deyhle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711436084">Yosso, 2006</xref>), there have been few studies connected to such research in social studies classrooms. This study offers a beginning point for the instructor who is asking, “How can I engage my Latino students in my social studies class.” This study points to a multitude of culturally derived content knowledge that Latino students may bring to a social studies classroom from which a teacher may answer such a question.</p>
