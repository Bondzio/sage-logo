<p>I don’t understand the relation between the past and the present of capitalism as it is rendered in Jeffrey Sklansky’s “Marxism in the Age of Financial Crises: Why Conventional Economics Can’t Explain the Great Recession” (in <italic>New Labor Forum</italic>’s Fall 2012 issue). Perhaps I am complaining about the relation between the theory and the history of capitalism—a relation that is a great deal more variegated, in my view, than it appears in this space, where the Marxists steer the right course and everybody else misses the boat. I am still a Marxist, more or less, but I also know that Keynes came closer than anyone to grasping the truth of his time and ours in Volume 2 of <italic>The Treatise on Money</italic> (1930).</p>
<p>Professor Sklansky explains the late-nineteenth-century crisis by reference to the falling rate of profit: “As productivity rose, profit rates fell, increasingly leading capitalists to save their money or spend it unproductively instead of reinvesting it in further economic growth.” This cannot make sense unless Marx’s law of accumulation supersedes all others. Profit rates fell, ca. 1877-1896, because while output and real wages were increasing rapidly, per capita productivity in the industrial sector was lagging. Capitalists were in fact reinvesting those profits, which remained quite substantial in volume, but their efforts only increased surplus productive capacity. The crisis of the 1890s did not then consume the surplus that had kindled it—it added flames to the fire, so that by 1898, according to the experts on the scene, a new round of growth required either social reform or imperialism; either way, they said, the corporation was the indispensable agent of change.</p>
<p>But let us grant Sklansky his premise; let him explain the late-nineteenth century in the hallowed terms of classical Marxist analysis. What does a falling rate of profit have to do with crises in the twentieth century, when the law of accumulation gets canceled, along with the labor theory of value, according to Marx himself? (Don’t take my word for it, see <italic>Capital</italic>, Kerr ed., vol 1: 648-652, 682-685, vol 2: 414-452, 504-510, 552-570, vol 3: 434-521; <italic>Theories of Surplus Value</italic>, Progress ed., vol 2: 219-220; and the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, pp. 704-706.) Not much, as far as I can tell, but Sklansky invokes it anyway because he believes that surplus capital has become the origin of both financial chicanery and economic crisis. If profit rates are inevitably falling according to the law of accumulation, where does all the speculative, “fictitious” surplus capital come from?</p>
<p>There is no answer until we get to the 1970s. Sklansky passes over the 1920s and the Great Depression in one paragraph. About those 1970s, he claims that “capitalists launched a regime-changing political and economic offensive” to restore “squeezed profits across the industrial world.” I take it that they somehow revoked Marx’s law of accumulation. What then becomes of the classical Marxist analysis Sklansky has hitherto taken for granted? Those profits were restored and then some by the neoliberal capitalist offensive, so that, as amplified by the systematic deregulation of the financial sector in the 1990s, they flowed into the “securitization” of every tangible asset, thus widening the gap between debt and real property, on the one hand, and tightening financial claims on the future of labor time on the other.</p>
<p>Sklansky concludes, however, that high finance, so conceived, “has alleviated at once the converse problems of surplus capital at the top and the lack of buying power at the bottom of the social scale.” But everything he writes and everything he cites, from Arrighi and Henwood to Brenner and Harvey, would suggest the exact opposite: the financialization of every available asset has exacerbated these very problems, precisely by postponing them.</p>
<p>Still, Sklansky claims that there is reason to hope for the future, because the socialization of financial assets has been practically completed by the bailout of the big banks in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, in 2008-2009. “The bank bailout represents for Marxists a golden missed opportunity and a sign of how real change might yet be achieved.” I do not see how this follows. To be missed, an opportunity must be recognized as such. To be golden, it must be eminently practical and immediately plausible. How many Marxists saw this “opportunity” and were on the scene, advocating the public ownership or control of the salvaged banks in 2008 or 2009? Weren’t most of them whooping it up, saying “I told you so, those chickens have come home to roost?”</p>
<p>Back then, the most forceful and cogent rationale for public control of the banks came from Willem Buiter, once associated with the Bank of England and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, now the chief economist at Citigroup. You read that right. It wasn’t the Marxists who rode to the intellectual rescue, in other words, it was the conventional bourgeois economists, like Buiter.</p>
<p>In 2010, Benjamin Kunkel wrote in <italic>n + 1</italic> that “it is only from a Marxian standpoint that the recent credit bubble can be understood.” I emphatically agreed with him in print, in a 2011 book about the Great Recession, among other things. Now I am not so sure we were right, and, as a result, I’m more skeptical of Jeffrey Sklansky’s paean to Marxism than I might have been a year ago. Perhaps I am only complaining again about the relation between the theory and the history of capitalism. Perhaps I am only saying what the cranky old John Quincy Adams did in addressing his abolitionist comrades: “Let us put off holiness.”</p>
