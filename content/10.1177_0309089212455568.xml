<p>This article departs from the traditional view that the episode involving Balaam and his donkey (Num. 22.21–35) is an independent insertion that disrupts the Balaam narrative (Num. 22–24). Instead, the focus here is on the manner in which, within this episode, Balaam displays certain characteristics that are associated elsewhere in these three chapters with the Moabite king Balak. Comparison with two other texts, Genesis 38 and 1 Samuel 25, reveals that the presence of such a role-reversal in the donkey episode renders it an indispensable component of the larger narrative. Each of these three texts thus instantiates a trope in which a role-reversing interlude interacts closely with its surrounding context to highlight the rich human complexity of a central figure.</p>

<p>Situated at the heart of the pericope known as the ‘Book of Balaam’, Numbers 22–24, lies the peculiar episode involving the prophet Balaam; his donkey, who is divinely endowed with the power of speech; and the divine messenger that they encounter on the road to Moab. In this study I argue against the longstanding traditional view that this episode is to be seen as an independent insertion that disrupts the larger Balaam narrative. Rather, I focus specifically on the manner in which, within this episode, Balaam takes on certain traits and attitudes that are associated elsewhere in these three chapters with the Moabite king Balak. By way of analogy with two other texts—Genesis 38 and 1 Samuel 25—whose main characters, Judah and David, undergo similar role-reversals, I argue that the presence of this feature in the story involving Balaam and his donkey demonstrates that this episode is an indispensable literary component of the Balaam pericope as a whole.</p>
<p>To be sure, I am not the first to offer such a reading, and indeed I rely heavily on the penetrating insights offered in prior scholarship, drawing primarily but by no means exclusively on the work of James S. Ackerman on the donkey episode in Numbers 22,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212455568">1</xref></sup> that of Robert Alter on Genesis 38,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212455568">2</xref></sup> and that of Moshe Garsiel on 1 Samuel 25.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212455568">3</xref></sup> In the course of their examinations, each of these scholars highlights the importance of the role-reversal undergone by the main character of the story in question. In this study, however, I argue that such independent examinations, which approach these disparate narratives on the level of the individual story and its surrounding context, serve as the building blocks for a broader, more generalized perspective. Specifically, I bring them together under the rubric of a large-scale, evidently widely attested literary device, namely the role-reversing interlude, according to which each such episode serves through its characteristically close interaction with the surrounding material as a means of highlighting and exploring the rich human complexity of the major character with which it is concerned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212455568">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the centerpiece for the present discussion, the donkey episode in Numbers 22 constitutes a natural starting point from which to embark on our investigation. My assertion of this episode's status as an integral part of the larger Balaam pericope runs generally counter to the perspective most frequently expressed in prior discourse; and so it is worthwhile at the outset to revisit the traditional view and the evidence on which it is built, and to provide some preliminary justifications for my departure from this view. In general, the established interpretation posits that the donkey episode is an interpolation that has been inserted into the larger, otherwise continuous Balaam narrative at a late date.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212455568">5</xref></sup> From the range of arguments marshaled in support of this perspective, one may distill three key elements that serve as its primary underpinnings.</p>
<p>First, special emphasis is placed on the episode's perceived failure to contribute to the advancement of the larger narrative. The series of encounters involving Balaam, his donkey, and the divine messenger is seen as an extraneous digression from the larger story, bearing no direct relationship either to the prophet's interactions with the king of Moab and his envoys, or to the curses-turned-to-blessings that he speaks over Israel. In response to this point, however, we may consult Jacob Licht's observation of two tripartite patterns evident in Numbers 22:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A1 Balaam's first revelation (22.9–12)</p>
<p>A2 Balaam's second revelation (22.20)</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>B1 Balaam's donkey sees Yahweh's messenger for the first time (22.23)</p>
<p>B2 Balaam's donkey sees Yahweh's messenger for the second time (22.25)</p>
<p>B3 Balaam's donkey sees Yahweh's messenger for the third time (22.27)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A3 Balaam sees Yahweh's messenger (thus third revelation) (22.35)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212455568">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This sequence offers a twofold prefiguration of Balaam's experiences in Numbers 23–24, and thus we may extend the pattern into these chapters, as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>C1 Balaam receives first oracle (22.41–23.6)</p>
<p>C2 Balaam receives second oracle (23.14–17)</p>
<p>C3 Balaam abandons ‭םישחנ‬, speaks third and subsequent oracles without theophany (23.28–24.2)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Accordingly, one notes that the extraction of the donkey episode from the larger Balaam narrative would not only eliminate the B pattern entirely, but also leave the A pattern without its final element, thus resulting in the total loss of this chapter's artful foreshadowing of the C pattern that occupies the remainder of the pericope.</p>
<p>Moreover, Meshullam Margaliot likewise rejected such a view on thematic grounds, stating that ‘[t]his argument could only arise because the main theme of the B[alaam] N[arrative], namely the attitude of the prophet to the L<sc>ord</sc> and the relationship between them, was not properly understood’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212455568">7</xref></sup> Indeed, close scrutiny of the text reveals that one particularly prominent expression of this relationship and its development as the story proceeds is given voice in a series of statements, felicitously numbering seven in all, which I provide here:</p>
<table-wrap id="table1-0309089212455568" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" alternate-form-of="table1-0309089212455568" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212455568-table1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Each statement in this sequence is constituted of one or both of two distinct expression types, presented in separate columns in the above schema. Those of Type A are <italic>negative</italic>, that is, they state explicitly what Balaam himself <italic>cannot</italic> do, thereby emphasizing the limits of his personal power; while those of Type B are <italic>imperative</italic>, in the sense that they identify what Balaam <italic>must</italic> do, in accordance with God's direction. These two distinct perspectives on Balaam's relationship with the divine form a harmonious tandem, operating jointly within the context of the larger series of statements to articulate Balaam's practical role in the matter in which Balak seeks to involve him.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unity of the overarching seven-part sequence likewise finds emphasis in the arrangement therein of the verbal roots ‭השﬠ‬, ‘do’, and ‭ךבד‬, ‘speak’, which are employed according to the following pattern:</p>
<fig id="fig1-0309089212455568" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212455568-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>This pattern lends additional underlying structure to the larger seven-part series of statements, thus further highlighting its significance as an extended expression of one of the pericope's central themes, namely, the nature of Balaam's role as a transmitter of divine will. In other words, Margaliot's recognition of this theme, and his assertion that it lies at the very heart of the Balaam narrative, find direct, sustained textual support in the meticulously constructed seven-stage sequence that I have identified here. And indeed, with Margaliot, I reiterate that this theme is particularly well-suited to shed light on the integrity of the pericope as a whole; for, as is evident in the above chart, crucial links in this seven-part chain would be lost if the donkey episode, which is bracketed by the second and third of the seven statements, were excised from the pericope.</p>
<p>Second, the challenging sequence in Num. 22.20–22, in which God seemingly grants Balaam permission to go to Moab but then is angry at his doing so, is adduced as an editorial vestige indicative of a seam between different sources. But the notion that this view actually constitutes a somewhat facile jump to conclusions has found recent support within the source-critical camp itself, given Richard Elliott Friedman's observation that the crux in question ‘is surprising but still understandable as a single author's development, and…is not easily resolved by separating this section into two sources in any case’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212455568">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may go a step further, moreover, and posit briefly that R.W.L. Moberly is correct in his observation that ‘God's words [in v. 20] are not just to be taken at face value as straightforward permission to go [to Moab]’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212455568">9</xref></sup> for indeed, it is entirely possible to read this verse quite differently, as follows. All other instructions that God issues to Balaam elsewhere in the pericope are presented as simple, direct commands. In v. 20, however, the first part of God's statement is framed instead as a conditional, marked by the particle ‭םא‬. This may indicate that we should see in this instance a subtle rhetorical nuance, whereby it is not merely an opportunity for Balaam to proceed as he chooses or as the Moabite emissaries desire, but rather an invitation for Balaam to recognize that the true source of the power on which the Moabites hope to prevail—the power to curse Moab's enemies—lies not with Balaam himself, but with God. ‭םישנאﬣךאב דל ארקל־םא‬, ‘If (it is) to call to <italic>you</italic> (that) the men have come’, God says to Balaam, then go with them. But the alternative receives emphasis in the second half of the verse, where God implies that Balaam himself is not the agent that the Moabites seek, stressing that he may proceed only as he is directed: ‭ךילא רﬢא־רשא רברﬣ־ﬨא ךאוﬣשﬠת וא‬, ‘but just the word that I speak to you—it shall you do’. What, we may ask, is the ‘word’ that God speaks to Balaam? It has been detailed precisely only a few verses earlier, in Num. 22.12: ‭ךלﬨ‬ ‭אלאלאוﬣ‬ ‭ךורביבםﬠﬣ־־א‬ ‭ﬢאﬨ‬ ‭אל‬ ‭אﬣמﬠ‬, ‘You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for it is blessed’. Clear though this earlier directive is, however, Balaam misses the rhetorical import of God's statement in v. 20, and in the next two verses he makes the wrong choice, departing for Moab and thereby provoking God's anger.</p>
<p>Admittedly, such an interpretation of this challenging sequence is extravagant in its impressionism, and in the end we still must concede the difficulty of the text. But it does echo the suggestion that we ought not to insist here on the hypothesis of an unharmonized editorial seam as our sole explanatory recourse.</p>
<p>The third point frequently raised in support of the view that the donkey episode is to be set apart from the surrounding narrative revolves around its presentation of Balaam in an ostensibly negative light. Alexander Rofé saw the episode as a late response to the rest of the pericope's favorable portrayal of Balaam as a non-Israelite prophet of Yahweh:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The burlesque on Balaam [that is, the donkey episode] was intended therefore to invalidate the view that he was a prophet, as expressed generally in ‘<italic>Sefer Bilʿam</italic>'; the invalidation is expressed by means of a demonstration that all prophetic qualities were absent from Balaam at the time of his encounter with the messenger on the road. Thus [this] prophetic meditation sought to purge the troublesome memory of him as a pagan prophet!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212455568">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similarly, David Marcus isolated several features that he interpreted as pointing to the episode's character as an anti-prophetic satire intended ‘to belittle Balaam and expose him to ridicule’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212455568">11</xref></sup> As a corollary to such perspectives, the donkey episode generally is seen as bearing a greater affinity with the unequivocally negative attitude toward Balaam evident in later biblical and postbiblical traditions than it does with his positive portrayal in the rest of the Balaam text in Numbers 22–24.</p>
<p>It is to this third aspect of the traditional perspective on the donkey episode that I would like to respond in the most direct and sustained fashion. In my view, the lampooning of Balaam in this episode is not intended merely to denigrate him, but rather to highlight his humanness in a way that emphasizes the complex, compelling, and well-rounded qualities of this character, the hero of the pericope. This is achieved by means of a role-reversal in which the role occupied elsewhere in the pericope by the Moabite king Balak, who resists the divine message and wilfully proceeds according to his own wishes, is occupied in the donkey episode by Balaam; and parallel to this shift, it is the donkey, not Balaam as elsewhere, who is privy to direct communication with the divine. To put it another way, the relationship that is depicted in the surrounding material between Balak and Balaam is superimposed here onto Balaam and his donkey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212455568">12</xref></sup> Ackerman noted this in his comparison of the donkey episode to the extended exchange and series of oracles that occur in the following two chapters: ‘Just as the she-ass three times sees what the ‘seer” cannot…Balaam will three times be given a divine oracle that Balak will not accept’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212455568">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, in this episode we are invited to see Balaam, the protagonist of the pericope as a whole, in a new light. Specifically, it reveals in Balaam himself the very qualities for which Balak is castigated in the rest of the Balaam narrative: like Balak, he fails to recognize a divine imperative when it is transmitted to him through an intermediary, and single-mindedly pursues his own wishes irrespective of the circumstances arrayed against him. In the end, however, it becomes clear that although Balaam is shown to exhibit these characteristically human flaws, unlike Balak, he is not relegated to the role of villain. Rather, at the conclusion of the passage he contritely acknowledges his failure and expresses a willingness to rectify it. Thus, this episode's reversal of roles between Balaam and Balak serves to demonstrate, on the one hand, that Balaam is subject to the same frailty and inner complexity as any other human; but on the other hand, that unlike a figure such as Balak, he is not <italic>defined</italic> by these flaws, but rather avails himself of the opportunity to learn and grow from them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the biblical corpus yields other instances in which its great heroes are portrayed in precisely the same fashion. To bolster my case, therefore, I draw attention to two major illustrative examples, the first of which is the incident involving Judah and Tamar in Genesis 38. This story is situated within an extended sequence of chapters in which Reuben's status as the firstborn son is eclipsed gradually by Judah's rise to a position of leadership over the other brothers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212455568">14</xref></sup> This process has begun already in the last half of the immediately preceding chapter, in which Judah persuades the brothers to sell Joseph in Gen. 37.26–27, evidently without the knowledge of the eldest brother Reuben (see v. 29) and in direct contravention of the latter's desire to save Joseph, as expressed earlier in v. 22. Later in Genesis, chs. 42–45 evince a particular focus on Judah's actions, culminating in his extended and eloquent speech to Joseph in Egypt, just before the latter reveals his identity to his brothers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212455568">15</xref></sup> Consequently, Judah's status as the main character in Genesis 38 accords with his prominence throughout this portion of the book.</p>
<p>In Genesis 38, however, he is shown to be so lustful that he is happy to divulge his symbols of authority rather than miss a chance to sleep with Tamar (v. 18); concerned more about his reputation than about making good on his debt (v. 23); and brutally uncompassionate in his order to have Tamar, his daughter-in-law and a widow, burned for her harlotry (v. 24). In the end, Tamar reveals her identity, which she had concealed from Judah in order to trick him into sleeping with her, and Judah admits his wrongdoing, stating in v. 26 that ‭ןב־לﬠ־יב‬ ‭ינממ‬ ‭ﬣקרצינב‬ ‭ﬣלשל‬ ‭ﬣיﬨﬨנ־אל‬, ‘She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shela, my son’.</p>
<p>In good role-reversing fashion, the function of this episode extends beyond the bounds of the chapter itself, since the text here attests certain key elements connecting it to the surrounding material,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212455568">16</xref></sup> including the following two particularly significant examples. The first is that the animal Judah pledges to Tamar is a kid (‭םיזﬠ־יךג‬, Gen. 38.17), which calls to mind the animal that the brothers slaughtered in the previous chapter (‭םיזﬠ‬ ‭ךיﬠש‬, Gen. 37.31) in order to dip Joseph's tunic in the blood and deceive Jacob. The second is the recurrence in Genesis 38 of the keyword ‭ךיבﬣ‬, ‘recognize’, which denotes an important theme across the bulk of the latter portion of Genesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212455568">17</xref></sup> Just as Tamar shows Judah his staff, seal, and cord and says ‭אנ־ךבﬣ‬, ‘Recognize, please’, to Judah in Gen. 38.25, and he recognizes (‭ךביו‬) in the following verse, the brothers already have said ‭אנ־ךבﬣ‬, ‘Recognize, please’, to Jacob in Gen. 37.32, when they show him Joseph's bloody tunic, and in the next verse he recognized it (‭ﬣךיבינ‬) as having belonged to his son.</p>
<p>In Genesis 38, therefore, the interplay of these two themes—the animal and the keyword ‭ךיבﬣ‬, ‘recognize’—serves to place Judah, foremost among the brothers in this portion of Genesis, in the role held elsewhere by Jacob, the one who is duped. Thus Alter observed that at the moment of Judah's recognition, ‘[i]n the most artful of contrivances, the narrator shows him exposed through the symbol of his legal self given in pledge for a kid (<italic>gedi ʿizim</italic>), as before Jacob had been tricked by the garment emblematic of his love for Joseph which had been dipped in the blood of a goat (<italic>seʿirʿizim</italic>)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212455568">18</xref></sup> In short, this story portrays the actions of Judah, arguably the hero of the larger section of Genesis in which this story falls, as nothing short of despicable; but when his wrongdoing is brought to his attention, he acknowledges it, accepts responsibility, and learns from the experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212455568">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>We turn now to our second example of this type of role-reversing interlude, namely 1 Samuel 25, which is sandwiched between two chapters whose numerous similarities have elicited the opinion in scholarship that they actually are two different versions of the same story, or alternatively that one version adapts and expands on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212455568">20</xref></sup> In the first version, 1 Samuel 24, Saul pursues the fugitive David to En Gedi. David has an opportunity to kill Saul, but does not do so. Ultimately the two men have an extended conversation in which David professes his innocence and urges Saul to stop pursuing him, and in v. 18 [v. 17 in <sc>mt</sc>] Saul admits his wrongdoing: ‭ינממ‬ ‭ﬣﬨא‬ ‭קידצ‬, ‘You are more righteous than I’. In the second version, 1 Samuel 26, Saul pursues David into the wilderness. David sneaks into Saul's camp at night and again forgoes an opportunity to kill the king, instead retreating to a distant hill, from which he has another extended conversation with Saul, who again acknowledges his wrongdoing in v. 21: ‭ﬣגשאו‬ ‭ﬨלבםﬣ‬ ‭ﬣנﬣ‬…‭יﬨאטﬨראמ‬ ‭ﬣבךﬣ‬, ‘I have sinned…behold, I have been foolish, and erred very greatly’.</p>
<p>Between these twin stories stands 1 Samuel 25, the episode involving David, Nabal, and Abigail. While in the wilderness, David and his men have been protecting the estate of the wealthy Nabal. In v. 8, when David hears that the landowner is nearby shearing sheep, he approaches Nabal and asks him to give his men whatever he can provide, in honor of the festive occasion. Nabal is tight-fisted with his provisions, however, and further insults David by saying in v. 10 that ‭םיﬠךפﬨמﬣ‬ ‭איךבﬠ‬ ‭ובך‬ ‭םויﬣוינךא‬ ‭ינפמ‬ ‭שיא‬, ‘Nowadays there are many servants who run away, each from before his lord’. In a rage, David swears in v. 22 that he will annihilate Nabal's entire household. But before he can enact his plan, Nabal's wife Abigail intercedes and delivers a lengthy speech in which she fervently beseeches David to abandon his destructive course. Finally in v. 33, David hears her entreaty, and blesses her for being the one ‭יל‬ ‭יךי‬ ‭ﬠשﬣו‬ ‭םימךב‬ ‭אובמ‬ ‭ﬣזﬣ‬ ‭םויﬣ‬ ‭ינﬨלב‬ ‭רשא‬, ‘who restrained me this day from coming in blood, and my hand (from) avenging me’.</p>
<p>Recent scholarly focus on these three chapters attests recognition of their literary coherence as a unified narrative triad that speaks richly to the major conflict addressed in this portion of the books of Samuel, namely, the tension between David's rise to power and the legitimacy of Saul's dynastic hold on the throne of Israel. Widely touted as the most significant evidence of this unity of voice is the implicit equation of Nabal in 1 Samuel 25 with Saul in 1 Samuel 24 and 26, based on the two figures' perpetration of similarly unjustified and disproportionate affronts against David.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212455568">21</xref></sup> Robert P. Gordon effectively summarized the parallel between these characters: ‘The Nabal story is wedged between two accounts of David's sparing of Saul when he had it in his power to finish him off, and it addresses the same issue: revenge by David's hand, or by God in his own time?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212455568">22</xref></sup> The secondary literature catalogues a wide range of specific textual and literary data linking the two figures,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212455568">23</xref></sup> including such elements as Abigail's reference in v. 29, in her entreaty to David, to a figure who arises ‭ךשפנ־ﬨא‬ ‭שקבלו‬ ‭ךפרﬢל‬, ‘to pursue you and to seek your life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212455568">24</xref></sup> As Ellen van Wolde pointed out, while the ostensible subject matter of Abigail's speech is Nabal's actions and David's impending response, here Abigail describes an individual that hardly can be seen as similar to Nabal, who ‘does not pursue [David] at all; on the contrary, Nabal does not want to be disturbed by him’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212455568">25</xref></sup> but that bears a clear correspondence to Saul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212455568">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the context of this discussion of role-reversals, however, it is to another relationship between parallel characters that I wish to draw attention. In his analysis of all three chapters, 1 Samuel 24–26, as a coherent narrative triad, Garsiel examined how ch. 25 places David, the innocent fugitive, in the role of Saul, the impetuous figure who must struggle constantly to keep his vengeful impulses in check.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212455568">27</xref></sup> Indeed, David's situation in this chapter corresponds remarkably closely to that of Saul in the surrounding chapters. Throughout 1 Samuel, Saul pursues David relentlessly, so much so that his fervor seems to have little to do with whatever original cause sparked it. In 1 Samuel 24 and 26, he comes close enough to catch and kill David, but each time he is persuaded at the last minute to let him go in peace. As Garsiel pointed out, in 1 Samuel 25 it is David whose emotions must be held in check, and who, like Saul, admits his wrongdoing: ‘Chapter 25 relates how David vows to destroy Nabal's house and everything he has, and actually sets out to do so. Were it not for Abigail, who comes to meet him with a gift and a persuasive speech, he would certainly leave no one alive—and would thereby fail in a most serious matter, qualitatively similar to that by which Saul is tested’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212455568">28</xref></sup> This sequence performs a twofold function, therefore, on the one hand rendering Saul somewhat more sympathetic, since even the great hero David can fall victim to the same unrestrained ill humors; and on the other hand, placing David, through his confrontation with Nabal, in precisely the position that Saul occupies in the surrounding narratives. And since Saul is twice able to restrain himself, what a shock it would be if the great David did not likewise turn aside from vengeance in response to Abigail's last-minute entreaty!</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest in any way that we should reject the notion of a connection between Nabal and Saul, which by now has been amply and convincingly demonstrated; nor, for that matter, should it come as a surprise that one might encounter, in a single piece of biblical narrative, a multifaceted literary rendering that offers diverse yet equally legitimate interpretive possibilities. Rather, I simply propose that the intense focus in the discourse on the Nabal-Saul relationship may have obscured the equally important alternative perspective linking David in 1 Samuel 25 with Saul in 1 Samuel 24 and 26, scholarly recognition of which evidently is lacking outside of Garsiel's work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212455568">29</xref></sup> The value of this latter reading, moreover, lies in the access that it alone provides to the role-reversal I have highlighted in the story of David and Nabal.</p>
<p>How, then, are we to understand these two narrative interregna involving Judah and David? Are they aimed at ‘belittling’ these figures and ‘exposing them to ridicule’, to use Marcus's terms?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089212455568">30</xref></sup> In a sense, the answer is ‘Yes’, since in these narratives the emotions, impulses, and actions of the two Israelite heroes are presented as deeply problematic, on both social and theological grounds; and in fact Gary A. Rendsburg argued that although Genesis 38 deals explicitly with Judah, it actually is to be seen as a veiled lampoon of King David himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089212455568">31</xref></sup> On the other hand, however, I believe we go too far if we perceive these stories as unqualified denigrations of these renowned figures. Rather, the interludes in Genesis 38 and 1 Samuel 25 serve to complicate and layer the personalities of Judah and David, working in tandem with the surrounding narratives—with which they share profoundly intimate links—to present a multiplicity of perspectives on the two characters. The overall effect is that their humanity is displayed poignantly in the tension between their heroic qualities and their flawed human nature, or as Garsiel put it, that ‘moral stature is not a fixed ‘given” but is something that a person must fight for repeatedly, struggling against his emotions and passions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089212455568">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>From this standpoint, the perspectives that these two texts provide on Judah and David, respectively, also may be turned fruitfully onto Balaam in the donkey episode. As in the interludes involving Judah and David, Balaam's violent frustration with his donkey and his persistence in trying to subject the situation to his own will bear a remarkable correspondence with the surrounding material, resembling both Balak's repeated attempts to persuade Balaam to come to Moab in the first half of ch. 22, and the king's repeated refusal to accept Balaam's oracular blessings in chs. 23–24.</p>
<p>Moreover, each interlude not only highlights the richness of the central character, but also offers him an opportunity to overcome his shortcomings and thus to learn from his experience. As we have noted, both Judah and David seize this opportunity, their respective admissions of guilt highlighting an important moment of personal growth in each case. Regarding Judah's acknowledgment of his own wrongdoing in Gen. 38.26, for example, Bryan Smith remarked that ‘at last something had happened <italic>in</italic> Judah and not just <italic>to</italic> Judah';<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089212455568">33</xref></sup> and the same observation applies with regard to David's relenting from his vendetta in 1 Sam. 25.33, just as Saul does in the two adjacent chapters.</p>
<p>Likewise in the Balaam narrative: whereas Balak never manages to move beyond his insistence on proceeding with a scenario that is not divinely ordained, by the end of the donkey episode Balaam does recognize his own fault and reorients his thinking in response to this new awareness. Thus, when he acknowledges his error in v. 34, he also pledges to reverse his self-interested ways if such is required of him: ‭יל‬ ‭ﬣבושא‬ ‭ךיניﬠב‬ ‭ﬠך־םא‬ ‭ﬣﬨﬠו‬…‭יﬨאטﬨ‬, ‘I have sinned…and now, if [my journey to Moab is] evil in your eyes, let me return’. The employment here of the conditional ‭םא‬ subtly refers back to the identical usage in God's statement in v. 20, which we have examined above, suggesting that Balaam's admission of guilt represents his cognizance of precisely where he had gone wrong. Indeed, the character of this moment as one of true redemption for Balaam is confirmed in the following verse, where the messenger of Yahweh indicates that his actions require no compensatory reversal. Rather, he is ordered to proceed, with a slightly altered reiteration of the same dictum expressed prior to his departure for Moab: ‭רבדﬨ‬ ‭וﬨא‬ ‭ךילא‬ ‭רברﬢא־רשא‬ ‭רבדﬣ־ﬨא‬ ‭םפאו‬ ‭םישנאﬣ־םﬠ‬ ‭ךל‬, ‘Go with the men; but only the word that I say to you—it shall you speak’.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, it is remarkable, given precedents such as those I have presented here, that the role-reversing interlude has not garnered more widespread scrutiny as a discrete formal trope in biblical literature. Certainly, the evidence I have presented from Genesis 38 and 1 Samuel 25 requires us to reevaluate the episode involving Balaam and his donkey, and invites us to see it, like these other texts, as a scenario that exposes the protagonist's human frailty but ultimately ends with his realization of his own shortcomings and his decision to move beyond them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089212455568">34</xref></sup> From a certain perspective, therefore, one might say that this episode is less concerned with denigrating Balaam than with demonstrating that he possesses a certain strength of character that empowers him to supersede his human imperfections—imperfections, we might add, that others, such as Balak, are unable to overcome.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have noted an intricate network of connections linking the donkey episode with the rest of the Balaam pericope, just as one might expect of such an interlude on the basis of the evidence available in the other examples we have explored. In the light of this interaction, the disjunctive force that one otherwise might attribute to any perceived discrepancies in style or content between this episode and the surrounding prose is mitigated considerably. Such distinctions instead take on a different kind of significance, working in tandem with the evidence I have presented to highlight the donkey episode's status as an interlude—set apart, to be sure, but by no means extraneous. As a result, we encounter in Balaam a rich, complex, and multifaceted character, and experience a deepened appreciation of the overarching continuity of the entire Balaam story in Numbers 22–24, of which this role-reversing interlude is both literally and figuratively a central part.</p>
<p>Finally, the evidence I have presented points to the widespread use in biblical literature of the role-reversing interlude as a versatile, highly expressive means of enriching the central character of a given story, and of expounding upon the themes with which it is concerned. Indeed, this overarching perspective invites us to revisit the sundry tales that populate the biblical corpus, with a specific eye toward still other applications and adaptations of this device in an even broader variety of contexts.</p>
