<abstract>
<p>Nanotechnology is now increasing attention to inter-firm collaboration and alliances for developing nanotechnology commercialisation opportunities. This study explores and examines nanotechnology alliance networking behaviour to determine fully what types of factors drive nanotechnology alliance activities. The proposed research frameworks attempt to fill the gap in knowledge regarding emerging nanotechnology alliance behaviour and to explore the alliance decisions driving inter-firm nanotechnology alliances that are grounded in deeper knowledge of nanotechnology alliances. The primary focus of nanotechnology alliance activity for nanotechnology-based firms confirms that nanotechnology alliances are influenced directly by inter-firm R&amp;D ties and by joint interactions among inter-firm R&amp;D ties, network positions and technological uncertainty. Specifically, we propose that a nanotechnology-based firm is highly likely to engage in alliances regarding decision-making activity. Using an original dataset of nanotechnology-based firms in the emerging nanotechnology alliance activity, we found that the joint effect of a position of high network centrality and a high level of technological uncertainty weakens inter-firm nanotechnology alliances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><sc>THE ECONOMIC AND</sc> societal impact of emerging nanotechnology has been widely discussed by scholars in various fields and the topic has grown rapidly in various fields in recent decades. Many prior studies argue that nanotechnology was potentially the next great commercial opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0971721813489430">Tolfree, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0971721813489430">Uldrich and Newberry, 2003</xref>) and had future economic growth potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971721813489430">Bozeman et al., 2007</xref>). Such emerging nanotechnology presents both opportunities and challenges to existing firms and industries. These effects, of course, are remarkable because many governments have encouraged different fields to invest in nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) programmes. The world’s largest nanotechnology R&amp;D performers, such as United States National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), have invested more than US$14 billion in public funds in nanotechnology R&amp;D programmes since 2000. The Roco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0971721813489430">2003</xref>) discussion of nanotechnology development found that at least 35 countries had initiated large investment programmes in developing R&amp;D of nanotechnology. Similarly, Miyazali and Islam (2007) argued that nanotechnology was widely seen as having great potential for scientific research (in such fields as physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and material sciences) and technological applications (in such fields as human healthcare, life science, communication and electronics) due to its nanoscale, which makes material properties significantly different from those of the same materials in macroscopic form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding nanotechnology application, many researchers noted that nanotechnology had become popular and widely applicable to various domains, such as materials and manufacturing, nanoelectronics and computer technology, pharmaceuticals and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971721813489430">Hung and Chu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971721813489430">Islam and Miyazaki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489430">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0971721813489430">Wilkinson, 2003</xref>), aviation and aerospace exploration, environment and energy sources and biotech and agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedler and Welpe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0971721813489430">Roco, 2003</xref>). One of Taiwan’s most important research institutions, the industrial technology research institute (ITRI), had established a nanotechnology research centre in 2002 that had collaborated with government, universities and firms to engage in nanotechnology R&amp;D collaborative activities. Nanotechnology attracts wide attention not only because of its bridging role in linking science and technology development but also because of its high commercial potential. As a consequence, nanotechnology has attracted widespread attention among researchers, engineers, sociologists and managers for applications in different disciplines. Specifically, many experts have regarded nanotechnology as the next industrial revolution that may improve traditional technologies or material properties to bring more innovative products to almost all disciplines and areas of relevance.</p>
<p>Previous literature clearly explains that nanotechnology may offer a rare opportunity for discovering new technology and possibly creating technological revolutions from a variety of dimensions. The emerging nanoscience is a result of cross-disciplinary (or so-called interdisciplinary) collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489430">Leyedesdorff and Zhou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0971721813489430">Renn and Roco, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489430">Schummer, 2004</xref>). Specifically, the interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology lends itself well to collaborative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489430">Leyedesdorff and Zhou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489430">Schummer, 2004</xref>) across firms in different fields to develop new technology for discovering commercialised opportunities. Similar arguments can be made that nanotechnology could be seen as the most important bridge between basic research and marketable products and processes and, furthermore, that nanotechnology represents the technological prerequisites for various innovations in several disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971721813489430">Fleischer et al., 2005</xref>). As such, most nanotechnology firms are likely to promote interdisciplinary collaborations among different scientific and technological fields. Interdisciplinary research and collaboration are seen as more successful than individual work in achieving breakthroughs and fostering innovation and competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0971721813489430">Porter and Youtie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0971721813489430">Rafols and Meyer, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0971721813489430">2010</xref>). Obviously, a significant concern in nanotechnology development is the interdisciplinary collaboration to further R&amp;D and consequently translate R&amp;D results into commercial applications.</p>
<p>The debate about emerging nanotechnology is, however, problematic, especially given the uncertain nature of nanotechnology development. As noted by Fiedlera and Welpeb (2010), as well as in Sastry et al. (2010), emerging nanotechnology exhibited high levels of uncertainty and possible risk. The uncertainty results mainly because nanotechnology was more complicated than conventional technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971721813489430">Islam and Miyazaki, 2010</xref>). These enormous expectations find expression engagingly in large inter-firm collaborations in increasing the number of scientific, knowledge-based nanotechnology applications. While nanotechnology development emphasises uncertainty, few studies have explored how the technological uncertainty predicted by a focus on inter-firm nanotechnology alliances depends upon the type of uncertainty encountered and on the interaction between alliance network and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of nanotechnology uncertainty and an environment characterised by uncertainty and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedler and Welpe, 2010</xref>), inter-firm alliances are necessary. Inter-firm R&amp;D ties with partners are used as a mechanism not only to decrease uncertainty but also to access complementary resources through appropriate network positions. Powell (1987), for example, stated that the inter-firm alliance helps an organisation to access complementary skills, new competencies, economies of scale in joint research and risk sharing. Successful technological development in emerging nanotechnology requires inter-firm collaboration between different domain partners to acquire complementary technology and knowledge for decreasing uncertainty. Consequently, many nanotechnology firms attempt to build the inter-firm collaborative relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0971721813489430">Pandza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0971721813489430">von Raesfeld et al., 2012</xref>) to ameliorate the phenomena of high uncertainty and risk in the field of nanotechnology development. Furthermore, most previous nanotechnology collaboration research is focused on co-author analysis of nanotechnology related journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489430">Leyedesdorff and Zhou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0971721813489430">Meyer and Persson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489430">Schummer, 2004</xref>) or patent citation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489430">Leyedesdorff and Zhou, 2007</xref>), rather than on inter-firm collaborative behaviour across different technological fields. Although journal and patent analyses are powerful tools in examining links between fields of science and technology, these empirical analyses were not exploring inter-firm strategic collaboration and the behaviour of nanotechnology firms. Currently, few related studies fully explore what types of factors drive inter-firm collaboration in nanotechnology alliances and what specific effects inter-firm alliance networks have on nanotechnology alliances. Consequently, we pose the following research question: To what extent do nanotechnology alliance networks and inter-firm R&amp;D collaboration have an influence on the decision to pursue inter-firm nanotechnology alliances? We derive hypotheses that link nanotechnology alliance networks and inter-firm R&amp;D collaborative relationships for nanotechnology development to nanotechnology alliance strategies. We test our hypotheses using nanotechnology firms across different domain samples.</p>

<title>Ontological Characteristics of Inter-firm Nanotechnology Collaboration</title>
<p>Previous studies have recognised that nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary technology because it utilises interdisciplinary knowledge and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971721813489430">Islam and Miyazaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489430">Nikulainen and Palmberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0971721813489430">Rafols and Meyer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489430">Schummer, 2004</xref>) to promote technological progress and development. There is increasing attention devoted to understanding the relevance of nanotechnology’s interdisciplinary development by social science scholars, but prior studies have largely ignored the inter-firm collaborative behaviours of emerging technology between different network actors in the context of nanotechnology-based firms. Thus, in this study, we contribute to these efforts by applying network embeddedness theory to explore how the inter-firm alliance network facilitates emerging nanotechnology collaboration and to examine nanotechnology firms’ alliance networking behaviours. Nanotechnology-based firms are highly knowledge-and-technology-intensive; thus, inter-firm R&amp;D collaboration is concerned with the transformation of science- and technology-based knowledge into commercialisation opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedlera and Welpeb, 2010</xref>). Inter-firm R&amp;D networks comprise firms, research institutions, universities and government working together to develop and share nanotechnology resource goals. These features are likely to influence the nature and sources of nanotechnology development opportunities and thus the inter-firm collaboration and alliance processes conducted by nanotechnology firms. That effect is remarkable because nanotechnology firms are required to participate in inter-firm collaboration, as nanotechnology builds upon many sciences and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971721813489430">Islam and Miyazaki, 2010</xref>). Thus, the concept of network embeddedness has been used more specifically to analyse certain issues in inter-firm collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971721813489430">Ahuja, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Inter-firm alliance network literature stresses the fundamental role of inter-firm networks in fostering emerging technological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971721813489430">Barringer and Harrison, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0971721813489430">Wiek et al., 2007</xref>) and discovering new business opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>). Specifically, high-tech industries are characterised by rapid technological change that has a major effect on the development of emerging technology not only within organisations but also within inter-firm collaboration and alliance partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489430">Hagedoorn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0971721813489430">Powell, 1998</xref>). Another remarkable characteristic of emerging nanotechnology is its nascent stage position, which is driven by scientific knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedler and Welpe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489430">Nikulainen and Palmberg, 2010</xref>). Thus, nanotechnology could be expected largely to depend on a high degree of interdisciplinary and inter-firm R&amp;D collaboration for development. This characteristic will, in turn, depend on the degree to which the developed scientific knowledge can be acquired through intensive collaboration with various fields’ partners to facilitate the success of nanotechnology commercialization. As argued by Hagedoorn (1993), inter-firm alliances are important strategic tools for firms to exchange, share and access advanced knowledge and technology, as well as resources in different industries. It is therefore particularly important to highlight the inter-firm alliance behaviour through which emerging nanotechnology brings a shift towards emerging technology development and even successful commercialisation. Therefore, exploring the key drivers for nanotechnology alliance network behaviour is important. Meanwhile, an emerging stream in the nanotechnology collaboration literature on inter-firm alliance networks could contribute to a better understanding of nanotechnology alliances on a network level and focusing on continuous networks may offer useful insights into nanotechnology firms’ alliance behaviours.</p>
<p>Science and technology-based firms are increasingly creating emerging nanotechnology development capability through inter-firm alliance networks rather than in-housing R&amp;D for two reasons. First, nanotechnology has been widely applied to various industries and research fields and has, therefore, had a tremendous influence as scientific and technological firms share different disciplines’ specialised knowledge and resources among alliance partners. Meyer and Persson (1998) noted that nanotechnology is more interdisciplinary than other fields of science; therefore, nanotechnology requires different patterns of collaboration to support its development. The interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology is highly pervasive in a variety of scientific knowledge-based applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489430">Nikulainen and Palmberg, 2010</xref>). Thus, nanotechnology firms would rely broadly on inter-firm alliance networks that enable them to acquire external know-how successfully to complement a nanotechnology firm’s advanced nanotechnological development. Furthermore, inter-firm alliance networks may provide nanotechnology firms the opportunity to learn new technology and to access technological capital through frequent interactions with a variety of different partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489430">1999</xref>). Network-based interactions with the nanotechnology alliance network would be of interest to nanotechnology firm managers involved in inter-firm collaboration and alliance, as it would provide rich insights on engaging effectively in collaborative alliances across different fields and participating effectively in emerging nanotechnology development initiatives.</p>
<p>Second, the commercialised applications of nanotechnologies are expected to make contributions in various sectors of the economy and technological and knowledge-based effects might lead to new businesses, new products and even new services. Such broad commercialisation applications may require well-developed inter-firm nanotechnology alliance networks as a platform for supporting a continuous stream of nanotechnology development in the context of multi-industry commercialisation opportunities and to provide a lens for emerging nanotechnology. According to Fiedlera and Welpeb (2010), the successful commercialisation of an emerging technology, such as nanotechnologies, greatly relies on a collaboration commercialisation strategy of many scientific disciplines partners. Given the commercialisation opportunity of relying on a wide application, many nanotechnology firms have recognised the importance of inter-firm alliance networks in building and development. Inter-firm alliance networks can be a source of external knowledge, capabilities and business due to the path-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1999</xref>). Nanotechnology commercialisation may gravitate toward path-dependent processes by which nanotechnology firms accumulate inter-firm alliance network resources that can be further extended to incorporate scientific technologies and knowledge into commercialised nanotechnology goals. Inter-firm alliance network resources not only result from the place of a nanotechnology firm within alliance networks but are also influenced by a firm’s past ties with partners. The path-dependent process enables nanotechnology firms embedded in inter-firm alliance networks to access timing knowledge and technological capital that enhance their commercialisation capabilities.</p>
<p>In sum, to the extent that nanotechnology-based firms attempt to access knowledge and organisational boundaries from a variety of disciplinary firms through inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties, we need to understand better how inter-firm alliance networks at different levels of analysis are affected by network position in their capacity to transmit science and technology knowledge and capabilities. Namely, an important theoretical benefit of nanotechnology-based firm inter-firm collaboration research is the ability to determine whether existing theories are useful predictors of what will happen in the industries where nanotechnology applications are being developed.</p>

<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>

<title>Inter-firm Nanotechnology Alliances</title>
<p>Facing dynamic and rapidly changed environments, many firms are being advised to seek potential external collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1995</xref>) to share risks and acquire complementary assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1999</xref>) and thus to increase their survival and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971721813489430">Miner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0971721813489430">Uzzi, 1996</xref>). Researchers have increasingly noted the inter-firm alliance network as the reservoir of all the industry’s benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489430">Koka and Prescott, 2008</xref>). Through the inter-firm alliance network, firms may discover and exploit critical resources across different organisational boundaries. Consistent with the theoretical appeal of focusing on inter-firm alliance, Gulati (1999) has proposed that firms can access network resources through participation in an inter-firm alliance network. Firms can thus improve their organisational activities because inter-firm alliance networks may provide complementary resources to network members by allowing them to obtain external network resources that cannot be produced through their internal capabilities. We elaborate network theory in the context of nanotechnology firm collaboration to highlight the importance of inter-firm nanotechnology alliances on the emerging nanotechnology R&amp;D activities, as well as commercialised activities. Specifically, recent studies by Lee (2007), Stuart (2000), Ahuja (2000) and Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) have demonstrated that an inter-firm network may be able to access network resources and speed up R&amp;D activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Powell et al. (2005), Ahuja (2000), Hagedoorn et al. (2000) and Powell et al. (1996), inter-firm collaboration is a key mechanism for both knowledge exchange and production in science and technology sectors. The interdisciplinary collaboration of nanotechnology reflects the mission of knowledge-integration activities to produce a higher rate of breakthroughs and thus to solve complex societal problems and foster innovation and competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0971721813489430">Rafols and Meyer, 2007</xref>). This emerging and strong degree of interdisciplinarity in nanotechnology is often required through external collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedlera and Welpeb, 2010</xref>), which reflects that nanotechnology-based firms are dependent on external sources of scientific knowledge and technologies. In light of this dependency, nanotechnology-based firms led to the development of a set of interdependencies between knowledge and technologies, even when inter-firm collaborations occur, with the primary disciplines being contingent on network embeddedness. In scientifically and technologically intensive industries in which inter-firm collaboration are relatively frequent, there can be collaborative embeddedness within alliance networks. As argued by Hagedoorn (1993), firms embedded in inter-firm collaboration engage in collaborative work at all stages, including R&amp;D and the introduction of new products. Nanotechnology-based firms deepen their ability to collaborate with external partners not only to access news resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>) but also to keep pace with the most promising scientific and emerging technological developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>). These effects of collaboration have resulted in nanotechnology fields where nanotechnology firms engage in inter-firm alliance networks to create concrete research activities and, in turn, to drive novel knowledge and emerging technological developments.</p>
<p>In exploring inter-firm nanotechnology alliance status, we apply network theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489430">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0971721813489430">Stuart, 1998</xref>) that provide powerful informational cues for nanotechnology alliance network actors regarding the likely strategies of inter-firm network relationships that influence their behaviours and outcomes. The network theory is a more appealing theory and enables us to identify a landscape of networks that possess the relevant features, as well as to be thorough and explicit concerning how inter-firm alliance network resource flows influence nanotechnology-based firms’ collaborative behaviour. For the purpose of this study, we define the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network as consisting of formalised collaborative relationships across nanotechnology-based organisational boundaries that involve flows of knowledge assets, skill staff, nanotechnologies, equipment, information and organisational skills. Namely, the model in the current study uses inter-firm alliance networks containing formal, contractual collaboration, joint R&amp;D programmes, joint venture and research-driven collaboration, as well as nanotechnology knowledge and know-how exchange among firms, universities, labs, competitors, suppliers and research institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0971721813489430">
<title>Nanotechnology R&amp;D Ties</title>
<p>Nanotechnology-based firms engage in inter-firm R&amp;D collaboration, which serves as a crucial vehicle for complementary technologies and science-based knowledge in promising new commercialisation opportunities. R&amp;D network ties in high-tech industries play a critical role in allowing firms to stay in rapidly changing technological environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>). A firm is already dependent on tight external collaborative relationships for sharing risks, accessing complementary assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1999</xref>) and accelerating R&amp;D activities among different organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971721813489430">Ahuja, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0971721813489430">Stuart, 2000</xref>). Nanotechnology-based firms also require other technologies and science-based knowledge to enhance their ability to facilitate research outcomes when exploring potential commercial opportunities. Specifically, when emerging nanotechnology requires interdisciplinary science-based knowledge and technologies, collaborative R&amp;D alliances provide a fertile ground to refine nanotechnology development capability and access diverse knowledge from a variety of sources. Inter-firm R&amp;D collaborations even may lend a technological and scientific advances fuelled by a large variety of firms engaged in joint R&amp;D, which can improve their technological performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489430">Hagedoorn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0971721813489430">Soh, 2003</xref>). Thus, we argue that a nanotechnology-based firm that participates in abundant inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D collaborations increases its ability to form R&amp;D alliances to facilitate nanotechnologies and science-based knowledge development. A nanotechnology-based firm with close relationships with other collaborative partners may obtain useful and complementary technologies and knowledge to be continuously integrating advanced technologies into updated processes and new products. As a result, such a nanotechnology-based firm likely may frequently collaborate with partners to acquire the external resources that it needs. To have frequent R&amp;D collaboration, a nanotechnology-based firm must have well-developed inter-firm nanotechnology alliance networks that can undertake nanotechnology R&amp;D and obtain benefits from such collaborations. After nanotechnology-based firms increase their R&amp;D collaboration ties, their R&amp;D capability is enhanced and this positive feedback will reinforce the firms’ tendency to look for frequent inter-firm collaborations. Hence, we hypothesize that:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1: As a nanotechnology-based firm has more inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties connected to all other partners in the inter-firm alliance network, its inter-firm alliance frequency increases.</italic></p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Network Centrality</title>
<p>Centrally located firms in an inter-firm alliance network may have plentiful benefits regarding potential external sources in their tight collaborative relationships. Firms in central positions have higher chances to describe their ability to access information and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971721813489430">Freeman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0971721813489430">Wasserman and Faust, 1994</xref>). Firms more centrally located should have more timely access to promising potential collaborators, while those with more collaborative experience should be better positioned to exploit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>). Firms that are located in relatively high central positions in an alliance network have more effective resource integration and coordination than peripheral actors do. Through increased central positions in inter-firm technology alliance networks, individual firms may easily connect to all others and access external resources through shorter paths, which improve performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0971721813489430">Soh, 2003</xref>). In line with this logic, we propose that high central position firms will be more likely to influence inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D alliances for two reasons. First, firms located in high central positions are assumed to have a highly and significant source of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489430">Brass, 1992</xref>); therefore, high central-position firms will have more bargaining power to dominate network resources and partner relationships. As central firms increase their network ties, the network resources dominated by central firms are enhanced and this positive feedback will reinforce firms’ tendency to improve operational efficiency and will enhance their resource endowments. Second, central firms possess a larger number of information sources through their connected ties, through which central firms are likely to access new and timely information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489430">Gnyawal and Madhavan, 2001</xref>) and through which they gain access to better and more resources and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971721813489430">Gulati et al., 2000</xref>). In turn, central firms may easily integrate a set of valuable technologies and knowledge into their R&amp;D activities. Firms that occupy network centrality are not only able to identify potential opportunities through their collaboration partners because they are not constrained by their network position, but the firms also reduce their transaction costs and improve alliance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489430">Goerzen, 2007</xref>). For science and technology-based nanotechnology development and commercialisation, inter-firm R&amp;D alliances may rely on more intense interaction to facilitate what engagement firms need in their nanotechnology R&amp;D activities.</p>
<p>Firms in a position of centrality have a greater chance to access key technologies and knowledge to help their emerging nanotechnology development. Central firms may be better positioned to access the plentiful resources of partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0971721813489430">Burt, 1987</xref>) and may attain critical information due to the formation of multiple ties with many partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489430">Koka and Prescott, 2008</xref>). Nanotechnology-based firms that are central in inter-firm alliance networks can exert influence by being in a position to grasp timely and novel nanotechnology and crucial resources between others because they have the ability to connect to more than only peripheral actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0971721813489430">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) within inter-firm alliance networks. Central firms can easily overcome information constraints and thus enable superior growth by quickly adding many R&amp;D ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0971721813489430">Powell et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, central firms already possess superior nanotechnologies and knowledge information and central-position firms have more opportunities to dominate the network in which firms have greater incentives for R&amp;D efforts. As argued by Gulati (1998), a firm’s central position enables it to enter alliances more frequently with collaborative partners in inter-firm alliance networks. Such positions may not only enhance firms’ ability to explore emerging and novel technologies beyond their familiar domains but also may help firms engage in their R&amp;D activities to complement existing knowledge. We argued that nanotechnology-based firms with more central positions have more R&amp;D ties and that the ties they have provide more connectedness for enhancing a firm’s ability to collaborate closely with partners. By extending these insights to nanotechnology-based firm analysis, we make the argument that network centrality provides different benefits and, consequently, that central firms are likely to interact frequently with collaborative partners to facilitate what they need to engage in nanotechnology R&amp;D activities. This argument suggests the following:

<title>The Moderating Role of Technological Uncertainty</title>
<p>When we examine the relationship between inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and collaborative frequency and when we consider the nature of network positions regarding nanotechnology-based firms within alliance networks, it is important to acknowledge the effect of technological uncertainty on inter-firm collaboration behaviour. In the case of technology exploration-oriented inter-firm alliances, technological uncertainty may be considered to be an important source of exogenous uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0971721813489430">Vassolo et al., 2004</xref>). Nanotechnology is an emerging technological paradigm, which may involve uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489430">Fiedler and Welpe, 2010</xref>), especially regarding novel combinations of technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0971721813489430">Fleming, 2001</xref>) and this uncertainty may undermine the integration of various technologies due to their ill-defined routines and processes and how these methods fit the existing technologies within which they are embedded. Thus, to extend this argument to the inter-firm alliance, Eisingerich et al. (2010) have argued that the effect of inter-firm alliance networks on firm collaborative activities is influenced by technological uncertainty. Uncertainty arises in knowledge- and technology-intensive industries, such as nanotechnology, where emerging and highly specialised technologies make it difficult to integrate existing technologies and novel technologies. In addition, the integration of knowledge and technology from different scientific industries and disciplines may expose uncertainties, especially involving nanotechnology industries in which firms face the highest technological uncertainty regarding novel tacit technologies and the know-how actions of inter-firm R&amp;D collaboration. Thus, we reason that high technological uncertainty will increase the likelihood of integration and coordination risks and costs, which may be reduced by utilising external alliance networks.</p>
<p>Despite recognising the importance of a central position in inter-firm alliance networks, this study nevertheless remains skeptical that uncontrolled exogenous factors—such as technological uncertainty—may increase uncertainty for inter-firm alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0971721813489430">Veugelers and Cassiman, 2005</xref>). Indeed, nanotechnology development is based on specific knowledge and technological applications that are derived from a variety of industries. The development of complementary technologies can potentially create technological applications and increase commercialisation. Given the specific characteristics of scientific knowledge and technologies, inter-firm R&amp;D activities are highly uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971721813489430">Holmstrom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0971721813489430">Sampson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0971721813489430">Veugelers and Cassiman, 2005</xref>) and there exist high information asymmetries between partners and high transaction costs for knowledge and technology exchange, such as nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0971721813489430">Veugelers and Cassiman, 2005</xref>). These uncertainties make it difficult for a firm to infer what its partner contributes to the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0971721813489430">Sampson, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the highly uncertain and non-codifiable nature of the scientific know-how of nanotechnologies results in high transaction costs and systemic failures in established and novel nanotechnology know-how integration. Additionally, in this case, information asymmetries and the uncertain and tacit nature of nanotechnology may endanger the exploitation of inter-firm collaboration and alliance benefits. These risks could relate to higher transaction costs for inter-firm collaborative agreements in highly uncertain nanotechnology R&amp;D alliances. As a consequence, when translating this reasoning to inter-firm nanotechnology collaboration surroundings, we expect the concept of technological uncertainty to act as a moderating parameter of the relationships between inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and the frequency of inter-firm nanotechnology collaboration activities.</p>
<disp-quote>

<title>Sample, Survey Design and Data Collection</title>
<p>Because we focus our attention on the inter-firm alliances of nanotechnology-based firms, we considered that inter-firm nanotechnology alliances are based on the two criteria. First, the nanotechnology-based firms were registered in the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in Taiwanese. The nanotechnology-based firms register in the well-defined IDB to ensure the availability and reliability of the nanotechnology-based firm’s data. Second, the alliance relationship criteria proposed by Laumann et al. (1983) was used to define the boundaries for identifying an inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network. According to the sampling frame of IDB, the census survey was used in this study to collect data. By doing so, we can capture and identify the ego networks of nanotechnology-based firms by studying a bounded community of firms and the inter-firm network ties between their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0971721813489430">Wasserman and Faust, 1994</xref>). That is, nanotechnology-based firms that formed at least one nanotechnology alliance with their partners were included when identifying the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network.</p>
<p>A database of nanotechnology-based firms is available from the website of Fansio and the IDB of MOEA also lists nanotechnology-based firms. The IDB is administered by the MOEA, which listed different industries’ firms as registered in Taiwan. According to our selection criteria, there are 297 total nanotechnology-based firms registered and listed in the dataset. We sent questionnaires to all nanotechnology-based firms. All nanotechnology-based firms were surveyed because the inter-firm alliance network needed to contain a sufficient number of samples to explore the networking circumstance. Completed surveys were returned directly to the researchers. After three rounds of reminders, there were 82 complete responses (28.1 percent response rate). We used the information of nanotechnology firms from the databases to analyse response rates but found on difference between the final 82 nanotechnology firms and the non-response firms for which the survey was not returned in terms of their inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network. The resulting sample contained 17 chemical firms, 15 biotech and health care firms, 14 electronic component firms, 14 material firms, 8 semiconductor firms, 8 research institutions, 2 optics and precision firms, 2 plastic firms, and 2 textile firms. Given the sample size of nanotechnology-based firms, the egocentric nanotechnology alliance network is probably the best indicator of key information regarding inter-firm collaboration characteristics, as well as characteristics of firms’ relationships with nanotechnology-based networking. In addition, because inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and collaborative behaviour consequences were the main focus of this study, we used the firms as the level of analysis to construct a nanotechnology-based dataset. The focus on nanotechnology-based firms enables us to construct a sample of firms that share some common characteristics regarding their inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D collaboration and alliance behaviour.</p>
<p>To explore the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network, we sent a well-defined questionnaire to nanotechnology-based firms and their partners to collect inter-firm nanotechnology alliance data; the questionnaire asked them to describe how focal nanotechnology-based firms interacted with multiple partners and identify firms that had engaged in inter-firm joint nanotechnology development activities during the sample timeframe. Particularly, we first build a database of the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network of nanotechnology-based firms and then use network analysis methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0971721813489430">Scott, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0971721813489430">Wasserman and Faust, 1994</xref>) to capture the links between nanotechnology-based firms and partners involved in inter-firm nanotechnology collaborative activities, i.e., universities, competitors, suppliers and governmental institutions, to yield a complete visual representation of their network linkages. Next, to construct an egocentric nanotechnology alliance network, we apply the snowball sampling technique to identify primary alliance network actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971721813489430">Laumann et al., 1983</xref>); this technique is useful for analysing nanotechnology alliance networks and it is widely used in constructing inter-firm alliance networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489430">Gulati, 1995</xref>) and examining consequences to explore firms’ behaviours. This study focuses on the effects of an egocentric nanotechnology alliance network and examines how and under what contingencies diverse network positions help focal firms capture and convert varied external nanotechnology and science-based knowledge into inter-firm collaborative outcomes. In this study, we defined the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network with respect to the frequency of nanotechnology collaborations or joint nanotechnology, know-how and knowledge developments between nanotechnology-based firms and their partners. We subsequently applied these collaborative relationships to the co-development of new nanotechnology and commercialisation opportunities.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The central proposition of this study is that each focal nanotechnology-based firm needs to collaborate with partners to acquire distinct sources of nanotechnologies. These specific nanotechnologies arise from the particular alliance characteristics through which the imperatives are made manifest. As argued earlier, inter-firm alliance is an important outcome indicator for nanotechnology-based firms in which managers must spend a significant amount of time and effort on such an alliance. This variable reflects the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance used by nanotechnology-based firms to acquire nanotechnology, know-how and knowledge over the past year. The high inter-firm R&amp;D collaborative frequency of nanotechnology-based firms enables the switching and acquisition of know-how, interdisciplinary nanotechnologies and knowledge between focal nanotechnology-based firms and partners using nanotechnology development. This collaboration also aids the end goal of commercialisation. We operationalised this variable by asking the managers of nanotechnology-based firms to report how frequently and with what intensity they had to spend a significant amount of time and effort to collaborate with their alliance partner. To assess the degree of nanotechnology collaborations and alliances, we used an ordinal scale from 1 to 5, with the value of 1 equalling ‘never’ and the value of 5 equalling ‘very much’.</p>

<sec id="section12-0971721813489430">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p><bold>Nanotech R&amp;D ties:</bold> The number of inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties a focal nanotechnology-based firm has is used to capture the extent of its involvement in core nanotechnology collaborations and joint activities of the inter-firm alliance. Network studies often use name and position generators to measure network ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971721813489430">Batjargal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971721813489430">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971721813489430">Laumann et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0971721813489430">Lin et al., 2001</xref>). To capture the nanotechnology R&amp;D ties, we follow Lin et al. (2001) and Burt (1992), who asked respondents to list all alliance partners to build a holistic inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network. This approach enables us to identify egocentric networks as a source of inter-firm nanotechnology alliances in this study. The number of a focal nanotechnology-based firm’s R&amp;D alliances reflects its network profile for the purposes of nanotechnology development and the exploration of commercialisation opportunity.</p>
<p><bold>Network centrality:</bold> Network centrality in the alliance network is an important aspect of positional advantage, which is the number of direct contacts a focal firm is connected to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971721813489430">Freeman, 1979</xref>). Of the different measures of network centrality, we apply degree centrality to measure a focal firm’s position in the alliance network because it can capture a focal firm’s direct partner relationships in its ego networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0971721813489430">Everett and Borgatti, 2005</xref>). Thus, to this degree, centrality is a good indicator of the network positions for measuring the inter-firm alliance network. Following the prior work of Freeman (1979), we used degree centrality to capture a focal firm’s visibility in an inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network. Our centrality measure, a proxy for degree centrality measures, is created with Ucinet 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489430">Borgatti, et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Technological uncertainty:</bold> Nanotechnology is in a fluxional state; therefore, it is likely to change significantly in the future. That is, the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance of nanotechnology-based firms may be influenced by technological uncertainty. Hence, five items from prior work were adapted and revised to measure technological uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0971721813489430">Jaworski and Kohli, 1993</xref>). Technological uncertainty contains five items: examining the role of nanotechnology in changing products, examining the role of nanotechnology in changing industry, new product ideas from technological breakthroughs, nanotechnology development in minor and difficulty in forecasting nanotechnology for the next two to three years. The five items were measured on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). The obtained alpha reliability coefficient for this construct was .0.7 and in the CFA, the construct obtained strong reliability with values of .0.56 for construct reliability.</p>
<p><bold>Control variables:</bold> Prior research argues that specific factors may influence the inter-firm alliance outcome of a firm. These factors need to be controlled for to reduce influence on empirical results. Five control variables were included in our empirical analyses: firm size, firm age, ownership type, industry type and division.</p>
<p><italic>Firm size</italic>: Firm size can influence firm performance and productivity. Large firms may offer more redundant resources when investing in inter-firm alliances for the development of new nanotechnology products and discovering new opportunities. Consequently, we include firm size as a control variable to test the hypothesis. Firm size is defined as the total number of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489430">Goerzen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489430">Koka and Prescott, 2008</xref>). (a) <italic>Firm age</italic>: Firm age could be associated with inter-firm alliance behaviours. A well-established firm is more likely to have strong skills and solid financial capability to engage in inter-firm alliance activities. Hence, we controlled for firm age, which was measured by how many years the nanotechnology-based firms have been operating. (b) <italic>Industry type</italic>: Different industry type may have different influences on nanotechnology R&amp;D activity and firms’ alliance outcomes. We controlled for industry type with the high-tech industry coded as 1 (for example, computers, electronic equipment, biotechnology) and 0 = other industries (for example, apparel, food, agriculture, and so on). (c) <italic>Ownership status</italic>: Ownership status is another firm characteristic included as a control variable and identifies whether the firm engages in inter-firm nanotechnology alliance activities. We further controlled for ownership status as a dummy variable, coding wholly domestic-owned firms as one and wholly foreign-owned firms as zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971721813489430">Li et al., 2008</xref>). (d) <italic>Division different</italic>: Division difference is a dummy variable to differentiate between two divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0971721813489430">Shaner and Maznevski, 2011</xref>). Division difference is used to describe inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D activities across different sectors (coded as one) and zero represents nanotechnology collaborative activities contained in the same sector.</p>

<sec id="section13-0971721813489430">
<title>Statistical Model</title>
<p>Because the dependent variable represents discrete categories, we cannot use traditional least square regression as an analysis technique. That is, ordinary regression techniques using ordered categorical dependent variables may produce statistical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971721813489430">Long, 1997</xref>). Instead, we use the ordered logit method because the dependent variable takes ordered values that represent different levels of inter-firm collaboration frequency. An ordered logit model is preferred over OLS regression because the dependent variable is ordinal, rather than interval, in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489430">Agresti, 1996</xref>). In addition, an ordered logit model can provide a robust and valid method for testing and estimating the effect of an ordered categorical variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971721813489430">Long, 1997</xref>). Therefore, the ordered logit regression model employed in testing our hypothesis is more appropriate than the OLS regression model which is because the data are not strictly continuous and require the incorporation of firm effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489430">Kennedy, 1998</xref>). With the ordered logit regression model, we can infer whether inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D alliances can better be described as a point along a separate and distinct alternative. The general specification of the ordered logit regression model is as follows:

<title>The Structure of the Nanotechnology Network</title>
<p>In this section, we depict the actual structure of the nanotechnology collaboration and alliance network. This inter-firm nanotechnology network is captured by the network diagrams sketched with the program Netdraw. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0971721813489430">Figure 2</xref> presents a visual map of the nanotechnology collaborative R&amp;D alliance network, which is a group of nanotechnology-based firms extensively sharing collaborative partners and maintaining close relationships that create collaborative partner clustering. Within this figure, the nodes represent firms; the lines connecting the nodes represent nanotechnology R&amp;D ties. The collaborative partners of focal nanotechnology-based firms include research institutions, governmental agencies, international organisations, medical institutions, other nanotechnology-based firms, labs and public/private universities that have engaged in nanotechnology R&amp;D alliances. Each network tie with an arrow represents a formal inter-firm R&amp;D collaborative relationship between nanotechnology-based firms and their collaborative partners. Network visualization can help trace the role of the nanotechnology-based firms and collaborative partners in forging connectivity within the inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D collaboration community. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0971721813489430">Figure 2</xref> shows a highly connected nanotechnology alliance network in which more than 200 firms have engaged in a multitude of joint R&amp;D agreements. Additionally, numerous firms are highly connected to nanotechnology network actors (the nodes in the centre of the network) with several isolated pairs and isolated clusters. In addition, the size of the nodes is based on the degree attribute value that reflects the degree of importance of the inter-firm nanotechnology alliance network assigned to the overall network. Specifically, actors with more network ties represent crucial nanotechnology and know-how in the network. Meanwhile, the entire structure is neither uniformly dense nor sparse, being composed of two primary clusters along firm 16 and 119. These results imply that the nodes were well-connected and that it may be easy to acquire various resources and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0971721813489430">Scott, 1991</xref>). A firm may be able to dominate the alliance network, as well as to control the flow of nanotechnological know-how and knowledge resources.</p>

<p>In addition, we measured network density, transitivity, distribution of degree and average social distance in nanotechnology alliance network. Network density is defined as the number of ties expressed as a proportion of the maximum possible ties in a network. The density of the nanotechnology alliance network in this study is 0.011, which indicates that only about 1.1 per cent of all the possible ties are present. This is due to the fact that the low density is a characteristic of large networks as it is inversely related to the network size. The larger the network, the smaller is the density. The network transitivity is regarded as a mechanism that a focal firm gains competencies and resources from one network tie to improve their value, where actor derives from exchanges with an independent third relation. In the nanotechnology alliance networks, there are 93 transitive (directed) triples. Furthermore, the social distance between two actors in a network is defined as the length of the shortest path between them. In a nanotechnology alliance network effects, nanotechnology firms’ average social distance scores are 4.44. This means score on the whole suggests that most of nanotechnology firms are willing to have some form of social contact with partners. On the one hand, the important attribute of the nanotechnology alliance network is the degree, which is defined as the number of collaboration connected that a single actor has. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0971721813489430">Table 1</xref> presents in detail the distribution of degree in the nanotechnology alliance network. Most nanotechnology firms (65.1 per cent) had one alliance partner in our sample.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the left-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0971721813489430">Figure 2</xref> presents a part of the network that is highly dense because of the highest number of collaborative partners connected with node 16. By contrast, the right-hand side of the figure shows a relatively loosely concentrated area of the nanotechnology network that is somewhat loose in structure. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0971721813489430">Figure 2</xref>, node 16 is well-known and is the most important research institution. The Industrial Technology Research Institutes (ITRI) in Taiwan have a large number of links and play a crucial bridging role for assisting in the development of emerging technologies and transferring them to collaboration partners. This importance is certainly reflected in the share of the ITRI in R&amp;D partnering. In addition, node 119 represents one of the dominant semiconductor firms, United Microelectronic Corporation (UMC). UMC has exploited many important nanotechnologies and know-how and, moreover, has contributed and transferred to its collaboration partners. In the above finding, we already noticed that ITRI had become the dominant form of inter-firm R&amp;D partnering, which reinforces Taiwan’s technological competitiveness and accelerates production-education-research collaboration. Consequently, in the context of the overall dominance of inter-firm R&amp;D partnering, ITRI has shared outstanding and critical research outcomes with its partners (for example, nanotechnology firms, public/private universities) to assist collaboration partners in overcoming the deficiencies in their R&amp;D competencies via R&amp;D alliance networks. Conversely, UMC is a leading semiconductor firm in high-tech industries. As an industrial leader, this company conducts and produces a functional 65-nanometer integrated circuit (IC) to its collaboration partners and furthermore adapts a 28-nanometer process technology to produce chips. Given these outcomes, star network players are directly connected to the research networks of other collaboration partners and rely largely on inter-firm joint R&amp;D agreements for fulfilling emerging nanotechnology development. As a consequence, inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D alliance networks are becoming important conduits for complementary technologies and knowledge.</p>

<title>Empirical Analysis</title>
<p>Most regression models require homoscedasticity for consistent estimation of the error terms. In case this assumption is violated, the estimations might suffer from heteroscedasticity. We therefore estimated the heteroscedasticity by using a robust regression technique to correct for possible heteroscedasticity. The results of the chi-square test reject heteroscedasticity in all model specifications. These results are suggesting no heteroscedasticity in our data set.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0971721813489430">Table 2</xref> reports the means, standard deviations and correlations among variables included in the analysis. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0971721813489430">Table 3</xref>, we use hierarchical models to test our hypotheses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0971721813489430">Table 3</xref> presents the results of the hierarchical ordinal logit regression analysis for testing the hypothesis. Model 1 is the baseline model, in which all control variables, such as firm size, firm age, industry type, ownership status and division difference, are included. Model 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0971721813489430">Table 3</xref> shows that nanotechnology R&amp;D ties are significantly and positively related to nanotechnology alliance (0.264, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which provides support for Hypothesis 1. A positive and significant coefficient indicates that the variable is positively correlated with a greater likelihood that the nanotechnology-based firms are likely to spend a significant amount of time and effort on nanotechnology alliances with their collaborative partners. Our hypothesis 2 argues that network centrality positively moderates the relationship between nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and nanotechnology alliance activity. Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0971721813489430">Table 3</xref> shows that the interaction coefficient between nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and alliance activity is positive and significant (0.409, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which supports Hypothesis 2. Our hypothesis 3 argues that joint interaction of nanotechnology R&amp;D ties, network centrality and technological uncertainty simultaneously have a negative impact on nanotechnology alliance activity. As expected, the results in Model 3 show that the coefficient for the three-way interaction is negatively and significantly (–0.109, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) related to nanotechnology technology alliances. This result supports Hypothesis 3 and implies that technological uncertainty with network centrality positions may mitigate nanotechnology alliances because uncertainty accompanies higher transaction costs between collaboration partners. This result implies that when technological uncertainty increases, the negative effect of inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and the advantage of network centrality of focal nanotechnology-based firms become weaker.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This study focuses on a focal nanotechnology-based firm’s inter-firm nanotechnology alliance behaviour. Social network theory considers how nanotechnology-based firms acquire nanotechnology resources through inter-firm R&amp;D ties and alliance networks. This study develops new theoretical explanations and presents new empirical evidence to advance our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of inter-firm nanotechnology alliance behaviour in the emerging nanotechnology industry. The evidence found indicates that emerging nanotechnology firms need inter-firm R&amp;D ties to support their alliance activity.</p>
<p>The emerging nature of nanotechnology still requires complementary resources to support emerging technologies’ development. As noted by Inkpen and Beamish (1997), interdependent partners, particularly in emerging fields, greatly rely on external collaborative partners to access advanced technologies and knowledge.</p>
<p>The results regarding the network position of a focal nanotechnology-based firm provided evidence that centrally located nanotechnology-based firms are likely to have more opportunities to collaborate with partners for acquiring emerging technologies resources. This result suggests that they are more actively seeking collaboration with partners and trying to identify emerging nanotechnological development and commercialised applications. The availability of centrally positioned firms also drives emerging nanotechnology exchange, indicating that the more unique collaborations are related to emerging technological activities in the form of joint R&amp;D.</p>
<p>In addition, our study further explored the two contingency perspectives of network centrality and technological uncertainty by examining the joint interaction effects that influence nanotechnology R&amp;D ties. The contingencies tested were the reality inter-firm nanotechnology collaborations and alliances, which may help nanotechnology-based firms to understand and explore the tension between making nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and alliance activity. Our results suggest that when a focal firm operates in the fluxional state of emerging nanotechnology fields, nanotechnology-based firms have fewer inter-firm R&amp;D ties because such R&amp;D investments are less likely to obtain expected outcomes. Moreover, a high level of technological uncertainty reduces the value of emerging nanotechnology development, due to mismatches in rapidly changing technological environments. In an environment of high level technological uncertainty, nanotechnology-based firms and their partners who engage jointly in nanotechnology R&amp;D activities are not able to predict future changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0971721813489430">Song and Montoya-Weiss, 2001</xref>) and it is therefore difficult for the partners to respond with objective and formal procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971721813489430">Atuahene-Gima and Murray, 2004</xref>). As a result, we found that a high level of technological uncertainty is unlikely to contribute to collaboration R&amp;D activities and thus likely to obstruct nanotechnology development or to accompany high levels of R&amp;D investment risk. By examining these contextual factors, we may easily obtain results that either enhance or reduce the potential influence of nanotechnology R&amp;D ties on alliance activity. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of whether and how nanotechnology-based firms should invest in nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and appropriately engage in nanotechnology alliances.</p>

<title>Contributions and Limitations</title>
<p>In our view, this study contributes to technology management and practices in three important ways. First, this study develops new theoretical explanations and presents new empirical evidence to advance our understanding of the emerging nanotechnology antecedents and consequences of inter-firm alliance behaviours in the emerging nanotechnology industry. This study contributes theoretical explanations and empirical findings to the technology management research and practice. We explain why inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D embeddedness increases inter-firm alliance activity and leads to alliance rank orders of nanotechnology-based firms and we explain how inter-firm level collaboration enables a nanotechnology-based firm to achieve a higher frequency collaboration rank in such an emerging technology. Second, although growing attention is paid to interdisciplinary R&amp;D alliances and the demonstrated linkage between inter-firm collaboration R&amp;D efforts within nanotechnology alliance activities, these effects are still not thoroughly understood and explored. The study is an early effort in examining the effects of nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and network status on nanotechnology alliance activities in the emerging nanotechnology fields. Specifically, our focus on inter-firm nanotechnology collaboration and alliance demonstrates significance and goes beyond the few previous studies in examining the link between social networks and nanotechnology alliances. Finally, drawing on social network theory and empirical studies results, this study takes a step forward in linking two separate streams of research on inter-firm nanotechnology alliance activities. This study had explored how nanotechnology-based firms’ inter-firm R&amp;D ties and network attributes of alliance relationships drive inter-firm nanotechnology alliances. This study extends prior social network research by addressing both nanotechnology alliance attributes and network characteristics. Our study highlights the importance of network position of a focal nanotechnology-based firm in alliance activity. A firm likely benefits more from inter-firm alliance networks through centrality positions when making emerging nanotechnology alliance decisions. Specifically, we extend social network theory by providing a contingency perspective on the choice of inter-firm alliance, finding that both network positions and technological uncertainty moderate the relationship between nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and inter-firm nanotechnology alliances.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study. First, according to the sample frame of Fansio and IDB, our response rate is relatively low; therefore, the sample size is not large enough to explain holistic nanotechnology-based firms’ alliance behaviour. Because many nanotechnology-based firms viewed nanotechnology collaboration and alliance with collaborative partners as a security agreement, they do not provide detailed information about inter-firm nanotechnology R&amp;D ties and alliance activity. This lack may increase the difficulty of surveying information and may result in an incomplete data set. Second, we have restricted the survey to one specific form of alliance, specifically, a focal nanotechnology-based firm that engages in inter-firm collaboration and alliances frequently. While this specification allows us to control for confounding contextual factors that might be present if different alliance forms were surveyed, it also represents a potential limitation to the generalisability of the results. Future research should incorporate other alliance form measures to explore inter-firm nanotechnology alliance behaviour. Third, our study has focused mainly on inter-firm nanotechnology alliance behaviour. There are many other interesting issues that may also be applied to inter-firm collaboration to make nanotechnology R&amp;D ties decisions. For instance, nanotechnology-based firms may be more willing to engage in interdisciplinary collaborations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489430">Nikulainen and Palmberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0971721813489430">Rafols and Meyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0971721813489430">Schummer, 2004</xref>) if they are promised future promotional nanotechnology development and commercialisation opportunities. Due to data limitations, we are not able to explore these issues directly in this study. Future research might consider examining interdisciplinary collaboration capability.</p>
