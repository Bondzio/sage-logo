<p>Malcolm Miles’s <italic>Herbert Marcuse: An Aesthetics of Liberation</italic> sets itself a limited but precise task. Miles wishes ‘to offer an introductory commentary relating specifically to Marcuse’s aesthetic theories’ (p. 1). From a practical point of view, this is very timely, since the ongoing publication of Marcuse’s <italic>Collected Papers</italic> have made the broad sweep of his work newly accessible, particularly to those who do not read German. Indeed, Miles relies heavily on this collection, and on Douglas Kellner’s substantial introductions to each volume. From a conceptual point of view, also, Marcuse’s critical articulation of pleasure and memory retain a provocative edge and deserve attention today. Yet there are formidable barriers in the way of even Miles’s limited goal, and perhaps none more than the inaugural move of separating the aesthetic from the larger critical theory.</p>
<p>The book is organised in an intuitive fashion. The introduction and first chapter set out the broad lines of the project, the biographical context of its author, the supposed aesthetic deficit of the Marxist tradition, and Marcuse’s intervention in it with his last book, <italic>The Aesthetic Dimension</italic> (1977). The remaining chapters proceed chronologically, each discussing one or more of Marcuse’s texts and reconstructing its particular historical context until, with the final chapter, Miles turns to discuss examples drawn from the art world in the Marcusean terms he has been elaborating.</p>
<p>Marcuse’s political education began with the failed German Revolution of 1919. Marcuse, in Berlin, was nonetheless drawn to Kurt Eisner’s Bavarian Republic, which met with such scorn from Max Weber. But Marcuse’s involvement in the revolution was brief, and over even before the fighting. Here, as elsewhere, Miles makes an effort to remind the reader about historical distance. ‘Writing this in a quiet town in Devon in 2011, I have to make a big historical adjustment to understand that critical theory emerged in conditions in which the lives, and not just employment prospects, of those who contributed to it were radically insecure’ (p. 32). Aesthetics was at the heart of Marcuse’s intellectual response to the events of 1918-1919. It took the form of his 1922 dissertation in <italic>Germanistik</italic> on the theory of the <italic>künstlerroman</italic> – the artist novel. Miles finds in this dissertation, and particularly its treatment of Thomas Mann’s <italic>Death in Venice</italic>, ‘a theory of art as a fracturing of the dominant society’s mind-set, in a consciousness of beauty’ (p. 38). For Miles, ‘what emerges is the significance of art for Marcuse … as a vehicle for negation of unfreedom when political conditions are not open to radical change’ (p. 40). This, expressed in different ways at different moments, remains the basic lesson Miles draws from Marcuse’s aesthetics.</p>
<p>The next two chapters pursue this line of investigation through commentary on Marcuse’s ‘The affirmative character of culture’ (1937) and ‘Some Remarks on Aragon’ (1945). Miles moves rapidly through Marcuse’s period as a Heidegger student in order to introduce him, as quickly as possible, into the Frankfurt School. Miles wants to emphasise the latter at the expense of the former. The difference in outlook between the reigning powers of the Frankfurt School and Marcuse is nicely summarised by a quote from Angela Davis (consistently referred to in the text and index as ‘Davies’), recounting how in the 1960s, Adorno told her, ‘my desire to work directly in the radical movements of that period was akin to a media studies scholar deciding to become a radio technician’ (p. 43) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">Davis 2005</xref>). Marcuse, in contrast, supported her activism. In any case, the essay on ‘Affirmative culture’ was born of Marcuse’s engagement with Horkheimer and Adorno. It is in continuity with their attempts to explain how particular cultural forms allow for, even called forth, fascism (p. 58). ‘Some remarks on Aragon’, published for the first time only in 1993, finds the possibility of resistance to fascism not in explicitly political writing, but rather in ‘the literature of intimacy’, exemplified by Paul Éluard (pp. 74-80). As with Mann, so with Éluard, beauty in art rescues the memory of utopia in political conditions that render other forms of dissent impossible.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter shifts to Marcuse’s response to the uprisings of the late-1960s. This creates an odd gap in the narrative of Marcuse’s development, leaving out the most significant of his critical theory writings, particularly <italic>Eros and Civilization</italic> (1955) and <italic>One-Dimensional Man</italic> (1964). In the late-1960s, it seemed possible to Marcuse that a ‘new sensibility’ would allow form to manifest human freedom as society itself. This would be, although Miles does not pursue this formulation, the moment of intersection between Schiller and the New Left (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">Jameson 1972</xref>: 83-116). The situation of the 1960s is summarised thus: ‘Against a total institutionalization … personal experience and imagination were inherently oppositional’ (p. 90). It is never quite clear whether this is a description of the moment of the late-1960s as Miles believes it to really have been, or only a description of lived experience.</p>
<p>Miles’s sixth chapter examines Marcuse’s suggestion that the time had come, at the end of the 1960s, to finish with utopia. Liberation, a post-scarcity and post-repression society, was actually now possible, and utopia was no longer an appropriate idiom. Marcuse poses liberation in biological terms, which clearly makes Miles uncomfortable. He consistently connects it backward to the Marx of the ‘Theses on Feuerbach’, but finds no good way of explaining how subversive new needs might be distinguished from merely consumerist ones, and in particular no way of connecting this to the activity of aesthetics: that is, the re-ordering of the ‘codes and categories’ of the dominant system. A critical class separate from the old proletarianised working class, however, will have to be identified. Miles traces Marcuse’s influence forward here to André Gorz, and hazards the suggestion that the difference between the two is that, for Gorz as for many today, agency is diffused (pp. 119, 121) rather than simply relocated. In what is one of the more potentially productive confrontations in the book, Miles brings Henri Lefebvre’s critique of Marcuse into the picture. Miles makes the intriguing suggestion that one might replace Marcuse’s <italic>temporally</italic> articulated theory with one that is <italic>spatially</italic> articulated (p. 125). It seems that this is a move in the direction of Ernst Bloch’s <italic>Spirit of Utopia</italic>, toward the idea of co-present but disarticulated temporalities.</p>
<p>In the seventh chapter, having now traversed Marcuse’s career, Miles returns to <italic>The Aesthetic Dimension</italic>. For Miles, the aesthetics articulated in this last decade of Marcuse’s life is not a retreat to mere introspection, but a response to the clear failure of the revolutionary surge of the late-1960s. This assertion relies, we might notice, on the claim that Marcuse’s earlier writings on aesthetics were, in their own moments and on their own terms, successful responses to political failures. In any case, we are here getting close to a usable Marcuse. Authenticity in art can now be defined as ‘the transposition of content into form, and the transposition of the sedimented traces of conditions of unfreedom into aesthetic form’ (p. 133). Art is a truth-making activity, able to transcend the given. So, Miles summarises, ‘imagining the world as it could be, rather than accepting the monopoly of the given, involves the incipient realisation of that world in the process of its articulation as a counter-reality’ (p. 134). For Miles, then, ‘art offers a viable arena for the articulation of imaginative worlds, as a safe house within the terrain occupied by advanced capitalism, as a zone of experiment, a process of improvisation rather [than] a manufacture of solutions, which <italic>is</italic> the revolution’ (p. 134).</p>
<p>The book’s final chapter, after summarising what has thus far been acquired (pp. 148-9), takes up works of art and evaluates them according to these criteria. Picasso’s <italic>Guernica</italic> turns out to be too explicitly political, insufficiently convulsive, and easily ‘co-opted into the narrative of modern art’ (p. 152). Joseph Beuys’s open studio as a prefiguration of participatory democracy fares somewhat better, although in the end even its destruction of the category of art relies on the mediation of Beuys as a ‘shaman’ figure (p. 155). Miles in the end reduces Marcuse to the portable slogan: ‘beauty is a protest’ (p. 162). That beauty is always-already enmeshed in structures of capitalist domination is not to be met with critical reflection, but with the admission of paradox and a reference to art as ‘negated reality’ (p. 163). Art and aesthetics are rolled into beauty, which is figured always as ‘convulsive’, as a limit-moment. Since the system of capitalist domination always appears as total, this limit-experience is almost automatically emancipatory.</p>
<p>Miles set out to write an introduction to Marcuse’s aesthetic thought for use by undergraduates and professionals. Marcuse emerges from the pages of Miles’s book as a fascinating historical figure, useful for understanding the peculiar turns of the intellectual history of the 20th century. Yet energetic undergraduates should read Marcuse himself, who is an accessible writer; or they could look, for compressed accounts of his thought, to Fredric Jameson, Martin Jay, or Kellner’s introductions to the <italic>Collected Papers</italic>. Miles has not made the case that Marcuse’s aesthetics are more useful today than those of, say, Jacques Rancière – nor that among his contemporaries he is more worth returning to than Georg Lukács. It might have been possible to make both cases, but only by arguing for the broader sweep of Marcuse’s critical theory. Nonetheless, Miles does demonstrate that Marcuse’s work deserves today more attention than it receives.</p>
