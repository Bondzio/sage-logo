<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to understand the stick–slip properties of para-aramid woven fabrics. Para-aramid Twaron CT®716 (CT716) and Twaron CT®714 (CT714) woven fabrics were used to conduct the pull-out tests. CT716 and CT714 woven fabrics have low and high fabric densities, respectively. Data generated from the single and multiple yarn pull-out tests using various lengths of CT716 and CT714 woven fabrics included fabric stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force. Stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force depend on fabric density and the number of pulled ends in the fabric. Stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force in the multiple-yarn pull-out test were higher than those of the single-yarn pull-out test. Stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force in single- and multiple-yarn pull-out tests in the dense CT716 fabric were higher than those of the loose CT714 fabric. In addition, long fabric samples showed high stick–slip force compared with that of the short fabric samples.</p>

<p>Ballistic fabrics with higher pull-out force have been shown to perform favorably in impact tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512449052">1</xref></sup> Some studies have stated that to understand the mechanism of yarn pull-out it is necessary to understand the role of yarn pull-out friction in fabrics and engineering frictional properties to enhance their ballistic performance. Yarn pull-out was defined by Kirkwood et al. as one end of the yarn being pulled out from the fabric structure by the motion of the penetrator. They reported that the force required to pull the yarn from the fabric structure was the sum of the frictional forces between the yarn sets at all intersecting points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512449052">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512449052">3</xref></sup> The three distinct modes of fabric failure observed by Erlich et al. in slow penetration tests were yarn pull-out, local yarn rupture and remote yarn failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512449052">4</xref></sup> Ballistic performance depends upon friction and material properties such as elastic modulus and strength of the yarn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512449052">5</xref></sup> Another study revealed that very high inter-yarn friction could lead to premature yarn rupture during impact load and eventually reduce the energy absorbing ability of the fabric. In addition, the crimp in the woven fabric could be considered as another factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512449052">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512449052">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, the tribological behavior of woven fabric made from Kevlar® yarns of different linear densities was compared with the friction properties of their constituent yarns using different surface treatments. Both yarn texture and surface treatment were seen to have an influence on the friction coefficient. Linear density and woven structure had the largest impact on friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512449052">8</xref></sup> The softening treatment of fabric was shown to reduce inter-yarn adhesion and inter-yarn sliding friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512449052">9</xref></sup> Frictional processes within a fabric are important for both normal indentation and ballistic deformations as they control the effective stiffness of the material. It was found that fabrics with high friction and the lowest effective moduli dissipated larger amounts of energy relative to fabrics with lower friction. Relatively small changes in friction produced much greater changes in the deformational behavior of an assembly of cross-over contacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512449052">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Modeling studies have shown that friction contributed to delaying fabric failure and increasing impact load thus allowing the fabric to absorb more energy. Also, it was reported that fabric boundary condition was a factor that influenced friction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512449052">11</xref></sup> Projectile–fabric friction delayed yarn breakage by distributing the maximum stress along the periphery of the projectile–fabric contact zone. The delay of yarn breakage substantially increased the fabric's energy absorption during the later stages of impact. Yarn-to-yarn friction hindered the relative motion between yarns and thus resisted decrimping of fabric weave tightness. It induced the fabric to fail earlier during the impact process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512449052">12</xref></sup> The effect of yarn slippage at the cross-over point as well as within the clamp was modeled and yarn fracture during impact in single-ply woven fabric was determined using a kinetic energy relation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512449052">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A review of the factors that influence ballistic performance can be outlined as the material properties of the yarn, fabric structure and multiple plies, projectile geometry and velocity, friction between fabric and projectile and yarn-to-yarn in the fabric and far-field boundary conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512449052">14</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512449052">15</xref></sup> The fabric maximum pull-out forces in para-aramid fabric structures have been investigated with regards to their ballistic performance. It was found that stitched ballistic layered structures showed high pull-out force which eventually enhanced the ballistic resistance of structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512449052">16</xref></sup> The fabric displacement stage and crimp extension stage in single- and multiple-yarn-ends pull-out have been investigated. It was concluded that the fabric displacement stage could be utilized to determine fabric shear behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512449052">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512449052">18</xref></sup> and the crimp extension stage could be used to explain fabric failure under tensile loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512449052">19</xref></sup> The stick–slip phenomenon has been identified in nature and has been used to explain seismic movement, the flow of glaciers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512449052">20</xref></sup> and textile materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512449052">21</xref></sup> and even everyday life. The stick–slip phenomenon was considered during single- and multiple-yarn-ends pull-out in fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512449052">19</xref></sup> As seen in the literature, the friction in the stick–slip stage of pull-out in fabric structure was an important energy absorption mechanism for soft ballistics. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the behavior of the stick–slip stage of para-aramid single woven fabric under single- and multiple-yarn pull-outs.</p>

<p>The woven fabric was constructed with the para-aramid type of fibers (Twaron® of Teijin, Japan). The fiber and fabric properties are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512449052">Table 1</xref>. Two types of fabrics were used. These were Twaron CT® 716 (CT716) and Twaron CT® 714 (CT714). They were both plain weave and the warp and filling yarn linear densities were 110 tex. The warp and filling densities of the CT716 and CT714 fabrics were 12.2 and 8.5 ends/cm, respectively. The weights of the fabric unit areas were 280 and 190 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Water repellent treatment was also applied to both fabrics. Crimp measurement was performed using a Tautex digital instrument (James H. Heal Co., UK) according to ISO 7211-3. Fabric thickness measurement was performed using an R&amp;B cloth thickness tester (James H. Heal Co., UK) according to ISO 5084. Fabric weight measurement was performed based on ISO 6348. The fabric’s initial angle between warp and weft was measured by an optical microscope (Olympus SZ61-TR).

<sec id="sec3-0040517512449052"><title>Pull-out tests</title>
<p>Pull-out tests were conducted to determine the yarn-to-yarn friction on single or multiple yarn ends in the frayed edge of the plain fabric structure. For this reason, a pull-out fixture was developed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512449052">Figure 1</xref> shows the fixture and the pull-out test carried out in the testing instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512449052">18</xref></sup> Fabric from both edges was clamped. In this set-up, the fabric stick–slip stage was defined as ‘the end of one yarn set (either warp or weft) passes through from each of the consecutive intersecting points in the fabric during single or multiple yarn pull-out after the maximum pull-out force stage is completed’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512449052">Figure 2</xref> shows the schematic views of the fixture and pull-out test during the stick–slip stage. In addition, ‘the pulled yarn end in the fabric is released from the each yarn which is normal to the pulled yarn direction in where the response of the remaining part of the pulled yarn in the fabric is defined as the accumulative retraction force’. Fabric crimp interchange during the pull-out test was ignored. The residual tension on the fabric due to clamped fabric edges was also ignored. The yarn slippages and yarn flattening in warp and weft directions in the fabric interlacement regions were not considered for simplification purposes. It was also observed that some of the filaments in the pulled yarn structure were broken. These broken filaments were also ignored. The testing instrument used was the Instron 4411 and the testing speed was 100 mm/min.

<p>Fabric dimensions for performing the pull-out test were prepared as a fabric width of 360 mm for the total sample dimension, and 300 mm for the sample dimension in the fixture. Fabric lengths ranged from 50 to 350 mm at 50 mm increments. The pull-out direction was in the warp direction of the fabrics. The frayed yarn length of the sample was 150 mm and the total edge length holding the sample in the fixture edge was 60 mm. In the single-yarn pull-out test, only one yarn was pulled from the middle of the fabric sample. In the multiple-yarn pull-out test, 2 and 3 yarns were pulled from the middle of the each fabric sample. The Instron 4411 pull head draws individual yarn ends from the frayed edge of the single fabric.</p>

<p>Single- and multiple-yarn pull-out tests on CT716 and CT714 fabric samples were carried out. Single- and multiple-yarn pull-out force–displacement curves were obtained. In the yarn pull-out force–displacement curve, the stick–slip stages of the kinetic friction part, which was from the beginning of the maximum pull-out force to the end of the yarn pull-out test, in CT716 and CT714 fabrics were considered. The curve in the kinetic region has one maxima and one minima for each of the two crossing points where from maximum to minimum (one minima) is called stick–slip and from minimum to maximum (one maxima) is called the accumulative retraction force due to the fabric structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512449052">Figures 3(a) and (b)</xref> show the stick–slip stages of the single-yarn pull-out force–displacement curves for CT716 and CT714 fabrics, respectively. The 11 meso-cells of CT716 fabric were considered to investigate the stick–slip stage of the single-yarn pull-out force–displacement curve as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512449052">Figure 3(a)</xref> whereas the eight meso-cells of CT714 fabric were considered to investigate the stick–slip stage of the single yarn pull-out force–displacement curve as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512449052">Figure 3(b)</xref>. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512449052">Figures 4(a) and (b)</xref> show the stick–slip stages of the multiple yarn pull-out force–displacement curves for CT716 and CT714 fabrics, respectively. The 11 meso-cells of CT716 fabric were considered to investigate the stick–slip stage of the multiple yarn pull-out force–displacement curve as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512449052">Figure 4(a)</xref> whereas the eight meso-cells of CT714 fabric were considered to investigate the stick–slip stage of the multiple yarn pull-out force–displacement curve as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512449052">Figure 4(b)</xref>.

<p>Therefore, we considered only the first 11 meso-cells, where one meso-cell is composed of one stick and one slip region, for the CT716 fabric and the first 8 meso-cells for the CT714 fabric from single- and multiple-yarn pull-out force–displacement curves which were from the beginning of the maximum pull-out force to the corresponding number of meso-cells, respectively.</p>

<p>The initial crossing angle (θ) depends on the directional fabric density and directional crimp ratio. Under the pull-out force on warp yarn, fabric displacement and crimp extension stages occurred first.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512449052">17</xref></sup> This causes straightening of the pulled warp yarn and θ is decreased from its initial value. The measured average initial θ values for CT716 and CT714 fabrics were 10.37° and 4.41°, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512449052">Figure 7</xref> shows the measured initial crossing angles of CT716 and CT714 fabric structures.

<p>When we look at the meso-cells in the stick–slip stages of the single- and multiple-yarn pull-out force–displacement curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512449052">Figures 3</xref> and 4, there is an exponential function which has periodic decrease and increase lines. It is most likely that the decreasing line corresponds to each stick–slip region (<italic>S<sub>k</sub></italic>–<italic>S<sub>p</sub></italic>) whereas the increasing line corresponds to each accumulative retraction force by fabric structure (<italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512449052">Figure 8</xref>. After the maximum pull-out force stage was completed, the first decreasing line occurred due to the first yarn stick–slip region. When the first yarn (weft) was released from the fabric structure, the first increasing line occurred due to accumulative retraction force by the fabric structure coming from the remaining eight yarns in the end of the pulled yarn (warp) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512449052">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512449052">8</xref>. When the pull-out phenomena was repeated, the second decreasing line occurred due to the second yarn stick–slip region. Immediately afterwards, the second yarn was released from the fabric structure and the second increasing line occurred due to accumulative retraction force by the fabric structure coming from the remaining seven yarns in the end of the pulled yarn. This phenomenon was repeated until the ninth yarn was released from the pulled yarn.

<p>The stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force obtained from the single-yarn pull-out force–displacement curve of CT716 fabric for 11 meso-cells and CT714 fabric for 8 meso-cells are presented in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512449052">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512449052">3</xref>, respectively.

Fabric length considerably affected the stick–slip forces of the meso-cells of the CT716 and CT714 fabrics due to the number of crossing points.</p>

The warp directional single-yarn accumulative retraction forces in various fabric lengths of CT714 fabric varied from 1.481 to 0.709 N in MC-1 and from 1.611 to 0.333 N in MC-8.

However, the warp directional single-yarn accumulative retraction forces in MC-1 of CT716 and CT714 fabrics were higher than those in the MC-11 of the CT716 and MC-8 of CT714 fabrics due to the remaining crossing points in the fabric during pull-out.

<p>Single- and multiple-yarn pull-out tests were conducted in order to understand the stick–slip stage properties of high- and low-density para-aramid fabrics in soft ballistic applications. Data were generated from single- and multiple-yarn-ends pull-out tests for high-density CT716 and low-density CT714 para-aramid fabrics.</p>
<p>It was found that the decreasing line in the force–displacement curve corresponds to each stick–slip region (<italic>S<sub>k</sub></italic> − <italic>S<sub>p</sub></italic>) whereas the increasing line in the force–displacement curve corresponds to each accumulative retraction force by fabric structure (<italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic>). The warp directional single- and multiple-yarn stick–slip and accumulative retraction forces in the MC-1 of dense and loose fabrics were generally higher than those in the MC-11 of dense and the MC-8 of loose fabrics. The MC-1 was found to be the most critical cell due to the starting point of the yarn pulling region and it was related to fabric boundary. The amount of stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force in multiple-yarn pull-out were extremely nonlinear compared with those of the single-yarn pull-out. On the other hand, the amount of stick–slip force was related to the number of interlacement points in the fabric whereas the amount of accumulative retraction force was related to fabric structural response. These were probably significant results for the energy absorption of soft ballistic structures.</p>
<p>Stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force depended on fabric density and the number of pull-out yarn ends. In general, the stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force of high- and low-density fabrics obtained from the multiple-yarn pull-out test were higher than those of the single-yarn pull-out test. On the other hand, the stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force of dense fabrics were higher than those of loose fabrics. It was also found that the stick–slip force and accumulative retraction force of long fabrics were higher than those of short fabrics.</p>
<p>Future research should be conducted to find the analytical relation among stick–slip force, accumulative retraction force and yarn–fabric structural parameters for various fabric weaves. This could result in a multiaxially interlaced fabric with improved frictional properties which could be used in soft ballistic applications.</p>
