<p>This book, part of the Understanding Public Health series from Open University Press, is the second edition of the book, first published in 2005. It is a ‘teach yourself public health’ manual, well laid out, with each chapter starting with its learning objectives and definitions of key terms used within the chapter. Information is regularly punctuated by learning activities, followed immediately by feedback on the activity. Finally, each chapter concludes with both a reference list, and a further reading list.</p>
<p>The book is in two main parts. The first part, ’Foundation of Modern Public Health’, teaches the reader the skills both quantitative (e.g. how to calculate life expectancy) and more qualitative (e.g. collection and appraisal of evidence for Health impact assessment) required of a public health practitioner. The second section,’Major Determinants of Health’, demonstrates the practical application of these skills on traditional (e.g. infectious diseases) and contemporary (e.g. human rights, genetics, climate change) determinants of health.</p>
<p>This is an efficient book; running to less than 300 pages, it nevertheless encompasses the key skills and issues relevant to public health in both developed and developing countries. It is never possible for an experienced professional to view a book like this through the eyes of a learner, but it appears to be a useful book both for both the self directed learner, and as an accompaniment to a taught course. My only irritation with the book’s layout is that the ‘feedback’ immediately follows each activity, often on the same page, making it all too easy for the reader to ‘short cut’ the activity and read the feedback immediately. That quibble aside, this is a book I would recommend to those interested in understanding public health methods and practice.</p>
