<title>Aims:</title>
<p>Precarious type of employment may have a negative impact on health, notably on low psychological wellbeing. The basis of the former relationship is constructed by definition and operationalisation of precariousness. In this research, we first experimented with a construct of work history in the operationalisation of precariousness and second studied the relationship between precariousness and health.</p>

<p>The research data originated from a large population-based birth cohort (NFBC 1966). The study sample consists of 3449 respondents to the postal questionnaire at the age of 31 and the information supplemented by the register data of the Finnish Centre for Pensions.

<p>Our operationalisation with a construct of discontinuous work history captured the precarious insecure relation to work.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the past 30 years or so, the almost globally spread neoliberal economic policy, which emphasises the centrality of markets and market-driven solutions, privatisation of government resources, and removal of government protections, has generated precarious, unpredictable work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>]. Precarious relation to work is not a new phenomenon, but it has grown rapidly since the late 1970s. Demand of more competitiveness and productiveness of new economy calls for responsiveness on the part of labour markets to economic change and bind workers to quantitative flexibility. For individual employees, the use of flexibility comes at the expense of security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Precarious work is related to greater economic insecurity and inequality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>]. Low income, lack of benefits, no job security, lack of control over the labour process (e.g. no collective representation), and lack of regulatory protection are factors related to nature of precarious work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812450092">2</xref>]. Precariousness has consequences for individuals (e.g. loss of status, less autonomy, less resource, stress), social relationships (e.g. family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812450092">3</xref>], community), and social stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812450092">4</xref>]. When unemployment includes a risk of downward social mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812450092">5</xref>], people accept low-income jobs for minimising the risks of unemployment as a strategy of reducing uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812450092">6</xref>]. It has been shown that temporary employment generates job insecurity [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812450092">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Precarious employment is increasingly attached to the concept of labour market insecurity (LMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812450092">8</xref>]. LMI is intimately related to the concept of job insecurity that has two basic dimensions: perceived severity of threat and powerlessness to resist threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812450092">9</xref>]. However, the question in labour market insecurity is about the concern of the continuity of employment rather than about the continuity of the current job. Precarious insecurity (LMI) involves the subjective threat of unemployment, powerlessness in the face of it, and concern for re-employability.</p>
<p>The mediation of job insecurity on individuals’ health or stress is documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812450092">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812450092"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812450092"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812450092"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812450092">14</xref>]. The harmful influence of accumulating unemployment to an individual’s health has also been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812450092">5</xref>]. Several studies have illustrated the association between precarious type of employment and low psychological wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812450092">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812450092"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812450092"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812450092">18</xref>]. In Finland, women in fixed-term employment (which lasts for a specified length of time) were found to be suffering more often from increased psychological distress compared to those in permanent employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812450092">17</xref>]. No such difference has been found in physical health, but fixed-term and contingent employees reported better self-rated health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812450092">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812450092">19</xref>]. It has also been shown that contingent employees have higher threshold of taking sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812450092">19</xref>]. However, international research has reported somewhat inconsistent and inconclusive findings related to health and psychological impact of precarious types of work [for a review of studies, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812450092">21</xref>]. A major problem concerns the inconsistent vocabulary and definitions of precarious type of work, originating from the heterogeneity of precarious workforce (fixed-term, part-time, temporary, irregular, atypical, intermittent, contingent, casual jobs, non-standard working). Results are also distorted by, for example, different health outcomes, methodological limitations pertaining to selection of health and social bias, and confounding factors in regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812450092">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812450092">21</xref>]. Moreover, differences in national legislation and labour market conditions contribute towards research designs and an understanding of the impact of precarious type of work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In most European studies, precarious type of work appears in the divisions of temporary, fixed-term, or non-permanent employment, while contingent and non-standard employment are more used in US and Canadian research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812450092">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref>]. Moreover, defining precarious type of work (operationalisation) varies between the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812450092">21</xref>]. For example, in Finnish research, temporary workers have been defined by the type of contract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812450092">20</xref>]. However, the researchers reported problems in defining the degrees of security among temporary type of workers as it lacks information on contract renewals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812450092">17</xref>]. For example, workers may feel relatively secure under the conditions of consecutive and long-term contract renewals.</p>
<p>In this research, we try to get grip on long-term precarious work utilising data on work history and to study its relationship with health. First, we experimented with a construct of work history in the operationalisation of precariousness, and then we evaluated our operationalisation with several characteristics. Second, we aimed to explore the association of health with precariousness by comparing groups of precarious and permanent workers. We hypothesised that people under the conditions of precariousness tend to be at the risk of mental distress. Our study was based on data, which originated from a large population-based birth cohort.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The research material is based on the prospectively collected data of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966) research programme with 12,058 cohort members who were born in northern Finland in 1966. The epidemiological and longitudinal database of NFBC 1966 is comprised of postal questionnaires, clinical examinations, various hospital records, and national register data, including comprehensive information on factors such as health, wellbeing, and work. A detailed description of the NFBC 1966 has been presented in the studies of Rantakallio [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812450092">22</xref>]. The study population consists of 8449 respondents to the postal questionnaire at the age of 31 (response rate 79%). The information has also been supplemented by register data of the Finnish Centre for Pensions. The ethical committee of Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District has approved the study and written informed consents were obtained from the cohort members in the 31-year follow up.</p>
<sec id="section7-1403494812450092">
<title>Operationalisation of precariousness</title>
<p>We define precariousness as an insecure relation to work, with many contracts or work arrangements. The construct of precariousness has a historical dimension. A short precarious work arrangement or single contractual commitment does not make one precarious. We consider discontinuous work history to be a key element of precariousness. The scope of work history reveals the history of precariousness: acts of employment and unemployment. It also brings together the experiences of insecure work, manifested as many discontinuous contracts or work arrangements. The degree of insecure work varies (e.g. when the position of an employee with precarious work history becomes a permanent position). In order to capture effective precariousness, work history must be completed with knowledge of current contractual type. The two elements of precariousness – work history and current contractual type – have been addressed in the operationalisation.</p>
<p>In the database of this study, work history was completed with seven descriptive items, from “continuous work history” to “never paid working”. We classified work history into three categories: (I) continuous work history (working throughout the work history, continuously at work); (II) discontinuous work history (mostly at work, less unemployment); (III) unstable work history (mainly unemployment, occasionally at work). A corresponding division of work history has been presented in earlier studies of NFBC 1966 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812450092">23</xref>]. Current (work) situation was assessed as belonging into one of 12 categories: 1, permanent full-time job; (2) fixed-term full-time job; (3) part-time job; (4) self-employee; (5) entrepreneur; (6) student; (7) unemployed; (8) under employable; (9) temporary dismissal; (10) parental leave; (11) retired; (12) other reasons for being outside the workforce. For the use of operationalisation, the first three categories related directly to contractual employment situations.</p>
<p>We operationalised precarious workers by (II) discontinuous work history and (2) fixed-term or (3) part-time job. Permanent workers were operationalised by (I) continuous work history and (1) permanent full-time job. Possible precarious workers in other categories were excluded due to lacking information on contractual employment (e.g. in the case of parental leave). (4) Self-employed and (5) entrepreneurs were also left out, with no details of independent contracting. The population with (III) unstable work history (mainly outside the workforce) was excluded from the study sample. The detailed information on the study population is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812450092">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Characteristics</title>
<p>The study groups were compared for the characteristics of perceived job insecurity, socioeconomic group, education, household income, marital status, and number of children. Socioeconomic group was derived from the question “What is your current occupational title?” The classes determined were based on the Classification of Socioeconomic Groups 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812450092">24</xref>]. Education was assessed with two questions on basic and occupational education in the questionnaire. The levels of education were categorised based on the International Classification of Levels of Education (ISCED) 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812450092">25</xref>]. For the sake of comparability, the levels of education were classified into four levels: basic (≤9 years); secondary (10–12 years, vocational); lower tertiary (≥13 years, polytechnic); and upper tertiary (academic). Marital status was divided into four categories (married, cohabiting, single, and divorced or widowed). Household income was derived from the open-ended question on gross annual salary and it classified into three categories based on the median annual gross income (poverty limit=50% of median, while well-off equalled 150% of median, in proportion to consumption units) in 1996 in Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812450092">26</xref>]. The categories used were: (1) low income; (2) average income; and (3) high income. The information on job insecurity was derived from the questionnaire under clinical examination of subpopulation at 31 years (<italic>n</italic>=5737, 68% of invited cohort members). The field survey population (<italic>n</italic>=2235) consisted of 1514 permanent workers (46% women) and 721 precarious workers (59% women). Perceived job insecurity was assessed with the question “How certain is the permanence of your current job?” with a scale of highly certain (1) to highly uncertain (4).</p>
<p>The study groups were also compared with the register data of their annual working days (from 1989 to 1999). The information was derived from the register data of the Finnish Centre for Pensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494812450092">
<title>Health outcomes</title>
<p>Health was measured by two outcomes: HSCL-25 for mental symptoms and doctor-diagnosed/treated illnesses. Both outcomes were included in the postal questionnaire. The Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), a 25-item shortened version of an originally 90-item questionnaire, is a commonly used screening method for mental symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812450092">27</xref>]. The measure includes the most common symptoms of anxiety (10 items) and depression (15 items). Self-reports were set in Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) and the scale of symptoms was calculated as a sum score ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. Several cut-off points have been used in defining sensitivity and specificity of psychiatric caseness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812450092">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812450092">28</xref>]. In this study, we used the lowest threshold (≥1.55). Doctor-diagnosed or treated illnesses were set with a list of 33 diseases or injuries (encompassing, for example, cardiovascular diseases, intestinal, articular, and mental disorders) completed with an alternative of other disease or injury. The respondents answered alternatively (yes or no). In physical illnesses, the amount of diseases or injuries was calculated as sum score, whereas mental disorders were calculated for whether the respondent had none or more than one disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812450092">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were carried out separately for men and women. The health outcomes of doctor-diagnosed/treated illnesses were examined as continuous variables and compared using t-tests and categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> test.</p>
<p>Binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the association between precarious and permanent workers in the mental symptoms of HSCL and were adjusted with potential confounding factors. In men, the following potential confounding variables were used in logistic regression analyses: perceived job insecurity, socioeconomic status, education, and marital status; and in women, perceived job insecurity and household income, since they were associated with precariousness and mental symptoms. The logistic regression models are reported using crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (v. 17) for Windows. All significance tests were two-tailed and values of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>After case operationalisation, the study sample consisted of 1082 precarious workers (60% women) and 2357 permanent workers (44% women) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812450092">Figure 1</xref>). Comparison between the study groups and the register data of annual working days shows that compared to permanent workers, precarious workers have fewer annual working days in their working history, but they have mostly been at work (over 270 days), with the exception of the excluded population of mainly unemployed (III). In addition, examination of work histories within the past 10 years shows how the proportion of precarious employment relationships declines during the depression in 1993–1994 and takes off again with the economic boom in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812450092">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Precarious workers were characterised by the perception of high job insecurity in both men (56 vs. 4%) and women (62 vs. 5%) compared to permanent workers. They also had lower household income compared to permanent workers. The proportion of low income was higher among precarious men (18 vs. 6%) and women (14 vs. 4%). Moreover, precarious men were at a disadvantage regarding every characteristic compared to permanently employed men, showing a difference in low education, low socioeconomic status, being less frequently married, and having fewer children. There were no corresponding differences among women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812450092">Table I</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study experimented with the construct of work history in the operationalisation of precariousness with good results. The composition of discontinuous work history and contractual type captures precarious relation to work. When the study groups were compared, the precarious workers were found to be at a disadvantage. High perceived job insecurity and lower income level were the most dominant characteristics of precarious workers. Moreover, precariousness was typical among women (60%), which is compatible with earlier research [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812450092">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812450092">8</xref>]. The operationalisation was also supported by a correspondence between the study groups and the register data of annual working days. A similarity was also found between the impacts of economic trends and the relationships of precarious employment. We consider that precarious workers share first and foremost a common experience of a discontinuous work history, not an experience of a single precarious contract or short work arrangement. Our focus is on the accumulating effect of precarious work. The use of work history enables one to distinguish between fixed-term persons with suspended contracts and discontinuous work history (insecure work) from those with consecutive contracts and continuous work history (secure work). In the case of part-time workers, the use of work history reveals the degree of insecurity of persons with fixed-term contract and discontinuous work history as opposed to persons in part-time work with a permanent contract and continuous work history.</p>
<p>There was no difference in doctor-diagnosed/treated illnesses between precarious and permanent workers, but there were proportionally more mental symptoms among precarious workers, in particular when workers perceived high job insecurity. The results provide light support for the association of precariousness and psychological distress. We could, however, not substantiate the independent association of precariousness and mental symptoms in our logistic analyses. This was mainly because the socioeconomic characteristics that we used as confounding factors are directly related to the substance of the precariousness, such as low incomes and perceived high job insecurity. We also agree with previous studies that independent effect of precariousness is difficult to substantiate when workers in different arrangements have different socioeconomic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812450092">14</xref>]. In the end, we formed a construct of precarious distress by supplementing our findings with some highlights of earlier research, as discussed below.</p>
<p>In view of the perceived high job insecurity and mental symptoms among precarious workers, these reactions could be construed as the senses of powerlessness to resist the threat of job loss, as researchers of job insecurity have been perceived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812450092">9</xref>]. Behind the experience of powerlessness, they formed, for example, a lack of protection (the unions, the form of employment contract). Similarly, Maslow formulated a baseline for job insecurity with his expression of the human safety need and reference to a job with tenure and protection”. Sennett catches precarious indisposition intertwining personal anxiety with the global and febrile “new capitalism” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812450092">4</xref>]. He argues that apprehension about the future is a consequence of unstable and episodic labour in the New Capitalism. He describes how the short-term spirit of new capitalism disorientates people and corrodes their trust, loyalty, and mutual commitment. Eventually, this leads to a corrosion of one’s identity and personality causing lack of self-worth and anomie. Sennett also pointed out that the uncertainty of the new economy produces common fear of how easily people could lose control over their lives and that “fear is built into their work histories” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812450092">4</xref>, p19] Precarious uncertainty or rather insecurity is likely to intensify along the accumulating effect of precariousness.</p>
<sec id="section13-1403494812450092">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Results regarding precariousness, perceived job insecurity, and mental symptoms were originated from the data with lower population size compared with the original study sample. Taking into account the differentiation in association of precariousness and mental symptoms (OR 1.8) in the original study sample compared to the smaller sample (OR 1.6), we found that many of those precarious workers who had the highest levels of mental symptoms were not included in the field survey (<italic>n</italic>=2235). Our use of the lower threshold of HSCL-25, results in a higher sensitivity and more false-positives, but it was considered appropriate to our purpose of screening all mental symptoms regardless of the probability of mental disorders, as has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812450092">28</xref>]. In the end, we were here not able to assess labour market insecurity but perceived job insecurity conceptually. Nevertheless, we consider that precarious insecurity (continuity of employment) was captured in this study. However, we agree with the earlier suggestions of differentiating conceptually the job insecurity of permanent workers from that of precarious workers [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812450092">30</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The study suggests that the construct of work history is a useful element in defining precariousness. The study also proposes to view precariousness as a new division in the working life constructed with different socioeconomic characteristics, and when the confounding factors of socioeconomic characteristics may not be appropriate to use in the analysis of precarious type of work. Regarding the perception of high job insecurity embodied in precarious distress, the study suggests further research of the stressful experience of precariousness. Improving precarious standing depends on national regulations, institutional settings, and legislation.</p>
