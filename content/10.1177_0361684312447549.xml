      <p>We all smile—and if not all the time—we do so often. And there are many types of smiles suitable for different social contexts: the happy smile, the embarrassed smile, the anxious smile, and more. This is the starting observation of Marianne LaFrance’s book, <italic>Lip Service—</italic>a book about smiles (and other facial expressions). LaFrance describes smiles as social acts with consequences and sets out to illuminate these consequences for different domains. She clearly aims to give a full account of the literature on this topic and that is a surprisingly tall order.</p>
      <p>In the first section of the book, LaFrance highlights differences in appearance between different types of smiles by focusing on the aspects that make smiles appear genuine. The function of the smile—to elicit positive feelings in others and to foster bonding and trust—are discussed, as well as the social display rules that demand smiling—or not smiling, depending on social context. In this section, she also discusses research on various pathologies leading to reduced or absent smiling. LaFrance engagingly attempts to present a very thorough review of the relevant research. Yet, at times, the guiding line of argument is lost in the sheer abundance of findings. For example, the section on facial feedback seems out of place until the very end of the following discussion which is focused on the effects of Botox treatments on experienced affect.</p>
      <p>The second section of the book, entitled “Lies,” focuses on both the perceiver and the expresser, noting that how a smile will be perceived depends as much on the motivations of the receiver as on the type of smile shown. In this section, the discussion of smile politics is an especially interesting contribution and nicely extends the better known issue of pressure to smile at the workplace.</p>
      <p>The third section, “Loyalty,” starts out with discussions of gender and cultural differences. The discussion on gender differences cites biological and social influences in an insightful presentation, although discussions of smiling at the job hark back to the previous section. The chapter on smiling for the camera also reflects back on the politics of smiles. In fact, I found the logic that assigned these contents to this section (rather than the preceding one) elusive. Each chapter in this section is well presented, but they do not unite well and overall the section headings seem forced.</p>
      <p>In the course of the book, LaFrance makes a central distinction between genuine and voluntary smiles and outlines the many social consequences that may occur in the light of this difference. Yet, the choice of wording unfortunately assumes motivations based on the appearance of the smile, that is, whether activity of the orbicularis oculi is present, making it a Duchenne, or genuine, smile—or not, or making it a voluntary smile. This dichotomy makes the non-Duchenne smile necessarily appear as less than genuine, as manipulative, or at least as strategic. This view does not do justice to the literature that shows that Duchenne smiles are used purely as social signals or that non-Duchenne smiles can express genuine feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312447549">Niedenthal, Mermillod, Maringer, &amp; Hess, 2010</xref>). Allusions to the latter can be found, for example, in the discussion of politeness, but overall the more simplistic view that Duchenne smiles express happiness, and other smiles do not, dominates. This simplistic view does not do justice to the overall very successful attempt to highlight the complexity of smiling. Overall, I enjoyed this book, engagingly written for a lay audience, but with enough detail to provide insight into the underlying data, often pleasantly summarized by references to film and fiction.</p>
