<abstract>
<p>This article explores the gap between eucharistic narratives, common eucharistic practices and the racially segregated realities of mainline Christianity. Using the wisdom of trauma theory to excavate the dismembered Body of Christ that gathers for Communion in most American churches, the authors seek to re-member Eucharist with new embodied “postures and gestures” of transformation and redemption. Close attention to both the destructive force of the “colorblind” narrative that many churches adopt and the need to embrace a more honest narrative about whiteness inform the character of these transformative postures and gestures.</p>

<body>
<p>Our stories tell us who we are, at least that is what Christianity tells us. Our salvation story, the stories of Scripture, and testimonies of faith define us and inform our religious identities. But what about when our stories are incomplete? Or worse yet, what about when our stories about ourselves are lies? What about when stories dis-member or contort part of the Body of Christ by asking them to be silent or to deny their truth? Can we abide together in Christian community with stories that are both untellable and must be told?</p>
<p>The Communion Table is set for us as a place where we come to be welcomed and reconciled to God. Scripture tells us the story that in God’s kingdom people from all nations, all tongues will come to sit at the throne of God, singing praises (Rev 7:9). Jesus called himself the bread of life (John 6:48) and the true vine (John 15:1). Scripture tells us about Christ’s last supper with his friends in an upstairs room. There he called the bread they ate his body, he told them the wine was the new covenant sealed in his blood, and he told them to eat it and drink it all (Luke 22). And Scripture tells us this is a meal that, whenever celebrated, is to be done in remembrance of him (1 Cor 11:23–26).</p>
<p>Our institutional memory sifts through these stories to further interpret what happens at Eucharist and how it is achieved. John Calvin articulated the Reformed formula that the mystery and power of the Holy Spirit assures us of the real presence of Christ in our Communion meal, “as if Christ were placed in bodily presence before our view, or handled by our hands.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484750">1</xref></sup> Calvin describes how we are nourished at Table with words like “refresh, strengthen, and exhilarate.” Calvin basked in the mysterious efficacy of the Eucharist, by the power of the Holy Spirit, to “truly unite things separated by space.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573613484750">2</xref></sup> Somehow Christ dwells in us; somehow we, gathered communities of disparate believers, are transformed into his Body in the world.</p>
<p>Our eucharistic habits have created the expectation that we have a shared story and that we embody this shared story in our eucharistic practice. Yet when real bodies gather at the Table there is a thoroughgoing dissonance that signals rupture and betrayal as well as particularity and possibility. Estranged relationships are allowed to splinter—and instead of all nations and tongues at the Table, we look around and see people just like us. And we quietly partake of this feast we’re told reflects God’s hopes for us while trivialized souls are left thirsty and hungry. We nibble at the bread of life and sip the cup of salvation. We keep our eyes down wondering if we should taste more. With the echoes of an invitation to come and encounter the Body of Christ lingering in the air, we sit and wait for another day’s sensation.</p>
<p>There will always be gaps between Jesus’ story and our lives; the human condition is tangled up with such dissonance by our very nature. Confession narrates these fragmented and distorted layers of who we are. It is not a “correct” eucharistic practice that makes the Lord’s Supper a transformative practice, but God’s effusive love embodied in Christ’s startling presence among us. For most Christians the failure to duplicate Jesus’ healing meals with outsiders is not intentional. Churches understand themselves to be welcoming communities. “Inclusiveness” is a frequent descriptor in many church mission statements. Indeed, churches have so “moved on” from one of our nation’s most egregious forms of exclusion, the historic sin of racial segregation, that like most (white) Americans, predominantly white churches claim to be “colorblind.” That is, such churches intend to see all persons, regardless of color, as God’s children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573613484750">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A dominant contemporary (white) narrative, then, is of church as a welcoming, colorblind community that gathers at the Table regularly, to be reconciled with God as members somehow encounter the body and blood of Christ. But is that story his/story? Many theologians describe the sacraments of Eucharist and baptism as “the essential rituals of our politics.” The Eucharist is often equated with the social witness of the church: “liturgy <italic>is</italic> social action.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573613484750">4</xref></sup> “It is <italic>in worship itself</italic> that the ethical in-forming of human acting and judging comes about.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573613484750">5</xref></sup> If this is so, what kind of “social action” is being narrated and performed by this purportedly welcoming colorblind table fellowship? Despite the well-meaning discourse, this is a narrative and practice that bears more scrutiny, especially if we take Calvin seriously that communion is “as if Christ were placed in bodily presence before our view, or handled by our hands.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573613484750">6</xref></sup> If Christ’s presence has to do with bodies—his, and ours as the “Body of Christ,” then the bodies at the Table matter.</p>
<p>To understand the function of Eucharist in both reproducing and potentially aiding in the transformation of brokenness requires something besides an appeal to the traditional visions of the past, whether Luther’s, Calvin’s, the early church’s, or that of medieval liturgy. We need attention to the connections between embodied practice and theological imagination. Liturgical scholar Scott Haldeman argues that liturgical theology typically has two tendencies: to be critical of a contemporary practice and to be nostalgic as a way to address the problem. Even the standard ordo desired by many forms of liturgical scholarship, he argues, is not adequate to “fix” contemporary liturgical problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573613484750">7</xref></sup> Liturgical scholar Siobhan Garrigan would agree, arguing for attention to the face-to-face social relations of sacraments, saying that what people “actually do with their bodies sometimes betrays what they do with their thoughts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573613484750">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>To identify and better address the “colorblindness” associated with much liturgical bodily practice, it is important to identify the nature of the problem as defined by bodies, social memory, and the ways that racialized injustices continue to impact our lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573613484750">9</xref></sup> These patterns and practices embody the marks of traumatic memory in the unruly ways racialized violence (both systemic and chronic) reiterates itself in trivialized practices and mentalities. In this project we invite a re-membering of Eucharist by both interrogating colorblindness and making space for acknowledging the traumatic imprint of race in our believing communities. These focal points allow us to point toward transformative capacity in both the stories we can tell and the stories that are impossible to tell.</p>
<p>Trauma literally means a wound. The Greek term refers to a wound of the body. Its contemporary use expands trauma to refer to “collective suffering,” a suffering given further nuance relative to different theorizations of trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573613484750">10</xref></sup> Freudian theories around trauma shifted the focus on trauma’s wounds toward the mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573613484750">11</xref></sup> Many contemporary trauma theories are informed both by Freud’s understanding that the mind is not able to take in the immediate force of trauma and developing understanding of how bodies hold trauma. Trauma is, therefore, not fully integrated into consciousness but “imposes itself again, repeatedly” in nightmares and repetitive actions. Trauma is characterized by this simultaneity of deeply embodied impact and unassimilated experience. Cathy Caruth describes the dynamic of trauma as “complex ways of knowing and not knowing.” The wounds of trauma “cry out” in the attempt to tell us of a reality or truth that is not otherwise available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573613484750">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The continued reality of trauma is, of course, not reducible to the unconscious; the dynamic of trauma extends onto the larger template of history itself. History “bears the marks of trauma” in its endless repetition of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573613484750">13</xref></sup> Such endurance also requires the emergence of ongoing cultural representation and structural support. Indeed, the actual public awareness of a group’s social suffering depends upon the successful distribution of these cultural representations and systems of support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573613484750">14</xref></sup> Given the complexities of trauma the history of race in American religious communities unfolds and conceals itself in ways we cannot fully describe or control.</p>
<p>Tangled into this snarl of dissonance, trivialization, estrangement, rhetoric, and possibility are tenacious threads of white denial and obliviousness. Race is often cast as an issue that only surfaces when people of color bring it up, otherwise everything is “fine.” And many whites tend to navigate the world with the “I’m not a racist” mantra, all the while embodying unconscious racialized assumptions and biases that help form everything from neighborhoods to public and private policies to intimate relationships. Privilege becomes obscured and affirmed with still more stories of the whence and the why of who we are and where we’ve been. Troubled, trivialized, and tormented memories conspire to render all the more tenacious the mentalities and blind spots of institutions like the church.</p>
<p>Even as many whites and the institutions they have tended to control engage in storytelling and work that is aimed at liberation, the realities of the layers and layers of harm that tell the embodied stories of racialized harm may be used to blame and judge those who have been most deeply harmed. These signs of ravaged generations become ways to justify continued cultural estrangement and even white mystification around the whence of so many of our society’s social challenges. This white denial is both stealth and tenacious and bears itself out in a staggering amount of data about how whites tend to understand the status of equity and fairness in this country. Most whites have assumed (even during the Civil Rights Movement) and continue to assume that the systems in this country are accessible and fair to people of all races.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573613484750">15</xref></sup> Even whites who may have a more critical awareness of things like higher conviction rates for people of color in our judicial system, higher rates of people of color in poverty, and the “achievement gap” data, often have trouble understanding how to connect these dynamics to racism, and in particular to white privilege. All the while, racism continues to erode and diminish communities, relationships, and possibilities. The effects of racism permeate everything from the rates of disease and infant mortality (even when data takes into account economic and education levels), to wealth, to financing and housing patterns, to the different ways and rates at which children who are white and children of color are disciplined in schools, to the patterns of incarceration, even to the ways we worship and embody faith practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573613484750">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wounds of racism are and have been experienced quite consciously as trauma by people of color even as racism continues to have profound unconscious and embodied effects. Alexander’s assertion about the necessary function of cultural representation and structures to foreground and define the trauma has notable relevance here, especially as the public representation of this collective suffering has changed over the years (from explicit denial in white narratives justifying slavery to framing of racial trauma via civil rights discourse, to the more recent narrative of colorblindness). The “not-knowing” that attends trauma takes hold in unique and particular ways, and is, therefore, also profoundly shaped by cultural context. Some social groups may have, for example, repressed certain experiences of violence, and some, as Jeffrey Alexander points out, “can and often do, refuse to recognize the existence of others’ trauma, or place the responsibility for it on people other than themselves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573613484750">17</xref></sup> Their bodily habituations toward that “other” social group can sometimes display this pre-conscious avoidance in contrast to the bodily survival tactics of marginalized groups. And these traumatic and re-traumatizing patterns can crisscross through cultures because of their shared legacy in things like violence (in particular the effects of things like sexual violence, war, and domestic violence).</p>
<p>The colorblind narrative around the Lord’s Table is an example of this social “not-knowing” that continues to mask the ongoing effect of the wounds of racism. Traumatic repetition and return play out in relationships ruptured by a violent past that visit and revisit themselves upon us without our bidding, even against our will. The full force of these wounds comes not in a story long past, but in a present captive to habits, patterns, and denial of the traumatic truth itself.</p>
<p>This project does not seek “perfected” eucharistic practice in order to secure a particular transformative outcome. For us, Eucharist is a template through which we can see ourselves and the marks of racialized trauma more clearly. And Eucharist is also a mechanism that creates space for new reenactments that could integrate traumatic repetition and embodied practices with life-giving possibilities. Eucharist tells us who we are even as it calls us to who God hopes we can be. It is the dissonance between the stories we tell around the Table and the practices we embody at that same Table that create the conditions of possibility for a new healing awareness of what have been our unconscious distortions. The wound of race surfaces and calls out for acknowledgement and transformation.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573613484750"><title>Dominant Narrative: Welcoming, Colorblind Society</title>
<p>A popular narrative of many Americans is the view that we have resolved the injustices of racism. We are a “colorblind” society. “I don’t see color, I just see people,” the saying goes. This popular narrative of colorblindness, however, has not effected much change in the social, material, and embodied realities of race relations in the U.S. Income, education, and access to privilege are still significantly differentiated by race. As many sociologists insist, this white habit of colorblindness tends to assume that racism is an individual, intentional act; racism has thus been addressed because most of us are “well meaning,” not members of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>When it comes to residual, structural racism, however, this colorblind narrative about the country, while well intentioned, is basically a fiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573613484750">18</xref></sup> Because this story and the habits that accompany it assume that anti-segregation and other equal rights legislation fixed our problems around racism, this “analysis” allows most whites to ignore the structural/institutional complexities of racism that still exist. It also suggests that we do not have moral categories for that level and complexity of agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573613484750">19</xref></sup> Not the only one to use this phrase, sociologist Bonilla-Silva describes most white narratives about race relations as illustrative of “color-blind racism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573613484750">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>An indication of the deeply embedded power of such a narrative is that colorblindness is not simply an intellectual conviction or belief. If it did have causal force, the inclusive and implicitly welcoming tenor of colorblindness would seem to play out in a significant increase in white “interaction with minorities in general and blacks in particular,” says Bonilla-Silva. However, his study of white patterns of interracial interactions has yielded a very different result. Instead of a welcoming set of interracial lived practices, Bonilla-Silva found a prominent “white habitus,” characterized by “a set of primary networks and associations with other whites that reinforces the racial order by fostering racial solidarity among whites and negative affect toward racial ‘others.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573613484750">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Well-meaning mantras do not necessarily correlate with altered social relations. Tim Wise explores the effects of these colorblind mentalities and habits on contemporary American political culture. He points to the myth of racial transcendence (buoyed by things like President Obama’s election) that snuff out public discourse about the lasting effects of racism in favor of more palatable and “post-racial” rhetoric around poverty that applies to and benefits everyone, not just people of color.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573613484750">22</xref></sup> This “post-racial” rhetoric retains an ethic of social action even as it denies the deep and lasting effects of racism’s wounds.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the social effect of Eucharist. It would appear, then, that white eucharistic habits may well perform this American narrative. Colorblind welcome, as we know, is a typical church story, too<italic>.</italic> While our sacramental gatherings as the Body of Christ are framed with Jesus’ story and other biblical narratives, in mainline denominational churches the other bodies at the Table are overwhelmingly white. The percentage of significantly interracial churches—communities in which no more than 80 percent of the membership identifies as the same race—is amazingly low: only 7 percent of American congregations qualify.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573613484750">23</xref></sup> Liturgical scholar Scott Haldeman says that “In regard to the race issue in the US, Christian worship has served most often to divide and oppress rather than to unite and liberate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573613484750">24</xref></sup> At best the invoking of welcome and inclusion in the Body of Christ in far too many churches would appear to be simply a rhetorical gesture towards differently racialized “others” by those with the privilege (and illusion) of not having “race,” for example of being white.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573613484750">25</xref></sup> Narrating this Table as a place where all of God’s people from all nations, all tongues come to sing God’s praises dis-members a past that has yet to be adequately re-membered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573613484750"><title>Eucharistic Re-membering and Traumatic Memory</title>
<p>What bodies actually gather around the Table coupled with the sacramental rhetoric of reconciliation and redemption reveals a dis-membered Body of Christ that we struggle to acknowledge. Like a phantom limb that leaves residues of sensation, we can inhabit a space of denial around the Table even when there are those who are so clearly missing. We gather as a contorted, truncated, dis-membered Body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573613484750">26</xref></sup> What separates us is a quiet violence tenaciously continuing to rupture those who God hopes can be together.</p>
<p>Dirk Lange connects Eucharist to traumatic memory through the event that we remember and ritualize in the sacrament, the Christ event. For Lange it is not the previous violence of crucifixion itself that is repeated around the Table, but the inaccessibility of the event. “The Christ event returns as a force that continually disrupts our usual forms of remembering and ritualizing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573613484750">27</xref></sup> Lange describes the repetition enacted in the Eucharist as “iteration” which is “continually failed remembering.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573613484750">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Knit through this impossible memory of Christ’s presence are all the strands of violence that we inherit and enact in our communal re-membering. The impossibility seeps into and through the palpable deficiencies and pain. The fragments of untold and untellable marks of racial violence add layers of impossibility to this already inaccessible memory. How we know and what we can know swirls in and through rote rehearsal of a story we are not sure we know how to make our own. These shards and fragments, these repetitions and rehearsals, and these dis-membered and re-membered bodies coalesce around a Table where we hear of a body broken and blood spilled for us.</p>
<p>Re-membering a dis-membered Body acquaints us with the shadows of the violence done to that Body. Re-membering violence, re-membering rupture and fissure and harm is traumatic memory. The fragmented memory of racism and white privilege in white communities has found a home not simply in the actual habits we have at Table, but in the shadows of avoidance and denial that afflict our segregated communities. These troubled memories take up a home in us in a way that elides the normal practice of memory and its habit of being an integrated part of who we are. In this way, the memory and chronic experience of racism and white privilege follow the habits and patterns of trauma and, therefore, are an affliction that must be encountered with an eye toward the chaotic, unruly, and unconscious ways that trauma wounds us in our flesh and blood. Traumatic memory haunts the Body of Christ with its repetitive playing out in segregated communities and white obliviousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573613484750">29</xref></sup> These habits simultaneously embody return and ignorance. How can we re-member the Body of Christ if we deny the wounds of the Body itself? Truly tending to the wounds of the Body, the memories that continue to diminish and distort the integrity of our narratives will mean opening our memory and our deep connections up to transformative possibilities.</p>
<p>Re-membering is not simply a cognitive activity, it is an embodied dynamic. We come to Eucharist to remember our story and to re-member the Body of Christ in our communal act of sharing, proclaiming, ingesting bread and wine, and leaning on the mystery of God’s transformative power to redeem and repair that which is the most broken about us. Such communal memory and re-membering has the power to form and transform us. Liturgy has the capacity to embody both the practice of new habits and the impossibility of purely representational memory and narrative. Liturgy embodies the already and not yet of Christian identity and community. Trauma reveals and conceals the unavoidable disruption, aspirational integration, and strange conflation of past, present, and future.</p>
<p>How this harm inhabits us is unique and particular to each of us and to differently racialized groups—it is entangled in all of us. Our unique experiences, our shared social contexts, and our bodies’ idiosyncrasies create in each of us particular and shared “tellings” of dis-membered stories of race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573613484750">30</xref></sup> The very character of things like bodies, racism, and church renders obvious variations in how different communities experience, acknowledge, and ignore these dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573613484750">31</xref></sup> Trauma subtly habituates us in practices that tend to re-harm rather than re-form.</p>
<p>Cathy Caruth explains that “the traumatic symptom cannot be interpreted, simply as a distortion of reality, nor as the lending of unconscious meaning to a reality it wishes to ignore, nor as the repression of what once was wished.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573613484750">32</xref></sup> Traumatic memory is a “literal return” of an event in a non-symbolic mode. Trauma is a return of what actually happened in an arrested form. Caruth explains that “the traumatized…carry an impossible history within them, or they become themselves the symptom of a history that they cannot entirely possess.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573613484750">33</xref></sup> The traumatic memory takes up a home in us in an involuntary and persistent mode. This memory replays and reifies the brokenness that gave it traction in our story in the first place. Traumatic memory replays its reality over and over again no matter how much the material reality it occupies has changed.</p>
<p>Racism and white privilege may seem to be things of the past because we can point to ways that the material reality we occupy has changed. Civil rights, affirmative action, changing patterns of workplaces, neighborhoods, and a population that is becoming less white all point toward a different world we inhabit these days. Yet, the traumatic memory of the societal wounding is tenacious still in its ability to habituate practices and unconscious fears in us. Trauma possesses us, holds us captive the more it is played and replayed out in unconscious ways. We cannot heal from a dis-ease that lurks in places we ignore and deny. Caruth, referencing Freud, describes this ignorance and delay as a “latency” that is passed from generation to generation, condemned to repeat violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573613484750">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trauma complicates the possibilities and pathways of healing in our liturgical practices because traumatic memory is characterized by pure repetition, not by processional transformation. Dis-membered eucharistic practice thus becomes a serial re-traumatizing of communities cut off from one another. The experiences of these re-traumatizing repetitions are always unique and particular to the cultural contexts and experiences that inform communities and individuals, even as they all participate in this shared repetitive dynamic. Despite real changes in laws, ideals, and aspirations our habits continue to embody deeply embedded harm. In white culture the “colorblind” story we tell ourselves and the prominence of what Bonilla-Silva calls our “white habitus” embody our profound denial and our repetitive dis-membering habits of community formation. Our eucharistic practice shows us our dis-ease. Traumatic memory can only give way to transformative memory when we tell the truth about ourselves, as impossible as that truth may be. Life-giving truth makes space for communal flexibility, imagination, and connection. The full force of the violation “cries out,” seeping through those who have little control over its emergence. Transformation, therefore, is not achieved by securing a correct or complete narrative, but by making space for sporadic comprehension of the incomprehensible. Like the task of theology that seeks to assign language and description to the ineffable, healing liturgy around trauma defies full definition and demands embodied recognition.</p>
<p>Trauma studies invites us into the complicated wake of deep harm and how memory carries fragmented narratives, sensations, and woundedness into the present and future, into relationships and communities, and into the cells and habits of our bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573613484750">35</xref></sup> Traumatic memory loosens its chokehold on us when flexibility is introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573613484750">36</xref></sup> Flexibility learns to re-member trauma by integrating traumatic memory into perspectives, frameworks, narratives, and embodied habits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573613484750">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Flexibility also develops through inserting alternative imaginations into our narratives. Not being able to integrate the traumatic memory into the rest of one’s life leads to a kind of dual existence and a “simultaneity” of traumatic experience that is “timeless” in its capacity to be palpably present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573613484750">38</xref></sup> Flexibility of memory introduces us to a space open to other scenarios than the trauma itself. The capacity to imagine oneself as having power in a past abusive situation “finishes” the nightmare with a different outcome—that is one example. It is this flexibility that allows for trauma to be integrated into present and future with a horizon expanded past debilitating and destructive harm. Imagining new life, perhaps retaining connection to a generative icon of vitality, disrupts and even reframes the repetitive pall of death and violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573613484750"><title>Flexibility, Imagination, and Connection as Transformative Eucharistic Practice</title>
<p>Flexibility, imagination, and connection do not illicit instant healing for the deep harms that trauma brings with it. Transforming memory is a complicated, promising, and mysterious possibility. These practices must be multi-layered and include not just words, but also embodied practices that wear new creek beds of thoughts, intuition, even unconscious instinct and reflex. Transforming collective memory around the Communion Table brings with it the added layers and complexity of multiple bodies and collections of unique constellations of being and understanding. Collective intentionality and shared practice become a necessity when we set ourselves to such profound change in our communities. Surely Jesus himself was doing similar work when he asked us to tell ourselves on a regular basis that we can be transformed into his Body through chewing on bread and sharing a cup.</p>
<p>For eucharistic practice to transform in the context of the traumatic memory of a racially dis-membered church, churches will need to stretch into new postures and new gestures of truth-telling and connection. How flexible are our gathered bodies when it comes to re-membering differently? The answer to that question can only be revealed in what “remains” we find in communities who truly imagine and practice a new kind of re-membering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573613484750">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trauma theory helps to fill out some of the characteristics these practices need to have in order to be wise both to the contours of trauma and to the slow work of healing. First, flexibility requires a knowledge and awareness of the depth of the harm that exists. This acknowledgement and awareness is more about an assent to the reality of the depth of harm than it is about being able to access it all and bring it up into a conscious, discrete narrative. Second, flexibility requires relational connection where there is room to abide in the repetitive return that trauma entails. This supportive environment helps create the conditions of possibility for communal skills to develop around noticing the cycles of repetition and denial without judgment and blame. And third, flexibility requires a mode of playful and experimental generation of language and practice. Just as believers dance around the edges of God’s mystery with our liturgies and language about the Divine, so do our sacramental sensitivities and practices need to be malleable enough to respond to the ebb and flow of new insight, new connection, and new imagination.</p>
<p>Stretching into these new practices of flexibility, imagination, and connection will be idiosyncratic, located, and fluid. These practices will also help the church collectively continue to discern new habits of flexibility, imagination, and connection. Healing from a traumatic past is a life-long process. The re-membered Body can enjoy vitality, even if its vitality is diminished by a past we find ways to acknowledge and integrate into who we are becoming. Particular healing intention around race will invite believing communities into some difficult and promising spaces together. We conclude with a few suggestive impressions around flexibility, imagination, and connection as transformative eucharistic practice. These impressions are born out of our own cultural contexts as white Presbyterians and as women who have sought out opportunities to help cultivate and experience cross-cultural community. Transformation, in our read of the biblical witness and Christian gospel, cannot be a mono-cultural dynamic even as we recognize the particular cultural growth edge that faces most white believers.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0040573613484750"><title>Flexibility</title>
<p>Many whites occupy a defensive posture when invited to excavate the way power and privilege functions in their lives. Stories like “I didn’t own slaves,” or “my family may have been racist, but I’m not” create barriers to further exploration by suggesting that they are exempt from needing to examine these structures and habits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573613484750">40</xref></sup> Whites must face the continued realities of historic racism by means of a flexibility that allows them to stretch into a less defensive posture. Through learning and hearing other stories non-defensively, whites may have more room to name and claim their own. Room for the validity of disparate stories can give us reality checks about the ongoing violence we do not notice, and they can offer alternatives to whites being silenced by shame and guilt.</p>
<p>This flexibility is not simply about hearing and acknowledging diverse stories of others who have had experiences different than our own. The transformative effect of flexible memory comes in seeing one’s own past and present in a new way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573613484750">41</xref></sup> And the particular power of flexible memory to transform is deepened when we also recognize the impossibility of full comprehension. For example, the mentality that whites sometimes express in phrases like “race has not affected my life” must stretch into a new awareness of how that denial is a mark of how race has affected one’s life. Only a white person in American culture could live in such an illusion. Thinking race hasn’t affected one’s life is race affecting one’s life. Taking in that fact even as we also affirm the impossibility of total comprehension requires flexibility. For instance, whites can assent to the profound effects of privilege even as there may be no complete way to parse out exactly how privilege has or has not generated certain outcomes (e.g. possessions, accomplishments, etc.).</p>
<p>To address this relatively hidden form of brokenness, to re-member the past in a way that resonates with the complicated and distorted realities of racism’s legacy, white churches need to acknowledge and explore their white privilege. Many white churches express a kind of learned helplessness when it comes to working on issues of race. “We’ve tried everything to be welcoming, and no people of color seem to come here.” Many largely white churches have simply accepted their racial homogeneity as something they cannot do anything about because they cannot attract people of color to be a substantive part of their communities.</p>
<p>New postures for white churches involve looking inward at the congregation itself instead of waiting for people of color to make real work on race possible. A new gesture might be to take an open stance toward exploring what it means to be white in American culture. These same gestures can be extended into congregations. Is there a way to “finish” the nightmare differently? Is there a way to name the harm that white communities embody because of their privilege? Is there a way to seek transformation within congregations that may cultivate a new kind of presence around race in our larger communities?</p>
<p>As whites begin to displace their obliviousness to privilege, the sacrament’s narrative can introduce another layer of flexibility to the healing process. Gathering around a Table where all are hungry and everyone gets what they need may allow a new imprint to take hold in which whiteness can be acknowledged and explored in its troubled complexity. This awakening induces the formation of new skills and habits in the face of return and repetition. And these skills can help to interrupt the mimicking of past patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573613484750"><title>Imagination</title>
<p>Flexibility is best nurtured with robust theological and existential imagination. For whites a new imagination can create conditions of possibility for honest facing of the realities of racism that avoids both superficial “reconciliation” and Manichean accounts of “good guys vs. bad guys” in black–white relations. Reconciliation is a process, a process that necessarily involves change, but also a redefining of relationships. The process of change and redefinition requires a period of transition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573613484750">42</xref></sup> Change is one thing (laws that make segregation illegal), but the capacity to really take the trauma of racism seriously requires transition to a new worldview. This worldview is something that is more time-consuming than “change” and is, of course, a significant alternative to the “fix” of colorblindness.</p>
<p>Transition is “the process that we go through to come to terms with that change.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573613484750">43</xref></sup> Transition is a period in which whites learn new ways of responding to the very idea of “race,” learn to recognize that we have race (privileged whiteness, the different ways in which that privilege is shaped by class and gender). For African Americans this transition period may bring with it new ways of seeing whites and themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573613484750">44</xref></sup> Bridges identifies this as a neutral zone, an “awkward in-between time” that is typically chaotic.</p>
<p>Learning to live with that kind of chaos and incompetency brings with it an imaginative set of new postures and gestures for many white congregations. The practices of surrender and letting go of the need to control the process can be felt in using things like silence instead of spoken word in prayer around the Table. Incompetency is a gesture that white mainline Christians can practice, too, in the experience of being a minority. The need to learn from others rather than dominate them or be oblivious to them is crucial to constructive incompetency. Imagining incompetence as a life-giving space takes practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040573613484750"><title>Connection</title>
<p>A new version of DuBois’s insight that oppressed groups must develop “double consciousness,” which is the awareness of the dominant group as well as their own in order to survive, may provide a necessary template for whites to connect in new ways. A white double-consciousness requires that the dominant group see themselves in an entirely new way and that obliviousness to the “other” be transformed in the intimacy of face-to-face relationships that call on us to be vulnerable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573613484750">45</xref></sup> Such transformation is not the replacement of obliviousness with charity, but the complicated discernment, with attendant and inevitable incompetency, that our own well-being depends upon that of the “other.” These dynamics can find a home around the Table when we share Communion facing each other, sharing our hopes and fears, and seeking God’s mysterious presence together.</p>
<p>Sharing power is another gesture and posture that can allow for new modes of connection. Discursive practices that make room for diverse understandings and enactments of personal power could be put to use around the Table in the way we voice the Great Thanksgiving and encounter Scripture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573613484750">46</xref></sup> Spiritual practices around the Communion Table and/or in preparation for the Table like <italic>lectio divina</italic> also can exercise new muscles in our collective capacity to shake loose of rigidity and fear. As new practices and habits emerge so will new dispositions toward one another and toward ourselves. Again, the Christian practice of confession and truth-telling before Communion invites a similar dynamic. These postures and gestures may provide new ways of embodying these age-old Christian beliefs.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040573613484750"><title>An Invitation</title>
<p>Re-membering a dis-membered Body is not formulaic or scientific. It is not about simple recollection or linear narrative. Re-membering is a lived dynamic. For any who have felt moments of this new sensation, for any who have glimpsed this vision of the Church “together in one place” you know the deep yearning for spaces and places for such re-membering to take hold. Those fleeting brushes with what can be change the stories we are able to tell and even the lives we are able to live. The memories we make around the Table re-membered can be more vivid than any we’ve known thus far. Far from colorblind, we might finally have eyes to see and bodies that can be Christ’s Technicolor dream for us.</p>
