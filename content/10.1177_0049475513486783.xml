<abstract>
<p>As far as we know, the accuracy of clinical judgment in diagnosing uterine cervical polyps has not been assessed in sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to discover the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical judgment in the diagnosis of cervical polyps. This is a retrospective descriptive study of 192 patients, carried out by the Departments of Pathology and Gynaecology of the Yaoundé Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital, Cameroon. The diagnosis of cervical polyp was confirmed by histopathology examination in 169 patients, giving a PPV rate of 88.0%. The PPV of clinical judgment in the diagnosis of cervical polyps is acceptable in our setting but the frequency of premalignant and malignant lesions encountered is too high (10.4%), even in the presence of a confirmed cervical polyp (8.9%). Even in areas where there are limited resources, we recommend a systematic histopathology examination of any clinically suspected cervical polyp.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0049475513486783" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cervical polyps are benign tumours originating from the surface epithelium of both the endocervix and the exocervix. It is a common finding among women in their reproductive ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513486783">1</xref></sup> Although asymptomatic in most of the patients, they are also found in 20% of those experiencing post-coital bleeding; other common symptoms are intermenstrual bleeding and vaginal hydrorrhaea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486783">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513486783"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486783">4</xref></sup> Recurrence occurs in about 6.8% to 12.6% of patients after removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513486783">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513486783">5</xref></sup> and premalignant and malignant lesions were reported in 0.1% to 0.5% of patients in Connecticut, USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513486783">5</xref></sup> Due to the limited human, material and financial resources in the sub-Saharan Africa setting, routine histopathological examinations after the removal of cervical polyps are often difficult. On the other hand, Indian researchers found direct inspection to be useful in the identification of suspicious cervix where the prevalence of cancer of the cervix is high and where cytological screening is not readily available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513486783">6</xref></sup> All these conditions are similar to those of our setting. We, therefore, decided to carry out this study to discover the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical judgment in order to diagnose cervical polyps and to rule out any precancerous and cancerous lesions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0049475513486783" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a descriptive study with a retrospective data collection, carried out at the Yaoundé Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital, Cameroon. The register of the department of pathology, the clinical files of patients and the histopathology reports were consulted. All the medical files of patients who had given a sample for histopathology and in whom a clinical diagnosis of cervical polyp had been made by a medical doctor within the period from 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2009 were included. Clinical judgment was based on history, direct visual inspection of the cervix and inspection of the removed tissue. Data were computerized and analysed with Epi Info 3.5.1 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The data were collected on a questionnaire and concerned the following variables: age, marital status, symptoms, clinical diagnosis of cervical polyp, and histopathology examination reports. Computerization and statistical analysis were done with Epi Info 3.5.1 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. Authorization was obtained from the National Ethics Committee and from the General Directorate of the Yaoundé Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital, Cameroon. Data sheets were confidential and identification codes were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0049475513486783" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 2653 samples were received by the Department of Pathology. Of these, 192 were labelled as polyps by clinicians, of which 169 were confirmed by histology. This gave an overall frequency rate of 6.4% (169/2653). Most of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of cervical polyp (61.5%) were aged between 30 and 49 years and 82.2% had at least three children. The majority (70.8%) were married. The characteristics of the population studied are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049475513486783">Table 1</xref>. Of the 169 (88.0%) cases of cervical polyps confirmed by histopathology examination, 12 (6.2%) and 3 (1.6%), respectively, were associated with dysplasia and carcinoma. Despite the clinical diagnosis, 23 (12.0%) were found to have non-polypoid lesions of which 4/23 (17.4%) were malignant and 1/23 (4.3%) were diagnosed as premalignant. Of all the specimens analysed, malignancy was observed in 7/192 (3.7%) cases and premalignancy in 13/192 (6.7%) patients. The calculated PPV of the direct visual inspection in the diagnosis of cervical polyps was 88.0% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049475513486783">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0049475513486783">3</xref>).

<sec id="sec4-0049475513486783" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PPV of the clinical judgment in the diagnosis of cervical polyps had not been reported in the available published literature. The value found in this study was high and may be acceptable with some reservation of the unknown unanalysed specimens in our context where there is a shortage of trained pathologists and low financial resources. In Cameroon, there are only 17 histopathologists and all of them practice in the main towns of Yaoundé and Douala. In addition, the socioeconomic status of the population is low, as reported in the 2007 report from the country, with 39.9% living on less than 35 Euros a month,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513486783">7</xref></sup> and the majority of Cameroonians live outside of the two main towns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the finding of malignancy and premalignancy in association with a cervical polyp is not uncommon. Berzolla et al. claimed that there were 0.5% cases of dysplasia in a series of 2246 patients with clinically diagnosed polyps. Golan et al<italic>.</italic> discovered no additional pathological findings in 218 asymptomatic patients but described eight cases of premalignancy among 144 symptomatic cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513486783">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513486783">5</xref></sup> In our series, 15 of the 169 cases (8.9%) of proven cervical polyps were associated with dysplasia and carcinoma. Of the 23 lesions found to be non-polyps, five (21.7%) were either premalignant or malignant. Therefore, the presence of premalignant and malignant lesions was very high in our study (20/192; 10.4%). These findings may be explained by the fact that most of the polyps were symptomatic. Contrary to MacKenzie et al., who recommend a policy of only removing cervical polyps from symptomatic women or those with abnormal cervical cytology, based on the finding of no malignant features in a series of 1366 cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049475513486783">8</xref></sup> we believe that histopathology examination of cervical polyps should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Our results must be considered with some limitations. If all the patients whose samples were received at the department of pathology with a clinical diagnosis of cervical polyp were included, an unidentified number of removed clinically diagnosed cervical polyps had not been sent for histopathological examination. In some cases specimens were sent but the women could not afford to pay the requested fees. All these might give some bias to our results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0049475513486783" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The PPV of clinical judgment in the diagnosis of cervical polyps is high in our setting. Unfortunately, the simultaneous occurrence of malignant and premalignant lesions is common in clinically diagnosed polyps. Therefore, histopathology examination should be mandatory.</p>
