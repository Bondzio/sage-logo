<p>Orissa, rich in mineral and other natural resources, is widely known for its abundant and the best quality deposits of bauxite, the ore for aluminium. It is also home to a large tribal population. With the opening up of the mining sector for private investment, this resource-rich state in east India has become an attractive investment destination, and is currently witnessing a huge private sector-led investment boom. While privatisation is touted as a road to rapid development, it has created a demand for land which is hard to meet. As natural wealth is mostly concentrated in tribal areas, large investment in mining projects is leading to the displacement of local population on a massive scale. The tribal people are deeply attached to their land everywhere, but in the case of Dongaria Konds of southern Orissa, the bauxite-laden Niyamgiri Hills where they have lived through centuries happen to be particularly sacred, as the abode of their god. Currently, these people are fiercely resisting the takeover of their land by multinational corporations (MNCs) that have set their eyes on rich bauxite deposits, especially those atop the Niyamgiri Hills.</p>
<p>Against the given backdrop, this book presents, from an anthropological perspective, a full and vivid account of the destructive impact of bauxite mining on the environment and tribal people of Orissa, together with an analysis of factors that have produced this devastating effect. Anthropologists’ knowledge about tribal societies, despite its limitations, puts them in an advantageous position to speak about the disruption inherent in the process of removing tribal people from their land for the sake of industrialisation. Felix Padel (an anthropologist who had earlier studied the Konds of Orissa) and Samarendra Das (an Oriya writer and activist), the authors of this book, are thus uniquely equipped to unveil a process of industrialisation that is causing irreparable damage to the environment, and rapidly leading to the extinction of a traditional culture in Orissa that respects environment and has lived in harmony with it through the ages. Because this study is focused on aluminium and its relationship with the tribal society, the authors call it ‘an anthropology of aluminium’. The authors think that similar analysis of other industries, especially steel and coal, will well be worth it as well.</p>
<p>The approach to studying tribal societies that anthropology follows is holistic. An anthropology of the aluminium industry, according to the authors, means studying the social structure as a whole. It means seeing how all its separate actors and factors relate together as a whole, even though many groups may be completely oblivious of the others. For example, engineers, traders, bankers and other groups concerned with aluminium may know nothing about the people who get displaced by bauxite mining, or about their customs and traditions. In order to understand the intricate web of relationship of bauxite mining to other groups, the authors provide information about all aspects of the aluminium industry so that the whole picture can be seen clearly. The aim is to provide a balanced view, examining as many facets as possible—social, environmental, historical, economic, political, legal and even scientific. What they present is an overview of the main issues, yet it adds up to a lot, given their penchant for minutest details about whatever they write on.</p>
<p>Following the economic reforms initiated in India under the globalisation pressures, state governments have been wooing MNCs as they are the source of foreign direct investment (FDI), much needed to support their development programmes. In recent years, MNCs have indeed landed in Orissa in droves, taking advantage of the new policy which welcomes private industry. The authors see a larger design in MNCs setting up aluminium plants; they are under pressure from the aluminium cartel, a conglomerate supported by the world’s most powerful governments. They need this metal for defence requirements, besides for its many other uses. The developed countries have stopped bauxite mining within their territories because of its adverse environmental and other effects, and therefore they are encouraging its outsourcing from India and other developing countries.</p>
<p>In today’s world, corporations have emerged as new centres of power, and they are affecting our lives in ways that remain little understood. Governments, too, tend to go out of their way to assist MNCs in many ways: in acquiring land, getting environmental and other clearances for their projects and so on. Sometimes, the impression one gets is as if the government officials are taking orders from the companies. It is no surprise that the people of Orissa have come to see the government as working for the corporations at their cost.</p>
<p>Corporations have acquired notoriety for their human rights abuses in their dealings with the tribal people whom they see as those opposing their projects. The fact is that MNC projects are a real threat to tribal society because the displacement they cause leads to impoverishment and other negative impacts. Such projects tend to polarise the tribal society, breaking up the social cohesion which has been its defining characteristic. The way the POSCO project has divided the local population in two warring groups, one supporting the project and the other opposing it, is a case in point.</p>
<p>Using their clout with the government, these companies often manage to obtain necessary clearances for land acquisition without the mandatory consent of tribal panchayats, hoodwinking the law and established procedures. For example, ArcelorMittal succeeded in their design on a mountain in Keonjhar through a subverted public hearing. In 2008, just before a public hearing was scheduled to take place, a leading protester was beaten up, and police arrested 250 tribal villagers, keeping them in jail while the meeting took place. The district collector who conducted the hearing reported that people were present from ten villages, and the overwhelming majority supported the project and were willing to give up their lands in lieu of compensation.</p>
<p>Through a well-orchestrated media effort, corporations try to present a benign face, though their real face is altogether different. The publicity offensive ensures that the stories of displacement, resistance to land acquisition, human rights abuses and the police brutalities to force tribal people off their land do not get to travel around. But this study successfully brings out in the open how despite farmers’ protests, Vedanta, POSCO, ArcelorMittal and several other powerful corporations have acquired land that they wanted, dislodged tribal people from their ancestral land and livelihood and managed to set up their shops in Orissa and other states in east India.</p>
<p>Laws favourable to tribal people are seldom implemented properly. There are laws to prevent alienation of tribal land to outsiders, and it is to ensure their compliance that the provision was made for public hearings to ensure that no displacement occurs without first consulting them. But public hearings are regularly manipulated. Recently, the Government of India issued an order barring outside persons and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from public hearings on the ground that outsiders instigate local people and otherwise create trouble. This may have been done to prevent independent observers from reporting what goes on in the name of public hearings, where consent is often manufactured.</p>
<p>The NGOs are an inescapable part of India’s development scene. There are thousands of them in Orissa as well. This book takes a good look at the role that NGOs play in the aluminium industry. The authors describe their role as full of ambiguity. While some support people’s movements, most NGOs support aluminium companies. Some do vital social work, but many are notoriously corrupt. Therefore, they come in for criticism from both sides.</p>
<p>The NGOs, as their name implies, should be non-governmental, but in reality, they are not so. They receive funds from foreign governments or work as contractors for local governments. Often, they are accountable to the foreign governments that give them funds, not to the local people. Because of their closeness to foreign governments, the people in a remote Dongaria village once described local NGOs to the authors as ‘centres of foreign government’; not an inappropriate description for NGOs that thrive on foreign funding sources for their activities.</p>
<p>The donor funding of NGOs is subjected to a critical scrutiny in one whole chapter. One aspect of donor funding is that this leads to competition among NGOs for donor funds because their number is large and not all of them can hope to get a slice from the available funding. The authors feel that NGO contribution to the community would be more productive if they cooperated rather than fought over donor funding. The other aspect is that richer NGOs who are financed by mining companies donate large sums to villages. This is what Vedanta is also reportedly doing to show its concern for the local people to the outside world, while wining them over to its side. A major issue is that donor-financed NGOs say what donors want to hear, or do not want to hear, otherwise they run the risk of not getting contracts or funding again. This restrains them from openly speaking against donors, even when they feel they need to.</p>
<p>The authors caution against painting all NGOs in one hue. They are all sorts. Some NGOs do real good work that they should be doing, but their number is small. While these few, small NGOs refuse funds from governments, donors and companies to maintain their independence and support social movements, most others unhesitatingly seek corporate finance. This, the authors point out, is particularly true of some of the biggest and most powerful NGOs. They are completely corporate controlled. It is the funding that then determines the knowledge they churn out, which often is of little wider practical use and only compounds the real issues.</p>
<p>While companies cause widespread displacement, the resettlement issue is routinely neglected. The usual response of officials, however, is to deny that the problem exists. As a result, the affected people are often left to their own wits to rebuild their lives. Without resettlement assistance, most displaced people end up more impoverished, worse off than before, unable to face an uncertain future. Having lost their land to projects, they gravitate towards nearby towns and cities in search of an alternative source of livelihood, for which they are least prepared. As the authors point out, this change of livelihood for the affected people involves a complete break from their culture and identity, apart from further exposing them to severe impoverishment risks of all kinds—economic, social and cultural.</p>
<p>Does the kind of private companies-propelled development process that Orissa has opted for done any good to the tribal people? From the evidence that the authors provide, the answer to this question is ‘No’. Instead of reducing poverty, development has only made it worse. Under pressure from MNCs, lands in tribal areas have been handed over to companies, often in contravention of constitutional and legal provisions. In this wave of displacement-induced development, the tribal people face a worse poverty than anything they had known before. What hurts them even more than displacement-induced poverty is the destruction of their traditions, values, cultural identity, which inevitably follows their separation from land. For the tribal people, large projects such as dams, mines and factories, which government promotes as development, is just the opposite of development since they involve their dispossession from their land and destruction of their culture, and a decline in their previous level of living, without providing an alternative to a decent way of life they have known all along.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a meticulously researched, insightful study of tribal people living in the hills and forests of Orissa, who are presently bearing the brunt of MNCs-led rapid industrialisation. This really has come at a time when it is needed most. Highly readable, the issues this thought-provoking book has raised need careful consideration. It will be a particularly useful reading for the policy makers who are currently facing critical challenges of governance and development not only in Orissa but also other tribal-dominated states in the country. For researchers, as also for the concerned citizens, this volume presents a mine of information, not to be found elsewhere.</p>
