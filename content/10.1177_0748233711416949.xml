<p>Methanol is primarily metabolized by oxidation to formaldehyde and then to formate. These processes are accompanied by formation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. This article reports data on the effect of methanol-induced oxidative damage in experimental rats and the role of aqueous extract of <italic>Opuntia vulgaris</italic> fruit extract (OE) to counteract the toxicity induced by methanol. The animals were exposed to methanol at a dose of 2.37 g/kg body weight intraperitoneally for 30 days. OE was found to contain large amounts of polyphenols and carotenoids and significant antioxidant capacities highlighted by scavenging activities for 2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl. The treatment with methanol exhibited a significant increase in serum hepatic and renal biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, urea, and creatinine). Methanol intoxication significantly increased hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation evaluated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in treated rats as compared to controls. However, hepatic and renal antioxidant enzymes namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly decreased in methanol-treated animals as compared to controls. The results concluded that treatment with OE prior to methanol intoxication has significant role in protecting animals from methanol-induced hepatic and renal histopathological and oxidative damage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Methanol, first in the alcohol series, is normally used as an industrial solvent and cleanser. Also known as wood alcohol, methanol is a component of washing fluids, antifreeze formulations, photocopying fluids, perfumes, and paint removers. Methanol, after intoxication, is metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and catalase (CAT), mainly in the liver, via formaldehyde to formic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711416949">Bryson, 1989</xref>). In rats, a catalase–peroxidase system is considered to be responsible for oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde. Accumulation of formic acid is likely pointed out as the cause for the metabolic acidosis resulting in the clinical manifestations of methanol toxicity and characterized by optic nerve involvement. Methanol is also increasingly recognized as a hepatotoxin in that hepatocytes oxidize it first to formaldehyde and then to formate (Tephly, 1991). These processes are accompanied by the elevation of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-reduced (NADH) level and the formation of superoxide anion, which may be involved in lipid peroxidation (LPO). Methanol could initiate reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation directly via a free radical intermediate, or possibly indirectly through mechanisms like the activation and/or enhancement of ROS-producing NADPH oxidases, which has been reported for ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711416949">Dong et al., 2010</xref>). The generation of oxygen free radicals might be enhanced, leading to membrane damage, LPO, and mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711416949">Bralet et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711416949">Chacon and Acosta, 1991</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711416949">Dikalova et al. (2001)</xref> detected free radical metabolite generation in bile and urine of rats from acute formate intoxication by the electron spin resonance spectroscopy spin-trapping technique. These generated free radicals cause extensive damage to cellular membranes leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Consequently, the cells’ ability to survive the increased ROS is diminished as antioxidants become depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711416949">Di Monte et al., 1992</xref>). However, cells also have a scavenging system to counteract the free radicals generated so that the integrity of the cell membrane may be maintained. Previously, we reported that high doses of methanol affects immune functions in albino rats (Parthasarathy et al., 2005). Data on the antioxidant defense potential in the liver and kidney after methanol intoxication in rats are lacking. It is, thus, interesting to evaluate the activities of methanol metabolizing enzymes in the liver cells which are targets of this alcohol. In this report, particular attention has been drawn to the antioxidant status expressed in enzyme activities in liver and kidney of rats after one high dose of methanol, which were observed for 30 consecutive days. During the past few years, estimation of free radical generation and antioxidant defense has become an important aspect of investigation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711416949">Zini et al., 1993</xref>). A positive correlation has been established between dietary supplementation with certain vegetables and plant products and the reduction in toxic effects of various toxicants and environmental contaminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711416949">Nandi et al., 1997</xref>). Plant products are known to exert their protective effects by scavenging free radicals and modulating antioxidant defense systems.</p>
<p>Fruits are beneficial to human health and contribute to the prevention of degenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711416949">Vinson et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Opuntia vulgaris</italic>, a species native to Tunisia, is widely distributed in the center and the south of Tunisia, and its fruit, known as prickly pears or cactus pears, is an excellent source of betalain natural colorants and functional compounds. Fruits of <italic>Opuntia</italic> spp. represent lower risk of microbiological contamination, have no nitrate content, are highly flavored, show adequate nutritional properties (e.g. high levels of calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C), and contain interesting functional compounds like quercetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711416949">Stintzing et al., 2005</xref>). The aqueous extract of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> on preliminary chemical analysis is found to contain saponin and alkaloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711416949">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Opuntia</italic> spp. extracts have shown analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, physiological antioxidant, cancer chemoprevention, and neuroprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711416949">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). It is also a scavenger for reactive oxygen species and nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711416949">Gentile et al., 2004</xref>). Recent studies have shown that some phenolic compounds can prevent certain chemical solvent-induced oxidative damage, and the activity of phenolic compounds might be related to their antioxidant properties. For that reason, it can be implicated for different pharmacological effects. The traditional use of this plant is based on the oral administration of a decoction prepared from its fruit in water. This study was designed to determine the possible protective effects of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> extract against biochemical effects and oxidative damages induced in rats by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of methanol.</p>
<p>In the present study, to evaluate liver and kidney functions, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, creatinine, and urea were assayed. Oxidative stress was estimated by an increase in LPO (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) and changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in liver and kidney tissues. To our knowledge, the use of <italic>Opuntia vulgaris </italic>fruit extract (OE) to alleviate the oxidative damage induced by methanol has not been previously examined.</p>

<italic>DPPH-radical-scavenging activity</italic>.

Briefly, 1 ml of a 4% (weight/volume [w/v]) solution of DPPH radical in methanol was mixed with 500 μl of sample solutions in ethanol at different concentrations. The mixture was incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. The scavenging capacity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 517 nm against a blank using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad SmartSpec<sup>TM</sup> plus). Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates higher free-radical-scavenging activity. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The percentage of DPPH-scavenging effect was calculated using the following equation: DPPH-scavenging effect (%) = (<italic>A</italic>

<sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents except the tested compound. <italic>A</italic>

<title>Hydroxyl-radical-scavenging activity</title>

The reacting mixture for the deoxyribose assay contained in a final volume of 1 ml the following reagents: 200 μl potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)–potassium hydroxide (KOH; 100 mM), 200 μl deoxyribose (15 mM), 200 μl iron (III) chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>; 500 μM), 100 μl EDTA (1 mM), 100 μl ascorbic acid (1 mM), 100 μl H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 mM), and 100 μl sample. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation period, 1 ml of 1% (w/v) TBA was added to each mixture followed by the addition of 1 ml of 2.8% (w/v) TCA. Solutions were heated on a water bath at 80°C for 20 min to develop the pink-colored MDA-TBA<sub>2</sub> adduct, and the absorbance of the resulting solution (total volume = 3.0 ml) was measured at 532 nm.

<title>Antioxidant capacities of O. vulgaris extract</title>
<p>The effect of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> extracts on DPPH-radical-scavenging showed a dose-dependent activity that can be evaluated by the determination of the IC<sub>50</sub> values corresponding to the amount of the fraction required to scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals present in the reaction mixture. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233711416949">Table 1</xref>, the radical scavenger extract showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 990 ± 5.60 μg/ml, followed by the water fraction. Therefore, we can conclude that this extract was able to reduce the stable free radical DPPH to the yellow-colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine. In the β-carotene bleaching method, the degree of linoleic acid oxidation is determined by measuring oxidation products (lipid hydroperoxides, conjugated dienes, and volatile by-products) of linoleic acid which simultaneously attack β-carotene, resulting in the bleaching of its characteristic yellow color in aqueous solution. The antioxidant activity of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> was evaluated using different concentrations of extracts and was compared with BHT used as reference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233711416949">Table 2</xref>
). The addition of the OE fraction and the BHT at a concentration of 800 and 1000 μg/ml prevented the bleaching of β-carotene at different degrees. The ·OH) can easily cross cell membranes, readily react with most biomolecules including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and DNA in cells and cause tissue damage or cell death. Thus, removing ·OH is important for the protection of living systems. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711416949">Figure 2</xref>
, the OE fraction exhibited high ·OH- scavenging activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 990 ± 5.60 μg/ml.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, the role of OE on the oxidative stress in methanol toxicity was investigated in male rats. The selective dose of methanol was literature based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711416949">Parthasarathy et al., 2006</xref>). The selective dose of OE was based on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711416949">Saoudi et al., 2011</xref>). The results indicated that phenolic estimation reveals that aqueous extract of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> fruit contain considerable amount of polyphenolic and flavonoid coumpounds. Our results are in accordance with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711416949">Kuti (2004)</xref> who reported that the extracts from four cactus (Opuntia species) fruit varieties marked a good source of natural antioxidants such as flavonoids and polyphenols, and consumption of Opuntia fruit or its products may contribute substantial amounts of antioxidants to the diet. The stable DPPH radical is widely used to evaluate the free-radical-scavenging activity in many plant extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711416949">Brand-Williams et al., 1995</xref>). The assessment of antioxidant activity showed that <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> fruit was able to scavenge this radical (IC<sub>50</sub> = 990 ± 5.60 μg/ml). This result revealed that the aqueous extract of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> fruit was free radical scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants. The inhibition of LPO by the addition of OE can be used to improve the quality and stability of food products.</p>
<p>The OE was found to have strong superoxide-radical-scavenging activity, which may be due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds. Also, higher peroxidation-inhibiting activity of OE suggests a possible biological functionality in preventing the oxidative damage. It is well known that radicals such as nitric oxide (NO) are associated with various carcinomas and inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and ulcerative colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711416949">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). The toxicity of NO increased when it reacts with superoxide radical, forming the highly reactive peroxynitrite anion (ONOO–; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711416949">Huie and Padmaja, 1993</xref>). The present study showed that the <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> extract studied has more potent scavenging activity. Methanol is toxic to the cells by the formation of free radicals and increased LPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711416949">Kadiiska and Mason, 2000</xref>). Numerous evidences clearly demonstrated the importance of medicinal plants in the treatment of oxidative stress-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711416949">Jung et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study evaluated the effects of aqueous extract of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> fruit on methanol-induced biochemical perturbation and oxidative stress. Also, damage to the liver after methanol exposure is a well-known phenomenon, and the obvious sign of hepatic injury is the leakage of hepatic enzymes into plasma. The increased levels of serum enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, and bilirubin have been observed in methanol-treated rats, which indicate the increased permeability, damage, or necrosis of hepatocytes. The OE administration gave a high hepatoprotective effect by reversing these changes produced by methanol. The observed decrease in the activities of these enzymes showed that OE, to some extent, preserved the structural integrity of the liver from the toxic effect. In addition, treatment with methanol induced increase in serum urea and creatinine, which indicated kidney dysfunction. The results also showed that OE significantly decreased the serum urea and creatinine levels. These results clearly showed that methanol has a harmful and stressful influence on the hepatic and renal tissue consistent with those reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711416949">Parthasarathy et al., 2006</xref>). Methanol is well known to produce oxidative stress in liver and kidney by disturbing the prooxidant/antioxidant status as revealed from the altered levels of different intracellular antioxidant markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711416949">Datta and Namasivayam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711416949">Sandhir and Kaur, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Antioxidant enzymes are considered to be the first line of cellular defense against oxidative damage. Among them SOD and CAT mutually function in the elimination of ROS. In the current study, treatment with methanol resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px. Reduction in SOD activity in methanol-exposed animals may be due to the enhanced production of super oxide radical anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711416949">Shanmugam et al., 2010</xref>). Catalase is an enzymatic antioxidant widely distributed in all animal tissues. Catalase decomposes hydrogen peroxide and protects the tissue from highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The administration of OE restored the activities of enzymatic antioxidant in liver and kidney. Polyphenolic compounds are present in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, which have powerful antioxidant properties, that is, free-radical-scavenging activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711416949">Pal and Mitra, 2010</xref>). LPO is one of the characteristic features of increased oxidative stress associated with methanol toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711416949">Sandhir and Kaur, 2006</xref>). Increased TBARS level is an index of enhanced LPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711416949">Devipriya et al., 2007</xref>). The oral administration of OE prior to methanol intoxication significantly lowers this enhanced TBARS level in hepatic and renal tissues. The OE extract may suppress LPO through different chemical mechanisms, including free radical quenching, electron transfer, radical addition, or radical recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711416949">Pal and Mitra, 2010</xref>). This observation directly demonstrates the antiperoxidative and antioxidant effects of OE.</p>
<p>Histopathological examination of the liver and kidney revealed that methanol treatment caused abnormal ultrastructural changes in the tissues. However, pretreatment with OE could prevent the changes and could also maintain the ultrastructure almost similar to that of normal control. Similar observations were reported by Xu et al. (2009). The current results clearly indicated that treatment with OE did not induce any harmful effects on the animals. The changes in the liver of methanol-treated rats were predominant in the centrilobular region. Administration of OE to methanol-treated rats reduced the liver cell damage and improved the histomorphology of the liver near to normal. The kidneys show dilated tubules with cloudy swelling in methanol-treated rats. Rats administered with OE along with methanol showed near normal appearance with mildly dilated tubules with regenerating epithelium of kidney, which indicates the significant protection offered by OE against the toxic effect of alcohol. The results of functional tests together with histological observations suggest that methanol leads to serious changes in histology of liver and kidney. The <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> fruit is rich in compounds known to be strong antioxidants and it ameliorated liver and kidney damages induced by methanol.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our data indicate that OE has a protective action against methanol-induced toxicity as evidenced by the lowered tissue LPO and elevated levels of biochemical enzymes and a decrease in enzymatic antioxidants in liver and kidney. Hence, our study suggests that OE plays a beneficial role in the treatment of methanol-induced tissue damage, which could be one of its therapeutic values.</p>
