<p>Each year, the College presents a variety of awards, grants and prizes to acknowledge outstanding achievements and contributions to psychiatry, the community and the College, and to recognise excellence in psychiatric research and training or encourage new and emerging researchers.</p>
<p>At the 2012 RANZCP Congress in Hobart, the following awards were formally presented as part of the College Ceremony.</p>
<sec id="section1-1039856212460348">
<title>The College Medal of Honour</title>
<p>The College Medal of Honour is the RANZCP’s highest and most prestigious award, and is presented only for distinguished and meritorious service to the College.</p>
<p>In 2012, the College Medal of Honour was awarded to Dr Ian Martin of Victoria. His citation reads:</p>
<p>Dr Ian Martin</p>
<p>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is pleased to award the College Medal of Honour to Dr Ian Martin of Victoria.</p>
<p>Dr Martin’s service to the College at the highest level is completely unparalleled in the history of the organisation. Dr Martin was truly a ‘founding father’ of the College who played a pivotal role in the establishment of the (then) Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Having served as the Honorary Secretary of the earlier Australasian Association of Psychiatrists from 1953 to 1963, Dr Martin oversaw the extraordinary processes of converting the Association to a College. He became the College’s founding Honorary Secretary upon its incorporation in 1963 and would hold this position for a further six years. During this period, Dr Martin administered the complex processes of establishing an Australia-wide Diploma of Psychological Medicine (under the auspices of the Association), and the processes leading up to the establishment of the College’s Membership (later Fellowship) examination. He also played an important role in the Australian team which negotiated and obtained the first Medicare rebates for psychiatric items within the universal health insurance scheme in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Dr Martin commenced his psychiatry training in Adelaide in 1945, and was admitted to Membership of the Australasian Association of Psychiatrists in 1951. He would go on to practice as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst for some 60 years. Dr Martin was described as an extraordinarily perceptive clinician, and a diligent and intellectually demanding teacher. Holding appointments in the psychiatry units of Melbourne general hospitals over several decades, he was able to bring psychoanalytic insights to the care of a large number of patients with physical and psychiatric co-morbidity, and also to contribute directly to the teaching of a wide range of health care professionals, including scores of trainee psychiatrists.</p>
<p>In addition to his significant College contributions, Dr Martin was instrumental in establishing the group psychoanalytic movement in Australia. He was a co-founder of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Group Psychotherapists, and also served as the Australian Psychoanalytical Society’s foundation Honorary Secretary.</p>
<p>Throughout his long career, Dr Martin contributed vigorously to the public debate about the need to promote knowledge of and treatment for mental conditions in the community. An inspiration to many doctors and psychiatrists who were taught and influenced by him, his contributions to mental health stamp him as one of the most significant and constructive psychiatrists in Australia since the Second World War.</p>
<p>Dr Ian Martin is commended as a most worthy and meritorious recipient of the College Medal of Honour.</p>

<title>The College Citation</title>
<p>The College Citation recognises special service to the RANZCP or to psychiatry, and may be awarded to a Fellow or other medical or non-medical nominee.</p>
<p>In 2012 College Citations were awarded to The Honourable Justice William Carter QC of Queensland and Professor Daniel O’Connor of Victoria. Their citations read:</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212460348">
<title>The Honourable Justice William Carter QC</title>
<p>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is pleased to award a College Citation to the Honourable Justice William Carter QC, for his outstanding contributions to improving the provision of services for disadvantaged people with mental health problems.</p>
<p>A lifelong campaigning lawyer and human rights activist, Justice Carter has been a dedicated and effective advocate for the development of Queensland’s mental health services. In 1990, he chaired a Queensland Government Commission of Inquiry into the care and treatment of patients in the psychiatric unit of Townsville General Hospital between 1975 and 1988. The resulting report proved to be an historically important watershed document which highlighted a number of facets of inappropriate practice endemic in that service at that time, and was the key to the initiation of a successful turn-around for a problem service.</p>
<p>Justice Carter was also the author of the pivotal Carter Report in 2006, which examined targeted service responses for adults with intellectual/cognitive disability who exhibit severely challenging behaviour. The report brought about a number of changes to the delivery of mental health care in Queensland. In particular, it resulted directly in the creation of a range of new Queensland disability services, including a state-wide mental health assessment and outreach service for adults with intellectual disabilities, a new academic centre of excellence in behavioural support at the University of Queensland, and an entire new network of multidisciplinary teams dedicated to addressing the challenges of behaviour disorder among people with disabilities. The recommendations of the report, combined with Justice Carter’s active advocacy, were central to the development of Queensland’s new state-wide forensic disability service which opened in 2011.</p>
<p>Justice Carter was a natural choice to author this report and it is testament both to the thoroughness with which he carried out the investigation, and his own reputation, that the report was so successful in initiating such massive changes.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Justice William Carter has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to improving the situations of marginalised and disadvantaged people with mental health problems, and he has had a profoundly positive effect on many aspects of service provision. He is held in the highest respect by the College and by his peers, and is a most worthy and meritorious recipient of a College Citation.</p>

<title>Professor Daniel O’Connor</title>
<p>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is pleased to award a College Citation to Professor Daniel O’Connor for his outstanding contributions to mental health care for older people and for his long and valuable service to the RANZCP, in particular to the College’s Faculty of Psychiatry of Old Age.</p>
<p>Professor O’Connor’s illustrious career began in New Zealand where he completed his psychiatry training. His strong research interest led him to Cambridge in 1984 as a Research Fellow under the supervision of Sir Martin Roth, and during the following six years he headed a large longitudinal study of dementia in the community. Named the Hughes Hall Project for Later Life, this project investigated the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, needs of carers and service issues relevant to people with dementia, and its outcomes are still being cited more than 20 years later.</p>
<p>Professor O’Connor’s research activity has continued over the years, and he has published widely on the epidemiology of mental health in late life, the recognition and management of dementia and depression in general medical practice, and non-pharmacological treatments of behaviour disorders in dementia. His research is marked by its relevance to the contemporary needs of psychiatry of old age locally and internationally.</p>
<p>Professor O’Connor’s dedication has resulted in the development and provision of improved services for older people. In his positions as Foundation Professor of Psychiatry of Old Age at Monash University and Clinical Director of Southern Health’s Aged Persons’ Mental Health Service, he has contributed to the development of a detailed state-wide plan, delivering specialist community inpatient and residential care to older people in metropolitan, regional and rural areas of Victoria. It was the development of this plan which established a leadership role for Victoria in the mental health care of older people.</p>
<p>Professor O’Connor has made significant contributions to the RANZCP over more than a decade. Most notably, he has chaired both the bi-national and Victorian committees of the RANZCP Faculty of Psychiatry of Old Age, and has been actively involved in the College’s education and training activities through the Board of Education and his chairmanship of the Committee for Education Projects. Professor O’Connor’s involvement has also extended to the organisation of a number of scientific meetings for the Faculty of Psychiatry of Old Age, plus other congresses and regional meetings for organisations including the World Psychiatric Association and International Psychogeriatric Association.</p>
<p>Professor O’Connor has tirelessly taught undergraduate and postgraduate students and has lectured widely across Australia and internationally. An active researcher, clinician, leader, and gentleman, Professor Daniel O’Connor is held in the highest regard both by the College and by his peers and is a most worthy and meritorious recipient of a College Citation.</p>

<title>The Ian Simpson Award</title>
<p>The Ian Simpson Award acknowledges the most outstanding contributions to clinical psychiatry as assessed through service to patients and to the community.</p>
<p>The 2012 Ian Simpson Award was awarded to Queensland Fellow Dr Frances Dark. Her citation reads:</p>
<p>Dr Frances Dark</p>
<p>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is pleased to present The Ian Simpson Award to Dr Frances Dark, for her outstanding contributions to psychiatry in the areas of psychosocial treatments, state-wide services for deaf people and early psychosis, and for her work with mental health non-government organisations.</p>
<p>Dr Dark is a highly-respected senior Fellow who has made many significant contributions to the promotion of psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia. In recent years she has coordinated the training and introduction of cognitive remediation, CBT, social cognition and interaction training to mental health services across Queensland. Her drive and commitment in leading and developing the State-wide Mental Health Early Psychosis Advisory Group and State-wide Early Psychosis Service ensured the successful implementation of these services.</p>
<p>Dr Dark has worked extensively with patients who are suffering from severe deafness as well as mental illness. She was instrumental in the establishment of an innovative state-wide mental health service for the deaf in 2004, which has greatly enhanced the ability of mental health staff to support this disadvantaged group. Her work and contributions have been greatly valued by the organisations which support deaf people.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Dr Dark has also provided invaluable, ongoing support to other community groups and mental health non-government organisations. Since 2006, Dr Dark has held positions on the Boards of Open Minds, and the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland.</p>
<p>Dr Dark’s enormous contributions over many years to the training of psychiatrists in Queensland and nationally are also noteworthy. It is this combined with her contributions to quality patient care and engagement with the wider community which has earned her the respect of her colleagues. Dr Frances Dark is held in the highest regard both by the College and by her peers, and is a worthy and meritorious recipient of The Ian Simpson Award.</p>
