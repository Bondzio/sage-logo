<p>This recent anthology covers a lot of ground in its twenty-two contributed original chapters, though it may date quickly given how rapidly research is expanding in this broad topic. Consalvo, who teaches communications at Ohio University, and Ess, a professor of philosophy and religion at Drury University in Missouri, have divided their collection into three parts.</p>
<p>The first, “Beyond the Great Divides—A Primer on Internet Histories, Methods, and Ethics,” provides the first five chapters concerned with studying the Internet “through the ages” (have there been that many?); web archiving, Internet methodologies, and the online/offline divide; the Internet in everyday life; and Internet research ethics past and present. These set the stage for what follows.</p>
<p>The second part, “Shaping Daily Life: The Internet and Society,” adds seven more chapters concerning the Internet’s impact on language, Internet policy, political discussion online, impact of the Internet on international development, Internet and health communication, Internet and religion, Indigenous peoples on the Internet, and queer Internet studies. Each of these serves to assess where the field stands “now” (or “then,” given the book’s 2011 publication), reviewing what we know and still need to find out.</p>
<p>And the third, “Internet and Society,” adds a final nine chapters on such topics as community and the Internet, the Internet and virtual worlds, Internet children and youth, Internet and games, social networks 2.0, understanding the changing Internet landscape of media industries, online porn (not as pervasive as many seem to think), music and the Internet, and why and how online sociability has become so central in teenage life. Some of these deal with more controversial topics on which research still differs.</p>
<p>In a sense, this is a large snapshot of a fast-moving target, as many of the specifics presented here will be different in months, let alone years. Still, it’s a very useful snapshot to help provide us with a sense of where we’ve come from, and where such studies may be going.</p>
