<body>
<p>Published as part of a series of “pocket guides to social work research methods,” the <italic>Systemic Synthesis of Qualitative Research</italic>, coauthored by the University of Toronto faculty Michael Saini and Aron Shlonsky, is an original and useful text. Highly suitable for students and faculty alike, the authors clearly explain a research method that is relatively new to social work: the process of synthesizing qualitative studies for the purposes of knowledge advancement and application to practice. As systematic reviews have taken an increasingly important role in social work scholarship and the profession more broadly, this book is both timely and likely to achieve great significance in the field.</p>
<p>The text begins by situating systematic qualitative synthesis in the larger Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) movement. The authors describe the evolution of systematic reviews and the interdisciplinary research networks (i.e., the Campbell Collaboration and the Cochrane Collaboration) that have set standards and guidelines for such reviews to be conducted. Recognizing that the scientific community has long recognized randomized controlled trials as the type of research that can best inform practice interventions, the authors argue that qualitative research also has a rightful place in knowledge production for social work practice, albeit one that may answer different sets of questions. In particular, qualitative research can be very useful in answering questions surrounding client perceptions of and the contextual aspects of interventions.</p>
<p>In Chapter Two, the authors introduce a spectrum of methods used to synthesize qualitative information, ranging from those that quantify themes across studies (i.e., a meta-summary) to methods that are more interpretive and flexible (i.e., meta-ethnography). The choice of method, the authors argue, is largely based on the types of questions that are posed as well as the type of studies that exist. The authors provide a number of relevant examples to accompany their descriptions while readily acknowledging the paucity of information on the relative strengths or weaknesses of these various qualitative synthesis techniques. In the next chapter, the reader is introduced to mechanisms for integrating qualitative research into systematic reviews alongside quantitative research. While mixed methods reviews are evolving in social work and related health science disciplines, particularly in nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512454921">Sandelowski, Voils, &amp; Barroso, 2006</xref>), the main focus of the book is on synthesizing qualitative knowledge and thus this chapter has slightly less relevance to the overall text than those that follow.</p>
<p>Chapters five through seven offer a concrete and user-friendly guide to launching a systematic review of qualitative research. They walk the reader through the process of focusing on a topic of study, selecting articles to review, classifying studies, and summarizing the results. Detailed examples accompany each of these stages. They identify and suggest ways to overcome several challenges involved in finding and combining qualitative findings, including barriers such as nonspecific titles, the methodological variance across qualitative studies, and lack of institutional knowledge about locating qualitative research specifically. Hands on advice about search terms and practical illustrations contribute to the book’s utility as a teaching tool. Perhaps most important in this section, the authors include guidelines on how to assess various aspects of quality associated with a qualitative study, which is a critical component of any systematic review. Here, the authors draw on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512454921">Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref> to establish some common points of appraisal across studies, such as credibility, transferability, and an array of other aspects of rigor associated with qualitative research. A unique aspect of this book is that they describe the Qualitative Research Quality Checklist, an instrument developed by one of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512454921">Saini, 2011</xref>) that offers a standardized way of rating and assessing potential studies for review consideration based on many aspects of quality.</p>
<p>In the last section, Chapters Eight and Nine walk the reader through the process of synthesizing, writing up, and disseminating the review. Here, they emphasize common aspects across synthesis techniques, such as transparency and detailed record keeping. They also provide concrete examples of how to report the results of a systematic qualitative synthesis, both textually and visually, and how to situate the results in a larger discussion to influence practice or policy. Finally, the authors conclude the book with a realistic proposal for a “way forward” in the field of qualitative synthesis and the larger EBP movement. While acknowledging some of the potential barriers advancing qualitative synthesis based on potential resistance from some stakeholders, the authors leave us with a convincing rationale about the importance of this type of knowledge for social work practice.</p>
<p>In considering this text, one should note that while the authors very thoughtfully address potential challenges to the credibility of qualitative synthesis from a more quantitative or traditional EPB perspective, the diverse community of qualitative scholars is also likely to have mixed opinions about how well qualitative studies are suited for synthesis. For example, some scholars may consider qualitative knowledge too inherently reflexive (i.e., dependent on the use of self) to be combined with another scholar’s study on a similar topic. In addition, one might have good reason to challenge the rationale for combining knowledge produced in qualitative studies across methods that are rooted in very different traditions, (i.e., phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory) and that produce varying types of knowledge. For example, in thinking about my own time-intensive and in-depth ethnographic research concerning young men’s experiences of treatment in juvenile correctional facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512454921">Abrams &amp; Anderson-Nathe, 2012</xref>), I have trouble envisioning how my results could be synthesized with a study that was conducted with far less intensive techniques, such as one-time interviews. Thus, I anticipate Saini and Shlonsky’s text may lead to some thorny, although potentially meaningful dialogue about how to appropriately synthesize and make meaning out of information collected from different viewpoints, methodologies, and intended uses.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the authors tackle many practical issues involved in locating and synthesizing a body qualitative research, there is reason to be concerned that these barriers may make qualitative synthesis very difficult to achieve in any one particular set of questions related to social work practice. First, I would surmise that are typically very few qualitative studies in any one area of practice. Moreover, standards for publishing qualitative research vary across journals and disciplines in regard to transparency and methodological detail; making many of Saini’s (2011) assessment points difficult to realistically code and consider for a range of retrievable works. This issue speaks to a larger problem concerning publishing qualitative research, which is the lack of consistent guidelines about what makes a qualitative study rigorous and publishable. As a qualitative scholar, it is my hope that this book will spark meaningful conversation about research and writing quality that can ultimately open up avenues for qualitative research to make a greater contribution to social work scholarship and practice.</p>
<p>In sum, I found this book to be refreshing in several aspects. First, the authors provide a balanced viewpoint about the usefulness of qualitative research in social work practice while still recognizing the need to move forward with knowledge integration and synthesis in order to broaden its impact. Second, the text is notably hands on and user-friendly while still maintaining a high level of intellectual rigor, which can be difficult to achieve in the format of a pocket guide. And finally, the text offers guidelines for assessing the rigor of a qualitative study that will be useful for students and faculty for many purposes, not only the practice of systematic reviews. I have little doubt that this book will make great strides in promoting qualitative synthesis as part of the “family of systematic reviews” and the larger EPB movement.</p>
