<abstract>
<p>Disability scholars have long called for better representations of disability in popular culture, particularly in cinema and television. These pleas have resulted in a robust body of research across multiple disciplines critiquing the portrayal of mental and physical disabilities. Whether producers of popular culture have paid attention to these appeals remains uncertain. This study explores a salient topic in disability discourse, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as presented through a popular television program in the U.S. The findings reveal disembodied portrayals of ASDs that focus on isolation and fear, with more emphasis on familial and societal concern than individual perspectives. These representations stress the anxiety of those perceived to be most affected by the diagnosis rather than the diagnosed individuals themselves and do little to improve upon on portrayals of disability in popular culture.</p>

<p>Music, movies, and television shows—all parts of popular culture—provide representations of salient issues that help people cultivate their personal tastes while developing attitudes and opinions about certain subjects. Depictions of delicate issues are often served up as reflections of societal norms and values, thus partially crystallizing the collective thoughts and fascinations of specific generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912472507">Darke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859912472507">Richardson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859912472507">Tasker &amp; Negra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859912472507">Thomson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Popular culture has incorporated disability representation, particularly in cinema, music, photography, and television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912472507">Bailey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859912472507">Cameron, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859912472507">Chivers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912472507">Hayes &amp; Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859912472507">van Kraayenoord, 2011</xref>). Such efforts have led disability studies scholars to conclude that portrayals of disability have improved but continue to lack meaningful context and truthful constructs that could enhance societal views of disability. Rather, disability narratives continually reflect society’s fascination with the “obviously different” without contextualization, personalization, or experiential considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912472507">1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859912472507">Richardson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This popular-culture creation—one that emphasizes societal reactions to disability rather than allowing discourse from the disabled—offers a perspective skewed toward those who presumed to be affected by disability (e.g., parents, siblings, friends) rather than disabled individuals (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0196859912472507">Shildrick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912472507">Thomson, 1996</xref>). The incorporation of disability into cultural discourse by means of secondary sources, or those without disability, certainly engages an elevated interest in disability but at the risk of alienating those who are actually disabled. This contribution, when disseminated to a large enough audience, can create an illusory image of disability based on cultural expectations that alienate disability and disabled individuals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859912472507">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912472507">Darke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912472507">Thomson 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859912472507">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>This study considers how a popular U.S. television program with a wide reach has portrayed. With a weekly reach of several million, <italic>Parenthood</italic> has captivated audiences since its first season in 2010. The family drama incorporates disability with one of its characters, a young boy who is diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome in Season 1. Asperger’s syndrome is, by clinical definitions, a cognitive disorder diagnosed along the same spectrum as autism and other ASDs. This spectrum has been an area of increasing concern as the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in children continues to rise. While a growing number of parents express anxiety over the prospect of ASDs, self-advocates have contended the diagnosis should be seen less as a disability and more as a diverse part of human makeup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912472507">Broderick &amp; Ne’eman, 2008</xref>). The latter issue has been the source of a fierce ongoing debate, with parents and similar advocates calling for more scientific research into causes, cures, and treatments for ASDs and many self-advocates seeking acceptance and inclusion.</p>
<p>In the midst of such discourse, <italic>Parenthood</italic> presents a chance to engage both sides, working through the show’s characters to holistically explore ASDs. As a key creator of popular culture in the U.S., <italic>Parenthood</italic> is a fairly lasting platform for analysis of how disabilities, particularly ASDs, are being portrayed. What role, if any, are people with ASDs playing in the show’s development and execution? How are ASDs being represented? Have popular-culture creators moved away from society-driven perspectives, or do they continue to rely on traditional and restrictive approaches to disability depiction? Answers to these questions can provide crucial information about the employment of disability in popular culture, and the construction of disability through representations that extend to a large segment of society.</p>
<p>This study examines the way ASDs have been presented to the public through an analysis of <italic>Parenthood</italic>’<italic>s</italic> inaugural season. Drawing on literature arguing that disability is constructed from societal and familial perspectives, and more pointedly that ASDs are most often represented negatively with little regard for personal narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>), the analysis presented here critically explores how <italic>Parenthood</italic> has portrayed ASDs for the viewing public and what those depictions might indicate about today’s popular culture and society.</p>
<sec id="section1-0196859912472507">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The appearance of disability in popular culture is nothing new, and indeed dates back to the late 1890s when it comes to moving images (e.g., cinema, television). Thomas Edison’s 50-second film <italic>The Fake Beggar</italic> portrayed blindness to audiences before the turn of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859912472507">Ivory, 1997</xref>). Most representations such as Edison’s have relied on the dramatization of disability rather than autobiographical explorations. Such methods introduce representations, sometimes metaphorically, of disability that help society interpret and make sense of the unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912472507">Bailey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859912472507">Darke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912472507">Hayes &amp; Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859912472507">Mitchell &amp; Snyder, 2001</xref>). That is to say, because so many people experience so little of disability, they draw on representations presented to them in multiple forms, including popular culture.</p>
<p>A wealth of research has explored these representations through metaphorical or symbolic analysis. In his early works, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912472507">Szasz (1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859912472507">1970</xref>) argued that the metaphor of mental illness is often used to explain “human disharmony,” and society tends to think life would be better without such disruptions. Such thoughts are propagated more by enforcers of disability—those with the training and education to diagnose and treat—and less by the disabled. This is, perhaps, because society finds the digestion of disability easier to cope with when there is some rational, or “normal,” individual constructing meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey (1992a)</xref> noted that the disabled are “socially dead” (p. 54) to society, making the stories of those who care for them seemingly more important. Thus, disability and the lives of the disabled are often told more through the perspective of society and its collective reaction than through the disabled. As such, the existing views of society are frequently grafted onto disability forming misrepresentations that serve to alleviate societal fears while alienating disability.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859912472507">Cumberbatch and Negrine (1992)</xref> observed that the public talks about disability and craves images of disability, but does not want those discussions or those images haunting hallowed popular-culture grounds. That is to say, society tends to view news media coverage of disability or biographical depictions of disability as more acceptable than disability popping up on comedies or game shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859912472507">Cumberbatch &amp; Negrine, 1992</xref>). Thus, disability is acceptable for popular-culture consumption, but only if it fits into societal expectations. Images of disability presented in popular culture become mental representations that transfer into public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912472507">Darke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859912472507">Evans, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859912472507">Richardson, 2010</xref>), and those have tended to be negative over the course of the last several decades. For example, in her dissection of metaphorical illustrations of sickness and disease, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912472507">Sontag (1979)</xref> noted that cancer and tuberculosis, although treatable, were most frequently cast as death sentences. Anyone diagnosed with either illness was in for a hopeless struggle that would darken the lives of those around them, according to the prevailing metaphorical representations of the time.</p>
<p>Such negative attachments have guided disability discourse, promoting a mythical “tragedy of impairment” that helps society keep disability at a safe distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992b</xref>). By attaching meanings of despair, destruction, devastation, and hardship to disability, popular culture at once promotes the salience of disability and fails to fully contextualize it. This ongoing approach inserts disability as abnormal and endangering, signaling the public to stay away from the “freaks” who are unlike them—who are not “normal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992a</xref>).</p>
<p>ASDs have endured similar treatment, with metaphors of disease, epidemic, enemy, and isolation guiding messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912472507">Danforth &amp; Naraian, 2007</xref>). Just as disability representations lean on outsider perspectives, so too have portrayals of ASDs. These have employed parents and siblings for familial illustrations of ASDs, and educators, clinicians, and other medical experts for more clinical explanations. Collectively, the present discourse surrounding ASDs is driven squarely by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick (2010</xref>, p.240) observed as a “non-autistic experience”.</p>
<p>While ASD advocates might argue that any discourse is good discourse, disability scholars have contended that representations of disability and ASDs may be doing more harm than good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912472507">Broderick &amp; Ne’eman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912472507">1992b</xref>). Creators of popular culture who refuse to recognize or incorporate the perspectives of the disabled cast the disabled as unfit for the role. They are portrayed as “creatures” deserving of attention but not of inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992a</xref>).</p>

<title>Labeling ASDs</title>
<p>Such denial of citizenship comes at a particularly pivotal time for ASDs, which continue to capture the public’s fascination. Early in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sparked national concern in the U.S. with a report estimating that as many as one of every 88 children had been diagnosed with an ASD. The report further agitated anxieties, indicating no clear cause for the uptick in diagnoses other than broadening medical definitions of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859912472507">CDC, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Under a clinical definition, ASDs are signaled by delayed or abnormal verbal and nonverbal communication, obsessive behaviors, self-injury, social self-alienation, and a preference for quiet settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859912472507">Howlin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859912472507">Lord &amp; Bailey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0196859912472507">Lord &amp; Rutter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912472507">Williams, 1992</xref>). Public fear over a purported link between a common childhood vaccination and ASDs has caused anxiety in parents who struggle with the best way to keep their children healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859912472507">Gernsbacher, Dawson, &amp; Goldsmith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859912472507">Holton, Weberling, Clarke, &amp; Smith, 2012</xref>). Societal themes—those that emphasize the interaction of science and medicine with society—can help alleviate some of these fears by helping people make sense of complicated health issues. They can also create troublesome environments for the disabled.</p>
<p>Society may have certain predispositions toward individuals with disabilities as noted by ASD individuals who have expressed concerns about discrimination, intolerance, and misinterpretation of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859912472507">Boundy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859912472507">Solomon, 2008</xref>). Stereotypes of ASDs offer little more than self-fulfilling prophecies for self-advocates who argue that popular culture typecast their condition without offering them a voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859912472507">Solomon, 2008</xref>). Perhaps this desire to be heard has helped fuel a rise in self-advocacy, which has grown sharply among internet-based social networks (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Autism-Blog.com">Autism-Blog.com</ext-link>, JoyAutismBlog.com, AdventuresInAutism.blogspot.com).</p>
<p>Behind a strong self-advocacy movement, ASD individuals have begun speaking out against advocacy groups such as Autism Speaks, challenging the dominant narrative of ASDs as disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912472507">Broderick &amp; Ne’eman, 2008</xref>). ASD self-advocates have urged less apprehension and more acceptance, embracing ASD diagnoses as a normal part of individuals’ neurological makeup. This approach, aptly coined “neurodiversity,” argues ASDs should not be defining labels placed on people but rather another in a long line of descriptors—like race or gender—used to characterize individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912472507">Armstrong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912472507">Broderick &amp; Ne’eman, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0196859912472507">
<title>Representations of ASDs</title>
<p>The debate over labeling aside, recent research indicates popular culture may be reinforcing familial and clinical images of ASDs by employing representations of the diagnosis as a disease necessitating preventions, treatments, and a cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>). Through ephemeral inclusions in popular television shows such as <italic>Grey’s Anatomy</italic> and <italic>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</italic>, ASDs are frequently used as “minor diversions, flitting across [people’s] attentions to work in terms of metaphor and analogy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>, p. 46). When an ASD does appear, it is often cast as a catastrophic event—one that forces characters to alter their lives or change their ways of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, the inclusion of ASDs is rarely created by or portrayed through an ASD individual. Personal narratives—those that could offer unique windows into the complexities of ASDs—are relative anomalies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912472507">Grandin (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912472507">Williams (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859912472507">1994</xref>, 2004) have provided personal insights of thoughts, emotions, relationships, sexuality, and interactions with society. These accounts move beyond imagined or familial representations, offering genuine connections to ASDs. They approach the diagnoses from an insider’s point of view, navigating intricacies ignored or misrepresented by metaphors. In short, they fill a gap between cultural understanding and public knowledge.</p>
<p>Yet, they have done little to appease the public’s growing fascination with ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0196859912472507">Murray, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">2008</xref>). Instead, popular-culture producers have fed society’s appetite in measured doses, plugging ASDs into minor roles to create drama and drum up interest. Representations of pity and shame are prevalent, and any sense of empowerment is usually masked by romanticized heroism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859912472507">Moody, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray (2008</xref>, p.4) called these representations “highly artificial” and noted the public’s need for ASDs in extremes—as with the captivating and intriguing savant or the havoc-wreaking disease. This want is often coupled with a sense of connection, explaining why so many ASD narratives emphasize the familial.</p>
<p><italic>Parenthood</italic>, which first aired over 13 weeks from March to May 2010, provided weekly doses of ASD representation in a familial setting. The program reached 7 million weekly viewers in the U.S., indicating a captive audience. By exploring the representations of ASDs employed by <italic>Parenthood</italic>, this study sought to advance the literature in several key ways, affirming existing literature and exploring novel representational devices that may be reaching the public. In considering the inclusion or exclusion of personal narratives, and the tactics used to embody ASDs, this study explores whether portrayals of ASDs are evolving to meet more accurate representations scholars have urged for or whether they are continuing to rely on staid constructs that appease the public at the expense of ASD individuals.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>When searching for representations of disability in society, it is crucial for research to explain how people might interpret images. To make such descriptions, especially when considering television shows and other forms of visual analysis, research cannot afford to simply skim the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859912472507">Norden, 1994</xref>). Rather, methods that allow for the examination of the collective elements of a program (characters, situations, locations, background, etc.) should be employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859912472507">Vande Berg &amp; Wenner, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>One way to achieve such analysis is through repeated observation. This method of uncovering multiple layers and meanings by immersion allows the researcher to offer a “thick description” of the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0196859912472507">Lindlof &amp; Meyer, 1987</xref>). Such analysis includes meanings that might be formulated by observing a subject and also provides detailed descriptions of how and why such meanings are constructed. Thus, results are often paired with analysis and discussion before drawing conclusions.</p>
<p>The findings of this study were drawn through repeated observation of <italic>Parenthood</italic>, which first aired in March 2010 and entered its third season in 2012 as one of NBC’s primetime shows. The hour-long program centers on the expansive family of 41-year-old Adam Braverman and the lives of his siblings. Adam is married to Kristina, a retired legal professional who has helped raise their two children, Haddie, 15, and Max, 8. From the pilot episode onward, Max’s character develops as one with behavioral “problems” that seem to affect his family more than they do him. During the season, Max is diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and subsequently becomes the central focus of several episodes. Because every episode had the potential to include Max and elements of his diagnosis, the primary researcher observed and recorded notes for each of the 13 episodes of <italic>Parenthood</italic> that aired during the inaugural season.</p>
<p>The researcher first watched each of the episodes as they appeared live on NBC’s Wednesday night schedule. Episodes were usually divided into five or six segments with commercial breaks. This observation stage included light note taking with little critical analysis. The second stage of surveillance included watching each recorded episode in sequential order at the end of the season. During this phase, instances of representation and metaphorical device were noted in detail. A third viewing of each episode, this time with deeper attention to the environment surrounding Max (e.g., parent and sibling reactions, background music, and school situations) allowed for more detailed descriptions. The researcher revisited each episode 1 year later, watching and analyzing many segments multiple times. Collectively, the researcher recorded approximately 120 hours of viewing over the course of analysis.</p>

<p>While disabilities have received increased attention in popular culture and related imagery such as charity advertising, inclusion has not necessarily been a positive indicator of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912472507">Waltz, 2012</xref>). Growing self-advocacy movements may help ASD individuals in “crafting their own messages,” but the shift has been slow going (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912472507">Waltz, 2012</xref>, p. 231). This was illustrated quite subtly in first season of <italic>Parenthood</italic>, which began with a pilot episode centered on Max’s perceived unusual behaviors and his parents’ reactions. While beginning with the pilot episode would make logical sense for a chronological analysis, peeling the layers back on the creation of the episode—one that guided the first season—is important given the potential impact of popular-culture creators on the public.</p>

<title><italic>Parenthood</italic>’s Portrayal of ASDs</title>
<p>Popular culture provides timely and topical information to the public, reaching audiences through various streams while deploying visual and auditory tactics that will, producers hope, hold public attention. An individual producer, or a series of producers, often guides this process, providing a presentation that reflects an individualized perception of what an issue is or what it should be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0196859912472507">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>). Such was the case with <italic>Parenthood</italic>, which began with producer Jason Katims.</p>
<p>Katims’s son, who was 13 years old at the time of <italic>Parenthood</italic>’s release, had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. The diagnosis and subsequent personal experiences, Katims said, drove him to develop “stories I would connect with” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859912472507">Autism Speaks, 2010</xref>). Katims added that his son’s condition informed his experience of parenthood, thus allowing him to connect more powerfully with the pilot episode. This individualized narrative—one where Katims is affected by ASDs—drove the development of Max’s character. Thus, the presentation of ASDs is guided by a single personal experience with the diagnosis, reinforcing the producer’s role of mapping individual experience or knowledge onto representations of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859912472507">Darke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912472507">Hayes &amp; Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859912472507">Markotic, 2008</xref>). As constructive as this may be—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray (2008)</xref> observed that personal narratives can help society understand the complexities of disabilities—it does not incorporate perspectives of ASD individuals. This, as several scholars have argued (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912472507">Thomson 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859912472507">1997</xref>), promotes an image of disability based on cultural views and perceptions rather than on lived experiences. Such portrayals are often generated by individuals with certain intentions, whether they be positive or negative, that are driven by a need to guide public attention to certain aspects of a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912472507">Thomson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents of children with disabilities are faced with important situations that many parents might not otherwise encounter, so Katims’ voice is not without merit. However, familial and clinical voices should not be taken for a substitute for informed experience. While this is not uncommon in popular culture, where writers and producers provide constructed realities for the public, it does little to represent disabled voices.</p>

<sec id="section7-0196859912472507">
<title>Creating Max</title>
<p>In the case of <italic>Parenthood</italic>, disability is represented through Max, who is diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome in Episode 2. Previous television programs have incorporated ASDs into single episodes or one-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>), but <italic>Parenthood</italic> wove Max’s diagnosis into all 13 episodes of Season 1. Max appeared prominently in the first three episodes but trailed off as other characters were developed. He played a significant role in at least one segment over each of the final 10 episodes and figured dominantly in four of those.</p>
<p>Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0196859912472507">Young (1991)</xref> observed that the attractive characters are often shown together with less desirable ones to enhance the effect of the disabled’s distance from “normalcy,” Max, too, is created much differently from his parents and his sister. Adam is a handsome, athletic, and successful independent businessman. Kristina is attractive and doe eyed, and their daughter, Haddie, is tall with silky hair and flawless skin. Max, meanwhile, is mop-haired and pale-skinned with a penchant for pirate costumes and untucked shirts, a fascination with beetles, and a detached disposition. He has few friends and rarely engages his peers. Additionally, none of the episodes are told through his perspective but instead emphasize his behaviors associated with Asperger’s syndrome and others’ reactions to him. This approach reinforces the isolation of ASDs, suggesting for the audience Max’s thoughts and emotions might be important and his interactions with society interesting, but his parents and others touched by his diagnosis are the only reasonable voices of his condition.</p>
<p>As the following exploration demonstrates, <italic>Parenthood</italic> is guided by representations that reflect familial responses with little consideration for Max and his voice. Through dominant portrayals of isolation and fear, Max is cast as what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey (1992a)</xref> referred to as one of society’s alienated “creatures.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0196859912472507">
<title>The Isolation of Max</title>
<p>From the beginning, Max is a boy alone. He is not necessarily lonely, because his voice is never promoted so the audience cannot determine that, but he is frequently shown in isolation. In Episode 1, before his diagnosis, Max is shown in his bedroom playing with a large pile of Legos. Adam approaches to talk to him about an upcoming baseball game, but Max keeps his gaze focused on the Legos. Adam lingers for a bit, before leaving Max alone. Later, with Max suited up at his baseball game, his teammates groan at the site of him and keep their distance in the dugout and on the field. In the following scenes, Max wears a pirate costume to school and sits alone among his peers. If the viewer has not picked up on the intended message yet—Max is an outcast—then a late cutaway to Max jumping silently and repeatedly into a muddy puddle in the darkness of night certainly drives the message home.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912472507">Waltz (2008)</xref> noted, representations of ASDs continually play on components of isolation. Whether those are fragmentation, disconnectivity, or disassociation, they do little to promote a true understanding of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912472507">Waltz, 2008</xref>). Rather, they collectively portray ASDs as a set of readily identifiable and overtly bizarre character traits. The choice of Legos over conversation might not be such a strange one for a child, but throw in an exasperated reaction from a parent and suddenly there is cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Episode 1 further sets Max up as an isolated child defined by his oddities and cast aside by society around him. To one classmate he is a “freak.” To his parents, he is an burden. In one scene of Episode 1, Adam calls on his own father, pleading, “There’s something wrong, and I’m gonna need you to help me.” This furthers the alienation of Max, drawing the attention away from him and onto Adam, who chooses to promote his own anxieties over Max’s well-being. In this instance, Adam is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0196859912472507">Young’s (1991)</xref> “glamorously beautiful” character, expressing angst toward the “grotesquely ugly” in Max.</p>
<p>This theme runs throughout the first season. For example, in the opening moments of the second episode, Max tries again to make it to school with his pirate costume on, this time causing an argument between his parents. Making his case against the outfit, Adam says: “He can’t keep going to school like that. Kids are gonna think he’s a freak. How’s he gonna make any friends? I knew kids like that in school. Once you’re a freak, you’re always a freak.”</p>
<p>Playing off that worry—and the representation of isolation—Max struggles to make new friends. To others, Max is the “invisible stranger” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859912472507">Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859912472507">Wolfson &amp; Norden, 2000</xref>). He is unresponsive to greetings from his peers, argues loudly when he does not get his way, and struggles to make friends. This is pointedly illustrated when Adam invites a coworker and his son, David, over for lunch. Despite a lecture in hosting etiquette from his dad, Max cannot resist asking David if he wants to talk about beetles. This seemingly harmless invitation prompts a negative reaction from David, who forces his father to take him home. Kristina later tearfully confesses to Max’s behavioral therapist that he “doesn’t really have any friends.” When he does make progress with a peer, it is with a boy who shares his diagnosis, Noel Lessing. This demonstrates what previous popular culture examples have before: The isolated outcast can only befriend another who is similar or even worse off, as is the case with Noel, who is frequently shown flopping wildly around or running back and forth. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey (1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912472507">1992b</xref>) would argue, the freak can only mingle with other freaks.</p>
<p>Yet, while loneliness and social difficulties may accompany ASDs, they do not define the diagnosis. Through personal observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912472507">Williams (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859912472507">1994</xref>, 2004) pointed out that many ASD individuals seek comfort in others and that relationships are forged through, not in spite of, the condition. Indeed, Max’s condition helps Kristina form a closer bond with Adam’s younger sister, Julia, and a new friendship with Max’s behavioral therapist. But what of Max? While others around him cope with his diagnosis, he is a victim without a voice relegated to the outer bounds of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859912472507">Cameron, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0196859912472507">McCance, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Max’s only moment of relational empowerment occurs in Episode 5. After rejoining the baseball team at the urging of the head coach who “heard about the situation with Max,” he quickly discovers his teammates have been instructed to make plays for him. A fellow player tells him, “You just have to stand there. That’s what coach said.” In the final sequence, Max moves in to make a routine play, shouting for his teammates to back away. When he catches the ball, cheers erupt from the stands and his teammates while background music pipes a playful tune.</p>
<p>This exaggeration of the normal into the abnormal or heroic has long plagued disability discourse. Scholars have argued that depicting individuals with disabilities as “superhuman” for completing otherwise typical tasks undermines the value of their contributions and further isolates them from society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912472507">Kama, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0196859912472507">Silva &amp; Howe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0196859912472507">Stevenson, Harp, &amp; Gernsbacher, 2011</xref>). This argument, combined with Max’s lack of friendships and constructed oddities, punctuates the representation of ASD individuals as isolated and without hope for societal integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0196859912472507">
<title>The Fear of Max and ASDs</title>
<p>Representations of isolation are often coupled with elements of fear such as worry over disease, anxiety about lifestyle changes, and emotional instability. As an example, metaphors of disease have often been used to explain disability, presenting the incurable and the untreatable in ways that society can draw meaning from and, in many cases, develop a fear for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912472507">Sontag, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912472507">Szasz, 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859912472507">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912472507">Waltz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Parenthood</italic> begins navigating this path after illustrating Max’s concerning behaviors in Episode 1. Rather than openly discuss Max’s behaviors with him or with any other family members—something endorsed by ASD individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912472507">Grandin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912472507">Page, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859912472507">Williams, 2004</xref>)—Adam and Kristina seek out and receive an Asperger’s syndrome diagnosis from a prominent therapist. Armed with a label for their child’s behavioral oddities, the Bravermans then set to work defining the abstractness of the diagnosis. This is achieved through the advocate assumption of treatment, whereby a label is needed in order to treat the unfamiliar. For the Bravermans, this means enrolling Max in an alternative elementary school to curb his outbursts at school, hiring an in-house behavioral therapist, seeking treatment information in books and online, placing him on a new reward system, and asking their extended family for help and understanding. Adam and Kristina desperately want a cure to end Max’s troubles, best summarized when Adam says: “I can deal with anything. I can deal with disease, with illness, with a broken bone. Give me something I can fix. I just don’t know how to deal with this. This is for life.”</p>
<p>Individual voices such as proponents of neurodiversity might agree—ASDs are for life. However, the negative association of their condition as a fear-inducing disease would likely be rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>). In fact, there is an element of empowerment fixed with the choice either to embrace the ASD diagnosis as a part of human makeup or to reject it as fuzzy science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912472507">Page, 2009</xref>). <italic>Parenthood</italic> does little to advance this consideration, instead casting the Bravermans as a family faced with a lifetime of uncertain treatments and, as Kristina puts it, cautious potential. Max may have moments of perceived normalcy—for example, a gentle encounter with a young girl at the park—but these are spare gifts that come along a road of treatment and hardship.</p>
<p>Such a presentation disables Max as a character and implies the disabling of ASD individuals. His is a condition of coping without repair, one confounded by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912472507">Waltz (2008</xref>, p. 19) called a “smokescreen of medicalised discourse”. Max is also shielded from the very label his parents sought as evidenced in Episode 12. The Bravermans join up for fundraising walk-a-thon benefiting ASD children, and Max takes an immediate interest. As Max’s enthusiasm grows, Kristina reveals that neither she nor Adam have disclosed his diagnosis to him. “He doesn’t really know that he has anything wrong,” Kristina tells Max’s therapist. “And so it kills me because, sort of, I feel like I’m lying to him by not telling him anything. And he’s just so happy to be a part of this thing.”</p>
<p>Parents often guard their children from “bad news” when it comes to illness, especially when explanations are not readily available and might promote stress or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859912472507">Harpham &amp; Kulikauskas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859912472507">Taylor, 1988</xref>). The Bravermans’ nondisclosure is understandable in that regard but represents the ongoing representation of ASDs as fearful. As diagnoses, they are unwelcome intruders who should be avoided, possibly even ignored, for as long as possible. Yet, Max himself is rarely shown as a “normal” boy. Indeed, emotional and physical outbursts are woven into his character throughout the premiere season of <italic>Parenthood</italic>.</p>
<p>Take this scene from early in Season 1: Max is shown sitting alone at a school desk working with construction paper, markers, and scissors. Unhappy with his creations, he rips and tears uncontrollably at the paper before attacking a classmate who poked fun at him. Expressions of disbelief and fear befall the faces of Max’s classmates and teachers. Citing the safety of Max and other children, school officials later recommend his removal. As they begin to wrestle with the best approach for Max, the Bravermans express their fears. “It’s not just the academics, not just the biting or the pirate costume or the fear of fire or the tantrums,” Kristina tells Adam. “It’s everything. Please don’t make me be alone with this.”</p>
<p>Yet, the majority of Max’s idiosyncrasies are nothing more than inflated characteristics common with many children. A fear of candles becomes a strange phobia, an interest in bugs becomes a deleterious obsession, a lack of emotion becomes a raw indicator of a muted life, and a temper tantrum becomes a lifelong behavioral disorder. By exaggerating traits common to children Max’s age, <italic>Parenthood</italic> preys on the same fears that have driven the recent ASD scare. These representations tell audiences to fear the slightest quirks in their children—to worry when worry is not necessarily warranted. They suggest to society that ASD individuals are a cumbersome bunch with little to offer aside from emotional distress and unending anxiety—all of this while pressing the mute button on ASD individuals, in essence promoting a fear of ASD individuals without ever considering the individuals themselves.</p>
<p>With the audience now following a path that depicts ASDs as unstable—who knows when the biting, the arm flailing, or the argumentative outbursts will take over—a peripheral character surfaces to guide the audience to a pinnacle moment of fear. Adam’s sister, Julia, begins to suspect her daughter, Sydney, may “have what Max has” after a flare-up over a rubber band ball Sydney creates. When faced with losing her ball, Sydney cries out, “Don’t take any of the rubber bands off, please! Because I’ve got them all counted up. Eighteen blue. Fifty-three red. One hundred eighteen brown.”</p>
<p>Rather than dismiss Sydney’s actions as an anomalous outburst, Julia rushes to meet with Kristina and later has Sydney tested by Max’s therapist. This unfounded panic, which turns out to be nothing more than a reflection of Sydney’s “gifted” side, might caution parents against assuming the worst when their children act out. Conversely, it may also reinforce the driving representation of fear, again likening typical childhood behavior to ASDs.</p>
<p>Fear can trace along many lines, including the suggestion of poor outcomes. Rather than contextualize ASDs for audiences, <italic>Parenthood</italic> suggests parents should always be on guard, looking for signs of the condition and acting on them to alleviate the fears they advance. This does little, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912472507">Hevey (1992a)</xref> noted, to alleviate “the issue of social disablement” (p. 52).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859912472507">Baines (2012)</xref> observed, children see themselves in the actions of others. Max would rightly then see the fear in his parents and consider himself the source. But the creators of <italic>Parenthood</italic> steer clear of this approach, casting Max as oblivious to his diagnosis and to the troubling signs his parents present. In fact, in the season’s final episode, when referring to autistic children, Max tells his family that they need to “help those kids,” suggesting he has no connection with his diagnosis or the potential wealth of support from others similar to him. Only the audience is clued in on the secret, and the only perspective they are given is the fear of ASDs conveyed through Adam, Kristina, and the rest of the Bravermans. Collectively, they isolate Max and his diagnosis while representing ASDs as a condition to be feared.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Popular culture has long been dominated by representations of disability, but the exploration of ASDs is relatively new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912472507">Waltz 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912472507">2012</xref>). Given the public’s growing fascination with ASDs, analyzing how they are being presented through popular culture is particularly important. Not only can popular culture direct public perceptions, but also it can provide key information to people as they work through abstract or complex subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912472507">Bailey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859912472507">Tasker &amp; Negra, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This study examined the portrayal of ASDs by a popular U.S. television show, <italic>Parenthood</italic>, finding that the program may be devoting more time to ASDs than previous popular-culture productions. This may partially alleviate what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray (2008)</xref> called a deficit in the longitudinal exploration of ASDs, but it has done so at the risk of alienating ASD individuals and reinforcing misrepresentations about the diagnosis. ASDs, much like disability as a collective, remain difficult to define both clinically and conceptually. As such, popular-culture representations offer an opportunity to help society understand its complexities. Yet, as the findings of this study suggest, they may only be fueling the public’s appetite for fascination without contextualization.</p>
<p>The pilot program of <italic>Parenthood</italic> was developed and produced by a man personally touched by a specific ASD, which is a promising start for the inclusion of individual narratives in conversations about ASDs. As a key producer, Jason Katims, provided insights that were specific to his interaction with ASDs and based on his observations of his son. Illuminating as they may be, these experiences cannot represent the broader range of people affected by ASDs—some 1.5 million people in the U.S. alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859912472507">Dryden-Edwards, 2012</xref>). To accomplish this, the producers of <italic>Parenthood</italic> could have invited ASD individuals to inform the script-writing process. Such voices, which remain confined to the narratives of autobiographies (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912472507">Grandin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912472507">Page, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912472507">Williams, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859912472507">1994</xref>, 2004), could help dispel misleading representations before they are written. They could also provide a window for other perspectives, allowing, for example, advocates of ASDs as neurodiversity to balance current discourse.</p>
<p>Such inclusions could also help dispel isolation and fear by personalizing and contextualizing ASDs in such a way so that the general public could formulate a stronger understanding of what it means to be diagnosed. This approach has the potential to flip ASD diagnoses from negative to positive, allowing ASD individuals to define themselves for society rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>For now, though, producers of popular culture, or producers of <italic>Parenthood</italic>’s premiere season at the very least, continue to urge treatments and cures to assuage their own fears. Receptive audiences, in turn, lose their tolerance for alternative representations and promote dominant attitudes and beliefs through their own discourse. They are often guided to advocacy groups that embrace the disease model and potentially feed off familial fears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912472507">Broderick, 2010</xref>). After all, ASD individuals may be getting older, but the increase in diagnoses remains highest among children. In their worries, parents may rely on popular depictions of ASDs to guide their actions. They may see Max as a window into their own fears, microanalyzing every quirk in their children, living with the constant fear that an ASD may be lurking just around the corner. They may also, as several scholars have pointed out, see ASDs less as a condition to work through with their children and more as a burden they have to suffer through. In this way, ASD individuals are isolated and feared even before they are diagnosed.</p>
<p>Granted, this study focused on the content of <italic>Parenthood</italic> rather than its viewers. Considering such, the representations on <italic>Parenthood</italic> might be taken in a much different way than this study has argued. By illustrating the effect of ASDs on a family over time, representations of ASDs might help ease parental angst and provide a familiar bridge. They might be viewed as alternative outlooks, casting ASDs as empowering, as promising, or as a new life experiences. From them, new meanings might be forged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859912472507">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>), creating realities less reliant on popular culture and more representative of individual considerations.</p>
<p>There are no doubt positive characteristics <italic>Parenthood</italic> and similar popular-culture elements might explore in the future. For example, while Max is often depicted as isolated and unstable around others, he interacts quite well with the bugs he collects. Rather than casting his isolation as a negative trait, <italic>Parenthood</italic>’s creators could have instead explored this as an area of great promise. Perhaps Max’s fascination with insects could help him identify friends who have a similar passion. Greater still, his affinity for bugs could lead him to become a successful entomologist down the road. The point here is that the glimpses of Max provided to the audience do not always need to reinforce the negative nor must they cast him as the occasionally surprising hero. Rather, they have an opportunity to show him as a boy with extraordinary interests and hidden talents who just so happens to have an ASD label. In doing this, they might allow Max to take control of his diagnosis, process it in his own way, and draw strength from his individual uniqueness.</p>
<p>Such representations should, though, be applied with caution. Exchanging one misrepresentation for another is hazardous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912472507">Murray, 2008</xref>). Rather, a balanced illustration that appeases societal fascination with appropriate and insightful context should be among the many goals of advancing disability discourse in popular culture. The depiction of ASDs in popular culture is already well under way, but the path is not yet set. Indeed, other elements of popular culture will no doubt incorporate ASDs. They can draw valuable lessons from <italic>Parenthood</italic>’s pilot season, most notably lending a voice to ASD individuals and allowing representing to sync up with those voices.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In her seminal work, <italic>Illness as Metaphor</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912472507">Sontag (1979)</xref> wrote: “Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place” (p. 3).</p>
<p>Considering Sontag’s words, society would be wise to pick up on the way disability as represented in popular culture. As the literature presented here suggests, disability is a notable part of public fascination, but that enthrallment has clouded an understanding of what it means to be disabled. <italic>Parenthood</italic> is simply a slice of popular culture in the U.S., yet it reaches millions of viewers each week who have their curiosity about ASDs fed through creators who have alienated self-advocates and portrayed ASDs as isolating and fearful. More broadly, the creators have made sure <italic>Parenthood</italic>’s positive effect on the lives of the disabled is limited to an increase in attention. While this approach may increase awareness, it does little to empower the disabled let alone those with ASDs.</p>
<p>This study set out to answer important questions about popular culture’s current portrayal of ASDs, which represent an intriguing component of current disability discourse. Using the first season of <italic>Parenthood</italic>, this study found representations of ASDs as isolation and fear. This study also argued that <italic>Parenthood</italic> did not include personal narratives or self-advocate perspectives, key voices absent from the broader intermingle between popular culture and disability. Much like popular-culture producers before it, <italic>Parenthood</italic> has presented a disability with little regard for those who are most touched by it—the diagnosed. While everyone may at some point experience disability, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912472507">Sontag (1979)</xref> wrote, the findings here suggest producers of popular culture might not yet be ready for such familiarity.</p>

<p>Many self-advocates and their supporters have similarly pushed for a move toward disability-first language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912472507">Armstrong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859912472507">Billington, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859912472507">Harmon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859912472507">Jones, Zahl, &amp; Huws, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0196859912472507">Moore, 2009</xref>). Without engaging the debate between people-first and disability-first language, this study instead relies on the aforementioned and uses the latter as it stresses disabilities less as appendages and more as parts of individual being.</p>
