<abstract>
<p>Today intersectionality has expanded from being primarily a metaphor within structuralist feminist research to an all-encompassing theory. This article discusses this increasing dedication to intersectionality in European feminist research. How come intersectionality has developed into a signifier for ‘good feminist research’ at this particular point in time? Drawing on poststructuralist and postcolonial theory the authors examine key articles on intersectionality as well as special issues devoted to the concept. They interrogate the conflicts and meaning making processes as well as the genealogies of the concept. Thus, the epistemology and ontology behind the ‘intersectional turn’ in feminist theory is the main concern here. The authors argue that the lack of ontological discussions has lead to its very popularity. Intersectionality promises almost everything: to provide complexity, overcome divisions and to serve as a critical tool. However, the expansion of the scope of intersectionality has created a consensus that conceals fruitful and necessary conflicts within feminism.</p>

<p>We do not need a totality in order to work well; quite the opposite. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506813484723">Haraway, ‘The ironic dream of a common language’, 1983</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the last 10 years the use of the concept intersectionality has practically exploded in European and North American gender research. Special issues have been devoted to the concept and it has been celebrated as one of the more important latest interventions in feminist theory. As the American sociologist Leslie McCall points out, ‘feminists are perhaps alone in the academy in the extent to which they have embraced intersectionality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484723">McCall, 2005</xref>: 1771). It has been discussed whether it should be regarded as a common platform for a new ‘paradigm’ that can replace gender research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506813484723">Hancock, 2007a</xref>) or as a ‘nodal point’ for gender researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506813484723">Bilge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2005</xref>). Intersectionality is also increasingly institutionalized within gender studies and has become a standard topic on both graduate and undergraduate courses. Furthermore, the concept has been deployed within politics, and academic articles are published on how to ‘mainstream intersectionality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506813484723">Dhamoon, 2011</xref>), how it is might be relevant in the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506813484723">Verloo, 2006</xref>) and how it can serve as ‘a human rights policy methodology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506813484723">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>: 203). In light of this, one could indeed claim that intersectionality is well on its way to become institutionalized and included in the ongoing bureaucratization of politics.</p>
<p>There are different views and discussions on whether intersectionality should be defined as a ‘theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506813484723">de los Reyes and Mulinari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506813484723">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>), a ‘framework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506813484723">Hancock, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484723">McCall, 2005</xref>), or as ‘politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506813484723">Crenshaw, 1991</xref>), but the concept and the field as such is rapidly growing without any signs of major internal clashes. In this article our endeavour is to examine and discuss the increasing dedication to the concept within feminist studies. We would like to examine how intersectionality has become such a success story and why the concept has developed into a signifier for ‘good research’ in feminist theorizing at this particular point in time. As Norwegian sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Randi Gressgård (2008)</xref> queries, could the terminology perhaps even be too promising? By drawing on international key articles on intersectionality as well as special issues devoted to intersectionality, we examine how the concept has been introduced, articulated and used, primarily in European, but also in North American research. We examine, in particular, the so-called ‘constructivist approach’ to intersectionality. For some of our examples we use the Nordic debate, not only because this is a setting we are familiar with but also because the development of ‘constructionist intersectionality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506813484723">Bilge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506813484723">Prins, 2006</xref>) is, with some important exceptions, particularly apparent in this setting, as well as the consensus-based approach to other feminist positions. It is however our conviction that our examples correspond to a general development concerning other (West) European feminist debates and conflicts.</p>
<p>The aim of the article is to show how the concept has moved from being a sign of threat and conflict to (white) feminism, to a consensus-creating signifier that not only made the concept successful but also enabled an institutionalization of a liberal, ‘all-inclusive’ feminism based on a denial of power as constitutive for all subjects (and non-subjects alike). Writing from a poststructuralist feminist perspective ourselves, this issue will be put in the forefront even though we also briefly consider the liberal appropriation of intersectionality from structuralist and (black) standpoint feminism. In line with this, we also intend to discuss how the concept has functioned within a new European ‘post-race’ feminism. Before we turn to our analytical readings of the proclaimed promises of intersectionality, we give a brief introduction to the development of the concept in order to show how the very concept itself implies a certain ontology that cannot be overlooked without giving cause to theoretical confusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506813484723">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The beginnings of intersectionality</title>
<p>Most scholars locate the starting point for intersectional research to the late 1980s and almost every text on intersectionality refers to the American lawyer Kimberlé Crenshaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506813484723">Crenshaw, 1991</xref>). Crenshaw’s major point was to show how white feminists excluded black women from the feminist movement by setting a white, middle-class agenda and how, at the same time, black women were not fully recognized within the anti-racist movement because of a male bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506813484723">2</xref></sup> Feminist standpoint theorist Patricia Hill Collins was then one of the first to pick up the term, specifically in her writings about nation and the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506813484723">Hill Collins, 1998</xref>). Both Crenshaw and Collins were influenced by American radical black feminist critique and used intersectionality as a metaphor for different sections of power structures interacting, which fitted the general theoretical settings of coherent structuralist ontology.</p>
<p>The metaphor was explicitly filled with other connotations when European feminists, inspired by Crenshaw’s text, adapted the concept to their specific field of research. For them, intersectionality not only referred to a category or a metaphor, it became <italic>a theory</italic> or <italic>a methodology</italic>. One example is sociologist Nira Yuval-Davis, who, probably more than others, has tried to create a complete, theoretical field of research around the concept based on (neo-)Marxism and certain revisions of Nancy Fraser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506813484723">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>). Likewise, in the Nordic context, historian of economy Paulina de los Reyes, cultural geographer Irene Molina and sociologist Diana Mulinari introduced the concept in 2002 as an important part of their critique of hegemonic white/Nordic feminism and its blindness to race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506813484723">de los Reyes and Mulinari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506813484723">de los Reyes et al., 2002</xref>). The preferred ‘intersecting categories’ for these researchers are class, gender and race since they are assumed to be more than ‘merely cultural’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506813484723">3</xref></sup> In their approaches, de los Reyes et al., as well as Yuval-Davis, present a structuralist ontology close to American black feminism with a realist idea of mapping intersections in relation to social positions and possible emancipation. It is hence possible to deduct that intersectionality from the very beginning was a concept deeply dependent on structuralist standpoint feminism. The idea to expand it and fit it to other feminist positions came later on and was carried out by other researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1350506813484723">
<title>The expansion of intersectionality</title>
<p>Most articles dealing with the trans-Atlantic journey of the concept describe this same rooting within structuralism (black feminism, especially) in geographical terms, where the US context is named ‘structuralist’ and the UK/European ‘constructivist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506813484723">Christensen and Siim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506813484723">Knapp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506813484723">Phoenix and Pattynama, 2006</xref>: 188; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506813484723">Prins, 2006</xref>). Geography is, however, not enough to explain the different turns the concept has made over the last decade. As already seen, European-based Yuval-Davis, Mulinari et al. adhere to the structuralist context, and the aforementioned text by American sociologist Leslie McCall is one of the most central ‘constructivist’ texts. McCall, though, has a more ambitious project: she intends to expand the scope of intersectionality by way of establishing intersectionality as common ground for <italic>all</italic> feminist research. In her terminology, gender research can be categorized into three approaches to complexity: intercategorical, intracategorical and finally, anticategorical. She writes that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Since my primary goal is a substantive one – to <italic>expand research on intersectionality</italic> – all other philosophical and methods-related issues are important only to the extent that they impede or facilitate this goal. … My emphasis instead is on the <italic>convergence</italic> of several interrelated but analytically separate developments that led to the current mode of research on intersectionality. … for now it is important that some <italic>similarities</italic> in the positions of all three groups compounded and reinforced the conflation of the anticategorical and the intracategorical approaches into a single widely received approach. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484723">McCall, 2005</xref>: 1774–1776, our emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>More specifically, her project is to include those theories that are not <italic>explicitly</italic> intersectional and thereby to expand the scope of what is included into intersectionality studies. In line with McCall, Nordic feminist scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Nina Lykke (2005)</xref> also strives towards, what she calls, a ‘broader understanding of intersectional thinking’. For this purpose, she criticizes, e.g. bell hooks’ genealogy of intersectionality for not acknowledging European feminists’ inclusion of class in the 1970s, since this implies that those feminists did, indeed, ‘<italic>think</italic> intersectionally’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2005</xref>, our emphasis). It is hard not to see this prolongation of intersectionality into a white feminist past as an attempt to clear this same feminism from a compromising history. This expansion of the intersectional genealogy into a white, European feminism also ignores critique from feminists who had migrated to Europe long before the 2000s. As for example Yuval-Davis points out, she and Floya Anthias provided a critique of the ‘triple oppression’ already in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506813484723">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>: 194). An interesting effect of Lykke’s genealogy, hence, is that the serious criticism from marginalized feminist groups from all over the world (black, lesbian, colonized) in the 1970s and 1980s, paradoxically, is reduced by only being acknowledged as examples of ‘intersectional thinking’ alongside white and heterosexual feminist ‘intersectional thinking’.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, this quite un-Foucauldian idea that ‘intersectional thinking’ predates the concept intersectionality runs the risk of emptying the concept of specificity and content by replacing it with a universalizing allegory for ‘thinking in more than one dimension’. Even though Lykke does acknowledge the difference between ‘explicit use of the concept’, ‘implicit use’ and ‘intersectional thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2005</xref>), there is no argumentation for or problematization of the need to universalize this very specific word. Rather, Lykke admits to desiring a feminism united around intersectionality as a ‘common nodal point, i.e., a coherent framework for how to conceptualize different phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2005</xref>: 9), including any feminism that ‘thinks intersectionally’, which according to Lykke is any feminism that adheres to the idea of power being more than one-dimensional.</p>
<p>American sociologist Kathy Davis’s perspective is close to Lykke’s, in the sense that she believes in intersectionality as a nodal point that brings ‘two of the most important strands of feminist thought’ together:
<disp-quote>
<p>While intersectionality is most often associated with US Black feminist theory and the political project of theorizing the relationships between gender, class, and race, it has also been taken up and elaborated by a second important strand within feminist theory. Feminist theorists inspired by postmodern theoretical perspectives viewed intersectionality as a welcome helpmeet in their project of deconstructing the binary oppositions and universalism inherent in the modernist paradigms of Western philosophy and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506813484723">Phoenix, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506813484723">Brah and Phoenix, 2004</xref>). Critical perspectives inspired by poststructuralist theory – postcolonial theory (Mohanty, 1988; Mani, 1989), diaspora studies (Brah, 1996), and queer theory (Butler, 1989) – were all in search of alternatives to static conceptualizations of identity. Intersectionality fit neatly into the postmodern project of conceptualizing multiple and shifting identities. It coincided with Foucauldian perspectives on power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506813484723">Davis, 2008</xref>: 70–71)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What Davis’s genealogy does not answer is the question why poststructuralists supposedly ‘were all in search of alternatives to static conceptualizations of identity’. Neither does she answer how the emancipatory project of the first strand of intersectionality researchers fit into the ‘Foucauldian perspectives of power’. Poststructuralism is, after all, already an ‘alternative to static conceptualizations of identity’ and one specific theory of power as complex is seldom reducible to another specific theory of power as complex.</p>
<p>This expansion of the concept thus creates theoretic confusion in more than one way: not only is the historization of the concept somewhat apprehensive, but the attempt to reformulate intersectionality (with its structuralist rooting) to fit into poststructuralism is also quite imprecise. Danish feminist researchers Dorthe Staunæs and Dorthe Marie Søndergaard quite early on tackled the same project as McCall and Lykke, and argued for ‘adjusting’ (<italic>justera</italic>) the concept intersectionality to a poststructuralist frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506813484723">Staunæs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506813484723">Staunæs and Søndergaard, 2006</xref>). Poststructuralism can here be discerned as mainly associated with terms such as ‘subjectivity’, ‘doing categories’ and ‘lived experience’, and treated as a counter-weight to a structural ‘macro-perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506813484723">Staunæs, 2003</xref>: 103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2005</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506813484723">Christensen and Siim, 2006</xref>: 33) The main reason to introduce poststructuralism to the more structuralist tradition of intersectionality, they claim, is to provide the opportunity for a balanced combination of perspectives by shifting between ‘structure’ and ‘individual life’. In these texts social constructivism is repeatedly used as synonymous with poststructuralism, ignoring the feminist critique of social constructivism from, among others, Judith Butler or Elizabeth Grosz (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506813484723">Butler, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506813484723">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506813484723">Grosz, 1994</xref>), as well as the obvious connection with post-Marxism. The fact that poststructuralism was never about singling out an actor (and even less an ‘individual life’) in relation to a structure, or subjectivity in relation to politics, but rather to implode such dichotomies, or at least to understand their political genealogy and impact, is not considered. Rather, what we find here repeatedly are quite traditional, and unproblematized, humanist ideals of pluralism and emancipation – ideas perhaps more appropriately attributed to classic liberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506813484723">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the structural ‘rooting’ of the concept, intersectionality has thus today become a platform or been articulated as a common ground for all feminisms – structuralist, liberal and poststructuralist alike. As Ann Phoenix and Pattynama have noted, intersectionality has become a ‘catch-all phrase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506813484723">Phoenix and Pattynama, 2006</xref>: 187). As studies on fast travelling concepts have already pointed out, sometimes popularity and ‘all-inclusiveness’ is guaranteed through theoretical vagueness rather than by specificity and explicit limits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506813484723">Knapp, 2005</xref>). We believe it is precisely this dream of a common language – this inclusion, and its less visible exclusions, that calls for analysis. We therefore focus on the endeavour to include what McCall names the ‘anticategorical’, Lykke ‘indirect intersectionality’ and Davis ‘postmodernist’ in intersectionality research. More specifically, we want to understand and discuss why this has happened at this point in time in feminist research and by what forceful reduction all feminisms are included in the field of intersectionality? What answers, to what questions/problems, have been found in this concept?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1350506813484723">
<title>The promise of complexity</title>
<p>By study how scholars describe what it means to use the concept and what it promises to deliver, we have been able to discern some recurrent central themes. First of all, intersectionality promises to be <italic>new</italic>. It is in some cases proclaimed to be a ‘rich intervention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic>, 2009</xref>), to constitute a ‘new method/methodology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484723">McCall, 2005</xref>), as a ‘potential for new feminist agendas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506813484723">Brah and Phoenix, 2004</xref>) and in other cases regarded as a ‘new perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506813484723"><italic>KKF</italic>, 2010</xref>: 5). Intersectionality is furthermore presented as having the potential to capture ‘the <italic>complexity</italic> in social life’, and provide ‘multilevel models’. According to McCall, all intersectional approaches ‘attempt to satisfy the demand for complexity’ and ‘explore the complexity of intersectionality in social life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506813484723">McCall, 2005</xref>: 1773). This is seen as offering a way to overcome unitary and exclusionary approaches in both academic and political feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506813484723">Hancock, 2007b</xref>: 67). In the <italic>European Journal of Women Studies</italic> the editors claim that:
<disp-quote>
<p>As such, it [intersectionality] foregrounds a richer and more complex ontology than approaches that attempt to reduce people to one category at a time. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic>, 2006</xref>: 187)</p>
<p>… it [intersectionality] facilitates a form of feminist enquiry that aims to, and is capable of capturing the complexity and multiplicity of axes of oppression. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic>, 2009</xref>: 207)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the aim is articulated as capturing complexity to offer a more fine-tuned way of representing the world. Another similar example of this tendency can be found in the editorial of <italic>Politics and Gender.</italic> Here the concept is announced to be the best way of representing reality:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the same time, viewing gender as a stand-alone factor necessarily distorts reality. Gender never operates independently from other aspects in political life, so it is misleading to think of gender as an autonomous category of analysis. … The integrated, mutually constitutive nature of identities is the central premise of <italic>intersectionality</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506813484723"><italic>Politics and Gender</italic>, 2007</xref>: 229)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Those sceptical of intersectionality are here defined as researchers who only want to analyse one category (or just add categories together – a much criticized approach among all intersectionality researchers, but hardly ever illustrated with a reference). This pictures a schism between only two possible approaches: the ‘one category’-approach (of radical feminism) and the nuanced, multifaceted intersectional-approach. The only defined ‘enemy’ of intersectionality in this discourse, then, is the feminist who believes only gender is relevant for a feminist analysis. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Gressgård (2008)</xref> points out, this search for complexity falls close to a positivist research agenda that aims to map out the world and hence ignores that ‘we cannot have complete knowledge of complex systems; we can only have knowledge in terms of certain frameworks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Gressgård, 2008</xref>: 5). In Gressgård’s reading, the understanding of complexity within intersectionality literature is closely associated with a realist approach, perhaps even implicating ‘complicated’ rather than ‘complex’. Something is complicated ‘when the task of predicting its behavior presents a difficulty due to incomplete information … but when in principle it is possible to explain and understand it by extending a simple, fundamental model’ (Greco, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Gressgård, 2008</xref>: 9). In this sense, one could say that intersectionality researchers are indeed (still) adding categories to each other, extending one simple model in search of incomplete information ‘as if a more difference-sensitive, sophisticated scheme could solve the crisis of representation or the problem of categorization all together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Gressgård, 2008</xref>: 5).</p>

<p>In this list of names, however, there are no scholars who are known for arguing against intersectionality; instead they all argue for the usefulness of the concept and provide different ideas on exactly how intersectional analysis should be conducted, not <italic>if</italic> it should be conducted. The critical effort rather seems to be a sort of pseudo-criticism, focusing on issues like ‘travelling concept and transformation’, ‘revisiting intersectionality’, ‘additive tendencies’ and ‘missing elements and how they can be included’. The editorial to the special issue on intersectionality in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic> (2006)</xref> also asks:
<disp-quote>
<p>Why are so many feminists <italic>both attracted to, and repelled</italic> by intersectional analysis? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic>, 2006</xref>: 187, our emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editorials to both special issues on intersectionality in <italic>Kvinder, køn og forskning</italic> states that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The focus in the discussions [on intersectionality] are often for or against. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506813484723"><italic>KKF</italic>, 2006</xref>: 3, our translation)</p>
<p>Intersectionality is an open and contested concept. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506813484723"><italic>KKF</italic>, 2010</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We are curious: who is being repelled? Who is against? In what way is intersectionality a contested concept? In all the special issues and anthologies we have examined there is no such contestation going on, it is only stated that there are conflicts, but without any references to such debates. Even feminist positions <italic>outside</italic> the field of intersectionality are treated as compliant with the ideals and promises of intersectionality as long as these positions do not claim gender to be the only necessary category of analysis (which no one does). To paraphrase Sara Ahmed’s critique of the ‘critical’ in critical whiteness studies, the declaration appears to be ‘non-performative’ in the sense that it does not perform what it declares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506813484723">Ahmed, 2004</xref>). Even when intersectionality research claims to be essentially critical of its own project and ideal, this critique never takes place and instead the bulk of intersectionality literature is very much characterized by consensus on this specific issue. Indeed, it can probably be argued in line with Ahmed that intersectionality research constitutes itself as a field <italic>through</italic> these non-performative utterances.</p>
<p>There are many such ‘unhappy performatives’ in the discourse on intersectionality: one apparent example is Lykke’s recurrent invitations to critical debate, where critique turns out to be welcome only if it adheres to intersectionality as a ‘nodal point’. However, the very term nodal point derives from poststructuralist theorists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506813484723">Laclau and Mouffe (1985)</xref> to designate what happens to a floating signifier (in this case ‘feminist theory’) when it is given meaning within a hegemonic discourse (‘intersectionality’). According to Laclau and Mouffe, to endorse a nodal point is to exclude any discourse that refuses to believe in this nodal point as a point of reference – a strange metaphor, then, for a supposedly all-inclusive feminism.</p>
<p>Another discussion, passing off as criticism, is how (not) to use intersectionality as a metaphor and whether it is a theory, a method, a perspective, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506813484723">Staunæs and Søndergaard, 2006</xref>). In the articles and books we have gone through we have only been able to find three articles that present a critical view on intersectionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506813484723">Carbin and Tornhill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506813484723">Egeland and Gressgård, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506813484723">Gressgård, 2008</xref>). This lack of criticism is not caused by us defining ‘critical’ in a limited way that suits ‘our’ approach to intersectionality; by ‘critical’ we simply mean that the author asks <italic>if</italic> intersectionality is the only solution to the problems it claims to solve. It is this if-question that we define as necessary for a <italic>critical</italic> approach, no matter if the final answer is affirmative or negative. But, paradoxically, intersectionality research is instead articulated as critical while marginalizing both current and past criticism and conflicts.</p>
<p>The same lack of discussion can be discerned concerning the implications of the broadening of categories and theories, as well as explicit confrontations concerning different ontologies and key notions such as agency, power or resistance. Such discussions and debates, we believe, are important and crucial for the understanding of any field, since they provide the possibilities to position oneself as either inside or outside this field, or as either positive or critical (from within or from outside). Such confrontations and definitions within a field present an open position from which one speaks, instead of a hidden or assumingly neutral or inconsequential one. Since we could not find any such criticism in our search for the promise of intersectionality, we have instead been forced to search for <italic>traces</italic> of conflicts and analyse this lack of debate on ontological and theoretical issues and differences rather than any explicit positioning and border-setting.</p>

<title>The promise to overcome divisions</title>
<p>Almost all texts we have analysed bear such ghostly traces of conflict; conflicts and critique between structuralist and poststructuralist feminism, black feminists and white feminists, postcolonial feminism and western feminism are discernible. However, in many cases these debates, based on long-term struggle, critique and different opinions concerning ontological and epistemological issues, are not articulated as <italic>conflicts</italic>, but instead regarded as ‘differences’, ‘divisions’, ‘different strands’, ‘different versions’ or ‘perspectives’, and as being ‘kin-related’, as if they could be combined, ‘conjoined’, in one single entity called intersectional feminism. Somehow, conflicts seem to be foreclosed, while the dream of a united feminism is revived. However, calling a conflict a ‘division’ is not an innocent synonym; it provides for the metaphor of bridging, where intersectionality is the bridge that can help feminists overcome divisions, here defined in various terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>It [intersectionality] proposes ways to overcome divisions in feminist theory, for example those between systematic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506813484723">Collins 1998</xref>) and constructivist approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506813484723">Phoenix and Pattynama 2006</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506813484723"><italic>KKF</italic>, 2010</xref>: 4)</p>
<p>… the debates and opinions about the power and utility of thinking and working ‘intersectionality’ ranged quite broadly. Among the strengths were statements about the necessary reorientation in perspective that thinking ‘intersectionality’ requires because it involves thinking simultaneously at level of structures, dynamics and subjectivities; that it conjoins rhetorics of ‘voice’ and presence and rhetorics of discourse and institutional form. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506813484723"><italic>EJWS</italic>, 2009</xref>: 207)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Intersectionality, by becoming the very nodal point of feminism, will hence overcome divisions within feminism by linking two analytical levels – variably named ‘systematic approach and constructivist approach’; ‘structures and subjectivities’; or ‘rhetorics of voice/presence and rhetorics of discourse and institutional form’. But since poststructuralism was a response and revision of structuralism where the binarism between structure and agency was questioned and completely replaced with a theory of subjectification (assujétissement) it makes no sense to frame the division as standing between levels of ‘structure’ and ‘subjectivity’, or ‘voice’ and ‘discourse’, as if structure was synonymous with discourse and subjectivity with voice. This can only be done if you side-step the poststructuralist critique of structure vs agency and power vs freedom. Instead of accepting this difference (or conflict) between two ontologies, poststructuralism here seems to have been appropriated and translated into structuralist terminology so that a problem between a poststructuralism that supposedly only deals with the symbolic and representations and a structuralism that struggles to ‘capture the voice’ of ‘concrete’ individuals could be formulated. In other words, with the advent of intersectionality, the problem that poststructuralism pointed out a long time ago (structure vs agency does not work) was more or less hijacked, but the terms were scrambled around and, paradoxically, resulted in a critique of poststructuralism for not having worked on this problem. Why this lack of acknowledgement of an already existing feminism that has worked with issues of power in more than one dimension, but with a different ontological framework?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506813484723">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>The ghost of poststructuralist feminism</title>
<p>In the late 1990s academic feminism was almost exhausted by the discussions on difference and identity. As Robyn Wiegman wrote in 2000: ‘academic feminism finds itself so deeply troubled about the internal dynamics of “difference” that women’s very incommensurabilities with one another serve as one of the most powerful forces narrating feminism’s apocalyptic end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506813484723">Wiegman, 2000</xref>: 808). One could in line with Wiegman say that the self-identical feminism was in a state of crisis. Wiegman defines this threatened and apocalyptic feminism as equating itself with ‘continuity, history, and origin. Such equations make feminism’s own history a story of maternal order and generational succession, thereby reproducing a model for feminist subjectivity that requires it to be self-identical across time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506813484723">Wiegman, 2000</xref>: 809). She points out how attempts to reconcile critique of this feminism can lead to a situation in which ‘[t]he apocalyptic is thus countered by a critical imaginary that seeks inclusion in order to lose nothing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506813484723">Wiegman, 2000</xref>: 815).</p>
<p>Poststructuralist feminism is not coincident with women’s subjectivities and therefore requires a politics that could not be recognizable within the self-identical frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506813484723">Wiegman, 2000</xref>: 822). As a school of theory that can be found outside the frames of feminist writings, and requiring a reading list including continental philosophy and Lacanian psychoanalysis, it is very much a non-identical feminism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506813484723">6</xref></sup> It is also an ambitious theory, trying to take up not only the matter of power in a self-critical way, but also the very matter of matter – questions not asked by structuralist or social constructivist feminists (and only recently appropriated by the school of New Materialism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506813484723">7</xref></sup> With feminist theorists such as Judith Butler, Gayatri Spivak or Elizabeth Grosz, matter seemed to come back in the forms of sex, sexuality and race – concepts many academic feminists were quite uncomfortable using and discussing. All put together, this period was probably a confusing time for feminists who had struggled to introduce the concept of gender to be able to avert biologist and essentialist ontologies. Thus, we believe that at the time intersectionality was introduced, feminism was most probably haunted by the ghost-of-the-future named poststructuralism; a ghost that not only enforced the sense of apocalypse, but also opened up for intersectionality as a way to save a self-identical feminism.</p>
<p>Given this, it is interesting to note how intersectionality today is legitimized by including scholars such as Judith Butler, Beverly Skeggs, Wendy Brown or Gayatri Spivak in ‘intersectional literature’. And this even when these very scholars are explicitly (or otherwise obviously) critical of the field. Wendy Brown, for example, writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Insofar as subject construction does not take place along discrete lines of nationality, race, sexuality, gender, caste, class, and so forth, these powers of subject formation are not separable in the subject itself. These powers neither constitute links in a chain nor overlapping spheres of oppression; they are not ‘intersectional’ in their formation (Kimberlé Crenshaw), … There is not as Judith Butler recently remarked first gender and then the apparatus that regulates it; gender does not exist prior to its regulation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506813484723">Brown, 2005</xref>: 123–124)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In an interview, Beverly Skeggs is asked about her opinion on intersectionality. She answers: ‘when people say that we need the intersectional gesture to include race, class, gender, and everything else, what it usually means is to think about these things which exclude understandings of the relationship to the capitalist system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506813484723">Skeggs, 2008</xref>: 41). In a sense, the inclusion of scholars such as Wendy Brown and Beverly Skeggs has thus made it possible to <italic>not</italic> relate to this and other criticisms, because if intersectionality researchers were to relate to the criticism, it would become clear that not every feminist who has used terms like class or ethnicity together with gender can be labelled an intersectionality researcher.</p>
<p>It may be that poststructuralism, as it is defined within intersectionality research, is rather used as a general symbol of a multidimensional, nuanced and complex view on power; a perspective that brings to the fore concepts such as differences and complexities, and therefore thought of as somehow needed within the field. Yet, the basic premise of poststructuralism is missing in this inclusion: that of the fundamental impossibility of accurately representing the world. It is as if those very elements of poststructuralism – its ontology – are overlooked and only the empty signifier (along with some key terms) is included in the intersectionality field. That which remains outside the field is left on its own, without any possibility of ‘talking back’ to the appropriator, not without being classified as either already-included or as an obsolete ghost from the past.</p>

<title>The ghost of black feminism</title>
<p>But perhaps the success of intersectionality does not only stem from the anxiety caused by poststructuralism; similar relations between heterosexual feminism and queer critique, or liberal, middle-class feminism in relation to Marxist critique can also be discerned. As Gudrun Axeli Knapp notes, there was in the beginning of the 2000s a growing fear ‘of a lessening social relevance of gender and a crisis of feminist theory altogether’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506813484723">Knapp, 2005</xref>: 256). Rumour had it that gender would be overshadowed by multiculturalism or race/ethnicity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2003a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506813484723">8</xref></sup> Knapp notes that the introduction of race-class-gender was accompanied with certain ‘irritation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506813484723">Knapp, 2005</xref>: 250). The sense of threat was not only present in academic circles in Western Europe but also in the US. As late as 2008, Kathy Davis concludes that:
<disp-quote>
<p>However tarnished the ideal of inclusivity has become, feminist theory still needs a theoretical and normative platform if it is not to disappear altogether. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506813484723">Davis, 2008</xref>: 71)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The risk that gender, gender studies and feminist theory would disappear was seen, perhaps not as an immediate threat, but at least as a potential one. In our reading it represents another apocalyptic threat that produced yet another ghost that haunted European feminism in the beginning of the 2000s: the ghost of black feminism, or, as it was named in the Nordic countries: postcolonial feminism. Feminists inspired by both black feminism and postcolonial criticism were part of a strong critique of white-centred feminism incapable of handling debates on race, ethnicity and migration (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506813484723">de los Reyes et al., 2002</xref>). At the time, this critique, however, seemed to have been met by harsh resistance from some of the established feminist researchers who defended the idea of gender as the prime category to understand inequality, but at the same time refused to see their own feminism as racialized, and even racist. In the Nordic countries this debate was public and heated: one side accusing the other for splitting the feminist movement and the other one for being blind to racism and ignoring the situation of immigrant women in relation to issues of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506813484723">Carbin, 2010</xref>: 14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1350506813484723">9</xref></sup> It is right after such a debate, springing from a traumatic murder of a young immigrant woman (a so-called honour killing), that Lykke claims to introduce intersectionality as a way to overcome this particular division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506813484723">Lykke, 2003a</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>In their response, Mulinari and de los Reyes point out the obvious: they had already introduced the concept one year earlier and it is clear that Lykke uses it not only without giving them credit but they also believe she introduces it for a different reason:
<disp-quote>
<p>As opposed to Lykke, who wants to use the concept intersectionality from a meta-feminist position to solve the schism between two feminist fractions, we are interested in making visible and challenging power relations that in different temporal and spatial settings create, articulate, and reproduce inequality and submission. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506813484723">de los Reyes et al., 2003</xref>: 160, our translation)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Here the schism is not only acknowledged, but extended into the very discussion itself. However, this is the only mentioning of the conflict; in later articles on intersectionality all researchers – here positioned as opposed to each other – inscribe each other into the same field. There is therefore, we believe, more to the story than a simple strategy for consensus. There is also anxiety and affect: anxiety from white feminists about how to handle these non-white feminists with strange accents and non-European pasts that ‘suddenly’ started to talk to them, and affect from those feminists who tried to make themselves recognizable <italic>as</italic> feminists within an ethnically homogenic field of feminist research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1350506813484723">10</xref></sup> By including intersectionality in a European white feminism, the radical criticism from black feminism seems almost to have turned into a way – to paraphrase Spivak – for white feminists to save black feminists from black feminism. Black feminism’s contribution to intersectionality research is, for example, routinely defined as that of ‘theorizing the relationships between gender, class, and race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506813484723">Davis, 2008</xref>: 70). Even here we can find an erasure of one of the central political aims with black feminism – that of making hierarchical and problematic relations within feminism visible. In this sense, intersectionality can provide a way to cover up a conflict, while at the same time recognizing the importance of (the less critical parts of) black feminism and postcolonial feminism.</p>
<p>A broadening of the concept, and, most importantly, of the analytical categories, provided a possibility to ‘think intersectionally’ together, no matter our (many and, for some, embarrassing) differences. Intersectionality, then, promised a common ground where we could all talk about gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. without either neglecting or being neglected, leaving the old conflicts, the awkwardness and the guilt behind. It is as if intersectionality as a term makes it easier to talk about differences. This may serve as a relief to some feminists, but it also offers most self-identical feminists at least one category that they feel more comfortable to talk about and identify with. Especially if even more categories are introduced, where each ‘etc.’ always opens up a possibility for each individual feminist to feel both less anxiety and less affect. But in all those cases, it is still a feminism that requires self-identification and is hence based on foundationalist ontologies.</p>
<p>From this perspective, intersectionality arrived ‘just in time’ to preserve both a unifying history and a guarantee for a recognizable future (still filled with women of some kind). In other words, intersectionality could save an otherwise disappearing field of gender studies and at the same time, provide the field with a progressive way of doing feminist analysis. Thus, gender could paradoxically be saved as the most important category for feminist research, despite or because of listings such as ‘gender, race and class’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1350506813484723">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions: Intersectionality as a consensus-creating signifier</title>
<p>Today intersectionality is no longer just a metaphor. It is presented as <italic>the</italic> feminist theory. As has been shown here, however, it is a theory that provides us with an ontology of neither the subject nor power. Intersectionality has foremost become successful precisely because it does not meet these requirements of a theory and hence ‘everyone’ feels that it fits ‘their way of doing research’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1350506813484723">12</xref></sup> Anyone can recognize themselves in (at least) one of the categories provided by intersectionality, making it a profoundly self-identical feminism that closes off not only other futures, but also those feminisms that refuse such a self-identical project. Intersectional feminism, and maybe especially its constructivist version, we fear, has come to signal a liberal consensus-based project (that ignores capitalism as oppressive structure) in an increasingly neoliberal and conservative European context. Just as liberalism forecloses tensions and critique by subscribing to values that are so generalized that no one can be against them (democracy, equality, freedom, human rights, etc.), all feminists agree with sentences like ‘social positions intersect’, ‘categories are intertwined’ or ‘power relations are complex’. In the same way as liberalism passes itself off as non-political, such sentences seduce the feminist reader into a discourse where opposition is made impossible, a discourse that claims the obvious (‘everything relates’) as belonging to one specific feminist theory, now named ‘intersectionality’. Intersectionality, even though intended as a critical concept and derived from a much needed feminist intervention, has thus been successful through the lack of ontology, and this lack has in some cases led to a diminishing of the explicitly structuralist (Marxist) ontology of black feminist but also a de-legitimization of a poststructuralist (post-Marxist) ontology that does not share this dream of a common feminist language. What we have found within the field of intersectionality, then, is not only a refusal to deal with and engage in feminist theories, and especially poststructuralist, postcolonial and other anti-foundationalist ontologies, but a refusal to recognize that these feminisms cannot and should not be included in the field of intersectionality.</p>
