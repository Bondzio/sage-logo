<p><italic>Karl Barth and American Evangelicalism</italic></p>
<p>Bruce L. McCormack and Clifford B. Anderson, editors</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011. 387 pp. $38.00</p>
<p>This superb collection of essays was presented at the 2007 conference at Princeton Theological Seminary exploring the dialectical “friend–foe” relationship of American evangelical theology toward Karl Barth. Since most authors in the book have either written extensively on Barth or appreciatively engage with him as a dialogue partner, this volume will most likely find readership among Barth scholars or evangelicals who have a favorable view of Barth’s theology. The book is divided into three parts: (1) historical analysis set in motion by Cornelius Van Til’s blistering criticism of Barth in his 1946 book, <italic>The New Modernism: An Appraisal of the Theology of Barth and Brunner</italic>; (2) theoretical explorations into the topics of Kant’s legacy, christology, ecclesiology, and election/universalism; and (3) discussions about areas of interest shared by both Barth scholars and evangelicals such as post-liberalism, the theologies of John Milbank (Radical Orthodoxy), and Stanley Hauerwas as well as the Emergent church movement. The book also includes an instructive introduction and conclusion by the editors.</p>
<p>The opening essays by George Harink and D.G. Hart frame the historical structure of the book by contextualizing Van Til’s emerging criticism of the “neo-modernist” Barth within the events before, during, and after the 1929 split in Presbyterianism, when J. Gresham Machen and Van Til left Princeton and formed Westminster Seminary and eventually the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. These essays demonstrate how Barth was seen, particularly in Van Til’s view, as the catalyst igniting the intra-Presbyterian conflict and life and death struggle over the future of Reformed theology. Although Van Til’s narrow neo-Calvinist critique of Barth as a dangerous liberal cloaked in neo-orthodoxy failed to have lasting legacy on evangelical theology, his general suspicions about Barth’s masked liberalism have a stronger legacy. John Hare and Clifford Anderson creatively explore the links between Kant’s philosophy (and neo-Kantianism) and Barth’s theology. Hare’s reassessment of Kant’s thought is instructive, while Anderson investigates the neglected topic of Barth’s theology of religious experience and how neo-Kantianism of the “Marburg School” shaped Barth’s early thought. The essay by Michael Horton, the most critical in the book, claims that Barth’s “christomonism subverts his christocentricism,” which collapses Christian theology into a “central dogma” rather than a “series of sub-plots” centered in Christ (144, 146). Horton admits his “one-sided” critique may not do justice to all of Barth’s thought, and rightly so, as he neglects to discuss Barth’s trinitarian theology in relation to christology, such as found in <italic>CD</italic> I/2. A counterpoint to Horton is Adam Neder’s essay on Barth’s theology of the <italic>hypostatic union</italic>, which presents a more dialectical and detailed summary of Barth’s christology in <italic>CD</italic> IV/1–3. The subsequent pair of essays on ecclesiology by Kimlyn Bender and Keith Johnson provide resources for evangelicals who want a more robust theology of the Church, one that challenges voluntaristic, individualistic, and subjectivist trends in some evangelical ecclesiology. The essays by Bruce McCormack and Suzanne McDonald provide interesting openings into Barth’s controversial theology of election (and latent universalism) as McCormack examines Barth’s thought in relation to Paul’s Romans, and McDonald looks at Barth’s pneumatology. Jason Springs’s essay engages Hans Frei and Barth in dialogue regarding the meaning of historical events and biblical authority, and John Franke explores how the Emergent church movement could benefit from Barth’s more dialectical and open-ended dogmatic approach. The last two essays critically discuss Barth in relation to contemporary theology, as Kevin Hector critically examines “ontological peace” in Radical Orthodoxy and John Milbank, and Todd Cioffi evaluates the theological politics of church and state in Stanley Hauerwas.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the book. Some important theological issues in the Barth/evangelical conversation are not discussed, such as the atonement, sacraments, and soteriology (justification/sanctification). Moreover, the reader would welcome another descriptive essay, following Hart’s essay, on the evangelical reception of Barth’s thought since 1970. Finally, the problem with books originating from conferences, including this book, is they often fail to supply coherent arguments tying the essays together. In saying this, however, the introduction by Anderson and conclusion by McCormack help alleviate some of this problem. Overall, this book should serve as a valuable contribution to growing rapprochement between evangelical theology and Barth studies and should be consulted for its important contribution in areas of Barth studies.</p>
