<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To improve understanding of the sources of frustration for people with chronic pain and consider the potential influence of frustration on the chronic pain experience and relationships with health professionals.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Qualitative in-depth interviews with a diverse, maximum variation sample of 46 participants with chronic pain, 30 of whom talked about frustration. Analysis paid close attention to <italic>how</italic> people talked about their frustration as well as what they said.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Frustration is a multi-faceted emotion and its effects are cumulative. Sources of frustration include interference with everyday activities, the interruption of life goals and roles and the unpredictability of pain; here we focus on the frustrations associated with the invisibility of chronic pain and the perceived limitations of diagnosis and pain management (both related to the perceived legitimacy of the condition). Several of the participants who had lived with chronic pain for many years described overcoming, or managing, their frustrations.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> If patients think that their pain is not being believed this is clearly a barrier to an effective consultation. Communication with chronic pain patients may improve if the frustration of living with an invisible, debilitating condition that is hard to diagnose and treat is explicitly (and perhaps repeatedly) acknowledged by the health professional.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312443692" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Frustration, the feeling of being upset or annoyed as a result of being unable to change or achieve something,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312443692">1</xref></sup> is recognised as an intrusive and significant negative emotion for people with chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443692">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312443692">4</xref></sup> Chronic pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as pain which has persisted past normal tissue healing time and as with any pain involves a complex interaction of sensory and emotional components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312443692">5</xref></sup> Frustration in chronic pain has mainly been measured and discussed in relation to aspects of the patient experience such as social relationships and impact on daily life and goals. This study seeks to improve understanding of the sources of frustration, in relation to chronic pain, by examining the narrative accounts of people with chronic pain and discuss potential implications for pain management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312443692"><title>Levels of frustration and relationship to other emotions</title>
<p>A study that measured frustration found that 97% of pain clinic patients with back pain or post hepatic neuralgia reported high levels, rated higher than 7 on a 10-point scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443692">2</xref></sup> Frustration has been rated higher than other negative pain-related emotions such as depression, fear, anxiety and anger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312443692">3</xref></sup> and has been positively associated with anger, fear and distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312443692">4</xref></sup> Wade et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312443692">3</xref></sup> found that frustration made a significant contribution to pain unpleasantness and suggested that treatment techniques specifically targeting frustration may be effective. Fernandez and Turk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312443692">6</xref></sup> postulated that frustration is an antecedent to anger which, depending on whether it is internalised or expressed, may have multifaceted influences on pain and well-being. They suggest internalised anger could be expressed as pain and lead to increased levels of pain-related depression and physical illness mediated via ‘stress-provoked changes in immunological responsivity’. Conversely, externalised anger leads to breakdown of personal relationships, poor adherence to pain management and maladaptive health habits. They propose that people may become trapped in a vicious cycle when pain treatment fails, aggravating the levels of frustration and anger. Identifying the sources of frustration in the chronic pain experience is important if this cycle is to be broken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395312443692"><title>Frustration at interference with everyday activities and life goals</title>
<p>In pain clinics, frustration is usually understood and interpreted as an understandable reaction to the fact that people in pain often cannot reach their goals or act spontaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443692">2</xref></sup> Researchers have described this frustration in the context of physical limitations and the unpredictability of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312443692">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443692">9</xref></sup> Others suggest that it is not simply prevention of everyday tasks that causes frustration but the impact on life roles and identity: their sense of who they are and what they might become.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443692">10</xref></sup> Harris et al. point out that when pain persistently interrupts tasks it leads to interference or degradation of performance, which is associated with frustration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443692">10</xref></sup> They propose that persistent interference of a person’s behavioural repertoire has a negative impact on their identity. Frustration may also present a major barrier to the adjustment process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312443692">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312443692">12</xref></sup> a person’s psychological well-being and ability to carry out normal physical and psychosocial activities despite pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312443692">13</xref></sup> Aldrich et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312443692">11</xref></sup> however, propose that the frustration results from repeated attempts to solve unsolvable pain which leads to a negative focus on self rather than more gratifying aspects of life. Drawing on the work of Arthur Frank, Vroman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443692">9</xref></sup> found that frustration with the limitations and unpredictability of pain often features in the ‘chaos narratives’ of people with low back pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443692">9</xref></sup> These unordered narratives reveal people’s vulnerabilities and the disruptions caused by the pain and are an antithesis to Frank’s ‘restitution narratives’ which are about hope, recovery and moving on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312443692">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395312443692"><title>Frustration relating to the invisibility of pain</title>
<p>The difficulties of communicating pain have been linked to frustration. Closs’s qualitative focus group study of the impact of neuropathic pain on relationships highlighted the impact of pain on social supports and people’s fear of the consequence for close relationships if they expressed their frustration as anger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312443692">15</xref></sup> The main negative impact was, however, on relationships with professionals where frustration arose from a failure to communicate symptoms and the consequences of pain to uncomprehending doctors, or to feel believed by statutory agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312443692">15</xref></sup> Osborn and Smith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312443692">16</xref></sup> found that when people felt vulnerable to the judgement of others, including professionals, they exaggerated their display of pain to convince others that it was ‘real’. Gullacksen and Lidbeck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312443692">17</xref></sup> singled out the frustration at not having the pain acknowledged or understood by health professionals as an obstacle to adjustment for women with fibromyalgia. Women in their sample also reported using exaggerated pain behaviours in an attempt to get their pain acknowledged because they wanted an explanation of the pain. The authors concluded that the lack of a diagnosis can lead to perceptions of pain as mysterious, causing frustration and an additional barrier to adjusting to a life with pain. Herbette and Rime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312443692">18</xref></sup> in a questionnaire study of 255 patients with chronic pain found that lacking a credible explanation for pain and not feeling able to share their feelings about their pain (social constraint) both had a negative impact on psychological adjustment. People with pain may also feel that it is unjust that their condition is open to scrutiny by society and particularly by the medical profession and the benefits system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312443692">19</xref></sup> Walker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312443692">20</xref></sup> described people with pain being trapped ‘in the system’ (medical, social security and legal system), which although it has been designed to support and treat them actually leaves them powerless, frustrated and angry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312443692">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395312443692"><title>Rationale for the current study</title>
<p>Whilst studies have hypothesised a range of possible triggers for frustration in chronic pain, including problems maintaining an identity as a person whose pain problem is real,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443692">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312443692">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312443692">17</xref></sup> none has completely grounded this in what people describe as frustrating, or attempted to characterise and collate different sources for frustration through qualitative investigation. This was the rationale for our study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395312443692" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to contribute a deeper understanding of the sources and consequences of frustration in chronic pain through re-analysis of 46 open ended narrative interviews on the perspectives and experiences of living with chronic pain. Based on Heaton’s five categories of secondary analysis, this study could be seen as a ‘supra-analysis’, since it examines the data from a new theoretical perspective, which was not the main focus of the primary research, yet is conducted by the original researcher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312443692">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>We focussed on the expressed sources for frustration which we grouped into analytic categories using established qualitative techniques. Frustration was discussed in 30 of the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742395312443692"><title>Sample and recruitment</title>
<p>The original sample used diverse, maximum variation sampling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312443692">22</xref></sup> of adults with chronic pain from throughout the United Kingdom, collected by the lead author in 2001–2002. Participants were aged between 24 and 80 described being in chronic pain, from 7 months to 45 years and had experienced a range of partially effective and ineffective treatments and pain management approaches. We recruited through a variety of sources including support groups, general practitioners, nursing and allied health professionals and pain specialist consultants. The sample included people who had pain from different origins including injury-related back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, post-surgical pain, unexplained abdominal pain and pelvic pain, lupus, multiple sclerosis, post stroke pain, brachial plexus avulsion and repetitive use wrist and arm pain. Pain related to cancer was excluded.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1742395312443692"><title>Interview procedure</title>
<p>Using methods approved by a national Research Ethics Committee (MREC), the interviews were conducted in people’s own homes and lasted between 1 and 4 h. The first half of the interview used a narrative approach, inviting people to tell their story about their experience of chronic pain, in their own words for as long as they wanted. Semi-structured interviewing then covered additional topics not raised during the narrative section, or explored topics in more depth. Topics in the semi-structured sections included the impact of pain on people’s daily lives, how their pain had affected them emotionally and their interactions with other people including health professionals. Following informed consent interviews were audio-recorded. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim by a professional audio typist and transcripts were checked by the lead author (CD). Participants were given the opportunity to review and remove any sections of the transcript; however, none of the sections removed related to frustration. Finally participants gave informed consent for the use of their interview for a range of purposes, including research and secondary analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742395312443692"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>In accord with qualitative thematic analysis practice all of the transcripts were read and reviewed several times by the lead author (CD). During this initial analysis frustration emerged as an important part of the chronic pain experience for many respondents. For the secondary analysis reported in this article we identified all sections of the transcripts in which people talked about sources of frustration. Using the computer package QSR NVivo these sections of text were gathered together in an NVivo report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312443692">23</xref></sup> For this analysis we first identified all uses of the term frustration and its variants (e.g. frustrated, frustrates, frustrating). To avert the dangers implicit in a simple, uncritical ‘word search’ content analysis we also (i) searched for any sections of text that seemed to describe the experience without using the term itself, (ii) we attended closely to how people talked about frustration and excluded from the analysis any examples where the description of ‘frustration’ could be judged to be very mild, apparently ‘rhetorical’, or not relevant to the experience of pain, for example ‘it is frustrating that buses always come three at a time’. An OSOP ‘one sheet of paper’ analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312443692">24</xref></sup> was used to ensure that all relevant data were incorporated in the analysis and to build up an understanding of the sources of frustration and develop sub-themes relating to these sources. To improve the rigour of the analysis CD and SZ independently coded the data and corresponded regularly to resolve discrepancies in the coding, clarify the key sources of frustration emerging from the interviews and describe the analytical sub-themes corresponding to these sources. Further analysis and video and audio clips from the interviews can be seen, anonymised in accordance with participants’ wishes, on the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthtalkonline.org/chronichealthissues/Chronic_Pain">http://www.healthtalkonline.org/chronichealthissues/Chronic_Pain</ext-link>.</p>

    <p>When we considered how people talked about the sources of frustration in chronic pain, their most strongly expressed frustrations related to two issues: the invisibility of pain and the limitations of health care in diagnosis and pain management. Respondents also talked about frustration caused by interference (with activities); interruption (of life goals and roles) and the unpredictability of pain (See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1742395312443692">Box 1</xref>). However, since these three aspects of frustration in pain have received more attention in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443692">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312443692">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443692">10</xref></sup> we will focus here on ‘invisibility’ and the limitations of diagnosis and treatment issues which are distinguishable, yet linked by their relationship to the patient’s sense of the legitimacy of their pain and their implications for clinical relationships.
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-1742395312443692" position="float"><title>Box 1. Interference, Interruption and Unpredictability</title>
<p>‘You can’t plan anything. That’s another thing, you know, I was always quite organised and I can’t be organised now because I don’t know how I’m going to be the next day or even later on that day. My relationship with my husband has suffered because he likes to go out, well we both used to like to go out… But you can’t plan an evening in the morning because you don’t know how you’re going to be by the time you get to the evening and, if I feel I can’t do it, then the guilt comes in […] Sort of all the time you’re feeling guilty and frustrated and that’s horrible.’ (CP28, woman aged 47)</p>
<p>‘… I think they understand but children don’t want their parents ill. They want their parents able and it’s been very, very difficult for example, not to be able to play squash with my son .… you can’t keep telling a boy “Stop hitting it so damn hard. I can’t run.” You know so it was intensively frustrating not to be able to do the normal things that a father would do.’ (CP48, man aged 61)</p>
<p>‘But, as time's gone on, I found it becoming less and less predictable. So yes, I do tend to have bad days after I've done too much, but sometimes I don't and sometimes I have bad days for virtually no reason possible. And that's actually been the most frustrating part, is the fact that I can have a bad day and think “I've done nothing, why am I worse than I was before?’ (CP21, woman aged 32)</p>

<sec id="sec11-1742395312443692"><title>The invisibility of pain</title>
<p>One pervasive source of frustration is that chronic pain is an ‘invisible’ condition which is hard to communicate and can hinder patients’ attempts to have their pain recognised by others. Several people said that they wished that there was a physical manifestation of their pain, for example that they could <italic>turn blue where the pain is</italic> or bear a letter <italic>P on the forehead</italic> to somehow prove that their pain was real.</p>
<p>The perceived need to constantly reiterate, explain and legitimise the limitations of unrelenting pain was described as hugely frustrating. Despite this people often suspected that friends and family either did not believe them or seemed to forget that there was a problem. Some noted that friends and colleagues no longer enquired about their pain; while some were resigned to this, others were frustrated at the apparent lack of interest or assumption that they no longer had a problem.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘even people that have known me for long periods of time, don’t understand that. And I, I find that frustrating and can’t explain it enough, you know, how, how pain affects my life’</italic> (CP18, woman aged 52)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This problem of legitimacy was, perhaps understandably, an even greater issue affecting communication with health professionals. If the patient perceives that others are challenging the reality of the illness, it causes a threat to their identity which Åsbring and Närvänen contend ‘<italic>may be experienced as a heavier burden than the illness itself</italic>”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312443692">25</xref></sup> A 50-year-old woman who had sometimes felt that her doctors did not believe her described this as a ‘<italic>double burden.’</italic><disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘… you’re in pain but you are being told by your doctors “No, no you haven’t got pain, it’s just a pain you’re feeling in your head”. It just destroys you completely and it gives you a double burden to carry and that’s what had happened to me and I was destroyed by it’</italic> (CP07, woman aged 50)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Frustrated attempts to explain pain to health professionals sometimes led to a breakdown in communication. Wileman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312443692">26</xref></sup> quote GPs who describe the ‘stomach churn’ and ‘heart sink’ provoked by some consultations with patients with unexplained symptoms. Some of the people we talked to were acutely aware that health professionals saw them as ‘heart sink patients’. CP18 said that she had stormed out of consultations when she felt the doctor was not listening.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘I have been known to, to, you know, storm out, be, you know, what’s the word, a difficult patient because I’m frustrated. You know, if you feel you’re not being listened to, it’s frustrating, really frustrating’</italic> (CP18, woman aged 52)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1742395312443692"><title>The limitations of diagnostics and management</title>
<p>The perceived failure of the health care system to recognise, find a cause, or recommend an effective treatment, all contributed to feelings of frustration. Those whose doctors could not find anything wrong often said that they were far from relieved, even if the doctor presented the results of the diagnostic tests as really good news. The lack of explanation added to some people’s fears and concerns.<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>I just desperately wanted to know what was wrong with me and I mean I remember doctors saying “Oh it’s really good news. We didn’t find anything.” And me being really frustrated and saying “How is that good news?” and they were you know “You should be really pleased. There’s nothing dangerously wrong with you.” But I was just desperate to know what was going on because it was having such an impact on my life</italic>.’ (CP16, woman aged 25)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the early stages of investigations patients were, of course, hoping that a diagnosis would lead to a cure. The people we talked to had often come to realise that this was an unrealistic expectation. Yet sometimes the frustration was caused by the lack of timely and individualised treatment. CP45, for example, did not find out about a pain management clinic for two years and at that point he was placed on an 11 month waiting list. When his appointment came through he phoned his GP because he was frustrated at the delay.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘And I rang him, the GP up and said “What’s this all about?” and he said “Yes, that’s, that’s the problem, we’ve got an eleven month waiting period before you can actually see the pain clinic for your first visit.” That seemed quite frustrating and this is one of the better pain clinics in the country that had a lot of resource and a lot of facilities and here was this waiting period and you think well, why is this happening?’</italic> (CP45, man aged 54)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When a physical explanation could not be found some felt that their pain was being unfairly re-branded as a ‘psychological’ condition.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘… it’s really difficult […] I always try and keep positive, but if you ever had a negative thought or said anything negative to the GP or to the consultant, they turned it into a psychological thing or they made you feel as [..] if you’re not thinking positively, you’re not going to be acting positively. As in “Do you need to see a psychologist …?” So like though that’s harsh and it seems harsh and it is really frustrating that, that happens I suppose that it’s a learning thing in that if you think negatively then they’re going to put you in a box and send you [to] a psychologist …’</italic> (CP19, woman aged 28)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nettleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312443692">27</xref></sup> has shown that patients with unexplained neurological symptoms felt shame and guilt that an organic cause could not be found for their illness, threatening ‘their sense of self and social identity’. Thus the motivation to find an explanation is not only practical (to find a cure) but also psychological (to maintain a coherent sense of oneself).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1742395312443692"><title>Cumulative frustration</title>
<p>People’s accounts of frustration were often intertwined and suggested that the frustrations of living with pain are cumulative. Angry and frustrated outbursts in the clinic are more understandable in the context of continual pain, mobility problems, interrupted life goals, fear of expressing anger with one’s friends and family, the sense that one’s experience is not believed or legitimate and what Walker describes as ‘the system’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312443692">20</xref></sup> In the following excerpt a 28-year-old woman recounted her frustration at needing to take medication just to get out of bed. She went on to describe how this was compounded by trying to explain this to professionals.<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>I’m upset because I’m in pain every day and because I can’t get out of bed every day and because I’m crawling on my hands and knees to be able to get out of bed every day, to get things (medication) down my neck … And you get so angry, frustrated by trying to explain that so many times, to so many different professionals, each of which have their own agenda, have their own specialist subject, have their own specialist area of your body that they want to analyse, that they don’t look at the bigger picture in the first place, they look at the different little sections and don’t put it all together. Then it just tires you out and you end up getting nowhere</italic>.’ (CP19, woman aged 28)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1742395312443692"><title>Overcoming frustration</title>
<p>We talked to some people with long standing chronic pain who said that over the years they had learnt to live with, understand or even overcome some of their frustrations. For example, the woman who we quoted earlier as having stormed out of consultations in the past went on to explain that, after 25 years with pain she realised <italic>‘it’s better for me to understand them not understanding me so that I can get my point across ….’</italic> (CP18) and that this had helped her relate better to clinical staff.</p>
<p>A man who had had pain for 20 years was able to frame his frustration in a more positive light. He described a series of events which lead to a break down, yet suggested that his expression of frustration may have contributed to being taken seriously at last. An operation had led to increased pain, although he said that he had been told repeatedly that ‘<italic>Oh that’s surgical pain, things will ease.’</italic> He had battled with his consultant and GP to come off medication which he felt was not helping.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘And I said “They’re not doing anything for me”[the tablets], you know “I’m popping these and I’m still the same, and if I don’t take them one day I’m not any worse or any better, so why take them”, and then they put it down to “Oh it’s his state of mind, get on to these valium”[..…] I don’t know maybe me being a man I broke down, I think I got a lot of frustration out and folk began to listen to me I think.’</italic> (CP03, man aged 56)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Those who had found a health care professional who would listen, respond sympathetically and provide explanations of both the physical and psychological mechanisms of chronic pain, said that this was enormously helpful. A 29-year-old who had been very frustrated at the lack of a diagnosis when her pain started 10 years before, was now able to look back and share some of the puzzlement that her doctors may have felt.<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘So I’ve actually read all my medical records, I’ve read all the letters that have gone backwards and forwards, and from a scientific point of view, you can completely understand why they just couldn’t work it out. It makes no sense at all, I mean it’s just a puzzle that goes backwards and forwards with this 19 year old girl saying that she’s in pain, with no proof, so yes I can understand where they were coming from, but it was very frustrating at the time.’</italic> (CP02, woman aged 29)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>CP46, who had taken part in a pain management course, reflected that, after 10 years, frustration was just part of his condition: <italic>‘… the frustration can still be there like, but I’ve just got to be patient, you know. I call it the three “P’s: pacing; patience; perseverance.”</italic>’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1742395312443692" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This qualitative analysis shows frustration as a multi-faceted emotion, commonly experienced in chronic pain, yet which can be overcome. While some frustrations may be relatively mild or transitory others threaten identity: our sense of who we are and what we might become.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443692">10</xref></sup> Difficulties performing daily tasks and roles were cited as frustrating but the deepest (most strongly expressed) sources of frustration concerned the invisibility of pain and the limitations of diagnosis and pain management. These are also associated with the legitimacy of the condition. We suggest that those sources of frustration that are connected to the nature of the condition (invisible, and with physical and psychological components) and the challenges of the consultation (inconclusive investigations and mixed success in treatment) may not be expressed (or at least not in a direct way) in the medical consultation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1742395312443692"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>We identified and examined every account of frustration, excluding all those where frustrations were judged (by two authors) to be minor, ‘rhetorical’ or not relevant. The sample was chosen to represent a broad and diverse range of experiences, rather than to be numerically representative. Sixteen of the 46 people we interviewed did not talk about frustration in their interviews but, since we did not ask these people whether frustration had ever been an issue for them we cannot speculate about whether it did not occur to them in the interview, or had not occurred to them in their experiences. No obvious pattern was apparent among those who did not discuss frustration: the 16 included those who had been dealing with pain for decades and a few whose diagnosis was in the previous 5 years.</p>
<p>As with all analyses of reported events we lack corroborative or observational evidence. It is possible that the other participants in these events (clinicians, family members) would provide different accounts of the person’s behaviour and perspectives. However, frustration will often not be apparent to observers, especially when associated with perceptions of legitimacy. Therefore people’s own accounts are an inevitable and valuable method of data collection, whether through in-depth qualitative studies or more narrowly focussed but numerically representative survey research.</p>
<p>This study was a secondary analysis of interviews conducted between 2001 and 2002. The original study was not focussed on experiences of frustration although people were prompted to talk about a wide array of experiences including the emotional impact of the pain. We consider it unlikely that the factors that lead people with chronic pain to feel frustration have changed much during this period. Future research could observe the expression of frustration in clinical encounters, as well as exploring reports in interviews with health professionals and patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1742395312443692"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
<p>In the clinical setting frustration is usually seen as a consequence of the limitations that pain causes for daily activities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443692">2</xref></sup> rather than the result of the difficulty of communicating pain to others, including clinicians. One possible explanation for this is that patients may be reluctant to express their wider frustrations in clinical settings with a biomedical focus of assessment and management, and instead focus on their physical limitations. Patients may regard physical goals as the main objective of pain assessment or feel that emphasising their inability to perform simple daily tasks will add verisimilitude to their accounts of pain. Werner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312443692">28</xref></sup> concluded that women with chronic pain who have faced scepticism and distrust of their pain construct the credibility of their pain as real rather than imagined by negotiating a picture of themselves that fits with a normative biomedical expectation of illness. An alternative explanation is that patient’s accounts in the clinical setting do cover a broad range of sources of frustration, but, understandably, clinicians may direct their focus to the more tangible outcomes such as the limitation of pain on daily activities. We found examples of people reporting a deep sense of frustration at trying to explain the limitations of their pain to doctors but feeling that the gravity of their situation was not acknowledged. Vroman et al acknowledge that it is difficult to listen to, and act on, chaotic narratives of suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443692">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>People reported entering consultations with a range of unresolved frustrations relating to poor communication, lack of a diagnosis and dissatisfaction with the treatment available. Frustrations that are not recognised in the clinical setting may have adverse consequences for pain management. Specifically, the overt focus on getting a diagnosis and the perceived need to emphasise the impact of pain in an attempt to gain recognition may act as a barrier to psychological adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312443692">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312443692">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395312443692">29</xref></sup> Allegretti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395312443692">29</xref></sup> in paired interviews with people with low back pain and doctors reported whilst both patients and doctors found the search for definitive diagnosis frustrating there was a mismatch in how they approached the lack of a diagnosis. Doctors had low expectations for a diagnosis that would change a treatment course and when tests were inconclusive moved on with management issues. Conversely a definitive diagnosis was central to many patients’ explanatory model and an inconclusive test left people disheartened and unable to move on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, among patients with fibromyalgia, the illness behaviours provoked by needing to convince others of ‘real pain problems’ are in turn predictors of frustration and distrust among physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312443692">30</xref></sup> A cycle of frustration may therefore exist between patients and physicians who are each confronted by an inability to explain symptoms of chronic pain. In an Australian study Kenny compares the accounts of patients with unresolved medically unexplained pain with doctor’s views of treating this group of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312443692">31</xref></sup> She draws attention to the implicit, competing theories of the genesis (biogenic, psychogenic or sociogenic) of chronic pain which reinforce a damaging tendency to typecast both the patients (often as ‘mad or stupid’) and the doctors (for example, as ‘dismissive’, ‘clock watching’ and ‘condescending’). She describes a situation where patients operate within a biogenic model of a physical cause for pain which can be diagnosed and treated and doctors operate in a psychogenic model where psychological distress plays a causal role in pain. It is clear that this can lead to an impasse where neither patient or doctor will shift from their standpoint and the doctor patient relationship deteriorates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312443692">31</xref></sup> Whilst people in our study wanted a recognition of their pain as real with a physical cause they also expressed a desire for a more holistic approach which took into account the impact of pain on their lives but without compromising the legitimacy of their pain.</p>
<p>Professional training which focuses on effective communication and a professional patient relationship which embodies a partnership approach have been seen as one way to reduce frustration in the clinical consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312443692">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742395312443692">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742395312443692">33</xref></sup> Werner and Malterud propose that when faced with a patient with unexplained pain admitting the shortcoming of medical knowledge may take the blame away from the patient and can help to transform the consultation to a space where the person feels empowered by recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312443692">34</xref></sup> One approach which has been trialled for professionals caring for people with fibromyalgia is a programme of training in shared decision making (SDM) which has been shown to improve physician patient relationships and reduce frustration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742395312443692">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312443692">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>People in our study often described a conflict between wanting their pain acknowledged by those around them but also wanting to appear able to cope. This has been described by Radley and Billig,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742395312443692">37</xref></sup> following Merton, as the ‘sociological ambivalence’ that faces people when they are ill, since they simultaneously want to be excused certain social roles and continue to be seen as a competent member of society. Campbell and Cramb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312443692">38</xref></sup> in a qualitative study of 12 non-service users with chronic pain, found that people said that they wanted to self-manage their condition, rather than become a ‘back bore’ yet felt they received little encouragement to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312443692">38</xref></sup> We interviewed a few people who said they had been able to overcome frustrations and take control of their pain, sometimes positive interactions with health professionals had helped. Others may eventually become resigned to the frustration at the failure of treatments for pain and adopt the coping strategy of ‘putting up with it’ and ‘getting on with it’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742395312443692">39</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1742395312443692"><title>Implications for further research and clinical practice</title>
<p>It seems likely that frustration, especially when it is cumulative, may present a major barrier to adjustment to life with chronic pain. Unresolved frustration which leads to an undue focus on the pain is likely to prevent people from focusing on other aspects of life which form their current or future identity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443692">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742395312443692">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742395312443692">41</xref></sup> Morley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742395312443692">41</xref></sup> reported improved adjustment amongst participants who were capable of reconstructing a positive self-image that was not dependent on the absence of pain. The less discrepancy a person feels between their desired self and their self-living with pain, the greater is the adjustment possible.</p>
<p>If measurement and management of frustration is to do justice to the complexity of people’s experiences of living with chronic pain it will need to address the factors discussed in this article, including the problems of legitimacy that are inherent in the invisibility of pain and the limitations of pain management and diagnosis. Future studies might explore how frustration fits within a conceptual model of adjustment and acceptance of chronic pain. Some of our participants who had been living with pain for many years described becoming reconciled to their pain and deterioration in function, or finding compensations in their life that balanced the frustration they felt. Further, more focussed work could examine whether people who have been in pain for many years report less frustration and, perhaps whether frustration could motivate people to learn to manage their pain. Little is known about health professionals’ beliefs about the sources of frustration in chronic pain and what they might do to help. There may be links to expression of anger; Fernandez and Turk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312443692">6</xref></sup> have suggested that externalising anger as hostility may lead people to adopt poor health habits and prevent them from engaging with self-care.</p>
<p>Frustration in chronic pain is a multi-faceted emotion and its effects are cumulative. If patients think that their pain is not being believed this is clearly a barrier to an effective consultation, yet clinicians are in a difficult position if the patient does not elucidate the strongest sources of their frustration, perhaps through concern that the clinical relationship will be (further) threatened. We therefore suggest that clinicians’ communication with chronic pain patients may benefit if the frustration of living with an invisible, debilitating condition that is hard to diagnose and treat is explicitly (and perhaps repeatedly) acknowledged by the health professional.</p>
