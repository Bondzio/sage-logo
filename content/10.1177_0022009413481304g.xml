<sec id="sec1-0022009413481304g"><title>Stuart J. Hilwig, <italic>Italy and 1968: Youthful Unrest and Democratic Culture</italic>, Houndsmills, Basingstoke, Palgrave MacMillan, 2009; x + 185 pp.; £55.00 hbk; ISBN 9780230575684</title>
<p>Hilwig’s book is certainly one of the better contributions to the history of 1968 and Italy that I have read. Yet the book is not without flaws. The research object itself does not seem completely focused: on the one hand, this book explores a local but very relevant case (Turin); on the other, the research focuses on the reaction of national press and political elites to the student movement. The reference bibliography, excellent as far as the student movement is concerned, overlooks the better recent Italian works as the author moves to the analysis of Italian society in the 1960s. As a result Helwig offers an often not very nuanced picture, as when he writes that the Communist party did not adopt ‘a revolutionary platform’ in the 1960s, ‘opting to work with the government’ (13), or that ‘Pope John XXIII publicly refused to endorse the Christian Democrats in the 1963 elections and called for a dialogue between Catholics and Communists’ (15). Nevertheless the book brings a new and refreshing approach to this field of study.</p>
<p>First of all, it fills a crucial gap, devoted as it is to a subject about which almost nothing has been written: the response of non-students (‘university professors, parents of activists, cops, journalists, factory workers, priests and politicians') to the university upheavals of the late 1960s (ix). Moreover, Hilwig’s is one of the few books with a true scientific approach (as the very good introduction to the historiography demonstrates, 6–11). Most Italian books about 1968 are still written from an autobiographical perspective (by 1980 Paul Piccone had already denounced a general international trend in this sense). Not only have protagonists of the movement or journalists but also many historians, young at the time, written their reconstructions more with the aim of justifying their past actions or reviving the myth of their youthful <italic>Bildung</italic> experience than with the idea of approaching a normal field of analysis. Hilwig, who himself was born in 1968 and has studied with Carol Fink, a scholar who devoted much attention to Marc Bloch and his methodology, expresses his intention clearly: ‘This study is neither an apology nor a condemnation … it is simply, in the spirit of Marc Bloch, a search for understanding’ (x). This pays great dividends.</p>
<p>Examining the Turin university case, and making intelligent use of the minutes of the debates inside the Academic Senate, Hilwig paints a rich picture of the divisions among the professoriate: a minority embraced the student call for a new university, a consistent group advocated police intervention (and expulsion of rebels), and a further group followed a middle-way attitude of prudent concessions. The last option prevailed in the end but divided many of the same ‘progressive’ and antifascist professors (as in the case of Norberto Bobbio and his hard criticism of both the student movement and the feebleness of the Academic Senate), and it did not even succeed in taming students. The students rejected the results of their victory because they felt their struggle was not focused on ‘democratic’ reforms but on a radical revolution, and they praised direct democracy and violent protest (36–51). By including interviews with witnesses, Hilwig analyzes also the very difficult relations between students and members of the police (60–6) as well as industrial workers (66–7).</p>
<p>The part of the book that is devoted to the press-image of the movement offers useful insights too. The ‘majority of the newspapers with national circulation’ (<italic>Il Corriere della Sera</italic>, <italic>La Stampa</italic>), as Hilwig demonstrates, ‘took a tough anti-student line constructing an image of the <italic>Sessantotto</italic> that was almost wholly negative’ (80): they often presented information selectively and accused the students of reviving the lawlessness and violence of the Fascist ‘squads’. The Communist <italic>L’Unità</italic>, by contrast, considered the students to be peaceful demonstrators for university reform and political change, condemned police violence and underscored, instead, the movement’s ‘continuities with the antifascist Resistance’ (107). What does not completely convince in this part of the analysis is the fact that the author, instead of limiting himself to recognizing the different strategies of the two conflicting sides of the Italian political system, stresses only the falsification of reality that the conservative press made, judging the Communist approach much more realistic (students were not fascists, of course, but – as Hilwig’s analysis of the Turin case demonstrates – they were not peaceful protesters either). On this point, even if not involved in the contrasts of 1968, the author seems still inside its myth.</p>
<p>Overall, this book brings many new and important contributions to the knowledge of 1968, and not only for the Italian case. It shows that there was no radical or absolute rejection of the new generation's requests and that ‘the allegedly chasmic generational, political and ideological divide’ between the movement and the establishment ‘was actually much shallower than previous scholarly and popular account suggested’ (131). Above all, it demonstrates the role of the images of the past (in the Italian case, fascism and antifascism) as the main lenses through which the new reality was perceived.</p>
