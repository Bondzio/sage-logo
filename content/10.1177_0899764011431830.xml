<abstract>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the strategies pursued by nonprofit agencies must take into account not only the conventional market forces but also the social expectations and constraints that the agencies regularly confront. This study reports on a theoretically guided, qualitative analysis of the strategies that develop in the context of such factors. Data stem from interviews with officials from 12 agencies, the agencies’ prime funding agency, and interest groups. The results suggest that sampled agencies occasionally use conventionally described strategies as well as the social and political strategies covered in several previous studies, but that they most frequently rely on rarely considered “relationship” strategies by which they seek to establish and preserve an image or status. The results are argued to inform strategic decision making and to suggest ways in which agency officials may take into account two sources of social expectations and constraints: institutional arrangements and organizational identities.</p>

<p>Several strands of literature discuss strategies, that is, agencies’ systematic approaches to achieving monetary objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764011431830">Dart, 2004</xref>). Studies suggest that strategic thinking is encouraged by contemporary economic and social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011431830">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>), that strategies are commonly used in nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011431830">Shoham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764011431830">Stone et al., 1999</xref>), and that reliance on strategies has financial and other advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011431830">Shoham et al., 2006</xref>). Studies also examine agencies’ adoption of strategic marketing plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011431830">Andreasen, Goodstein, &amp; Wilson, 2005</xref>), the relation between use of strategically related “tactics” and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 1998</xref>), and the nature of nonprofit agencies’ commercial ventures and social entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011431830">Light, 2008</xref>). Texts suggest financially viable ways of selecting and marketing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011431830">Oster, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011431830">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764011431830">Sargeant, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if most of the studies do not fully explicate their theoretical orientations, the majority take their cue from a small range of classic perspectives on strategies that provide what is called strategic choice theory. Literature on businesses provides the original frameworks for these perspectives and many public management studies build on that literature. Strategic choice theory suggests that agency strategies revolve around seemingly logical tasks: gaining market position by producing and marketing goods and services that are useful, needed, and valuable to others. This theory originally grew out of resource dependency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764011431830">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), which posits that agencies that produce valued and scarce goods and services obtain power over their environment and thus avoid disruptive dependency on outsiders (i.e., on other agencies and the like). Those without such power become dependent on the outsiders and are forced to produce the output demanded by outsiders on the outsider’s terms. In brief, more than resource dependency theory, strategic choice theory shows how agencies make choices about the goods and services they deliver. Their choices build on agency strengths and usually are designed to alter (or protect) their power and allow the agencies to improve their market position (not just to reduce dependency).</p>
<p>For example, several relevant studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764011431830">Boehm, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011431830">Oster, 1995</xref>) explicitly use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011431830">Porter’s (1980)</xref> classic work on competitive strategy, a central source for strategic choice theory. These studies suggest that nonprofit agencies should act to increase their power by enhancing their ability to produce goods and services that are useful, valued, and needed. Allegedly, agencies in this way ensure that they set the conditions for sales and thus improve their market position. Agencies also are advised to control the flow of goods, services, resources, and related demands emanating from competitors, consumers, and suppliers (again increasing power and thus improving market position). The studies further follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011431830">Porter (1980)</xref> in recommending that organizations analyze threats to their power stemming from new entrants to the market (increased competition reduces power and position), the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers (an enterprise is less powerful when suppliers or buyers have many options and thus can make many demands), and the existence of substitute products (lowering demand and thus power and position). Studies further consider several strategic approaches that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011431830">Porter (1980)</xref> argues guard against the loss of power or improve relative power, including positioning (focusing on products and services for which an agency has an advantage), influencing the competitive balance (raising the profile of an enterprise’s goods and services or lowering the cost), exploiting change (determining the future potential for competitive advantage), or diversification (focusing on multiple viable markets). Literature on nonprofit agencies that does not focus on a single theoretical source similarly examines how agencies plan for or market goods or services that are scarce, valued, of high quality, or of low costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011431830">Foster, Kim, &amp; Christiansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011431830">Shohan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these works make substantial contributions, they tend to only briefly consider the implications for strategies of the special or characteristic aspects of nonprofit agencies. Nevertheless, it is well known that nonprofit agencies organize in characteristic ways to confront special social expectations and constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011431830">Hansmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011431830">De Cooman, De Gieter, Pepermans, &amp; Jegers, 2011</xref>). Expectations in this context are social and political preferences for certain goods, services, and methods; constraints are social prohibitions against providing or using certain goods, services, and methods. For example, as they serve public purposes, nonprofit agencies typically confront expectations to serve financially needy people regardless of the financial return and are constrained from developing strategies that link demand to costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011431830">Oster, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Literature suggests that a central strategic dilemma for agencies is to comply with expectations and constraints while maintaining financial health. Allegedly, many agencies do so by balancing financial concerns with ethical behaviors that engender trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764011431830">Steinberg, 1997</xref>), even if this means foregoing some revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011431830">Brooks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011431830">James, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764011431830">Vitaliano, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, studies rarely detail the everyday strategic choices that thereby emerge. Furthermore, studies tend to underplay the extent to which strategies are affected by expectations and constraints. For example, few works consider that demands from stakeholders even can induce agencies to provide goods or services that are inefficacious but socially approved; the ineffective yet politically popular Drug Abuse Resistance Education program was once ubiquitous in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011431830">Frumkin &amp; Reingold, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The current work takes a further if tentative step toward exploring how the strategies of nonprofit agencies are formulated in light of social expectations and constraints. It focuses on strategies involving the service mix and on a small sample of agencies that are organized in ways that are typical for the nonprofit sector but very distinct from businesses. The work discusses the implications of its results for managers and for bringing about social change in nonprofit agencies.</p>
<sec id="section1-0899764011431830">
<title>Background</title>
<p>As noted, few of the works suggesting that expectations and constraints affect nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011431830">Barman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764011431830">Clemen &amp; Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764011431830">Frumkin &amp; Andre-Clark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011431830">Hansmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011431830">Herman &amp; Renz, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764011431830">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011431830">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764011431830">Tassie, Murray, &amp; Cutt, 1998</xref>) fully reveal how typical agencies take into account those expectations and constraints. Perhaps this is the case because the strategy literature and the literature on expectations and constraints tend to be bifurcated or because that many studies of strategy focus on such unusual agencies as those involved in social enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764011431830">Cooney, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz and Bielefeld (1998)</xref> take several strides toward describing the implications for strategy of expectations and constraints when developing a scale measuring “institutional tactics,” but they do not integrate their scale into a detailed analysis of specific options that agencies use (all such tactics are combined in a single index), do not describe strategies (beyond presenting lists), and include in the scale and predict the scale with variables that do not capture the phenomena of central interest here (as will be noted, they focus on what in this sample are relatively rarely used political and social strategies). The current work thus may be unique in detailing how social factors as well as market forces are reflected in the service-related strategies of a sample of nonprofit agencies.</p>

<title>Social Constraints and Strategy</title>
<sec id="section3-0899764011431830">
<title>Social Environments</title>
<p>Two relatively recent schools of thought help to explore the role in strategies of social expectations and constraints. One is the institutional school. This school argues that many nonprofit agencies operate in institutional environments, that is, in situations where it is difficult or impossible to accurately calculate, or base strategic decisions on, factors like cost and quality. Instead, agencies either produce outputs that have social or political value or rely on procedures that are in themselves so valued. For example, environments are said to be highly institutionalized if clients cannot readily determine whether one educational facility’s approach to educating students is superior to another’s. In that case, the facility is only likely to try to adopt a strategy designed to market an effective, new teaching module if the module also is socially or politically popular. Similarly, agencies may find that they are financially supported not due to the quality of their services but because their boards of directors follow conventional, socially approved board protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011431830">Herman &amp; Renz, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764011431830">2004</xref>). In short, the institutional school borrows from resource dependency theory the notion that the environment is important. However, it considers processes and outcomes that occur when environmental demands are not as heavily based on technical issues and service effectiveness (output) as on expectations and constraints. In general, organizations in institutional environments are said to seek legitimacy or the approval that comes from producing socially approved goods and services or following socially approved procedures.</p>
<p>Although most environments are partly institutionalized, those of interest here are heavily institutionalized. As a result, many nonprofit agencies are successful to the extent to which they maximize their legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011431830">Barnam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011431830">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>). For example, some agencies benefit financially from having a reputation of being highly professional. The agencies assure that they deliver services that are sanctioned by professional associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011431830">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011431830">Scott, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The second school considers expectations that specifically apply to groups of organizations. This school studies organizational identity: socially agreed on perceptions about the legitimate territory of organizations. Identity reflects perceptions concerning at least three issues: the organization’s constellation of products and services, the structures for delivering those goods and services, and the language used to explain actions. The first is central here: strategies about the service mix in nonprofit agencies reflect the perceptions about products and services that are held and enforced by members of the organizations and other stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011431830">Polos, Hannan, &amp; Carroll, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The early and most widely recognized work on identity examined internal organizational issues, such as whether employees readily adopt innovations that are consistent with the organization’s identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011431830">Albert &amp; Whetten, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011431830">Gioia, Schultz, &amp; Corley, 2000</xref>). However, the studies that are particularly relevant argue that identities define the acceptable range of strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011431830">Hsu, Hannon, &amp; Kocak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011431830">Hsu &amp; Hannan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011431830">Polos et al., 2002</xref>). These studies imply, for example, that mental health providers are socially accepted when they provide mental health services, conventionally defined. Nevertheless, there can be paths for growth in identities and thus change in the breadth of services: mental health agencies may be able to successfully innovate programs for dually diagnosed individuals (those with substance abuse as well as mental health problems) and eventually may be seen as legitimate hybrid organizations capable of providing substance abuse services. That type of insight helps to consider the details of strategic choices: it is likely that nonprofit agencies tend to only pursue conventional market strategies that enable them to provide services that stand within the confines of the identity or can be pursued by slightly expanding that identity.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0899764011431830">
<title>Analysis Sample</title>
<p>The current research attempts to unpack the role in strategies of conventional market forces, institutional phenomena, and organizational identities with the aid of interview data collected in a Midwestern State during 2006 and (occasionally) 2007. These data concern nonprofit agencies that provide substance abuse services. In the state of interest (like in most states) provision of substance abuse services is subcontracted to licensed nonprofit (or for profit) agencies. The examined agencies bear government licenses to deliver the services.</p>
<p>Following from a classic tradition in qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011431830">Emigh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011431830">Patton, 2002</xref>), agencies are selected for this study because they are organized very differently than conventional businesses and thus are likely to respond to forces and develop strategies that are not central to market-based enterprises. The current work thus uses the “negative” case study strategy, a variant of John Stuart Mills’ difference strategy, theoretically sampling agencies that pose a contrast to market based agencies. Analyses using this method tend to provide hypotheses that extend or alter conventional theories about strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011431830">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 238). These hypotheses, here partly developed inductively and partly developed from the institutional and identity schools of thought, can later be tested on heterogeneous samples.</p>
<p>In the current research, sampled substance abuse agencies are selected partly because they are donative agencies: agencies whose funds generally emanate from such third parties as governments or philanthropies rather than from clients or customers. Donative agencies, common in the nonprofit sector, are likely to be more fully bound by expectations and constraints than are the other major type of service-delivering nonprofit agencies, commercial nonprofit agencies (agencies that receive most of their funds from clients or customers). Third parties may be less concerned than customers about customer demands and may instead demand compliance to such political and social forces as legal regulations and public sentiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011431830">Hasenfeld &amp; Weaver, 1996</xref>). Similarly, the sampled agencies deliver services, which compared to goods, tend to spur the social and political evaluation of agencies.</p>
<p>As is typical for service delivering, donative nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011431830">Smith, 2002</xref>), the sampled agencies depend on resources from government sources. These sources implement rules likely to contribute to the formation of a nonbusiness-like (institutionalized) environment; as they license agencies and provide resources, governments impose expectations and constraints. The agencies sampled here in particular are heavily funded by what will be called the state substance abuse authority, the government unit that administers public support for substance abuse services in the state (most federal government funds flow through states, and states add their own funding). The agencies also obtain funds from other governmental units, like the state’s Department of Corrections. This state authority tends to dominate; other state agencies follow its procedures, use its agencies, tend to filter their funds through it, and thus let it generate institutional expectations and constraints. Some agencies also are funded by philanthropies or client insurance.</p>
<p>However, due to a financial shortfall, the substance abuse agencies in this sample were likely to experience market pressures and thus to develop strategies. Data were collected immediately after a period in the early 2000s when tax revenues reached a plateau and state support was problematic. As the state authority froze the support it provided through its central funding mechanism, agencies had incentives to adopt strategies to obtain new funding. Indeed, all but two of the agencies examined below report that they developed strategies to respond to the financial shortfall. The other two already had well-developed strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0899764011431830">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>The analyses heavily rely on data collected from interviews conducted with representatives of 12 nonprofit agencies on the list of state authority providers (Interviews also were conducted at three for-profit or local government agencies). Each agency was located in the central city of the state or in surrounding, suburban counties. Agencies were purposively selected to assure diversity in size (fewer or more service sites), demographic coverage (gender, race and ethnic group), and services (the range of residential and outpatient services). Although agencies often deliver various types of substance abuse services, the interviews usually concentrated on the one selected service. For example, agencies selected to represent outpatient services were asked to only describe trends in those services, even if some such agencies also delivered residential services. In small agencies, one interview generally was conducted with all core staff members. In large agencies, separate interviews generally were conducted with a high ranking administrator and with a treatment supervisor.</p>
<p>Agency-level interviews relied on previously published focused interview schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011431830">Sosin, Smith, Hilton, &amp; Jordan, 2010</xref>). Various questions in the schedule help to describe strategies. For example, agencies respondents were asked if there were changes in the last 3 years in pressures from funding agencies or other parts of the environment; how the changes affected decisions about services; if and how the agency regularly reached out for new funding; whether there were recent changes in such factors as funding, services, and diversification; and whether strategies or other factors lead to those changes.</p>
<p>The study also relies on data from interviews conducted at the state level. The interviewees included the chief state administrator of substance abuse services, the central experts in reporting and tracking services, the prime budget experts in the substance abuse agency, and representatives of the core lobbying group. State-level interviews focus on policies and policy that might motivate agency actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0899764011431830">
<title>Analysis Method</title>
<p>The analyses below in part describe the nuances of service strategies as revealed by the interviews. They also in part summarize formally coded materials that were derived from the agency-level interviews. Members of the interview team independently coded cases. Teamwide discussions then were held to refine the coding categories. The coding and refinement process then was repeated. As will be explained, the current investigator reconsidered the coding during the analysis phase, adding distinctions that reveal the role of social expectations and constraints.</p>
<p>A first set of codes concerning strategy was developed to examine strategies of the agencies as conventionally defined. The relevant data include interview questions that asked how the agencies generally responded to the shortfall and specifically whether the agencies added new services or populations. The codes thus measure whether agency services were stable or whether, in response to the shortfall, the agencies reported adopting the following conventional strategies: adding new funding sources to deal with the shortfall, such as by obtaining funds from insurance programs; adding new populations, for example, by adding services to women if they previously only served men; or adopting new service programs, for example, by adding outpatient services after previously only providing residential services. The codes also measure whether there only was one set of changes or whether strategies involved “rotation”; the regular development of new programs. The coding also documents the source of new revenue and how the population and services changed.</p>
<p>Eventually, the researcher realized that the central analytic issue is whether the strategies actually are fully encompassed by conventional coding categories. For, conventional strategies involve active attempts to use information about possible financial gain to either market or innovate service approaches. However, the interview material suggests that many agencies instead emphasized maintaining legitimacy with state funding authorities. When services changed, the change seemed to be a reward for compliance: relatively passive, “relationship-supporting” behaviors convinced funding agencies to offer new revenue. For example, an agency was asked by the state to add methadone maintenance services in part because of its reputation for being cooperative with procedures, including its ability to quickly spend down revenues provided to it.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a second set of codes was added to measure whether the changes described above were actively pursued through what may be called “innovating strategies,” or conventional business-like strategies under which agencies pursue new revenues, or if they are best characterized as “relationship based.” The latter strategies, which are stressed by the institutional school, are defined as occurring when agencies strive to meet expectations and constraints that help them remain legitimate with funding sources, and when service changes follow.</p>
<p>This new coding is relatively accurate and easy to pursue because each agency was asked to describe its relationships with resource providers and also to describe how a decision was made to alter services or populations. For example, in describing its response to the shortfall, an interviewee suggested that the agency added clients: women referred from the Department of Children and Family Services. However, in responding to the question about relations to the state agency, the interviewee revealed that it did not negotiate with the state to provide a new service. Rather, the agency simply was informed that the new funds would be provided to the agency by the state. (State officials confirmed that this was the procedure.) This provider thus was coded as adopting a relationship strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast, a provider agency executive reported adding gambling anonymous services. When asked about the approach to dealing with the financial shortfall, the executive described how the agency came to conceptualize the services and to actively work to interest county government. This provider agency thus was coded as using an innovative strategy. A third coding category, which describes the types of institutional tactics covered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz and Bielefeld (1998)</xref>, was added to represent the pursuit of funds through political and social means. For example, one agency reported that it was able to garner funding by working with legislative leaders to obtain a line item in the state budget. The analyses also report on abandoned strategies.</p>

<title>Overview of Strategies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011431830">Table 1</xref> shows the basic results from the first set of codes of strategies. Agencies that report multiple strategies are coded multiple times. The results seem to suggest that agencies responded to the shortfall in active ways that mirror conventionally described strategies. No agencies reported remaining fully stable in their financial approaches, whereas four reportedly added services to retain or increase funding (diversification). Six responded with rotation (repeated diversification). Five sought out funds from public agencies other than the substance abuse authority (positioning), and three reportedly received new funding from private sources. Two of these last three altered their mix of services (changing the competitive balance). One obtained public funds to add a service that did not involve substance abuse.</p>

<title>Strategies Theoretically Considered</title>
<sec id="section11-0899764011431830">
<title>Innovating Strategies</title>
<p>The results provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011431830">Table 2</xref> suggest that only seven of the twelve agencies report attempting to rely on innovating strategies. As two of the agencies only report failed strategic attempts, the results suggest that only 5 of the 12 sampled agencies are regular purveyors of these conventional-like strategies.</p>
<sec id="section12-0899764011431830">
<title>New service strategies</title>
<p>Two agencies reportedly undertake new service innovating strategies by which they developed new service models in the pursuit of revenues. In the process, the agencies also may serve unfamiliar populations and obtain financing from a new source (or new contract). This strategy is exemplified by the behavior of the most consistently innovative agency in the sample, which delivers outpatient services in a relatively well-developed, slowly growing suburb. The director reports regularly attempting to find funding for new service ideas, such as for case finding services, whereby the agency tries to locate those needing substance abuse services (the state authority refused to fund this idea). His major success in the period of interest was to obtain funding for gambling addiction services. The agency is located near a publicly sanctioned casino, and the county pays his agency to help clients who self-identify as compulsive casino gamblers. He managed to convince county government in this service-bereft county that his agency’s drug and alcohol addiction services can be modified into gambling addiction services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0899764011431830">
<title>New population strategies</title>
<p>The table suggests that one agency reportedly successfully uses a new population (innovating) strategy by which attracts new funds to provide to new populations its traditional services. The agency delivers outpatient services in the suburbs, largely serving young single people or families who are not as indigent as clients traditionally served in the central city. It has obtained many active managed care contracts, that is, funding from insurance companies. The contracts altered the population (as well as the funding source) but not the service approach, attracting clients who are not quite as poor as the clients subsidized by the state or county. The strategy developed slowly as they agency first sought out a single contract and found, over time, that its low-cost services were in demand by other managed care companies. In contrast, two city agencies tried to implement managed care but failed; contracts could be garnered, but clients refused to use the services. The directors suggest that insurance clients feel uncomfortable in facilities that are dominated by very poor clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0899764011431830">
<title>New funding source strategies</title>
<p>As the results reported in the table further suggest, two agencies use new funding source strategies, obtaining new funds to provide traditional services to traditional populations. One of these, which delivers outpatient services to adolescents, regularly relabels its services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 1998</xref>). The agency seeks out schools that are interested in, and can help obtain foundation funding for, a youth service program. The program is recast for various schools to stress such goals as youth leadership or delinquency prevention.</p>
<p>In sum, these agencies act in manners that are generally consistent with the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011431830">Porter (1980)</xref>. Making strategic choices, they try to diversify services (add the gambling service and fund it from a relatively new source), change the competitive balance (enter a new market with a respected youth development service), or favorably position themselves (as a low-cost supplier). Their success increases their power and improves their market position (they gain options for financing themselves). It is argued below that certain elements of their strategy also reflect identity theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0899764011431830">
<title>Political and social strategies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011431830">Table 2</xref> suggests that two agencies tend to heavily rely on political and social strategies, or active, nonmarket approaches for pursing funds. In brief, one agency developed a special relationship with the state authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011431830">Marwell, 2004</xref>), helps write grants for federal demonstration funds, and then is called on to provide the funded services. The other agency directly lobbies at the legislative level. According to the agency’s director and to a range of other interviewed officials, the agency’s religious approach to service delivery and its focus on a given population (homeless clients), finds favor with many legislators. As the state budget tightens but the caseload expands, the agency on occasion petitions members of the legislature for additional reimbursement. Furthermore, given its strong political position, it serves slightly more clients than allowed in the state’s budget and asks the state authority for reimbursement. (The abandoned social and political strategy involved a buying alliance.) Of course, these strategies are consistent with institutional theory. They demonstrate that the agencies achieve rewards by stressing their socially approved processes: a religious approach or the social ties developed between an agency and the state authority are mobilized to obtain funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0899764011431830">
<title>Relationship Strategies</title>
<p>The results in the table also suggest that all sampled agencies employ relationship strategies, whereby they obtain the resources used to support services by following agreed upon rules and thus gaining legitimacy with funders. That is, consistent with institutional theory, which stresses how following socially approved procedures and delivering socially approved service help to promote receipt of rewards, the relationship and resulting social status engender access to funds.</p>
<p>In some sense, the activities involved in relationship strategies are well known and not surprising. When funded by government, agencies work to meet government requirements: they serve eligible clients, record and submit for reimbursement service encounters, spend all of the allocated funds, and find new clients or modify services when state funding requires it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764011431830">Verbruggen, Christiaens, &amp; Milis, 2011</xref>). Moreover, agencies make sure that they remain in contact with representatives of the state authority so they can report trends in their service area and obtain information concerning government initiatives. Many directors also report spending considerable telephone time discussing problems with case reimbursement records. They also tend to be funded because they deliver socially valued types of services. As a result, the agencies develop a positive relation with the state authority and thus gain legitimacy. However, the less fully documented side of these phenomena is that the relationship enables agencies to obtain new funds. For, the state authority worked with the legislature and federal government during the financial shortfall to obtain special purpose funds. For example, “new” state money was garnered to serve parents who had children in the child welfare system; new Medicaid funds were added; federally-funded demonstration projects were supported. The state authority reallocated the new funds to agencies it perceived as legitimate. It most fully funded agencies held in the highest esteem. A conventional analysis may look at such changes and assume that the agencies actively sought out funds to change their activities, but the changes in service, population, and even funding sources actually reflected state-mandated reforms.</p>
<p>As the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011431830">Table 2</xref> suggest, there are four types of relationship strategies: maintaining revenue, obtaining new funding to serve traditional populations, obtaining new funding to serve new populations, and obtaining new funding to implement new services. The one agency that merely maintained revenues delivers methadone services. It traditionally lacked the clients needed to spend its entire state appropriation (and thus did not have fully legitimate processes), as clients dropped out at alarming rates. Although the agency regained is grounding by altering its programming to deliver services desired by its largely Hispanic clientele (such as counseling about employment and family relations), the state authority was uncertain about its capacity and did not offer additional funding.</p>
<p>Four agencies reportedly were able to obtain additional funding to serve traditional clients. These tend to be agencies that not only were cooperative, but that deliver socially approved services; the state benefited politically and socially from expanding funding to them. For example, another agency that delivered methadone services to the inner city benefited because the state authority was being pressured to increase drug services to inner-city neighborhoods. This agency could help with the expansion as it had ready access to needy clients from a nearby housing project and could quickly expand its internal service capacity, increasing the workload of its large cadre of workers. In some years during the shortfall, then, the agency was allowed to serve more clients than covered in its budget and to obtain reimbursement. In other years it was provided “end of the year money,” that is, money returned by the agencies that failed to spend their appropriation. Its general appropriation also grew as treatment sites were added. (The director of this agency was the only one to report discussing his capacity to change with state authority leaders, so his strategy was mildly “active.”)</p>
<p>Three agencies reportedly received funds to serve population groups they did not previously serve. These agencies received the funds from the special appropriations for mothers of child welfare clients, people on welfare (Medicaid funds), and so forth. These were agencies whose basic services were valued by the state (i.e., services were moderately legitimate). Each was procedurally cooperative and thus had the reputation of being willing to add new clients without altering the basic services. For example, the agency that also lobbies the legislature has multiple treatment sites. When Medicaid funds were expanded, the authority provided it with funds for a new residential program for women on welfare. The agency quickly filled the 30 allowed beds, expanding its existing residential program for women.</p>
<p>Five agencies received funding to implement new services (one such agency also received funding to serve a new population group). Ironically, these usually were low status, if compliant agencies. Enjoying some but not the ultimate level of legitimacy, they were provided small pools of funds that mildly helped them deal with the financial shortfall. One small agency only delivered outpatient services to clients who were eligible for Medicaid reimbursement (handled by the State authority). This agency previously cut back on its services because its parent agency scaled back funding. Nevertheless, the agency was provided modest new support for a case management program funded by a federal demonstration grant. All in all, then, as institutional theory might suggest, agencies cooperate with procedures designed by the state or produce socially valued services. These behaviors provide them legitimacy that, in turn, helps them maintain revenue or obtain new revenue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the finding that the agencies obey state requirements is not surprising, the implications of all of the findings are vast. Among other things, they suggest that previous works overlook that agencies like those examined here seem to rarely engage in market like, active strategies. To be sure, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011431830">Table 1</xref> seems to reveal that virtually every interviewed agency has such an active strategy; one would guess that the many studies that rely on conventional measures to code strategies would conclude from the table that the sampled agencies act in conventional ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011431830">Andreasen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011431830">Shoham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764011431830">Stone, Bigelow, &amp; Crittenden, 1999</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011431830">Table 2</xref>, which uses the detailed coding scheme, suggests that only five of twelve sampled agencies consistently pursue the types of active strategies that regularly occur in markets, which are represented here as innovating strategies.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between current findings of other studies is especially important because it contradicts conventional literature’s suggestion that American nonprofit agencies almost universally employ strategies that are quite similar to what here are called innovating strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011431830">Andreasen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011431830">Shohan et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, this lack of emphasis on innovating strategies occurs even though the sampled agencies operate in environments that might induce then to develop specific strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011431830">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>): they faced a financial shortfall and also were confronted with changes in government rules that forced them to plan separately for each discrete programs and bill for each treatment session. The findings similarly suggest that sampled agencies only rarely pursue the types of social and political strategies that are described in the literature as being regularly pursued by nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011431830">Galaskiewicz &amp; Bielefeld, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The detailed results instead reveal that agencies heavily rely on relationship strategies. Consistent with institutional theory, agencies through these strategies primarily seek to maintain their legitimacy (reputations). Their legitimacy, and the processes developed to sustain it (such as spending down money allocated by government), in turn provide them access to funding—even though agencies do not specifically apply for that funding.</p>
<sec id="section18-0899764011431830">
<title>Businesses and Nonprofit Comparison</title>
<p>It may be argued that literature on social constraints in businesses does describe strategies that overlap with relationship strategies. However, the current thesis would not be jeopardized if it turned out that the business literature, as well as the literature on nonprofit agencies, can benefit by analyzing the role in strategies of social constraints. Further, the types of social constraints and expectations faced by nonprofit agencies (at least by those represented here) seem to lead to unique types of relationship strategies, ones more fully explicated by institutional theory’s insistence that agencies often are rewarded for the social value of their processes and services. For example, cooperation among businesses seems to be more closely monitored and organized around discussions about product quality. A major statement on cooperation in businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764011431830">Gulati &amp; Singh, 1998</xref>) thus suggests that the suppliers of automobile parts are expected to work with the automobile manufacturer to notice quality problems and develop improvements, and that each finished component is evaluated by the manufacturer for quality. Of course, innovating strategies in sampled nonprofit agencies do not involve such discussions and evaluations. More generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764011431830">Frumkin &amp; Kim’s (2001)</xref> study of nonprofit agencies discovers that administrative efficiency is not related to the size of donations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0899764011431830">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>To the extent to which they generalize across nonprofit agencies, the results concerning the centrality of relationship strategies to nonprofit organizations have practical implications. Currently, much literature advises officials in nonprofit agencies to rely on a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011431830">Porter (1980)</xref>-like analysis of competitive advantages or to rely on strategic planning’s market-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011431830">Oster, 1995</xref>) to determine one’s marketing position. However, the current results suggest that such analyses have limited utility. First, those types of analyses are not regularly used by successful agencies in the sample. In fact, on being asked, only three of the agencies (three of those engaged in innovation strategies) reported that they even regularly analyzed the sources of funding received by other agencies, let alone broadly scoured the environment. Second, success among sampled agencies did not depend on determining the actually efficacy of services through a Porter-like or strategic planning-like analysis. Interviewees insist that the state does not directly measure efficacy; consistent with institutional theory, it approves of any services that the “local community” find valuable.</p>
<p>Again consistent with institutional theory, the results suggest that agency officials instead may benefit by recognizing why the agency is valued by the state authority. That is, results suggest that agency executives may beneficially attempt to ensure that they cover the clientele the state desires and provide legitimacy in state eyes by installing prominent people on the board of directors. More generally, agency leaders might beneficially attempt to improve their reputation by meeting state expectations.</p>
<p>Identity theory provides further ideas for managers. For example, results suggest that agencies managers should be aware of agency identities; results suggest that agencies are successful in implement innovating strategies when they add services that are consistent with those identities, so that identity theory as well as strategic choice theory applies. Thus, although the agency obtaining the gambling addiction program was partly successful due to its market, it also made an identity-based argument that addiction services were “very close” to substance abuse services; providing those services was consist with the county government’s perception of agency identity. In contrast, agencies in the central city were not able to benefit from managed care because insurance clients viewed the agencies’ identities are closely tied to serving very poor clients. Managers also may strive to maintain a particularly favored identity. As noted, certain agencies were successful because the state strongly favored their identities, such as their reputations for serving homeless clients and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Agencies also can alter their identity to improve their financial chances. For example, the agency receiving funds for gambling addiction parlayed its reputation for substance abuse services into funding for addiction services. Perhaps agencies also may be advised to collectively work to expand their identities. For example, substance abuse agencies may be able to make the claim that they can handle employment problems of clients who have substance abuse symptoms. For many agencies, this type of minor change in identities may be less risky to pursue than, for example, social enterprise, as it demands less dramatic transformations in social expectations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0899764011431830">
<title>Alternate Explanation</title>
<p>It may be argued that an agency focusing on relationships reflects not the nonprofit status of the agencies but the fact that sampled agencies deliver “human services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764011431830">Hasenfeld &amp; English, 1974</xref>), that is, services provided to people for a social goal. That is, perhaps the inherent nature of serving people requires applying socially determined evaluation criteria and thus encourages funding based on relationships as described by institutional theory and agreed on areas of expertise as described by identity theory. But evidence from the two for-profit providers included in the current sample (but not discussed above) suggests that for-profit human service agencies may adopt different strategies than nonprofit agencies. Thus, one of the two agencies delivers recovery house services, by which clients are provided a residence in a setting in which substance use is forbidden. This agency’s strategy generally is market based: it expands by locating paying clients and increasing its market share (increasing its market power in strategic and resource dependency terms). In fact, clients who cannot pay are asked to leave. (To be sure, it also passively benefitted from the decision by the director of the substance abuse authority to increase funding for recovery homes.) The second for-profit agency was part of a national chain of residential programs serving adults with drug problems. According to the interviewed official, its general strategy was to develop “product lines,” several of which were represented in the local substance abuse agency (again, gaining an advantage based on the output it produces). Its basic strategy was innovating in the sense that, when there were empty beds, the agency searched for funding to fill them. For example, the agency actively sought out funding from a subcontract from the city to serve clients in an SRO as well as funding from a local outpatient substance abuse provider to serve corrections clients (the funds emanate from the DOC). Further, the agency actively recruits clients when considering the financial return, stressing serving clients who provide the highest reimbursement rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0899764011431830">
<title>Generalization</title>
<p>As the sample was selected to maximize differentiation from businesses, its results need to be confirmed in a broad population of agencies. However, although evidence is not definitive, existing literature provides reasons to suspect that many agencies that adopt active strategies may be similarly bound by the institutional environment and by their identity. They change more dramatically than the studied agencies, but that may reflect institutional or identity change in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011431830">Frumkin &amp; Reingold, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011431830">Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011431830">Sosin et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, institutional and identity theory suggest that change more readily occurs under four conditions that seem to describe the external factors allowing for change in nonprofit agencies: when the environment is undergoing institutional change (expectations and constraints alter), when there are conflicts among key sources of legitimacy in the environment (e.g., when funding agencies have different criteria), when status changes occur (identities gain and lose popularity), and when identities are in flux (defining characteristics of agencies change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011431830">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011431830">Oliver, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011431830">Polos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764011431830">Reuf &amp; Patterson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764011431830">Table 3</xref> provides some questions that executives might ask to help develop strategies that take into account their institutional environments and organizational identities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are many limits to this as to any exploratory study. Given that interviews occurred during a financial shortfall in one state and only involved one type of services, there is a possibility that different strategies may emerge from studying other areas and situations. As noted, as agencies were selected to contrast with conventional businesses, findings need to be further verified in studies of other samples. Still, the basic findings of the study may generalize to many nonprofit agencies. For example, in light of evidence from the literature suggesting that cooperation with funding sources is important for nonprofit agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011431830">Van Slyke, 2007</xref>), relationship strategies may be central to many agencies. Furthermore, other literature, like the current study, suggests that even those nonprofit agencies adopting innovating strategies tend to take into account social constraints and expectations. For example, some literature suggests that very large agencies tend to rely on a small range of funding sources, to retain a narrow mission, and thus apparently to maintain an identity and provide services that are in keeping with popular institutional arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011431830">Foster &amp; File, 2007</xref>). In any case, results of the current analyses suggest that executives of many nonprofit agencies should be encouraged to analyze their agency’s identity and the institutional arrangements that allow for legitimation.</p>
