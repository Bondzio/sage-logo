<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing attitudes toward sexual activity among early adolescents in Japan. A total of 1,551 students aged 12 to 14 years at 4 junior high schools were divided into either a conservative or liberal group. Results of chi-square tests showed that the liberal group had higher percentages of students with drinking, smoking, and sexual activity than the conservative group. The liberal group also had more dating partners and friends with sexual experiences than the conservative group. Unpaired <italic>t</italic> test indicated that the liberal group rated lower than the conservative group in talking to their parents about life and AIDS and teachers listening to their opinions. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis showed that smoking, experience with sex, talking to parents about AIDS, teachers listening to participants’ opinion, older dating partners, and friends with sexual experiences were all significant predictors of attitude toward sexual activity.</p>

<p>Early adolescents are affected by various environmental influences when developing their values. In addition, they are at risk of developing various health problems, such as those related to the use of alcohol and tobacco, sexual intercourse, depression/suicide, antisocial behavior, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611435116">Fulkerson et al., 2006</xref>). Based on the results of a 2005 survey by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611435116">Japanese Association for Sex Education (2007)</xref>, it was found that there is a sharp increase in the rate of teenage Japanese males and females with sexual experience from 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively, among early adolescents (aged 13-15 years) to 26.6% and 30.0%, respectively, among late adolescents (aged 16-18 years). Sexuality is an important and complex area of early adolescent health. Commencement of sexual intercourse leads to the risk of problems such as teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In particular, one of the most serious health outcomes related to early sexual initiation for youth in Japan is autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Japan has the most rapidly increasing number of AIDS patients among developed countries. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611435116">Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare AIDS Trend Committee (2008)</xref>, the total number of HIV- and/or AIDS-infected people in Japan, including adolescents and young adults went from 1,680 in 1998 to 13,894 at the end of 2007. Furthermore, the annual number of young people under 25 years of age with new HIV infection has risen from 47 in 1998 to 131 in 2007. Despite such serious health outcomes for young adults in Japan, little work has been done concerning factors that influence the commencement of sexual activity among young people.</p>
<p>The present study investigated Japanese adolescents’ attitudes toward sexual activity rather than sexual behavior for two reasons. First, we explored such attitudes by utilizing the framework of the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611435116">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). In the domain of sexual behavior, the theory of planned behavior has been widely used to explain health-related attitudes, intentions, and behavior. According to this theory, one’s behavior is predicted by one’s intention and attitude. Therefore, sexual behavior is largely influenced by one’s attitudes toward and intention to engage in sexual activity. Indeed, previous researchers concluded that sexual intentions are among the strongest predictors of an adolescent’s future sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611435116">Kinsman, Romer, Furstenberg &amp; Schwartz, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, differences in the adolescents’ motives for pursuing sex are related to the types of sexual contact pursued with committed versus casual partners, few versus many partners, planned versus unplanned sex, and protected versus unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611435116">Cooper, Shapiro, &amp; Powers, 1998</xref>). Another study using Korean college student reported that premarital sexual attitude and referent group norms predicted intention of premarital sex for both female and male students. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611435116">Cha, Doswell, Kim, Charron-Prochownik, &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>). Second, according to the study by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611435116">Japan Family Planning Association (2008)</xref>, the average age of first intercourse is 19 years. Therefore, studying about attitudes toward sexual activity is more meaningful than investigating sexual behavior for young adolescents in Japan. Furthermore, to date, there is no investigation that explored such attitudes in Japan, so it is worthy of study. Therefore, the present study investigated factors influencing attitudes toward sexual activity among early adolescents in Japan.</p>
<p>Based on the results of national and international studies conducted on adolescents, the elements influencing the sexual activity of early adolescents include the social factors as well as individual factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611435116">Wong et al. (2009)</xref> described these social factors as “ecological” factors, such as family, school, dating partners, and friends. As suggested by this research, we examined both ecological and individual factors previously associated with attitudes toward sexual activity. This study’s predictors include are risky experience, such as drinking and smoking during the previous 3 months, self-esteem, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, frequency of eating dinner with family, frequency of communication with family/teachers, presence of dating partner and friend with sexual experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431611435116">
<title>Risky Experience (Drinking, Smoking, and Sexual Intercourse)</title>
<p>Previous researchers found that adolescents with sexual experience are more likely than virgins to participate in other behaviors, such as smoking and drinking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611435116">Silver &amp; Bauman, 2006</xref>). In Estonia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611435116">Part, Rahu, Rahu, and Karro (2011)</xref> also found that smoking and experience in drunkenness were strongly related to sexual intercourse for young adolescents. Similarly, using Japanese high school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al. (2005)</xref> found that the sexual activity of girls in late adolescence is influenced by smoking/drinking. Therefore, it is hypothesized that early adolescents who have had risky experiences would tend to have a more liberal attitude toward sexual activity than those who have not had risky experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0272431611435116">
<title>Self-Esteem</title>
<p>Self-esteem may be associated with attitudes toward sexual activity. In general, adolescents with higher self-esteem are more likely to abstain from sexual activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611435116">Johnson, Rozmus, &amp; Edmission, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611435116">Denny and Young (2006)</xref> reported that students who attended classes designed to delay sexual activity by focusing on improvement of self-esteem commenced sexual activity at a later age when compared to those who did not attend such classes. Therefore, although these studies were done using late adolescents and young adults in Western societies, it was hypothesized that self-esteem would be significantly related to attitudes toward sexual activity. In particular, early adolescents with higher self-esteem tended to show more conservative attitude toward sexual activity than liberal adolescents did.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272431611435116">
<title>Knowledge of HIV/AIDS</title>
<p>Early adolescents who received the AIDS intervention by the health professionals had greater AIDS knowledge, less favorable attitudes toward risky sexual behavior, and lower intentions to engage in such behavior than did those in a control condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611435116">Jemmott, Jemmott, &amp; Fong, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431611435116">Tokuhisa and Yamada (2009)</xref> concluded that increased knowledge about HIV infection improved the intention of not engaging in sexual behavior. These results suggested that interventions that increase such knowledge may have salutary effects on adolescents’ attitudes toward engaging in risky sexual behavior. Therefore, it is hypothesized that early adolescents with higher knowledge about HIV/AIDS may tend to show more conservative attitude than those with lower knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272431611435116">
<title>Eating Dinner With Family</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611435116">Fulkerson et al. (2006)</xref> showed that adolescents who frequently eat dinner with their family exhibit less sexual activity, antisocial behavior, and risky behavior such as drinking and smoking along with higher self-esteem in comparison to those who did not eat dinner with their family. Similarly, using Japanese high school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al. (2005)</xref> found that active sexual behavior was related to irregular meal habits at home. Therefore, it is hypothesized that early adolescents who frequently eat dinner with their family would tend to be more conservative toward sexual activity in comparison to those who do not eat dinner with their family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272431611435116">
<title>Communication With Family and School Teacher</title>
<p>High-quality parent–adolescent communication about sexual matters has been related to abstinence from sexual activity and less frequent sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611435116">Jaccard, Dittus, &amp; Gordon, 1996</xref>). The more frequent communication between male adolescents and their mothers about birth control, more consistent is their use of birth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611435116">Miller, Forehand, Kotchik, 1999</xref>). Using British-born Chinese teenagers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431611435116">Yu (2007)</xref> concluded that Chinese parents need extra support to communicate about sex-related issues to encourage sexual abstinence. In Japan, parents and school teachers feel uncomfortable about participating in investigations of adolescents’ sexual behavior, resulting in a small number of studies on this issue. Parents and school teachers even showed negative feelings about discussing adolescents’ sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611435116">Nagamatsu, Ozaki, Takedomi, &amp; Sato, 2007</xref>). A survey involving Japanese high school students revealed that parental supervision, parental disapproval of sexual behavior, and communication with their children about AIDS delayed the initiation of sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611435116">Nagamatsu, Saito, &amp; Sato, 2008</xref>). Other surveys conducted in Japan have shown that the low sexual activity of girls in late adolescence is greatly influenced by the good relationship between parents and the parent–adolescent relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). Other studies also show that communication with teachers and school-based interventions have influenced adolescents’ sexual behavior. For instance, a school-based intervention, called “Safer Choices,” reduced one or more measures of risky sexual behaviors among all groups of youth and was especially effective for males, Hispanics, and youth who engaged in unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431611435116">Kirby et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is hypothesized that early adolescents who communicate with their parents and teachers more frequently would tend to have a more conservative attitude toward sexual activity in comparison to those who have less frequent communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272431611435116">
<title>Presence of Friend With Sexual Experience and Dating Partner</title>
<p>Adolescents’ sexual behavior is not only influenced by the relationship with their parents but also with their friends. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431611435116">Walter et al. (1992)</xref> suggest that adolescents’ beliefs regarding their friends’ engagement in risky sexual behavior may be related to their own engagement in sexual behavior. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431611435116">Prinstein, Meade, and Cohen (2003)</xref> found that perceptions of best friends’ oral sex behavior were significantly associated with adolescents’ own behavior. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611435116">Kinsman et al. (1998)</xref> suggested that presence of friends who already have experienced sexual activity induced teenagers to engage in sexual activity. Another factor that may influence early adolescents’ sexual attitudes may be presence of dating partners. Among Japanese high school students, dating partners and friends with sexual experience both had significant influence on teens’ sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is hypothesized that early adolescents without dating partners and friends with sexual experience will tend to show more conservative attitudes toward sexual activity than those with liberal attitudes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0272431611435116">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The junior high schools that participated in this study were located in the Saga Prefecture (Japan), which is a rural district with an area of 2,439 km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 866,000. The schools were randomly selected, and the survey involved students from four schools who agreed to participate in this study. Each school was a medium-sized public junior high school with 100 to 250 students per year. During a period of 2 months (from November to December in 2007), an anonymous questionnaire survey was sent to 1,551 students aged 12 to 14 years at the four schools. Of the 1,551 students, 150 (9.7%) students could not get parental consent and 322 (20.7%) students who did not agree to participate were excluded from this study. Thus, a total of 1,079 (69.6%) students agreed to participate in this study (535 males and 544 females). Among students who agreed to participate, some students were excluded from the analyses because they did not answer the majority of measurements, including the attitude toward sexual activity, which is the dependent measure of this study (<italic>n</italic> = 242).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272431611435116">
<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section10-0272431611435116">
<title>Attitude toward sexual activity</title>
<p>This measure consists of three parts: (1) Current attitude toward sexual activity, (2) Intention to delay sexual activity (until graduation from high school), and (3) Rejecting sexual advances (if you are asked to engage in sexual activity). For the first item, students were asked to rate the following question, “Do you accept the idea of having sex while in junior high school?,” by indicating 1 = <italic>Yes (I do)</italic> or 0 = <italic>No (I do not)</italic>. For the second item, respondents answered the question, “Do you intend to delay sexual activity until graduation from high school?,” by showing 1 = <italic>Yes (I do)</italic> or 0 = <italic>No (I do not)</italic>. For the third item, students responded to the question, “Can you reject sexual advances if you are asked?,” by indicating 1 = <italic>Yes (I can reject it)</italic> or 0 = <italic>No (I can not).</italic> Because a higher score for the first item indicates one’s liberal attitude toward sexual activity and a higher score for the second and last items represent a conservative attitude, the first item was reversed. Then, all three items were summed. Thus, this dependent measure ranged from 0 to 3. A lower score represents a more liberal attitude toward sexual activity, whereas a higher score represents a more conservative attitude.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0272431611435116">
<title>Risky experience during the previous 3 months (Alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse)</title>
<p>We used the following three questions to evaluate risky behavior with respect to alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse during the previous 3 months: (1) Have you consumed alcohol within the past 3 months? (2) Have you smoked within the past 3 months? (3) Have you had sexual intercourse within the past 3 months? In the present study, these questions were presented separately. Students selected one answer from the following two alternatives: 1 = <italic>Yes (I have)</italic> or 0 = <italic>No (I have not).</italic></p>

<sec id="section12-0272431611435116">
<title>Self-esteem</title>
<p>The General Self-Esteem Scale (α = .78; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431611435116">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>) was used to assess respondents’ self-esteem and consisted of 10 items. It was translated into Japanese by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611435116">Hoshino (1970)</xref>, and its validity has been demonstrated with Japanese participants (α = .75). This scale has been commonly used for school education to investigate high-risk behavior, such as sexual behavior and relevant factors, in Japanese junior high school and high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611435116">Kawabata et al., 2007</xref>). The response options ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). All 10 items were summed, and the total score ranged from 10 to 40 points with higher scores indicating higher self-esteem.</p>

<title>Knowledge of HIV/AIDS</title>
<p>This scale was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611435116">Kelly (1989)</xref> and is comprised of 40 items. This scale was translated into Japanese by Matsumoto and Takeda. Twenty items were deleted from the original scale that did not fit with Japanese culture, and the Japanese version of the scale was created with 30 items, comprising 20 items from Kelly’s scale and 10 new items regarding knowledge of HIV and AIDS. They reported that 14 of the 30 items showed a high level of appropriateness for evaluating knowledge of HIV/AIDS (α = .67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611435116">Matsumoto &amp; Takeda, 2003</xref>). We used the scale comprising these 14 items with permission from the copyright owner. In 2006, our preliminary test participants aged 13 to 14 years showed a low response rate for 4 of the 14 items. Therefore, we used a shortened version of the scale with 10 items, and we confirmed that it was appropriate for 13- to 14-year-old students in 2007 (α = .69); the possible total score for this scale ranges from 0 to 10 points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611435116">Nagamatsu, Sato, Nakagawa, &amp; Saito, 2011</xref>) with higher scores indicating higher knowledge of HIV/AIDS.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Saga University Medical School. Approval of each school principal was also obtained. The authors distributed an explanatory document, the questionnaires, and consent forms to school teachers. The explanatory document contained instructions on how to distribute and retrieve the questionnaires. It emphasized the confidentiality of material in the questionnaires, which were sealed before retrieval. The consent form contained a detailed explanation of the objectives of the research, the confidentiality of all information, the freedom to refuse to participate, and contact information for the researchers. Before the survey was conducted, a letter and a consent form were distributed to the parents/guardians via the students. Students could only participate after parental consent was obtained. If a student did not want to participate in the survey, he or she could refuse to pass on the consent form. The student could also refuse to participate in the survey, even if parental consent had been obtained. It was explained at the beginning that students could leave the classroom if they did not feel like participating in the survey. The survey was only conducted when a student and his or her parents or guardian gave consent. Students were told that they did not have to submit the questionnaire unless they wished to, and students who did not assent were not forced to complete or submit the questionnaire.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611435116">Table 1</xref> represents the descriptive data, such as means, standard deviations, and percentage of all examined variables. In the present study, students were divided into either “conservative” or “liberal” groups to investigate whether or not there were differing patterns on some factors that may have been related to the attitudes toward sexual intercourse. Participants, who scored 2 or more on the Attitude Toward Sexual Activity Scale, were grouped into the conservative group, and participants who scored less than 2 were grouped into the liberal group. Because some factors were assessed with categorical data (e.g., gender of participants, risky experience, and presence of dating partners) and others with continuum data (e.g., self-esteem, knowledge about HIV/AIDS, frequency of eating dinner and communicating with family, and frequency of communicating with teachers), both chi-square test and unpaired <italic>t</italic> test were performed.</p>

<p>To investigate the difference in continuum data between liberal and conservative groups, the unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted. As for communication with teachers, the results indicated that the liberal group–rated teachers listening to their opinion in the past 3 months was significantly lower than the conservative group. For the family factors, such as eating dinner and communication with family, an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was performed. The results showed that four items in the communicating with family measure, such as talking to parents in general, talking to parents about life, AIDS, and listening to their opinion in the past 3 months were all significantly lower in the liberal group than in the conservative group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to frequency of dinner with family, self-esteem, and knowledge of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the effects of ecological factors on attitudes toward sexual activity, a multiple regression analysis was performed on the dependent variable, which is the summary of the three items of the attitude toward sexual activity. The results of this analysis are summarized in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431611435116">Table 3</xref>. Prior to this regression analysis, a correlation analysis was performed among all tested variables to check the possibility of multicollinearity issue. The results showed that the highest relationship was between “talking to teacher about life” and “talking to teacher about AIDS” (<italic>r</italic> = .53, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001), thus negating the concern of multicollinearity. The independent variables were categorized into five areas: (1) individual factor (alcohol use, cigarette smoking, sexual intercourse, self-esteem, and knowledge of HIV/AIDS), (2) family factor (frequency of eating dinner with the family, frequency of communication with the family), (3) school factor (frequency of communication with teachers), (4) dating partner factor, and (5) peer factor (friends with sexual experience). Because this is an exploratory investigation, all factors were entered simultaneously. The model <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic was .203 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). It showed that smoking (β = –.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), experience in sex (β = –.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), friends with sexual experience (β = –.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the presence of an older individual as dating partner (β = –.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were all significant predictors of more liberal attitudes toward sexual activity, whereas talking to parents about AIDS (β = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and teachers listening to participants’ opinion (β = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significant predictors of more conservative attitudes; that is, participants who smoke less frequently, had less experience with sex, more frequent communication about AIDS with parents, more strongly viewed their teachers listening to their opinions, had more friends with sexual experience, and who were not dating/who never dated an older individual had more conservative attitudes toward sexual activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing attitudes toward sexual activity among early adolescents in Japan. In particular, we examined the predictive factors of individual, family, school, dating partners, and peers on attitudes toward sexual activity. We found that adolescents with liberal attitudes toward sex tended to have more experience in alcohol drinking, smoking, and sexual activity than adolescents with conservative attitudes. Liberal adolescents also tended to have more same-aged and older dating partners and friends with sexual experiences than conservative adolescents. Furthermore, adolescents with conservative attitudes tended to have more frequent communication with parents in general and more discussion about life and AIDS and feel strongly about their parents/teachers listening to their opinion than did adolescents with liberal attitudes. In addition, we found that smoking, experience with sexual activity, talking to parents about AIDS, teachers listening to adolescents’ opinions, and the presence of older dating partners and friends with sexual experience were all significant predictors of attitudes toward sexual activity. We summarize our findings in the Discussion section on the basis of the ecological factors we examined.</p>
<sec id="section22-0272431611435116">
<title>Individual Factor</title>
<p>In line with the hypotheses, the results indicated that adolescents with risky experiences tended to show more liberal attitudes toward current sexual activity in comparison to adolescents without risky experiences. These findings are consistent with an earlier study on Japanese late adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). However, alcohol use did not predict sexual attitudes for youth despite the correlation between risk behaviors that is so often reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611435116">Part et al., 2011</xref>). Such inconsistency may be related to cultural norms of drinking and smoking in Japan. For instance, to purchase cigarettes or alcohol drinks at stores, one is required to present documentation that verifies his or her age. However, both cigarettes and alcohol drinks are also available from vending machines. As for cigarettes, a special identification card (ID), called “Taspo” has been created to prevent underaged individuals from buying cigarettes from vending machines. A strict age verification process must take place to obtain Taspo, and only Taspo card holders can buy cigarettes from vending machines. However, there is no similar ID available to buy alcoholic beverages from vending machines. Thus, accessing cigarettes is much more difficult for Japanese teenagers than accessing alcoholic drinks, which may be the reason why prevalence of drinking among Japanese junior high school students (20.5%) is much higher than smoking (5.1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431611435116">Osaki et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431611435116">2009</xref>). Similar prevalence rates were found in this study (e.g., 15% of participants admitted drinking, and only 2.8% admitted smoking). We speculate that such tolerant attitudes toward alcohol in Japan may influence findings inconsistent with other societies. In addition, prior sexual behavior also predicted a liberal sexual attitude. This finding is consistent with the theory of planned behavior.</p>
<p>Self-esteem was not a significant predictor of attitudes toward sexual activity. In general, individuals with high self-esteem would express themselves according to their own standard and values without being influenced by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611435116">Hoshino, 1970</xref>). Therefore, we had to speculate which inconsistency in this study is similar to the ones found in prior studies vis-à-vis self-esteem, because self-esteem is contingent on values and standards that individuals adhere to. In other words, sexual attitude may be more influenced by one’s values and standard than one’s self-esteem. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611435116">Rozmus and Edgil (1993)</xref> concluded that the values of an exciting life and pleasure were related to an increase in high-risk behaviors, whereas the value of health was related to a decrease in high-risk behaviors. Furthermore, the results of the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611435116">Werner-Wilson (1998)</xref> showed that religious belief had a greater influence than self-esteem over attitudes toward sexual expression. Since this study did not investigate personal values, it is worthwhile to further examine the relationship between self-esteem, personal values, and attitudes toward sexual activity, using Japanese adolescents.</p>
<p>Contrary to our hypothesis, knowledge of HIV/AIDS was not a significant factor to predict attitude toward sexual activity. This finding is inconsistent with other studies, including a study that assessed Japanese participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). We speculate that such inconsistency may be associated with developmental issues. For instance, the study by Inoue et al. was conducted among high school students, whereas our study used junior high school students. In Japan, the prevalence of sexual intercourse for junior high school students is 3.9%, whereas it is 28.3% for high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611435116">Japanese Association for Sex Education, 2007</xref>). Such difference in the prevalence of sexual intercourse may influence one’s perception of HIV/AIDS. That is, early adolescents, in comparison to late adolescents or young adults, may not feel that HIV/AIDS is one of the realistic concerns for them given that the majority of them do not engage in sexual intercourse. Future research is needed to examine our speculation by comparing attitudes between early and late adolescents.</p>

<title>Dating Partner Factor</title>
<p>As hypothesized, having a dating partner, particularly an older dating partner, was related to a more liberal attitude toward sexual activity. The influence of social status is an important motive for adolescent sexual activity, signaling to oneself and others the realization of a much-desired adult sexual status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431611435116">O’Sullivan, Meyer-Bahlburg, &amp; Watkins, 2000</xref>). Among girls, sex is associated with one of the socially important issues, such as having a boyfriend and being in love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611435116">O’Sullivan, &amp; Meyer-Bahlburg, 2003</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611435116">Arbeau, Galambos, and Jansson (2007)</xref> reported that adolescents who were dating an older partner felt older than their actual age in comparison to adolescents who were dating a same-age partner. Thus, regardless of whether or not adolescents encounter implicit or explicit peer pressure to engage in sex, they may be motivated to pursue such activity simply to conform to the much-desired “adult sexual status.”</p>

<title>Peer Factor</title>
<p>The present study showed the predictive influence of the presence of friends with sexual experience on liberal attitudes toward sexual activity. This is consistent with the results found in previous studies; for example, having sexually experienced friends is associated with the respondents’ more liberal sexual behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611435116">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611435116">Kinsman et al., 1998</xref>). A recent study showed that conforming to peer norms, coercion from sexual partners, and intoxication were common reasons for a premature and unwanted first experience of sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611435116">Skinner, Smith, Fenwick, Fyfe, &amp; Hendriks, 2008</xref>). A significant factor leading to sex among adolescents is lack of confidence to resist peer pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611435116">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is suggested that early Japanese adolescents are also influenced by friends with experience of sex and may want to adopt their values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0272431611435116">
<title>Family Factor</title>
<p>Unexpectedly, the results of this study did not support that adolescents with conservative attitudes toward sexual activity tended to eat dinner with their family more frequently in comparison to those with liberal attitudes. This may be due to the fact that the majority of the previous studies investigated the relationship between frequency of family dinner and sexual behavior rather than sexual attitude. Further research is necessary to replicate our finding to confirm the relationship between meal habit and attitudes toward sexual activity.</p>
<p>Adolescents with conservative attitudes also tended to have more discussion with their parents in general, talking about life and AIDS, and feel strongly about their parents listening to their opinions compared to the adolescents with liberal attitudes. In particular, high frequency of talking to parents about AIDS was related to a conservative attitude. This is consistent with the results of a study that parental supervision of children aged 16 years or younger, parental disapproval of sexual behavior, and communication with parents about AIDS delayed the start of sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611435116">Nagamatsu et al., 2008</xref>). This is an interesting finding because their knowledge of the HIV/AIDS and talking about HIV/AIDS with teachers were not significant predictors, whereas communication about HIV/AIDS with their family was. This is a strong indication that HIV/AIDS education at home, rather than education at school, is one of the effective ways to prevent early sexual activity. However, there are some obstacles to implement such intervention at home. For instance, speaking with parents about sexual matters is extremely rare in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611435116">Nagamatsu et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611435116">Saito et al. (2009)</xref> have pointed out that Japanese parents and teachers did not receive appropriate sex education when they were adolescents and often do not possess accurate knowledge about AIDS. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431611435116">Takedomi et al. (2003)</xref> showed that sex education, such as HIV/AIDS, sexual activity, and use of contraception, was not adequately provided at home by parents. Yet it is important for parents to comfortably talk to their children about sex and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, sex education should be targeted to parents as well, so that they can communicate on this topic with their teens at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0272431611435116">
<title>School Factor</title>
<p>Interestingly, teachers’ discussion of HIV/AIDS with students did not lead to a conservative attitude toward sex, whereas such discussion with parents did lead to a conservative attitude. This may be because there may be greater variability in parent communication about AIDS/HIV due to intimacy between family members as opposed to the lack of it in a typical student–teacher relationship, in which imparting such information more likely targets a group of students. Furthermore, high frequency of teachers listening to adolescent’s opinions was a strong predictor of a more conservative sexual attitude. Thus, we recommend educators show caring behavior toward students by listening to their opinions rather than just talk about HIV/AIDS to increase knowledge to influence adolescents’ attitudes toward sexual activity.</p>

<title>Limitations of This Study</title>
<p>This study had some limitations. We did not investigate students from other parts of Japan to assess regional differences. Therefore, replication of the findings of this study should be sought by using early adolescents from other regions. Also, the participants were exclusively Japanese; thus, our findings may not be relevant or generalizable to adolescents in other countries. Research conducted in the United States over the past decade has also shown that the initiation of sexual activity is influenced by age, gender, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, and parent–adolescent relationship, which includes parental activities such as communication, values, monitoring, control, and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431611435116">Meschke, Bartholomae, &amp; Zentall, 2002</xref>). However, in the present study, we did not include such demographic factors into the analyses. This is because we could not get permission from public junior high school principals to seek information from parents, for example information about parents’ income and marital status, . In future studies, such demographic information should be obtained and tested in order to examine their influence over sexual attitudes of adolescents in Japan. Furthermore, because this study is cross-sectional in nature, it would be useful for future studies to longitudinally follow participants as they go through different phases of relationships, for example, with family, school, peers, and dating partners.</p>
