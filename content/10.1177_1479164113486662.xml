<abstract>
<p>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, plays a role in endothelial dysfunction, an initial step of atherosclerosis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) also contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. However, a pathophysiological crosstalk between ADMA and AGEs remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between ADMA and AGE level in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetic nephropathy. We also examined whether and how AGEs increased ADMA generation by cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Plasma ADMA levels were positively associated with serum AGE level and were inversely correlated with endothelial function determined by flow-mediated vasodilatation. AGEs dose dependently increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ECs, which was blocked by antisense DNA raised against receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Furthermore, AGEs decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) level of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase <italic>(DDAH)-II</italic>, an enzyme for ADMA degradation, reduced its total enzymatic activity and resultantly increased ADMA, all of which were completely blocked by an antioxidant, <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine. These results suggest that the AGE-RAGE-mediated ROS generation could be involved in endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ESRD patients partly by increasing the ADMA generation via suppression of DDAH activity in ECs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reducing sugars such as glucose can react non-enzymatically with amino groups of proteins to form Amadori products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113486662">1</xref></sup> Over the course of days to weeks, these Amadori products undergo further rearrangement reactions to form irreversibly cross-linked senescent macroprotein derivatives called advanced glycation end products (AGEs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113486662">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164113486662"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113486662">3</xref></sup> The formation and accumulation of AGEs have been known to progress at an accelerated rate under diabetes, especially in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113486662">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that AGEs elicit oxidative stress generation in various cell types through the interaction with a receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and subsequently evoke inflammatory and thrombogenic reactions, thereby contributing to accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164113486662">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164113486662"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164113486662">6</xref></sup> Therefore, AGEs may be one of the causative factors that could explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetic patients with ESRD.</p>

All patients received insulin injection for the treatment of blood glucose. All patients received anti-hypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blockers (n = 12), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 2) and calcium channel blockers (n = 14). Four patients were treated with statins. The protocol was approved by the ethical committee of our institution and informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that plasma ADMA level was associated with circulating AGE level and was inversely correlated with endothelial function in type 2 diabetic patients with ESRD due to nephropathy. The findings have extended the previous observations showing that serum AGE level was positively associated with ADMA level in non-diabetic patients with early stage chronic kidney disease (CKD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164113486662">17</xref></sup> and that AGE level was correlated with endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113486662">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113486662">19</xref></sup> Moreover, we also found here for the first time that (1) AGEs reduced <italic>DDAH-II</italic> mRNA level and resultantly suppressed DDAH enzymatic activity and ADMA generation in cultured aortic ECs, all of which were blocked by the treatment of an antioxidant NAC, and (2) AGE-induced ROS generation was reduced by antisense DNAs raised against RAGE mRNA. Therefore, although we did not find here the direct correlation between serum AGE level and endothelial function probably due to small sample size, given that AGEs have exerted pleiotropic actions on a variety of cells via ROS generation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164113486662">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164113486662">20</xref></sup> our present observations suggest that the AGE-RAGE-mediated ROS generation could be involved in endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients with ESRD partly by increasing the ADMA generation via suppression of <italic>DDAH-II</italic> expression in ECs.</p>
<p><italic>DDAH-II</italic> is a dominant isoform of DDAH in ECs, which could mainly degrade ADMA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164113486662">21</xref></sup> DDAH enzymatic activity in ECs has been shown to be suppressed under oxidative stress conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164113486662">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>DDAH-II</italic> gene is reported to inhibit the elevation of ADMA level and, subsequently, to improve endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164113486662">23</xref></sup> Since there is accumulating evidence that increased plasma level of ADMA is associated with endothelial dysfunction, carotid intima media thickness and CVD in high-risk subjects such as patients with diabetes and CKD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479164113486662">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1479164113486662"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479164113486662">26</xref></sup> the present findings suggest that oxidative stress generation-mediated <italic>DDAH-II</italic> suppression, which is evoked by the AGE-RAGE system, could contribute to ADMA accumulation and accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients with ESRD. Small interference RNAs raised against <italic>DDAH-II</italic> significantly inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation of rat mesenteric arterioles, whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA) against <italic>DDAH-I</italic> had lesser effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479164113486662">27</xref></sup> thus supporting our speculation. However, vascular endothelial-specific <italic>DDAH-I</italic>-deficient mice have also been shown to exhibit an increase in ADMA concentration associated with attenuated endothelial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479164113486662">28</xref></sup> Therefore, although AGEs did not affect <italic>DDAH-I</italic> mRNA level in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113486662">Figure 3</xref>), we cannot totally exclude the possibility that AGEs could affect <italic>DDAH-I</italic>enzymatic activity in ECs because there is no reliable method to measure the activity of <italic>DDAH-I</italic> and <italic>DDAH-II</italic> separately.</p>
<p>Although we did not have the data of circulating levels of AGEs in diabetic patients with almost normal kidney function, several articles have already shown that circulating level of AGEs is significantly increased as the renal function deteriorated in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1479164113486662">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479164113486662">30</xref></sup> These observations suggest that the crosstalk between the AGE-RAGE axis and ADMA-DDAH system observed in cell culture system could apply to ‘diabetic patients with ESRD’.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that the AGE-RAGE-mediated ROS generation could be involved in endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients with ESRD by increasing the ADMA generation via suppression of <italic>DDAH-II</italic> expression and its activity in ECs. AGE-ADMA-DDAH axis may be a therapeutic target for preventing accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients.</p>
