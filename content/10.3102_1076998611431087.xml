<p>Herbert Weisberg's <italic>Causation and Bias</italic> integrates approaches to causal inference across several disciplines in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. The book adopts the potential response approach as its primary framework but places it in a broader context of causally heterogeneous populations. From this starting point, the book develops an integrative vocabulary and conceptual framework that spans both disciplines and research designs, from randomized controlled trials to passive observational studies. Throughout the book, Weisberg illuminates the strong and sometimes implausible simplifying assumptions at the root of widely applied formalizations from classical test theory to propensity score analysis. Along the way, Weisberg gently compiles a compelling case against taking randomized experiments as the gold standard for causal inquiry. An overemphasis on randomized experiments sacrifices external validity to internal. It neglects topics less amenable to randomized control. It downgrades other designs that can do a better job of bringing to light plausible causal explanations. It encourages black box evaluations that tell us little about how and under what conditions an intervention works. It slows the growth of cumulative knowledge and hinders the clear understanding of causal processes in causally heterogeneous populations.</p>
<p>Every book has its limitations. An early chapter criticizes empiricism for dismissing causation but then adopts an approach to causation deeply rooted in empiricist thinking, based on an austere ontology in which the universe contains no more than individual things and their individual properties. Weisberg thoughtfully recognizes that potential response theory does not provide a definition of causation and supplements it with Rothman's sufficient component cause model. Unfortunately, Rothman's model appears to fare no better at providing a noncircular definition of causation. The model begins by postulating all conditions that can precipitate an event, thus presupposing causal knowledge at its foundation. Likewise, it remains unclear how to reconcile this notion of causation with the treatment of causal effects in later chapters that assumes that the treatment variable does not cause the outcome variable for cases that would experience a positive outcome with or without treatment (immune cases) or a negative outcome with or without treatment (doomed cases). Given that the goals and methods of the book are primarily methodological rather than philosophical, perhaps such issues fall outside the intended scope of the work. However, the limitation illustrates the soft conceptual underbelly that characterizes most existing methodological work on causal inference.</p>
<p>The book is accessible to an audience with very little technical background but has at its core a carefully developed formal treatment of its topic. The book is didactic in the sense that it synthesizes and presents much familiar material from the literature, but it also presents an original contribution to that literature. The audience most directly addressed comprises statisticians consulting or collaborating with researchers in a wide variety of disciplines. For this audience, the book provides a unified framework for understanding issues of causal inference discussed differently across disciplines. However, the book will also be of substantial interest to methodologically minded readers working within specific disciplines but interested in methodological literature from other disciplines. The book also offers a useful introduction to issues of bias in causal inference for researchers working in any discipline in the social, behavioral, or medical sciences. Indeed, the book is sufficiently accessible to be used as a textbook in a course on causal inference. Overall, the book combines a useful synthesis of the literature with an original working through of issues related to bias in causal inference. Anyone with a sustained interest in this topic will find the book worth reading.</p>
