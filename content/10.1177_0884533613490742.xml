<p>The purpose of this article is to discuss systematic reviews, how they are performed, and their associated strengths and limitations. A systematic review is an assessment of evidence involving exact methods to systematically identify, select, and critically evaluate all available literature on a particular topic. Unlike most narrative reviews, systematic reviews have defined methods established a priori for searching, evaluating, extracting, synthesizing, and reporting available evidence. Key characteristics differentiating systematic reviews from most narrative reviews include: clearly stated objectives, pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, an explicit reproducible methodology, systematic exhaustive searches to identify all sources of evidence, an assessment of the validity for each included study, and a systematic presentation of the study characteristics/results. Though there are significant advantages to systematic reviews, there are also clear limitations such as: the quality of included evidence; heterogeneity and homogeneity of included studies; and publication bias. Even with these limitations, systematic reviews are beneficial to front line clinicians when the quantity of evidence is so substantial that reviewing and synthesizing it is not feasible, available evidence is conflicting, or when the robustness of available evidence is unknown.</p>

<body>
<p>It is rare that a single study would independently guide clinical practice. Even when multiple studies analyzing similar outcomes are performed, they often present conflicting results, and it can be difficult to tease out clinically important differences between the interventions. This creates the need for a method to systematically gather and synthesize all available evidence on a particular topic.</p>
<p>Reviews are published on a regular basis, but they are typically narrative reviews in which content experts present a summary of the evidence related to a specific topic. Although these narrative reviews are helpful by providing a broad overview of a topic, they are typically qualitative in nature and do not report the relative weights of included studies or provide answers to specific clinical questions. Narrative reviews only summarize the literature selected by the author; however, that selection process is not commonly reported, nor does it involve a systematic exhaustive review of all available evidence. This is where a systematic review plays an important role. The purpose of this article is to discuss systematic reviews, how they are performed, and their associated strengths and limitations.</p>

<title>What Is a Systematic Review?</title>
<p>A systematic review is an assessment of evidence involving exact methods to systematically identify, select, and critically evaluate all available literature on a particular topic.

<p>Many systematic reviews also contain meta-analyses. A meta-analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize the results of each independent study included in the review. Synthesizing this information can provide more precise estimates of the studied effects compared with those derived from the individual studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613490742">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup> How to appropriately perform and interpret meta-analyses will not be discussed in this article.</p>

<sec id="section2-0884533613490742">
<title>How Are Systematic Reviews Conducted?</title>
<p>Conducting a proper systematic review is very time and labor intensive and requires specific training to be conducted correctly. As a result, several organizations have made it their goal to conduct high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses on meaningful clinical topics. The organization best known for this is The Cochrane Collaboration. The Cochrane Collaboration is an international nonprofit organization “established to ensure that up-to-date, accurate information about the effects of healthcare interventions is readily available worldwide.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup> It develops and disseminates systematic reviews and meta-analyses dealing with various healthcare topics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup> Anyone may conduct a systematic review; however, it is often not feasible for a clinician involved in clinical practice to perform a systematic review or meta-analysis on his or her own.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613490742">9</xref></sup> Exhaustive, thorough reviews are best performed by trained teams. Examples include the teams developed by organizations such as The Cochrane Collaboration, which has both the resources and specialized training to conduct consistently sound systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Although it may be difficult for practicing clinicians to conduct a proper systematic review on their own, the results of such reviews can be very valuable to them. Systematic reviews help resolve conflicting results, address areas of uncertainty, analyze variations in practice, confirm the appropriateness of current practices, or highlight the need for additional research. The overall goal for performing a systematic review within healthcare should be to synthesize all available evidence to help guide clinical decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>How Are Systematic Reviews Performed?</title>
<sec id="section4-0884533613490742">
<title>Define the Question</title>
<p>As with most research, a sound systematic review begins with defining and refining a specific clinical question. The question brings focus to the study by establishing the patient population, intervention, outcomes, and study design. Questions should address practical concerns and options faced by frontline decision makers. The review should analyze outcomes that are meaningful to those making healthcare decisions. An outcome should never be included simply because it is reported in individual studies; included outcomes should always be meaningful. For systematic reviews, the research question will also determine the composition of the team who will work on the review. Review teams frequently include content experts, a clinical epidemiologist, a statistician, and librarians with expertise in systematic literature searching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0884533613490742">
<title>Establish the Method</title>
<p>Once the question is defined, it is important to establish the method. The methods used should be described in sufficient detail for the readers to fully understand the steps. It is recommended that the established protocol be sent for peer review to help prevent both random and systematic bias that may otherwise be present due to the retrospective nature of the review. Often the exact details of the method are provided, whether in the methods section, appendixes, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews require thorough, objective, reproducible search strategies, established a priori, to identify as many relevant studies as possible. Conducting such a thorough review requires the use of multiple sources of evidence extending beyond the commonly used bibliographic databases. Reported search strategies should not only include the sources of evidence searched but also identical copies of the search terms, exact dates searches were performed, and the number of results discovered. These efforts help to minimize bias and increase the investigators’ ability to obtain reliable measures of effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup> These are also some of the distinguishing factors between systematic and narrative reviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0884533613490742">
<title>Sources of Evidence</title>
<p>MEDLINE is one of the major international, online, bibliographic databases; however, searching MEDLINE alone is insufficient for a systematic review. Not all journals are indexed in MEDLINE. The decision to index a journal in MEDLINE is made by the director of the National Library of Medicine and the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee. Multiple factors contribute to this decision, but the primary consideration is the scientific merit of the journal’s content. Scientific merit is determined based on the validity, importance, and originality of the content, along with its contribution to and coverage of the specific field of research. Approximately 30%–80% of all published randomized trials are identifiable through MEDLINE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup> Relying solely on a MEDLINE search not only excludes a substantial portion of evidence but also introduces selection bias into the review. MEDLINE currently contains more than 19 million references to journal articles from 1946 on, with 5600 journals in 39 languages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613490742">10</xref></sup> Another major international, online, bibliographic database similar to MEDLINE is EMBASE. It currently contains more than 25 million records from 1974 on, with 7800 journals in 30 languages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613490742">11</xref></sup> Of the 7800 journals, at least 1800 are not indexed in MEDLINE, and at least 1800 of the journals indexed in MEDLINE are not indexed in EMBASE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although these major bibliographic databases contain a significant quantity of available evidence, many additional sources contain evidence not indexed in the major bibliographic databases. These include national/regional, subject-specific, abstract, and dissertation/theses databases along with gray literature. Conference proceedings and trial registries are other sources of evidence that are not routinely indexed in the major bibliographic databases.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions maintain their own electronic bibliographic databases often containing literature not indexed elsewhere. Examples include the Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and KoreaMed. Another example of databases containing evidence not indexed in the major bibliographic databases is a subject-specific database. Biology/pharmacology-specific databases include Biological Abstracts/BIOSIS Previews, Derwent Drug File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. There are also online abstract and citation databases such as Scopus, which includes 19,500 journals and 5.3 million selections from conference proceedings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613490742">12</xref></sup> Obtaining information on dissertations and theses requires investigators to search through yet another list of databases. One of the more well-known examples is ProQuest Dissertation &amp; Theses Database, which indexes more than 2 million doctoral dissertations and masters theses that are not indexed in major bibliographic databases. There are also databases indexing gray literature. Various definitions exist for gray literature, but it is typically understood to mean literature that is not formally published. Conference proceedings, abstracts, and other gray literature have been shown to be sources of approximately 10% of the studies referenced in Cochrane reviews. In a Cochrane methodology review, 5 of 5 studies analyzed demonstrated that published trials showed an overall greater treatment effect than gray literature trials. Thus, failure to identify trials reported in conference proceedings and other gray literature might affect the results of a systematic review. An example of a database indexing gray literature is OpenSIGLE (System for Information on Gray Literature).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Discovery of all applicable evidence sometimes requires the reviewers to go beyond databases. Handsearching is another important method for finding additional evidence. Handsearching involves a manual page-by-page examination of the entire contents of a journal issue or conference proceeding to identify all eligible evidence. Although manual and time-consuming, handsearching journals and conference proceedings can be a useful adjunct to electronic databases as not all trial reports are included in electronic bibliographic databases. Even when they are included, they may not contain relevant search terms in the titles or abstracts. Although many trials are reported in journal articles, other reports of trials appear in abstracts, news columns, editorials, letters, or other text. These are additional reasons why handsearching is a key component to a thorough systematic review. The Cochrane Collaboration has organized extensive handsearching efforts and has created central databases to index results discovered through handsearching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0884533613490742">
<title>Restrictions, Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Once the appropriate sources of evidence are chosen, researchers must delineate the limits and restrictions that will be used in the search. This has the potential for introducing bias into the review. Search restrictions should be carefully thought out in an effort to avoid making the studies too homogeneous or overlooking studies with negative results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>After applying appropriate restrictions, the resultant titles and abstracts are screened to identify all potentially relevant studies. These studies are then reviewed, applying the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria typically define the optimal study design, patient population, interventions, controls, and outcomes. They are broad and inclusive to achieve results that are generalizable. Inclusion criteria that are too broad may result in increased heterogeneity between included studies. Generally, there tend to be fewer exclusion criteria than inclusion criteria, and they are used to increase homogeneity and maintain focus on the clinical question of interest. Too many exclusion criteria may result in ruling out negative studies and introducing bias into the review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0884533613490742">
<title>Abstraction and Analysis</title>
<p>Once eligible studies are identified, data abstraction may begin. Abstracted data should be pertinent to the review, specified in the protocol, and abstracted in a planned systematic manner. One important element is assessing for features related to the methodologic quality of the included studies. Allocation concealment and blinding are two of these features that, if not performed appropriately, have the potential to introduce bias into randomized controlled trials. Few studies discuss whether the investigators used these features, and if they did use them, it is typically not described in sufficient detail to compare between studies. These are just 2 examples of assessing the methodological quality of included studies. Following the abstraction phase, the final decision about whether to conduct a meta-analysis is made. As mentioned previously, meta-analyses provide the ability for a quantitative analysis of the evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0884533613490742">
<title>Editorial and Publication Processes</title>
<p>To help prevent bias during the editorial and publication process, methodologists have established standards for publishing systematic reviews. The original standards were known as the QUOROM statement, and they indicate elements that should be included in the review to allow for an evaluation of its methodological quality and reproducibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613490742">13</xref></sup> The PRISMA statement is the most current guidance on critical elements to improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It is essentially an update to the QUORUM statement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533613490742">14</xref></sup> One important difference between systematic and narrative reviews, with regard to reporting findings, is that systematic reviews will inform readers when there is no reliable or clinically meaningful evidence. Remember that “no evidence of effect” should not be confused with “evidence of no effect.” A systematic review is not only more thorough than a narrative review, but it is typically designed to be more objective as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490742">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490742"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490742"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613490742">8</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0884533613490742">
<title>What Are the Limitations of a Systematic Review?</title>
<p>Although there are significant advantages to systematic reviews, there are also clear limitations to consider when analyzing the results and applying them to clinical practice. One limitation is the quality of the evidence included in the review. If the included studies are poor quality, no degree of manipulation or analytical skill will produce valid results. It is the concept of garbage in/garbage out.</p>
<p>A second limitation is heterogeneity between included studies. This heterogeneity may stem from differing clinical features (eg, differing stages of disease) or methodological features (eg, differing research design) between included studies. If there is too much heterogeneity between studies, analyzing their outcomes together may produce misleading results.</p>
<p>Ironically, a third limitation to systematic reviews is the homogeneity of included studies. In most instances, a meta-analysis is performed on the results of a systematic review. To perform a proper meta-analysis, the included studies should be fairly homogeneous to ensure it compares apples to apples. Although this homogeneity leads to a strong meta-analysis, it often excludes large quantities of published data. This is one area where narrative reviews have a distinct advantage over systematic reviews. Narrative reviews are allowed to address a wide variety of study designs and outcomes that would often be excluded from systematic reviews.</p>
<p>A fourth clear limitation is publication bias. This type of bias occurs when the studies with positive outcomes are published, whereas studies with negative or indeterminate outcomes are not. If a systematic review does not include many negative or indeterminate outcomes, because they were never published, there is significant potential for skewing the results.</p>
<p>Even with these limitations, systematic reviews are beneficial to frontline clinicians. They are designed to answer a specific clinical question pertinent to frontline staff. Systematic reviews are also beneficial when the quantity of evidence is so substantial that reviewing and synthesizing it is not feasible, available evidence is conflicting, or when there is little available evidence and it is unclear how robust the findings are. They also allow for analyzing variations in practice, confirm the appropriateness of current practice, and can highlight the need for additional research in particular areas. At these times, a properly conducted systematic review can provide clarity.</p>
