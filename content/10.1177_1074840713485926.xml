<p>The <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> is inviting manuscripts for a special issue addressing the <italic>Illness Beliefs Model</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illnessbeliefsmodel.com">http://www.illnessbeliefsmodel.com</ext-link>. The <italic>Illness Beliefs Model</italic> (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009; Wright, Watson, &amp; Bell, 1996) highlights the connections between beliefs, illness, and suffering. This compassionate approach to working with families with serious illness invites health professionals to a relationship practice to understand how illness beliefs can either enhance or soften suffering. The illness beliefs of both health practitioners and family members can influence the healing experience.</p>
<p>The <italic>Illness Beliefs Model</italic> is being used to guide clinical practice, research, and education in a variety of cultural contexts. For this special issue, guest editor, Dr. Lorraine M. Wright and <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic> editor, Dr. Janice M. Bell, are seeking descriptions of practice and/or knowledge translation, research reports, and theoretical manuscripts that critique and/or extend understanding of this model developed for advanced practice in family systems nursing. Work directed to all populations of families in all cultural contexts is welcome.</p>
<p>For consideration for inclusion in this special issue, manuscripts must be submitted by <bold>September 1, 2013</bold> through the usual <italic>JFN</italic> electronic submission process: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com:80/jfn">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com:80/jfn</ext-link>. Indicate on the cover page of the manuscript that it is being submitted for the special issue. All manuscripts will be peer reviewed. Individuals who are interested in submitting a manuscript are encouraged to contact either Dr. Wright (<email>lmwright@ucalgary.ca</email>) or Dr. Bell (<email>jmbell@ucalgary.ca</email>) to discuss further in advance of submission.</p>
