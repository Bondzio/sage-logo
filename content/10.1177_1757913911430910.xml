<p>Nelly Araujo from the RSPH development team provides an overview on the Health Promotion Awards 2011 and its winners’ good practice – highlighting that in a changing public health landscape, health promotion still features as a mainstream approach to address the wider social determinants of health</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757913911430910-fig1.tif"/>
<p>For the fourth year running, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) continues to support and encourage good practice in health promotion through the Health Promotion and Community Well-Being Organization and Partnership Awards. The aim of the awards is to recognise achievement in the development and implementation of health promotion and community well-being strategies and initiatives.</p>
<p>The awards support the work that organizations do in empowering people and communities to gain control over the underlying factors that influence their health and well-being. The criteria have at their heart the Ottawa Charter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430910">1</xref></sup> whose principles are still widely used as a benchmark for good health promotion practice.</p>
<p>The award scheme is also developmental. Each year the criteria feed from current public health policy and from the experience and knowledge new applicants bring. As such, the scheme has widened its reach in order to learn and recognise the contribution to health promotion and health improvement made by non-traditional health sector organizations as well. This year the award scheme has been further enhanced by the participation of a diverse range of organizations, ranging from local authorities to community radio. The winners of the 2011 awards are as follows.</p>
<sec id="section1-1757913911430910">
<title>East Herts Council</title>
<p>Even prior to the NHS reforms many local councils had been heavily involved in the public health arena. This has been the case at East Herts Council which launched its Public Health Strategy 2008–2013 with the purpose of providing a framework of action for the prevention of ill health, the protection of health and the promotion of positive health and well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430910">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This strategy has been a catalyst in motivating like-minded partners to work together on health projects in East Herts. As such the Health Engagement Panel, which oversees and develops the strategy, has good representation and input from elected members, senior and operational managers, as well as valued partners such as the local NHS, fire service, police, the voluntary sector and community groups.</p>
<p>Over 100 projects and initiatives have been delivered in light of the strategy. The outcomes clearly demonstrate success in improving people’s health and inciting behaviour change, and this is down to strong and effective partnership working, engagement with elected members and the clear strategic support and individual leadership of East Herts Council’s public health role.</p>

<sec id="section2-1757913911430910">
<title>Awaaz FM</title>
<p>Although Awaaz FM is a small and newly created community radio station, it is already showing how public health service can take different forms. Awaaz FM not only provides entertainment to Asian communities in Southampton but also focuses on wider health issues through its innovative programmes, which are transmitted in English, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Pushto and Potohari.</p>
<p>Awaaz FM plays a pivotal role in collecting information on health issues and services and then translating them into messages for ‘hard-to-reach’ populations. Its ground knowledge of how Asian communities work (culturally and structurally) is clearly an asset to public health. The evidence suggests that Awaaz FM has already been instrumental in positively influencing local health awareness and behaviours in Southampton.</p>

<sec id="section3-1757913911430910">
<title>Sefton Partnership</title>
<p>The Sefton Partnership is a group of seven agencies with a long-lasting and collaborative working relationship towards tackling health inequalities. The agencies involved include Sefton Borough Council, Merseyside Fire and Rescue, One Vision Housing, Sefton Community Service Volunteers, May Logan Health Centre and Sefton Primary Care Trust.</p>
<p>This is the second time that the Sefton Partnership has achieved the RSPH award due to its high level of joint working, as well as its strong commitment to the Ottawa Charter principles. The Sefton Partnership is committed to the community development approach, a key element for health promotion and for the sustainability of any project.</p>

<sec id="section4-1757913911430910">
<title>School Food Trust</title>
<p>The Coalition Government has emphasised its support for charities and social enterprises to expand their work and have greater involvement in the provision of social service projects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430910">3</xref></sup> In line with this objective, the School Food Trust (SFT) was originally set up by the Government as an agency to promote good nutrition in schools.</p>
<p>The SFT’s focus is on health promotion through advice, research, resources, support and training to help improve the nutritional quality of school food for children. The SFT’s Let’s Get Cooking initiative has established the country’s largest network of healthy cooking clubs for children and has had a demonstrable impact on children’s health.</p>
<p>The SFT is moving to a self-funding model with emphasis on the delivery of a commissioned project. There is huge potential for the SFT to expand its reach to other settings such as universities, care homes and workplaces.</p>

<sec id="section5-1757913911430910">
<title>Well London</title>
<p>Well London is an initiative led by a partnership that consists of seven principal agencies: London Health Commission, Arts Council England, Groundwork London, Central YMCA, London Sustainability Exchange, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of East London.</p>
<p>Well London’s health promotion practice is based on a community development and capacity building approach, which allows communities to have greater involvement in identifying their problems and developing solutions. This approach is also of direct relevance to the current policy context, including the Big Society and Localism.</p>
<p>After five years of working with 20 of London’s most deprived neighbourhoods, the Well London initiative has produced a sustainable and positive impact on people’s health and well-being. Its approach is highly transferable to other communities and a second wave of communities is imminent.</p>

<title>Purely Nutrition – PhunkyFoods</title>
<p>Purely Nutrition is a small privately owned company and demonstrates how a private-sector organization can initiate health promotion programmes through partnerships (with both private and public sector organizations). Purely Nutrition illustrates how initiatives can be made scalable through public-sector structures (primary schools) and sustainable through corporate sponsorship.</p>
<p>Purely Nutrition’s PhunkyFoods initiative is a unique and innovative primary school programme that involves healthy eating and physical activity lesson plans, resources, training and support for teachers. So far 800 primary schools have taken part in PhunkyFoods over the past seven years, and the appeal for this type of initiative is increasing rapidly as a further 175 primary schools are getting involved this year.</p>
<p>This initiative epitomises the contemporary public health strategy embodied in the white paper <italic>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Update and the Way Forward</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430910">4</xref></sup> and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Exellence (NICE) guidelines and embraces the Big Society approach through private-sector contribution in corporate and social responsibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757913911430910">
<title>Centre for Workplace Health – The Active Workplaces Project</title>
<p>The Centre for Workplace Health (CWH) is a health-promotion service based within St Mary’s University College London with an emphasis on creating healthier businesses and healthier working communities, using sustainable, practical and cost-effective approaches.</p>
<p>The CWH draws upon its academic background to act as a knowledge transfer unit, working with the private and public sector and policy makers. The CWH’s success in translating theory into practice is supported by a sustainable business model that compromises tailored projects and bespoke training for businesses, and the provision of commissioned services for local authorities.</p>

<title>This is what good practice in health promotion looks like!</title>
<p>In a changing public health landscape, health promotion still features as a mainstream approach to improve health and address the wider social determinants of health.</p>
<p>This year’s winners illustrate the importance of partnership working and the enduring relevance of the Ottawa Charter approach to improving and sustaining community health and well-being. The impact that each project has had on its local community shows that when it comes to improving health, a joined-up approach is key. This is a sentiment that Sir Michael Marmot, Director, UCL Institute of Health Equity, was keen to emphasise when he congratulated one of the winners:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we are to reduce health inequities it is essential to take action on the social determinants of health – the “causes of the causes” of ill health. That means working in partnership at local level to improve the social conditions in which we are born, live, grow, work and age. The Well London Alliance Partnership does just that. Empowering individuals and communities, and giving people a voice is integral to addressing health inequalities. I am delighted the Partnership has achieved well-deserved recognition for its work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This year’s winners show how truly varied the programmes and organizations undertaking health promotion initiatives can be. Equally important is that they represent examples of how policy can be translated into practice.</p>
