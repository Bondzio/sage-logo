<abstract>
<p>Over the last decades, many liberal democracies have experienced a tension between the education system’s expressed requirement to foster citizenship norms and the liberal (sub-)ideal of norm neutrality. This dilemma has been accentuated by, on the one hand, increased ethnical and cultural diversity and, on the other hand, liberalization of society in general and the schooling system in particular. This article provides a ‘state of the debate’ of this tension in France, Sweden, and England, through a media analysis of the period 2001–2010. Citizenship education was most prominent in the Swedish debate. The Swedish and English positions were most alike, arguing for ‘objective civics’ and promoting freedom of choice in the school system. In contrast, the French debate argued for a common, integrative state-managed school system that provides equal opportunities to all socioeconomic groups while inculcating loyalty to the State.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the dilemma when the education system’s expressed requirement to foster citizenship norms clashes with the liberal (sub-)ideal of norm neutrality. Though this dilemma is in itself nothing new, its gravity has increased markedly over the last few decades for two main reasons: (1) as a consequence of liberal democracies’ increasing ethnical and cultural diversity and (2) as a consequence of the liberalization of society in general and the schooling system in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483686">Fernández and Sundström, 2011</xref>: 363–364).</p>
<p>To capture how this dilemma may impact the school system, this article provides a ‘state of the debate’ on liberalization and citizenship education in French, Swedish, and English media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746197913483686">1</xref></sup> These three countries have experienced increasing cultural diversity but have responded to these pressures by adopting very different education policies. From a liberal perspective, citizenship education is particularly interesting as it presupposes a shared conception of what a ‘good citizen is, the special qualities and virtues that distinguish him or her, and the methods that should be employed to educate citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483686">Fernández and Sundström, 2011</xref>: 364). Comparing the media debates in these three countries thus allows us to tease out similarities, tensions, and differences.</p>
<p>Borrowing heavily from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483686">Fernández and Sundström’s (2011)</xref> two-dimensional theoretical framework, we start with a brief discussion about the various liberal debate positions vis-a-vis citizenship education. We then present the results of our detailed comparative media analysis, focusing specifically on the most talked-about dimensions and on certain country-specific discussions. The debates in each country will be presented in turn. Issues of school management, pupil admission requirements, and the types of citizenship education promoted were discussed in all three cases, although the promoted positions varied substantially between countries. In contrast, discussions about a society’s basis for an ethical foundation and curriculum design were almost entirely limited to a single country.</p>
<p>The three countries in this study were chosen because of their different political approaches in the field of schooling. They were thus expected to be placed at different positions in the two-dimensional theoretical framework. Our media analysis generally confirmed this initial hypothesis. Our findings support the notion that the French case best fits Fernández and Sundström’s <italic>monist</italic> position, whereas England and Sweden are both located somewhere on the public dimension continuum between the <italic>market</italic> and the <italic>universalist</italic> position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746197913483686">
<title>Analytical framework</title>
<p>In their review of the academic literature on citizenship education in liberal states, Fernández and Sundström developed an analytical framework based on a two-dimensional thin–thick continuum. The <italic>ethical</italic> dimension can be understood in terms of the values and norms that should be ingrained in citizenship education. Should schools seek to inculcate patriotism, solidarity, or loyalty in children, or should they remain neutral and focus only on ‘objective civics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483686">Fernández and Sundström, 2011</xref>: 369)? The <italic>public</italic> dimension homes in on the issue of state control in schooling. This dimension is conceptualized as a sliding scale from state paternalism, where public control is high, to private parentalism where it is low. Put together, these two dimensions create a two-by-two matrix forming four archetypal liberal positions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746197913483686">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The empirical material collected for this media study consists of more than 1200 newspaper articles debating issues related to citizenship education and/or liberalization of the schooling systems in France, Sweden, and England over a 10-year period (2001–2010).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746197913483686">2</xref></sup> Six prominent newspapers (four national and two regional) were selected per country,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746197913483686">3</xref></sup> based on their size (and widespread readership) and different editorial positions. Data collection was done both by surveying newspapers archives and through the <italic>Factiva</italic> database.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1746197913483686">4</xref></sup> All articles were coded using the same coding scheme that covered 15 dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1746197913483686">5</xref></sup> (and six background variables<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1746197913483686">6</xref></sup>). The final used material comprised 437 French, 415 English, and 360 Swedish articles (for a grand total of 1212 records).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1746197913483686">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746197913483686" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Debates on liberalization and citizenship education were present in all three countries, although <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1746197913483686">Table 1</xref> shows that discussion about liberalization was most prominent in France and England, whereas citizenship education was most prominent in the Swedish and to a lesser extent French debates. Articles were coded as dealing with schools’ ‘liberalization’ when they treated the various trends leading away from a publicly owned and unified school system. For instance, this could include (but was not limited to) demands that the school system match the needs of an increasingly diverse student body. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1746197913483686">Table 2</xref> shows, much of the debate on liberalization centered on who should manage public schools, pupil admission criteria, forms of curricula, and potential forms of an ethical foundation. Other less-prominent debates included who should be responsible for the development of teaching models and who should assess the quality of schools.</p>

<title>School management</title>
<p>When discussing liberalization, school management was by far the most discussed issue in all three countries with 44% of all French articles, 33% of all Swedish articles, and 31% of all English articles debating this topic. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1746197913483686">Table 3</xref> shows, most of the discussion concerned the role played by the private and public sectors in schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1746197913483686">8</xref></sup> Once again, France differed from the other two countries in that a notable majority of articles discussed the role of the public sector in the school system—only mentioning the private sector in 3% of the articles. Additionally, 12% of the reviewed articles debated the role played by professionals—more specifically <italic>pédagogues</italic>—in the school system. <italic>Pédagogues</italic> are affiliated with the <italic>Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maitres</italic> (<italic>IUFM</italic>), which, as its name implies, educates teachers and designs learning models. The <italic>pédagogues</italic>’ influence culminated with the 1989 <italic>Orientation Law</italic> that enshrined their guiding principle that ‘students should be put at the center of schools’. Their critics have argued that this principle has eroded teachers’ authority and the priority of knowledge as such in the school system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483686">Leclerc, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197913483686">Mattei, 2003</xref>). Most articles touching upon this issue called for a more restricted role of <italic>pédagogues</italic> in schools given their presumed inability to prepare students for work and the inappropriateness of their teaching methods in the face of growing student diversity and outbreaks of school violence. Declining power of ‘old’ actors (e.g. <italic>pédagogues</italic>, teachers’ unions) in French educative policies since the 1989 <italic>Education Law</italic> corresponded with the slow rise of new actors, particularly parents, in the school system, although their role was more along the lines of support for teachers than full-fledged ‘partners’ in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197913483686">Beillerot and Collette, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197913483686">Limage, 2000</xref>: 76).</p>

<p>Frequency of articles in the debate on schools in France, Sweden, and England mentioning the following ideals of school management (%).</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The Swedish debate mainly concerned the role of private education companies versus public sector schools. In 1992, Sweden implemented <italic>friskolereformen</italic> (the free school reform). This meant that schools run by private companies, charities, or individuals would be given a certain sum of money for each enrolled pupil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1746197913483686">9</xref></sup> The number of nonpublic sector schools has steadily increased since the reform was enacted: in 1992/1993, approximately 2% of all pupils in primary and secondary education attended free schools. In 2010 and 2011, this figure had risen to 12% and 24%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197913483686">Skolverket, 2012</xref>: 16; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483686">Lundahl and Olson, 2013</xref>). Even though the debate about pros and cons of the free school reform was most intense before its implementation and during the early days of its implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483686">Broman, 2011</xref>), it has continued to engage debaters. Many argue that free schools should be regarded as complements, rather than competitors, to public sector schools, but some debaters question the role and benefits of free schools, not least faith-based ones. Another recurring theme is the pros and cons of letting private education companies make profits while financed by tax money (allowable in Sweden).</p>
<p>In England, the debate also concerned the public–private divide. Although some debaters adopted a pro-private or pro-public position, many argued for some kind of mix in the schooling system. Hence, both ‘public sector (state)’ and ‘private sector’ were often mentioned as ideals in the same article, but the authors usually disagreed on the ideal mix. There were also references to the Swedish experiences of the free school reform in several English articles. Debaters advocating more freedom of choice and less rigorous state control over the schooling system usually emphasized the positive aspects of the reform, while opponents focused on negative aspects, such as increased social cleavages.</p>
<p>The role of grammar schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1746197913483686">10</xref></sup> and comprehensive schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1746197913483686">11</xref></sup> were recurring themes in the English debate. When it came to secondary schools, much of the debate also concerned the <italic>city academies</italic> introduced by the Labour Government in 2000. City academies are schools financed by the state and backed by an outside partner (businesses, universities, or other ‘sponsor’) and enjoying greater independence than traditionally maintained schools (even if they must follow the national curriculum and are monitored by <italic>Ofsted</italic> (The Office for Standards in Education), the school inspection agency). Many debaters argued against centralization and emphasized the need to free ‘good schools from the dead hand of local authority control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483686"><italic>The Times</italic>, 2006</xref>). Another, more recent, innovation that was debated was <italic>specialist schools</italic>—schools that focus on a specific subject. As in the Swedish case, the increasing number of faith-based schools and the pros and cons of making them part of the publicly financed sector were debated.</p>
<p>The role of grammar schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1746197913483686">10</xref></sup> and comprehensive schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1746197913483686">11</xref></sup> were recurring themes in the English debate.

<p>The motivations for, and potential beneficiaries of, the involvement of different actors in school management are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1746197913483686">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1746197913483686">5</xref>, respectively. In all three cases, the articles cited ‘quality’ as the main justification for their choice of actors to manage schools. However, there the similarities ended. While freedom of choice was the second-most debated topic in both England and Sweden, it was cited in just 1% of the French articles. In France, the choice of actors was justified on grounds of equal opportunities and—interestingly—law and order. The recurring violence in schools that has presumably been magnified by the 1989 school reforms was a hotly debated topic in the French media. Several education policies were adopted with the explicit goal of curtailing violence including, as we shall see, the basis for an ethical foundation.</p>

<p>In all three countries, the involvement of certain actors was justified on the grounds that it would first and foremost benefit the children. In England, parents and democracy writ large were also expected to be among the main beneficiaries. An example of a recurring argument regarding parents as beneficiaries is that a mixture of actors running schools increases parents’ choice, which is a good thing since parents know best what kind of school will fit their child. Freedom of choice was also sometimes portrayed as promoting democracy, which explained why ‘democracy’ in general was seen as a major beneficiary. In Sweden and France, the second-most presented justification was schools’ interests, which were barely touched upon in the English case.</p>

<title>Admission requirements</title>
<p>The basis on which pupils were selected also attracted considerable media attention and represented the second-most discussed topic overall with an equivalent degree of media coverage in all three countries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1746197913483686">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1746197913483686">Tables 6</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1746197913483686"/> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1746197913483686">8</xref> summarize our findings. In order to maximize integration and furnish equal opportunities for all regardless of background, most French articles supported pupils’ selection based on the <italic>carte scolaire</italic> (geographic proximity). However, some argued that this principle impeded rather than promoted integration as it created ghetto-like schools. The equalizing power of such a policy was also questioned, as the wealthiest were more likely to know which school fared better and thus better able to relocate accordingly. To solve this problem, some articles suggested the introduction of quotas promoting socioeconomic (though not—an important qualifier—ethnic or religious) diversity in public schools. The debate on quotas was also extended to French universities as several authors questioned whether university admission should be based on <italic>mérite</italic>/grades alone or whether there should be special arrangements for certain socioeconomic groups.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In Sweden and England, most debaters discussed freedom of choice when it came to pupil admission criteria. Those arguing in favor of unqualified freedom of choice rarely elaborated on the specific details how actually to realize it—on a completely level playing field, some schools will be oversubscribed, making unavoidable some process of selection. In the Swedish case, the second-most often mentioned selection criterion was grades (the pros and cons of using grades)—followed by the principle of geographic proximity. The latter principle was, together with means, among the most discussed ones in the English debate. The arguments for and against geographic proximity were similar: defenders of geographic proximity argued that freedom of choice in practice only benefits the well-informed and better-off pupils. Those arguing against this principle stated that it deprived children from less academic/well-off areas of the possibility to search out a better education in another area and so sustained societal inequalities.</p>
<p>This meant that both the ideals of freedom of choice and geographic proximity can be seen as promoting or working against equal opportunities, depending on the debater’s perspective. Equal opportunity arguments were most frequently used in the English and French debates. Many English debaters questioned whether it was possible to reconcile equal opportunities and excellence, and if so, how to accomplish this. In the Swedish debate, freedom of choice was the most commonly discussed value when admission criteria were under review. Pupils were the most frequently discussed beneficiaries in all three countries. However, the three countries differed regarding the second-most discussed beneficiaries: Sweden and England cited the parents, while France talked instead about socioeconomic groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1746197913483686">
<title>Basis of ethical foundation</title>
<p>Interestingly, some debates were heavily concentrated in one country and nearly absent in others. The question of the basis for an ethical foundation is a case in point (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1746197913483686">Tables 9</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1746197913483686"/> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1746197913483686">11</xref>). In all, 17% of the French articles mentioned the need to promote France’s ‘ethical society’, making it the second-most discussed matter. In contrast, merely 2% of English and Swedish articles touched this issue. The prevalence of this discussion in the French media shows how important this question is to the education system of this country. Overall, most articles agreed that the ethical foundation should promote a unified society in order to foster integration and equal opportunities. This should come as no surprise as France has a long history of inculcating civic values with the aim to forge social cohesion and equality. The education laws of the 1880s gave French schools their Republican character, promoting love for the <italic>patrie</italic> and respect for the Republican values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Schools were meant to introduce pupils to universal values and to play down potentially fragmenting particularities such as religion and ethnicity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483686">Saint-Martin, 2013</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Relating back to the two-dimensional theoretical framework, the French debate is indubitably emphasizing the need for a ‘thick’ ethical foundation for society. This emphasis is largely absent in the English and Swedish cases. The Swedish and English education systems can be placed along the ‘thin’ ethical dimension, that is, it is primarily nonnegotiable values and norms of the liberal order that are to be inculcated by schools/citizenship education. This leaves greater room for competing or complementing values than in the French case. The ‘thin’ ideal was also a predominant aspect of the English debate. The few Swedish articles that did raise the issue of an ethical foundation were evenly divided between the ‘thick’ and ‘thin’ ideals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1746197913483686">Table 9</xref>). The primary-stated motives in the Swedish debate were integration and equal opportunities, while they were so scattered among the different categories in the English case that none added up to a single percent of the articles. In both countries, the most frequently highlighted beneficiaries were democracy/citizens and children/pupils, with groups (such as socioeconomic or religious groups) a close runner-up in Sweden.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1746197913483686">
<title>Curriculum form(s)</title>
<p>Unlike the other two countries, French articles also frequently debated (16% of all articles) whether the curriculum and school structure should be diversified to have it mirror the diversity of its ‘customers/pupils’ (i.e. the <italic>filières</italic> position) or whether the same curriculum/structure should be applied to all (the <italic>collège unique</italic> position) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1746197913483686">Table 2</xref>). The latter position was predominant in the debate as French public schools do not take into consideration regional, ethnic, or religious idiosyncrasies. Instead, schools treat all future citizens of the Republic equally and uniformly by providing the same teaching—or at least the same curriculum—and in the same school structure or system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1746197913483686">12</xref></sup> It is interesting to note, however, that both positions were argued on the ground of providing equal opportunities to all. As one can see from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1746197913483686">Table 2</xref>, this debate was not as prominent in the case of England and Sweden, with only 8% and 5% of all articles discussing it, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, some <italic>potential</italic> debates were barely, if at all, in evidence in the French, Swedish, and English media. Questions about who can make decisions about required teacher and headmaster proficiency levels, or about schools’ admission policies, only turned up in 2% and 1% of the total number of articles, respectively. Who should be allowed to own school buildings or develop teaching materials was not discussed at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1746197913483686">
<title>Citizenship education</title>
<p>Articles on citizenship education debate how schools should prepare children for a future life and for civic participation. Here, we focused upon three subthemes, namely, <italic>temporality, geography</italic>, and <italic>society</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1746197913483686">Table 12</xref>). Temporality refers to whether citizenship education aims to preserve past or present values (conservative), prepare for the future (reactive), or create a new civic order (progressive). Geography refers to the geographical object of reference of citizenship education, which could be local, regional, national, or global. Finally, society refers to the type of society promoted by citizenship education.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As we can see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1746197913483686">Tables 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1746197913483686">12</xref>, in Sweden, these dimensions were most common in the debate (with 42% of all articles discussing this topic), followed by France with 26% and England with 7%. Considering that citizenship education was introduced as an obligatory topic in publicly financed English schools in 2002 (for all pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 years), it might have been expected to be more debated in England.</p>
<p>The citizenship education theme that generated most interest in all three countries was the <italic>type of society</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1746197913483686">Table 12</xref>). The French case was unique in that it contained a notable debate about whether schools should <italic>instruct</italic> (i.e. inculcate knowledge only) or <italic>educate</italic> (i.e. inculcate knowledge <italic>and</italic> values/morals) its pupils. Several articles argued that given the dwindling significance of previously important socialization drivers (e.g. family, churches, the army), schools should now shoulder the full responsibility to socialize children and inculcate values and behaviors necessary to live in society. As a result, articles often referred explicitly to the need to teach certain values in schools. In France, the usually promoted type of society was one that nurtures its traditional, inherited component by holding up solidarity and loyalty to the State/Republic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-1746197913483686">Table 13</xref>). It is interesting to note that tolerance, a value explicitly associated with the teaching of religious facts in France (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483686">Saint-Martin, 2013</xref>), attracted relatively little interest, with only 2% of all articles mentioning it. The lack of discussion about this particular value may be indicative of the relative novelty of teaching religious facts in French schools—or it may indicate that this type of teaching has so far had little bearing on the discussion about citizenship education.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In the Swedish debate, the democratic society was a commonly pushed citizenship education ideal, followed by the welfare society and the multicultural society. The discussion about the type of society that should be promoted by citizenship education was very limited in England, with only 5% of the articles mentioning it (usually criticizing multicultural aspects). Several debaters claimed that multiculturalism as a strategy has failed and has in fact established separate societies within England (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483686">Wilby, 2007</xref>). These sentiments were particularly notable after the 2005 London bombings. On the contrary, when the then Education Secretary Alan Johnson called for teaching ‘Britishness’ in schools in 2007, this was also criticized. One debater argued that the whole idea of teaching citizenship was ‘un-British’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483686">Parris, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There were various views expressed on the effects of citizenship education as a school topic in England, although most of them provided a critical take on it (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197913483686">Birdwell et al., 2013</xref>). This main critical approach in the debate is interesting, considering that research has affirmed a correlation between citizenship education and increasing levels of civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483686">Keating et al., 2010</xref>). One critic argued that ‘endless Ofsted reports […] regularly criticise the paucity of citizenship teaching and the fact that most pupils see citizenship as a Mickey Mouse subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197913483686">Fox, 2007</xref>). Others criticized the glorification of the British imperial past and the lack of geography teaching in relation to citizenship issues. Despite criticism of failed multiculturalism, tolerance was regarded as the most important citizenship quality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-1746197913483686">Table 14</xref>).</p>

<p>In the Swedish debate, by far the most frequently discussed quality to be promoted in citizenship education was independence, followed by tolerance and democracy. As mentioned above, the French debate mainly concerned loyalty and solidarity. The beneficiaries of the type of society discussed in relation to citizenship education were democracy/citizens and children in both Sweden and England, while the state dominated in the French debate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table15-1746197913483686">Table 15</xref>).</p>

<p>The Swedish debate on citizenship education stood out not only by the number of articles discussing citizenship education but also by a much greater interest in the two remaining themes of citizenship education—temporality and geography—than in the type of society (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1746197913483686">Table 12</xref>). The most frequently discussed temporality ideal in the Swedish debate was the <italic>reactive</italic> ideal (preparing the children for the future), with 26% of articles discussing it, followed by the <italic>conserving</italic> (16%) and <italic>progressive</italic> ideals (12%). The most commonly discussed citizenship quality in relation to temporality was, again in the Swedish case, independence (36%), followed by tolerance (14%) and solidarity (10%). The most often mentioned beneficiaries were children/pupils (33%) and democracy/citizens (28%).</p>
<p>As for <italic>geography</italic> (the geographical object of reference for citizenship education), the most discussed ideal in the Swedish debate was the nation (50%). This is not very surprising, considering that ‘ideal’ need not refer to positive statements. Citizenship was still mainly debated in reference to a particular country. Again, the most frequently debated citizenship quality was <italic>independence</italic> (36%), followed by <italic>tolerance</italic> (18%) and <italic>democracy</italic> (14%). The main beneficiaries were children/pupils (32%) and democracy/citizens (28%).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Some similarities across countries emerged from our comparative media analysis. Issues of school management, pupil admission, and the type of society to be promoted in citizenship education were discussed relatively frequently in all three countries. However, our analysis also identified country-specific issues and debates: for example, that citizenship education was almost entirely a Swedish concern and that the basis of ethical foundation was most prevalent in the French debate.</p>
<p>Additionally, most French positions were motivated on grounds of equal opportunities, integration, and law and order and were meant to benefit the state, the public schools, and the pupils. The Swedish debate on liberalization was often highlighting freedom of choice and the interest of children/pupils, while the rather substantial debate on citizenship education tended to revolve around the ideals of a democratic society and a reactive temporality (to prepare children for the future). The most important citizenship quality in this debate was independence, with the children/pupils presented as the main beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The English debate was characterized by a clear focus on liberalization and with a particular focus on the issues of school management and pupil admission. The school management debate homed in on the relation between state control (public sector) and solutions inspired by market logics (private sector), while pupil admission to a large extent revolved around the pros and cons of freedom of choice and potential impact on equal opportunities. Children/pupils were generally presented as the main beneficiaries in the liberalization debate. Given the fact that citizenship education is a mandatory school subject in England, the very limited debate on this topic was something of a surprise. The discussion that did take place tended to focus on the ideal type of society and frequently came to debate the (de)merits of a multicultural version. The most discussed citizenship quality in relation to this was tolerance, with democracy/citizens identified as the main beneficiary.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that the French position on liberalization and citizenship education closely resembles Fernández and Sundström’s theoretically deduced <italic>monist</italic> position. It is ‘thick’ on the public dimension in that it advocates a common, state-managed school system and curriculum in order to curb the impact of socioeconomic polarities and promote integration and belief in the Republic. It is also ‘thick’ on the ethical dimension as the need to promote civic Republican values of ‘liberty, equality and fraternity’, and its inherited and traditional society is constantly emphasized. French articles also tended favorably to compare their school system with the English ‘free market’ schools and generally opposed any trends to allow ‘multiculturalism’ or the teaching of cultural or religious particulars into their schools.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Swedish and English debates were both located at the ‘thin’ end of the ethical dimension, with pundits frequently arguing that schools should be teaching ‘objective civics’ rather than attempting to inculcate patriotism and loyalty to the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483686">Fernández and Sundström, 2011</xref>: 369). With regard to the public dimension, the Swedish and English debates are located somewhere between the <italic>market</italic> position and the <italic>universalist</italic> position in Fernández and Sundström’s model. We do find arguments for keeping the state in charge of, for example, the curriculum, and arguments for freedom of choice and market-oriented solutions. Although many debaters viewed favorably the improved options to select (type of) school in these countries, many also expressed concern that this extended freedom of choice in practice only benefitted the well-heeled and well-informed middle class.</p>
<p>There is a discussion on the role of faith-based schools (as part of free schools/the maintained sector) in Sweden and England, and with a particular focus on Muslim schools. Much of this debate concerned the pros and cons of this type of schools with regard to integration and community cohesion.</p>
<p>It is finally interesting to note that in England, the sizeable and wholly separate system of truly private schools, which in many ways manifest a market-based ideal, was rarely mentioned in the debate. At the very least, one might have expected them to provide a salient debate counterpoint.</p>

In the French case, we noticed that a surprisingly large number of articles came from <italic>Le Figaro</italic>. The use of Factiva as the main database led to an important limitation in the French case: the editorial section of <italic>Le Monde</italic>, a highly influential Left-leaning paper with the third highest readership in France, was somehow unavailable in Factiva, possibly because some of those editorials were outsourced from other press agencies or newspapers and thus they were not identified as having been written by the <italic>Le Monde</italic> editorial team.

<p>In the Swedish case, however, only articles published on certain dates were analyzed. The dates selected were 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 25, and 30 (28 in February) for every month. This means that the real intensity of the Swedish debate was notably greater in Sweden than in the other countries, although this should not materially impact its noted statistical scope.</p>

<p>It is important to note that to be classified as ‘private sector’—or any category—an article did not necessarily have to be in favor of a greater role of the private sector in schools, it merely had to discuss its role.</p>

<p>Hence, the use of the term ‘jacobism’ for describing French schools, from the Jacobins—those who advocated in favor of one school and one language for all and who opposed the Girondins, who advocated greater respect of particularities. The authors are grateful to Jonathan Richard for clarifying this distinction.</p>
