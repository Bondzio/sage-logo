         <title>The Planned Series of Papers</title>
         <p>Synthetic oligonucleotides present tremendous potential to bring new therapies to large numbers of patients, many of whom have unmet medical needs and face serious illness.  Therapeutic approaches are varied.  The first clinical strategy is based on antisense technology, but today’s development activities encompass a number of additional strategies.  The potential of synthetic oligonucleotides is being exploited in RNA interference (RNAi), which broadly includes the technologies of short interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), and in immune stimulation, aptamers and spiegelmers, oligonucleotide decoys, and splice modulators.  A recent estimate puts the total number of oligonucleotide development programs at 235, with 103 of those in phase 1 or phase 2 and 10 in phase 3.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0092861512445311">i</xref>
            </sup> The range of clinical indications is quite broad, with half of the effort in cancer and infectious disease.  Much of the innovation is being driven in small and midsized companies, but many large pharmaceutical companies are also involved either through licensing deals with smaller companies or in-house programs or both.  Indeed, up-front payment to smaller companies has averaged about US$650 million over the years from 2007 to 2010, with the total potential value of these deals at almost US$20 billion.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0092861512445311">i</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The variety of chemical compositions, formulations, and routes of administration mirrors the therapeutic strategies that are being pursued.  More humans have been exposed to therapeutic oligonucleotides via simple solution formulations than any other means, but clinical trials have been conducted using a wide range of delivery strategies including topical delivery, intrathecal delivery, intravitreal delivery, and dry-powder inhalers.  </p>
         <p>Two oligonucleotide drugs have reached the market: Isis Pharmaceuticals’ Vitravene and Eyetech’s and Pfizer’s Macugen.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0092861512445311">ii</xref>
            </sup> The first is an antisense drug, and the second is a PEGylated aptamer.  Thus, at least the beginnings of a regulatory framework are in place for this broad therapeutic class.  However, much of the existing regulatory guidance in the areas of chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) was not developed with synthetic oligonucleotides in mind.  The quality guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) provide comprehensive and broadly adopted guidance for topics in CMC. Guidelines are provided by the ICH for the development of both biotechnological products and for typical small molecules that are the product of chemical synthesis. Synthetic oligonucleotides are not products of biotechnology, but neither are they typical small molecules.  In fact, a number of the ICH quality guidelines specifically exclude synthetic oligonucleotides from the scope of the document.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0092861512445311">iii</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>A group of development scientists has convened to consider various aspects of CMC development of synthetic oligonucleotides.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0092861512445311">iv</xref>
            </sup> The group includes chemists, formulation scientists, analytical chemists, and regulatory specialists representing small and large pharmaceutical companies, regulatory bodies, contract manufacturing and development organizations, and independent consultants.  A number of topics are under active discussion within the group.  The group will develop these topics and publish papers that provide suggestions in many of the same areas as the ICH quality guidelines, but with specific reference to synthetic oligonucleotides.  This paper is the first of what is intended to be a series of such publications.  These publications are intended to present suggestions based on strong science for the knowledge and data that might be provided to support marketing applications.  Although the development phases are not addressed directly, an understanding of the CMC objectives that might support marketing applications may help industry and regulators plan development strategies.  </p>
         <p>The field of synthetic oligonucleotides is developing rapidly both in terms of chemistry and formulations.  The authors attempt to find the proper balance of being helpful for most active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) without appearing proscriptive and to allow for continued innovation.  In keeping with the scientific intent of the papers, references to published literature will be included; however, the authors do not aim to catalog the existing literature exhaustively. The papers will do no more than represent the collective thinking, experience, and wisdom of the authors; nevertheless, they are presented with confidence in their value.  </p>

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Synthetic oligonucleotides are not included in the scope of the ICH specification guidelines for either synthetic drug substances (Q6A) or for products of biotechnology (Q6B).  Of course, the topic of specifications is no less critical to synthetic oligonucleotides than it is to any other class of molecule, and its immediate relevance makes it a good topic for the first publication in this series.  This article draws on principles contained in both Q6A and Q6B and does not intend to contradict anything in either guidance.  Thus, it remains necessary for developers of synthetic oligonucleotides to be thoroughly familiar with the contents of those ICH documents.  This article addresses only those aspects that are specific to synthetic oligonucleotides.  Guidance from the ICH documents that applies directly to synthetic oligonucleotides may not be mentioned explicitly in this article, but some of that guidance may be reinforced. For example, tests for residual solvents, bacterial endotoxins, and heavy metals are expected, but because the tests and the corresponding guidance are directly applicable to oligonucleotides, they are not discussed further here.</p>
         <p>In this article, we have attempted to present basic scientific considerations for the broadest range of oligonucleotide drug substances.  However, it is acknowledged that there likely exist APIs for which the tests and analytical techniques discussed in this article are not suitable.  Additionally, the authors caution that adherence to the advice given in the following sections does not guarantee regulatory agency approval of any of the tests or methods proposed for a specific oligonucleotide API. For these reasons, sponsors of oligonucleotide therapeutics are strongly encouraged to discuss specification development with regulatory agencies during the drug development process.</p>
         <p>We have deliberately avoided any discussion of acceptance criteria. Like those of any APIs, acceptance criteria for oligonucleotide APIs are based on preclinical and clinical data, manufacturing process variability, and analytical control strategies. However, these factors are likely to vary dramatically among oligonucleotide APIs, rendering it impossible to provide even general suggestions on acceptance criteria.    </p>
         <p>Although a variety of chemical structures and therapeutic modalities are being explored, most oligonucleotide APIs fall into 1 of 2 general categories. The first category comprises single-stranded molecules and includes examples such as phosphorothioate diester antisense oligonucleotides and aptamers. The second broad category comprises double-stranded oligonucleotides, which are used in RNAi-based and other approaches. Oligonucleotide therapeutics may be further divided into nonconjugated molecules and those conjugated to a nonoligonucleotide modifier such as polyethylene glycol, cholesterol, or lipid. In the sections that follow, the authors have attempted to provide scientific advice and literature references useful to those engaged in the development of specifications for single-stranded and double-stranded oligonucleotides. The special case of conjugated oligonucleotides is considered in section 4.              </p>

         <title>2. Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides</title>
         <p>Single-stranded oligonucleotides are being investigated as antisense agents, immune stimulators, aptamers, splice modulators, and in other therapeutic approaches. A variety of chemical structures and oligonucleotide lengths are under evaluation.

         <p>The tests used to help establish the identity, purity, and potency of oligonucleotide and small molecule APIs are essentially identical. For some tests, that is, residual solvents, heavy metals, bacterial endotoxins, and microbial limits testing, the advice provided in existing regulatory guidelines can normally be applied directly to oligonucleotide APIs. Similarly, it is the authors’ experience that the standard analytical techniques used to conduct these analyses on small molecule APIs, such as gas chromatography for determining residual solvents, are entirely suitable for the analysis of oligonucleotide APIs. There are other tests, however, that while familiar to developers of small molecule APIs, require special consideration when applied to the analysis of oligonucleotides; it is to these tests that we devote the remainder of this article.</p>

            <title>2.1. Identification</title>
            <p>Identity testing seeks to establish the unambiguous identity of a sample. To be useful, an identity test should be able to discriminate among closely related structures; that is, it should be specific for the analyte in question. In some cases, it may not be possible to establish identity using a single test; in these instances, appropriate additional analyses are performed so that the combination of tests is specific.</p>
            <p>Determining the identity of an oligonucleotide is not trivial, and traditional approaches that work for small molecules, such as comparison of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention time or the infrared or UV spectrum of a sample to that of a standard of known identity, are not normally specific. The major challenge associated with confirming the identity of an oligonucleotide is establishing that the nucleotides are arranged in the order claimed. In this regard, it is clear that mass spectrometry (MS) is unable to differentiate oligonucleotides of the same nucleotide composition but different sequence.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0092861512445311">v</xref>
               </sup> Therefore, while MS is often included as part of identity testing, it is, on its own or in combination with other supportive techniques such as HPLC retention time comparison or <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which are similarly insensitive to changes in sequence, an insufficient test of identity. It is also clear, however, that determining the sequence of an oligonucleotide establishes both the nucleotide composition and the order in which the nucleotides are arranged and that this information is sufficient to confirm identity. Techniques for sequencing DNA and RNA were described over 30 years ago. Of the originally reported techniques for sequencing DNA, the chain termination method described by Sanger and Coulson<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512445311">1</xref>
               </sup> is not useful for sequencing relatively short (&lt;30) molecules, and the chemical technique described by Maxam and Gilbert,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512445311">2</xref>
               </sup> while useful for some oligonucleotides, has fallen out of favor due to its complexity and extensive use of hazardous chemicals. Today, oligonucleotide sequencing is normally accomplished either by controlled chemical or enzymatic digestion followed by MS analysis of the resulting fragments or by a direct MS fragmentation technique (for a recent review, see Banoub et al<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512445311">3</xref>
               </sup>). In the latter method, the oligonucleotide is fragmented in the gas phase, and the resulting fragment ions are detected by the mass spectrometer. Fragment ions for the sequence under consideration are calculated based on known fragmentation patterns of oligonucleotides<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512445311">4</xref>
               </sup> and the mass spectra checked for the presence of the predicted components. For oligonucleotides up to about 25 nucleotides long, it is normally possible to identify sufficient fragments from the 5′ and 3′ termini to permit unambiguous reconstruction of the full nucleotide sequence.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512445311">5</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>There are several other techniques by which the sequence, and hence the identity of an oligonucleotide, may be confirmed.  In certain circumstances, melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) measurement, when combined with a relatively low resolution mass measurement, can be used as a means of establishing identity.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512445311">6</xref>
               </sup> Use of T<sub>m</sub> to establish oligonucleotide sequence is indirect but straightforward.  Establish first, by independent means such as direct MS sequencing or failure sequence analysis (vide infra), the sequences of one lot of drug substance, which is now designated as the reference standard, and its complement.  For each subsequent lot of drug substance, identity is assessed by comparing the T<sub>m</sub> of the duplex formed between the reference standard and its complement to that formed by the sample and the same complement. Provided the T<sub>m</sub> values agree to within a certain degree, the sequence of the sample is confirmed.</p>
            <p>All other things being equal, the closer the sequences of 2 oligonucleotides are to each other, the closer the T<sub>m</sub> values of the duplexes they form with the same complement. The smallest possible sequence change is a replacement of one nucleotide with another; however, such a change results in mass alteration and is generally detectable by MS analysis. The smallest sequence alterations that do not result in a change in mass are those where the positions of 2 residues within the sequence are exchanged. This results in isomers, which while isobaric with the parent sequence, form duplexes with the complement of the parent sequence that contain 2 mismatches. It is normally possible to predict from first principles, which 1 or 2 of all potential 2-base swaps will result in sequence isomers that form duplexes with T<sub>m</sub> values closest to that of the parent duplex. It is a simple matter to make these isomers and measure the T<sub>m</sub> values of the duplexes they form with the parent complement. Provided the difference in T<sub>m</sub> values between the parent and mismatched duplexes is greater than the analytical variability associated with repeat measurements of the T<sub>m</sub> of the parent duplex, T<sub>m</sub> measurement, in conjunction with a determination of molecular mass to rule out single-base substitutions, is normally a sufficient means of determining identity.</p>
            <p>The direct sequencing and T<sub>m</sub> methods described above are normally applied to the analysis of isolated drug substance in its final form. However, solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis presents at least 2 opportunities for confirming sequence prior to testing of the drug substance. First, because cycle-wise coupling efficiencies in solid phase synthesis are not quantitative, the crude products of all syntheses contain a series of oligonucleotides that lack nucleotides from one end of the molecule. The mass difference between consecutive failure sequences corresponds to the mass of the nucleotide added in that cycle; by separating the failure sequences chromatographically and measuring their masses, one is able to determine the order in which the nucleotides were coupled and, from this information, ascertain whether the correct sequence was synthesized. Several groups have recognized the potential utility of these data for establishing oligonucleotide sequence, and HPLC-MS methods useful for separating and measuring the masses of failure sequences have been published.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512445311">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512445311">8</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>A second simple and widely applicable approach is to monitor synthesis output in real time. In this scenario, the identity of the nucleotide added in each cycle is recorded by monitoring the flow of nucleoside phosphoramidites through the reactor during the coupling reaction. Here, the problem is reduced to finding analytical signals specific to each of the nucleotide synthons used in a particular synthesis. For some oligonucleotides, monitoring the UV output at several wavelengths may be sufficient to differentiate among the nucleoside phosphoramidites. For others composed of both natural and sugar-modified nucleotides, or those that contain mixtures of sugar-modified nucleotides, it seems unlikely that simple UV measurements will be specific. Research in this area is still in a preliminary phase, but an approach using MS to differentiate between nucleoside phosphoramidites of the same base but different sugar chemistries was reported recently.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512445311">9</xref>
               </sup> An added benefit of confirming the sequence in real time is that incorrect syntheses can be immediately terminated. This approach is consistent with the FDA’s recent encouragement of the adoption of what is normally referred to as process analytical technology.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512445311">10</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>It is acknowledged that the choice of sequencing technique is dependent on the structure of the oligonucleotide under analysis, and techniques that work for some oligonucleotides may not work for others. For example, the enzyme digestion–MS technique is only applicable to oligonucleotides that are susceptible to enzymatic digestion or that can be converted to digestible forms (eg, phosphorothioate diester oligonucleotides).<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512445311">11</xref>
               </sup> The fact that many therapeutic oligonucleotides were selected at least partly for their resistance to enzymatic degradation means enzymatic digestion–based techniques are not always useful. Direct MS fragmentation appears to be more generally applicable, but for longer oligonucleotides such as aptamers, it is often difficult to generate sufficient fragments to permit complete sequence confirmation. Therefore, while it is clear from the scientific perspective that oligonucleotide sequencing is a necessary and sufficient test of identity, it is important that the methods used to achieve this end be selected for their suitability to the oligonucleotide chemistry in question.</p>
            <p>Finally, in this section, while it is somewhat outside the scope of this article, it is perhaps worth considering briefly the topic of identification testing subsequent to API release as it relates, for example, to API shipping, receiving, and formulation activities. For example, one may ask, once the sequence and hence the identity of a particular lot of APIs has been confirmed at release, what type of identification testing ought to be performed upon receipt of material at the drug product manufacturing site. Similarly, one might ask what level of identification testing is important at drug product release. When considering these issues, it is important to recognize that there exists a crucial difference between identity testing performed at API release and at all subsequent stages, including release of the corresponding drug product. At API release, it is important that the method used to determine identity be able to differentiate the correct sequence from all other sequences that could potentially be synthesized. In contrast, once the identity of a particular lot of APIs has been established, any subsequent identification test only faces the task of differentiating one API from all other APIs that are, in actuality, manufactured or handled at the same facility. Clearly, differentiating the correct API (or, for that matter, drug product) from those that are synthesized or handled is a simpler proposition than differentiating the correct sequence from all other sequences that might be synthesized. In most cases, it is likely possible to differentiate among the actual possibilities without having to resort to oligonucleotide sequencing; therefore, simpler methods for establishing identity, for example, confirmation of molecular mass, are often suitable for confirming identity subsequent to API release.  </p>

            <title>2.2. Counterion Testing</title>
            <p>The majority of oligonucleotides currently being examined as potential therapeutic agents consist of nucleosides linked together via some type of phosphodiester linkage, although peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are notable exceptions. (See Nielsen<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512445311">12</xref>

                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512445311">14</xref>
               </sup> and while it is true that as the charge on a single molecule increases, the remaining phosphodiester linkages become less acidic, all evidence to date suggests that synthetic oligonucleotides isolated from solution at or near neutral pH contain one counterion per internucleotide linkage.</p>
            <p>For small molecule drug substances isolated in their salt form, it is customary to include a test for identification of counterion as part of release testing. It is not normally necessary to include a quantitative test for counterion, presumably because most small molecule drug substances isolated as their salts are only singly, or occasionally, doubly charged. In such cases, weight-based drug substance assay measurements are often sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the amount of counterion present. The situation is more complicated for polyanionic molecules such as oligonucleotides. In this case, it is difficult to rely on a qualitative identity test and the drug substance assay measurement to confirm counterion composition. Therefore, unless it can be demonstrated that the drug substance assay measurement is sufficiently sensitive towards changes in counterion identity and content, we suggest that a quantitative test for counterion be included in the drug substance specification. Commonly used methods for quantitative counterion testing of oligonucleotide drug substances include inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS), ICP optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and atomic absorbance spectroscopy.

The wide variety of structures being explored as potential drugs makes it difficult to recommend one technique over another, although in all cases, it is suggested that assay values be determined by comparison to a well-characterized reference standard.  Although explicit suggestions are difficult to make, the aim is to use a method that is specific for the API, that is, to employ a method capable of resolving the API from any potential process-related impurities and degradation products.</p>
            <p>When considering analytical methodologies, it is worth remembering that it is possible to determine assay using a nonspecific method, provided the nonspecific measure obtained is then corrected for sample purity by a method specific for the API. An example of this type of approach would involve comparing the UV absorbance of a sample against a standard of known concentration<sup>

            <title>2.4. Water Content</title>
            <p>Oligonucleotides gain or lose water depending upon the conditions to which they are exposed.  Thus, water content is not a fixed property of an oligonucleotide but is simply a reflection of its current environment. Water content by itself may not be an indicator of quality or a predictor of stability of the drug substance.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0092861512445311">vii</xref>

            </p>
            <p>However, there are instances where determination of water is valuable.  For example, moisture content may be a useful indicator of the success of drying operations or the integrity of the container closure system.  Accurate water content is one of the parameters that allow for an accurate assay of an oligonucleotide.  Accurate water content can be determined on a sample of drug substance that has been allowed to equilibrate to its current environment; at the same time, another portion of the same sample is weighed for the assay. An estimate of the water content is useful during compounding of the API for drug product formulation.</p>
            <p>For APIs for which it is not a predictor of stability, the argument in favor of setting an acceptance criterion for water content at release appears to be centered primarily on the need to demonstrate process reproducibility. The authors recognize this argument but suggest that the hygroscopic nature of most oligonucleotide APIs be factored into specification discussions.      </p>
            <p>Moisture is most commonly determined by Karl Fischer titration either with the use of an evaporative oven or by direct titration. Another useful tool for the determination of water is near-infrared spectroscopy.<sup>

            <title>2.5. Purity and Impurity Profile</title>
            <p>The number and complexity of oligonucleotide impurities make controlling them a challenging endeavor. An additional issue is that many oligonucleotide impurities are structurally similar to the parent component. Despite the challenges, we believe the principles of reporting, identifying, and qualifying impurities and degradation products enunciated in ICH guideline Q3A apply to oligonucleotide therapeutics. However, while relevant, we believe that some of the details of Q3A, for example, the dose-variable reporting, identification, and qualification thresholds, are not directly applicable to oligonucleotide impurities.  </p>
            <p>Controlling impurities is important for 2 reasons. First, from a toxicological perspective, it is important that patients be exposed only to the types and levels of impurities that have been demonstrated to be safe. Second, results from impurity profile testing are an integral part of the data used to determine whether the manufacturing process is under control. It is important to identify and characterize as many impurities as is practical. It is also important that impurities present at significant levels be qualified.<sup>

               </sup> Consistent with ICH guideline Q3A, we suggest the specifications include limits for specified identified and unidentified impurities, for unspecified impurities, and for total impurities.</p>
            <p>It is recognized that many of the impurities present in oligonucleotides comprise groups of related impurities that are formed by a common mechanism. For example, most oligonucleotides made by solid phase synthesis contain small quantities of a group of impurities that are related structurally to the parent compound by removal of a single nucleotide. This group of impurities is often referred to as n – 1.<sup>

               </sup>  It is often possible, although it becomes more difficult with increasing length, and for some longer oligonucleotides impractical, to resolve chromatographically the n – 1 population from the parent component. For almost all oligonucleotides, however, it is not practical to separate the individual components of the n – 1 impurity from each other. The same situation applies to other commonly observed impurities that comprise mixtures of individual components, for example, n + 1,<sup>

               </sup> To the fullest extent practical, it is suggested that an effort be made to resolve impurities from the parent oligonucleotide and from each other. In general, however, we suggest the individual components within an impurity category; for example, the individual components that comprise the n – 1 impurity may not need to be controlled separately. Rather, we suggest that the specifications contain limits on impurity groups, for example, n – 1, n + 1, or depurinated oligonucleotides. It is acknowledged that even this simplified approach is difficult to implement for all impurities, many of which cannot be separated from each other. In these instances, grouping impurities on the basis of retention time or mass may be a better approach.</p>
            <p>A variety of electrophoretic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic techniques for impurity profiling of single-stranded oligonucleotides has been described. Early length-based separations were accomplished using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with quantitation by UV densitometry. In the late 1980s, CGE methods capable of resolving nucleic acids of differing lengths were introduced. These methods were adapted for the analysis of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides by increasing the theoretical plate count of the gel-filled capillary.<sup>

More recently, ion-pair (IP) HPLC techniques have become popular and, in many instances, have replaced CGE as the method of choice for achieving length-based separations.

            <p>The variety of single-stranded oligonucleotide structures under investigation makes it difficult to recommend any technique over another. It is also likely that additional techniques will continue to be developed. The degree to which it is practically possible to resolve impurities from the parent sequence and from each other will no doubt vary from oligonucleotide to oligonucleotide. For example, it is likely that it will become progressively more difficult to resolve impurities as the length of the parent oligonucleotide increases. We suggest, however, that the goal of impurity profile testing is always to provide as complete and accurate a description of the oligonucleotide content of the sample as is practically possible.   </p>
            <p>In the introduction section, we stated our intention to avoid discussing specific acceptance criteria, which we anticipate will vary widely with the nature of the drug substance and the analytical methods used. In our experience, however, no aspect of oligonucleotide specifications generates more controversy than the limit on purity, and therefore, a few cautious statements seem in order here. The discussion is almost always centered on the lower purity of oligonucleotide drug substances relative to most small molecule APIs. It is undeniably true that the current solid phase approach used to manufacture all therapeutic oligonucleotides produces material that is significantly less pure than most small molecule APIs, and although improvements to synthetic and purification processes will no doubt continue to occur, it is likely that this will always be the case. Of course, when one considers that solid phase synthesis of even a relatively short, 20-mer oligonucleotide consists of a linear sequence of approximately 80 chemical reactions, where the products of one reaction are fed into the next without purification, it is easy to see why. The situation is more daunting still for longer oligonucleotides such as aptamers. Rather than becoming mired in discussions concerning relatively low purities, the authors believe it is important that purity limit assessments for oligonucleotide APIs concentrate on ensuring the acceptance criterion chosen is supported by rigorous assessments of clinical and preclinical safety data and manufacturing and analytical variability. After all, these are the factors that are considered when setting purity limits for small molecule APIs.</p>
            <p>In summary, we believe the concepts of reporting, identifying, and qualifying impurities apply to synthetic oligonucleotides. Impurities may be considered in closely related structural groups. As far as practically possible, it is important to employ analytical methods capable of resolving groups of impurities from the parent molecule and from each other.</p>

            <title>2.6. Conformation</title>
            <p>The activity of an aptameric oligonucleotide (aptamer) is predicated on the adoption of a defined 3-dimensional structure. Therefore, it is important that aptamers be assessed by a test sensitive to 3-dimensional structure. Conformation testing is not important for oligonucleotide therapeutics whose activities are not reliant on conformation, for example, antisense and siRNA therapeutics. Aptamer conformation is often not assessed directly. Rather, conformation is often inferred from the results of a bioassay that measures activity; if the sample under testing exhibits a passing bioassay result, the correct conformation is assured. Due to the complexity and variability of many bioassays, alternative methods for assessing the 3-dimensional structures of aptamers are of great interest. In this regard, proton NMR using selective excitation to determine characteristic fingerprint patterns of exchangeable imino protons appears to be particularly promising. Other biophysical methods that are sensitive to conformation such as T<sub>m</sub> and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) are also perhaps worth investigating. It is likely that the main challenge associated with the development of direct methods for measuring conformation will be to determine the relationship between the biophysical and bioanalytical data sets.  </p>
            <p>Drug product constituents such as diluent and salt are often required for the aptamer to adopt the active conformation. We suggest, therefore, that conformational testing is more appropriate at the drug product stage than at the drug substance stage. However, there may exist exceptions, where conformational testing is also useful at the aptamer drug substance stage. For example, drug substance conformational testing could be important in cases where the ability to adopt the correct conformation changes over the course of drug substance storage.     </p>

            <title>2.7. Method Orthogonality and Impurity Tracking</title>
            <p>Before considering specifications for double-stranded and conjugated oligonucleotides, a brief discussion of method orthogonality and impurity tracking is warranted. Tracking impurities across orthogonal method permits, in the ideal case, the determination of accurate values for assay and impurity profile. The arguments set forth in the paragraphs below apply to all classes of oligonucleotide drugs.  </p>
            <p>To produce an accurate estimate of assay or purity, it is important that the method used be specific for the API. That is, it is important that the method be able to quantify in an absolute (assay) or relative (purity) sense the component or components defined as the API in the presence of impurities, which by definition are excluded. For some APIs, it is not possible to resolve all impurities using a single method; in these instances, it is common to use one or more orthogonal methods, which in combination are specific. In the case of small molecules that contain a limited number of impurities, it is often possible to determine how impurities detected and quantified in one method is seen by an orthogonal method; we refer to this information as impurity tracking. For the purpose of discussion, consider a sample that contains API X and impurities A and B. A reversed phase (RP) HPLC method has been developed to separate impurity A from X, which under the conditions of the analysis, co-elutes with impurity B. The sample is also analyzed by an AEX HPLC method that separates B from X and A, which appear as a single component. In this simple example, because the analyst has an understanding of how impurities A and B track between the 2 methods, he/she can use the combination of RP and AEX HPLC data to calculate accurately the amount of X in the sample.</p>
            <p>Impurity tracking becomes progressively more complicated as the number of impurities and orthogonal methods increases. It seems likely that for many oligonucleotides, it will not be practical to track all impurities. This, in turn, suggests that the ideal of combining assay or purity results determined across more than one method into single measures may not be attainable for many oligonucleotides. Even though the data sets from orthogonal methods cannot necessarily be combined, the value of the individual data sets is maintained.  Orthogonal methods can be applied when they provide a more detailed assessment of purity or assay than could be obtained using a single method. In the event that purity data determined by more than one method cannot be combined, the individual purity values may be reported. For example, if CGE and strong AEX are used to determine purity, and the data cannot be combined to derive a single purity value, both values can be reported. We do not advocate reporting more than one assay value but instead suggest that it be left to the sponsor to determine which measure provides the most useful information.                    </p>

         <title>3. Double-Stranded Oligonucleotides</title>
         <p>Double-stranded oligonucleotides are being used in siRNA and other approaches to control protein expression. Double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics consist of 2 complementary single strands.  Each strand is synthesized independently, and the 2 strands are annealed to form the duplex, which is taken as the API.  Given the assumption that the annealed mixture is at chemical equilibrium, the distribution of double- and single-stranded species in the mixture is fully defined by the various association constants between pairs of chemical species. Lot-to-lot consistency of the single strands will assure lot-to-lot consistency of the duplex, again with the assumption that the strands are annealed in a manner to ensure that chemical equilibrium is reached.  Given the increase in sample complexity after the 2 single strands are annealed, some analytical techniques do not perform as well for the duplex as they do for the individual single strands.  Therefore, it may be that some tests of double-stranded APIs are better performed prior to annealing on the complementary single strands. Thus, in most cases, it is anticipated that a meaningful specification for a double-stranded oligonucleotide API will include tests on the single strands and tests on the duplex.<sup>

            <title>3.1. Identification</title>
            <p>It is important that the identities of each strand of the duplex be confirmed using one of the approaches described in section 2.1. It is normally the case that identification testing of the individual strands is performed prior to annealing at the individual single-stranded intermediate stage. Provided they are confirmed prior to annealing, it is not necessary to confirm the sequences of the single strands following formation of the duplex. In these instances, the focus of identity testing of the duplex is determining whether the correct single strands were mixed and whether the desired duplex formed in the annealing step.</p>
            <p>To assess if the correct single strands were mixed, either the mass of the intact duplex or the masses of the dissociated single strands can be measured. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS (MALDI-MS)<sup>

            <p>It is important to demonstrate formation of the correct duplex during the annealing process. It is normally possible to prove the presence of the correct duplex by comparing the T<sub>m</sub> of the sample to that of a well-characterized reference standard.<sup>

            <title>3.2. Purity and Impurity Profile</title>
            <p>Determining the purity and impurity profile of double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics is complicated.  Because the duplex is formed by annealing 2 single strands, there will likely be closely related duplex variants arising from annealing of the impurities of the single strands.  Achieving chromatographic separation among the target duplex molecule and closely related duplex variants may be difficult and impractical.  As a result, assigning a purity value solely for the target duplex may not be achievable.  </p>
            <p>Impurities of duplex drug substances may include residual single strands, duplex variants, and aggregated strands.  These classes of impurities can only be measured via nondenaturing techniques, which generally do not permit detection and quantification of individual impurities due to insufficient chromatographic resolution.  For this reason, significant emphasis is typically placed on the determination of single-stranded purity and impurity profile (see section 2.5).  The full definition of the impurity profile will likely be captured via the analysis of the drug substance in both the duplex and single-stranded states.</p>
            <p>The impurity profiles of the single strands are typically determined prior to the annealing step, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512445311">Table 2</xref>. However, it is important to develop an understanding of the impact, if any, of the annealing step on the impurity profiles of the single strands, perhaps     by exposing the single strands individually to the annealing conditions.  While the single-stranded impurity profile can be captured via the analysis of the individual intermediates for release testing, determining the single-stranded impurity profile of the API on stability can only be accomplished using a denaturing duplex method. The analytical challenge associated with this task could be significantly reduced if the range of process impurities present in the single-stranded oligonucleotides is fully understood.  The remaining challenge would be to detect and quantify degradation products.</p>
            <p>Denaturing techniques cause the dissociation of all duplex and aggregated molecules into their respective single-stranded species, thereby providing a significant improvement in chromatographic resolution among individual impurities compared to the nondenaturing techniques, providing the capability to report, identify, and quantify individual impurities or groups of impurities as outlined in section 2.5. A variety of denaturing analytical techniques may be used (see section 2.5). If sufficient resolution is not achievable with one method, the use of a second orthogonal method may be considered.  As far as it is practical to do so, it is important to identify and quantify individual impurities and classify them based on their specific modification chemistry (see section 2.5).</p>
            <p>Nondenaturing techniques attempt to analyze the drug substance in its native form. The main analytical challenge is to develop methods that are capable of separating and quantifying residual single strands and aggregated components from the duplex, without at the same time disrupting the duplex.  Chromatographic methods that do not electrostatically bind or adsorb the analyte onto the column, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC),<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0092861512445311">38</xref>
               </sup> are generally accepted as having the least influence on structural conformation of the drug but are typically limited in resolving power compared to other techniques.  Additionally, for some nondenaturing methods, duplex variants might be sufficiently resolved from each other and the API to assess their distribution. In addition to SEC, other commonly used nondenaturing techniques include ion exchange chromatography,<sup>

            <p>The combined use of nondenaturing and denaturing techniques provides complementary analyses of double-stranded oligonucleotide impurities to ensure control of drug substance purity.  An effort can be made to map impurities detected by one method to the impurities detected by other methods.  If mapping between methods is completely successful, then confirming mass balance might be achievable.  Due to the complexity of the chromatograms, complete mapping of impurities from one method to another may not be practical in many cases.  A single purity value for the drug substance might thus not be calculable.  Regardless, it is important to establish an acceptance criterion for each of the impurity groups or individual impurities determined by each technique.  Given the challenges discussed in this section, it may be beneficial to report purity based on the same method as selected for assay determination.</p>

            <p>As discussed in the impurity profile section, it may be difficult to discriminate duplex variants (arising from combinations involving at least one single-stranded impurity) from the parent duplex.  Although the ideal is to have a quantitative weight-based determination of the parent duplex, it may only be practically possible to assay the total duplex instead, while at the same time tightly controlling single-stranded purity. At a minimum, we suggest the analytical technique be optimized to enable separation of residual single strands and aggregated strands from the duplex.  An important consideration in accepting an assay of an incompletely resolved duplex is that consistent impurity profiles of the single strands will assure a consistent equilibrium distribution of duplex variants following the annealing step.  The intent is to have a well-controlled process with appropriate analytical methods to ensure lot-to-lot consistency.</p>

The first comprises oligonucleotides that are conjugated to polydisperse species, such as polycarbohydrates and polyethylene glycol, while the second is made up of oligonucleotides that are conjugated to discrete moieties such as peptides, cholesterol, lipids, fatty acids, and others. Of the 2 classes, polydisperse conjugates present the greater analytical challenge, primarily because the conjugated drug substance is a mixture of related components.</p>

               <p>It is important to establish the identity of the oligonucleotide portion of the API. For technical reasons, testing is normally conducted more readily prior to conjugation. In the case of PEGylated aptamers, which represent a common class of polydisperse conjugates, the oligonucleotide portion of the API is typically in excess of 30 nucleotides long and often contains chemically modified nucleotides. These characteristics sometimes make direct MS (MS<sup>n</sup>) sequencing difficult, and often modified methods, which involve selective enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the oligonucleotide into smaller subunits that can then be sequenced directly, are employed. Failure sequence analysis<sup>

               <p>Provided the sequence is confirmed prior to conjugation, the goal of the identity test performed on the API is to determine whether the correct oligonucleotide and conjugation molecule were used in the conjugation reaction. As the target conjugated oligonucleotide might be difficult to distinguish from other conjugated oligonucleotides, more than one method may be required to ensure specificity. The identity of the conjugation moiety may be confirmed by measuring the average molecular weight of the API. Suitable methods for this purpose include SEC<sup>

In the majority of cases, it may be possible to confirm that the correct oligonucleotide was used in the conjugation reaction without having to sequence the oligonucleotide portion of the API. Example methods include comparison of retention time to a reference standard using RP or IP chromatography (although in isolation, this method is not considered a sufficient confirmation of sequence) and physiochemical methods such as T<sub>m</sub> analysis, CD, and NMR.</p>

               <title>4.1.2. Purity and Impurity Profile</title>
               <p>Because of the challenges associated with the analysis of polydisperse conjugates, it is important to develop methods for assessing the purity and impurity profile of both the nonconjugated intermediate oligonucleotide and the conjugated API. Many of the methods that are useful for the analysis of single-stranded oligonucleotides (section 2.5) may be applied to the analysis of the nonconjugated intermediate oligonucleotide. While the overall goal is to develop as complete a description of the impurity profile of the unconjugated intermediate as is practically possible, it is important to give special emphasis to determining and controlling the levels of impurities that are expected to participate in the conjugation reaction.</p>
               <p>It is also important to determine the purity and impurity profile of the conjugated API. Conceptually at least, impurities of polydisperse conjugated APIs may be considered at several levels. At one level, it is conceivable that the conjugated API may contain some amounts of residual nonconjugated oligonucleotide or conjugation molecule. In those instances where a purification step is performed subsequent to the conjugation reaction, it is likely that the very different physiochemical properties of the conjugated and nonconjugated oligonucleotides will ensure low levels of the latter are present initially, but it may be that residual conjugation molecules are more difficult to remove. In either case, unless it can be demonstrated through validation that the manufacturing process removes residual unconjugated oligonucleotides and conjugation molecules, we suggest testing the conjugated API for both. For those APIs where scission of the bond that links the oligonucleotide to the conjugation molecule occurs on storage, these tests assume additional importance.</p>
               <p>Polydisperse conjugated APIs may also contain low levels of related conjugates that are formed by conjugation of impurities present in the intermediate unconjugated oligonucleotide. As mentioned previously, the polydisperse nature of oligonucleotide conjugates results in broad peak shapes, which can often make it difficult to resolve parent from related conjugated oligonucleotides to any analytically useful extent. Broad peak shapes may also result in higher than normal limits of detection and quantitation. It is as a result of these and other analytical limitations that purity and impurity profile testing of the unconjugated intermediate assumes such importance.  Despite the challenges, however, it may be practically possible in some cases to distinguish among the different conjugated molecules present; in such instances, it is suggested the data be reported.</p>
               <p>The impurity profile of the oligonucleotide portion of the API is typically determined prior to the conjugation step, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512445311">Table 3</xref>. However, it is important to develop an understanding of the impact, if any, of the conjugation step and subsequent downstream processing on the impurity profile of the oligonucleotide.  This information, coupled with the impurity profile data generated on the nonconjugated intermediate, may be used to control the impurity profile of the conjugated API at the time of release. Given the challenges associated with its analysis, it is likely any stability assessment of the API conducted for the purpose of determining a retest period will rely not only on the analysis of the API itself but also on information gathered during the development phase on the stability and degradation pathways of the nonconjugated intermediate and conjugation molecule.   </p>

               <p>It is important to include a test of the polydispersity index (PDI), which is a measure of the distribution of molecular weights of a polymer. Changes in the PDI indicate changes in the molecular weight distribution of the polymeric portion of the API.  The PDI is expressed as the weight average molecular weight divided by the number average molecular weight. The larger the PDI, the greater the distribution of molecular weights present (a uniform polymer has a PDI = 1). The PDI may be determined from SEC and MALDI-MS data.</p>

               <title>4.1.4. Assay</title>
               <p>A quantitative weight-based assay of the sample is an important facet of the API specification. The assay value may be reported on the basis of either the conjugated oligonucleotide content or simply the oligonucleotide content of the sample. The choice of how best to define the assay value depends primarily on whether the corresponding drug product is formulated to contain a certain concentration of oligonucleotide conjugate, in which case it may be advantageous to define the drug substance assay on the oligonucleotide conjugate basis, or a certain concentration of oligonucleotide, in which case the alternative drug substance assay definition is more useful.</p>
               <p>However it is defined, we suggest the assay value be determined using a well-characterized reference standard. As a consequence of the polydisperse nature of the conjugated oligonucleotide, which results in broad peak shapes, it is frequently the case that the chromatographic method used to determine assay will be unable to differentiate between parent conjugated oligonucleotides and related conjugates formed by conjugation of oligonucleotide impurities. Therefore, although the ideal is to have a quantitative weight-based determination of the parent conjugate, it may only be practical to assay total conjugates instead, while at the same time tightly controlling the purity of the nonconjugated intermediate. The intent is to have a well-controlled process with appropriate analytical methods to ensure lot-to-lot consistency. Typically, the assay value is determined using a chromatographic technique, which is often the same as the method used to determine the purity and impurity profile of the conjugated drug substance or by UV spectroscopy. If a nonspecific method such as UV spectroscopy is used, the result obtained can be converted to a reportable assay value by multiplying by the purity.  </p>

            <title>4.2. Discrete Conjugates</title>
            <p>Conjugation of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides to a variety of discrete molecules such as cholesterol, peptides, fatty acids, and lipids can result in molecules with improved pharmacokinetic properties (see Manoharan and Kallanthottathil<sup>

               </sup> for a review). In most instances, the degree of analytical complexity associated with the analysis of an oligonucleotide conjugated to a discrete moiety lies somewhere between that of the corresponding nonconjugated and polydisperse conjugate analogs. Simplifying the analysis relative to the corresponding polydisperse conjugate is the fact that the target molecule is a single species and therefore more likely to be amenable to analysis by HPLC and MS techniques. However, conjugation, even to a discrete molecule, may result in analytical challenges not encountered with the nonconjugated analog, especially in those instances where the physiochemical properties of the conjugate are determined largely by those of the conjugation molecule.</p>
            <p>Where on the continuum of analytical complexity a particular discrete conjugate lies will determine the quality of analytical data available for the API. For example, for a short single-stranded oligonucleotide conjugate, it may be possible to demonstrate adequate control at the API stage itself, in which case the specification strategy might resemble closely that suggested for single-stranded oligonucleotides (see section 2). On the other hand, for a double-stranded oligonucleotide API where one strand is conjugated to cholesterol, for example, it is likely that the control strategy for the API will rely heavily on the results of intermediate testing. The control strategy may also be influenced by the manufacturing route. Most critically in this regard, the choice of whether to perform the conjugation reaction after oligonucleotide synthesis, which appears to be the case exclusively for polydisperse conjugates, or as the first or final step of solid phase synthesis impacts how much if any analytical data are available on the nonconjugated oligonucleotide.  </p>
            <p>In short, unlike polydisperse conjugates, where the analytical complexity introduced by conjugation appears to mandate control of the API rely heavily on results generated on the nonconjugated intermediate, the situation is less clear for discrete conjugates, and firm suggestions are more difficult to make. Despite this, we offer the following general observations in anticipation that they will apply to the majority of discrete conjugates.   </p>

               <title>4.2.1. Identification</title>
               <p>It is important to confirm the sequence of the oligonucleotide portion of the API. As was discussed in sections 3.1 and 4.1.1, it is important that the method used for initial sequence determination be able to differentiate the target oligonucleotide from all possible alternatives. If this is accomplished prior to conjugation, it is suggested that confirmation of the oligonucleotide sequence at the API stage is unnecessary; instead, the goal of the identity test conducted on the API is to confirm that the correct oligonucleotide and conjugation molecule were fused together in the conjugation step. In those instances when, either by choice or by necessity due to the method of synthesis, primary sequencing is conducted at the API stage, it will be important to demonstrate that the method chosen is unaffected by the presence of the conjugation molecule.   </p>

               <title>4.2.2. Purity and Impurity Profile</title>
               <p>Unlike polydisperse conjugates, for some simple discrete conjugates, it may be practical to develop a sufficiently selective method, or suite of orthogonal methods, to permit a full assessment of purity and impurity profile to be conducted on the conjugated API. In those cases where the manufacturing process does not proceed through a nonconjugated intermediate, this strategy is the only one available. To the extent that it is practically possible to do so, it is suggested that a complete analysis of purity and impurity profile be conducted after conjugation, using one or more of the techniques described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512445311">Table 1</xref>. We suggest that the impurity profile test also include a measure of residual nonconjugated oligonucleotides and conjugation molecules.</p>
               <p>It is acknowledged that in many instances, however, conjugation can limit the ability to assess purity and impurity profiles. For example, conjugation to hydrophobic lipids or cholesterol can result in APIs with chromatographic properties that are dominated by the conjugation molecule, making it difficult to detect and quantify levels of related conjugates. In these instances, it may be more effective to control certain impurities at the nonconjugated intermediate step. It is important to develop as full a description of the nonconjugated oligonucleotide as is practically possible, with particular emphasis on the detection and quantification of impurities that can participate in the conjugation reaction.  </p>
               <p>As was the case with polydisperse conjugates, when API purity is controlled at least partially by analyses conducted prior to conjugation, it will be important to demonstrate an understanding of the impact of the conjugation step and subsequent downstream processing on the impurity profile of the oligonucleotide.</p>

         <title>5. Conclusion</title>
         <p>In this article, we have identified characteristics of synthetic oligonucleotides that deserve special consideration and provide suggestions and discussions that we hope are of value. Tests and examples of analytical methodologies useful for helping to assess the quality of single-stranded, double-stranded, and conjugated oligonucleotides at the time of marketing application have been presented. Those experienced in drug development will find nothing surprising in the lists of suggested tests, as the general requirement to assess appearance, identity, assay, and impurities applies equally to small molecules and oligonucleotides. It is also true that the characteristics of analytical methods that are important for small molecules are shared with analytical methods for oligonucleotides. For example, the important analytical characteristic of the method used to confirm identity is specificity, and this is the case regardless of the nature of the API. It is clear, however, that it is often not practical to provide the same level of analytical detail for oligonucleotides as it is for small molecules. An example is impurity profile testing of single-stranded oligonucleotides (section 2.5), where it was argued that control of oligonucleotide impurities as groups rather than as individual components is the only practical strategy. Another example arises in the analysis of duplexes and conjugated oligonucleotides, where control of the single-stranded oligonucleotides is emphasized.</p>
         <p>We believe the approaches and underlying strategies presented in this article for different therapeutic modalities will continue to apply as analytical technology improves and as the design of modified oligonucleotides continues to widen. We have confidence that a number of new oligonucleotide therapeutics will soon be available to many patients.  In the majority of cases, we believe that it will be possible to develop and implement the minimum specification suggestions in this article by the time of submission of the marketing application. We emphasize that the API specification is only one facet of the control strategy and that other aspects, which include thorough product and process characterization during development, adherence to good manufacturing practices, process validation, and development of suitable specifications for raw materials, are also critical.</p>
