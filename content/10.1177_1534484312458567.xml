<abstract>
<p>We offer our reflections on McLean’s reaction and critique of our original article in which we developed an NHRD strategy model building process through cross case country comparisons of China and India. We address five major themes raised by McLean – country selection, challenges facing India and China, Model development, cross country comparisons and, research methods in this article. These broad themes also highlight the many areas of NHRD research and practice that are generally underexplored or remain confusing. There is much work to do in this area. We found this scholarly exchange useful and important in two ways. McLean’s critique and our reflections strengthen exploration of existing NHRD research and practice. Further, this literature extends the potential contributions and implications of HRD at the national level.</p>

<body>
<p>We appreciate the responses and insights shared by Dr. McLean with regard to our article. Writing a rejoinder to a response to one of our published articles was a new experience for us. We found engaging in scholarly dialogue very helpful for several reasons. First, it provides insights on many aspects of NHRD research and practice that are generally accepted (as an independent domain in HRD), challenged (theoretical base), underexplored (relevance to practice), or remain confusing (theory-building approaches and research methods). Second, it stimulates the expression of diverse opinions and gives the authors an opportunity to articulate their line of inquiry. Third, it offers further suggestions for scholars and practitioners interested in NHRD research. This exercise helps us, and our readers, become aware of areas for future improvement as researchers. Finally, it helps advance our knowledge of NHRD and move toward developing effective methods with which to conduct this line of research. Therefore, we appreciate the journal editor for inviting us, the authors, and leading NHRD researchers like Dr. McLean to engage in a scholarly discussion on this topic.</p>
<p>No research is perfect. As scholars, it is important that we learn from each research experience and use the new learning to improve future projects. Typically, journal publication formats do not offer opportunities to share the many decisions we make when conducting and writing research. These decisions often involve reframing some of the authors’ original ideas while incorporating valuable insights from reviewers and journal editors. Far from being a lonely journey, the research process engages many stakeholders who contribute and enhance the quality of research and the publication. We are, thus, enthused about articulating our perspectives, which are presented below.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">McLean’s (2012)</xref> invited reaction to our article raised five related issues. We address each of these issues and offer our reflections.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534484312458567">
<title>Country Selection</title>
<p>The countries we chose to compare in this research happen to fall into the category of BRIC, a popular acronym coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312458567">Jim O’Neill (2001)</xref>, which brackets four countries: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. In our article, we provided a sound rationale for such a choice beyond O’Neill’s grouping with regard to the selection of the two BRIC countries. The elaboration on the case selection was, in fact, prompted by our findings from the literature review, that there is a noticeable lack of effort by HRD scholars to provide a sound rationale in the selection of countries (single-country or multiple-country comparisons) for conducting NHRD research. It was important to disconfirm some of the assumptions regarding the selection and choice of case countries that we believe were taken for granted.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">McLean (2012)</xref> observed, our national affiliation (Indian and Chinese heritage) positioned us in bringing our own experiences and understanding (<italic>emic)</italic> of NHRD issues facing India and China. This is a good observation of what we were additionally attempting to accomplish in the research project. We combined the gap in the literature for providing a rationale for country selection as well as the vantage point of view our national origins offered, to redouble efforts in articulating the selection of these two countries as cases for comparison. The inclusion of two countries in this endeavor may have limited implications to other country contexts as suggested by McLean. The idea that a study of just two countries could produce meaningful insights for model development does have limitations, which affect the ability to create a meaningful model. We think it is reasonable to say that the NHRD research on single-country cases also has its limitations. We believe that the field has much work to do and our work should be considered as a step forward given the more prevalent single-country-based NHRD research in the HRD literature.</p>
<p>From the above standpoint, our rationale for country comparison (India and China) assumes particular significance given the variety and reach of the NHRD challenges, opportunities, and the potential implications they have for other developing nations. Despite the potential for interpretational bias (given our national origins), our work suggests important implications for other developing countries specifically with regard to the content and nature of NHRD challenges and opportunities. The aspirational focus of our research was to capture the evolving local, regional, national, and global identities (demographics), challenges (education, income, gender disparity, etc.), and opportunities (workforce and HRD potential) of the two countries. This focus was our biggest challenge and an unstated limitation of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1534484312458567">
<title>Unaddressed Challenges Facing India and China</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">McLean (2012)</xref> rightly indicated that our article did not address the many NHRD challenges faced by both countries. We made the decision for not including the NHRD challenges based on the feedback from the reviewers and journal editors. In our original manuscript, there were extensive descriptions of both countries (such as demographic data, educational systems, and cultural characteristics) and the high-level similarities in their national contexts. Unfortunately, these detailed descriptions had to be removed later due to publication constraints. To compensate for this omission, it was suggested that these NHRD challenges be included as areas for future research. Our primary goal was to identify an approach with which we could conduct cross-country NHRD comparisons. To that end, we presented critical NHRD issues (challenges and opportunities) to contextualize the cross-case comparison and to help readers gain a high-level understanding of each country. However, it is important to clarify that our decision by no means suggests factors as those noted by McLean do not exist or shape the NHRD reality in both countries. In fact, we concur with McLean that cultural barriers, and other challenges, which were not included in our article, create barriers to NHRD progress in the two countries. We appreciate McLean’s valid point that offers new insights for future research on NHRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534484312458567">
<title>Model Development</title>
<p>We are skeptical of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">McLean’s (2012)</xref> argument on the inadequacy of our model and model-building approach. First, to our knowledge, no HRD researcher has developed a model that identifies assumptions and variables that have been tested on observable NHRD data. We would be happy to include any additional elements relating to NHRD model building if we can identify those contributions. McLean outlines the concept of a model, referring to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312458567">Wiersman and Jurs (2009)</xref>. We believe the more appropriate way to frame our contribution would not be as a “scientific” model but a “conceptual model” derived from economic and historical perspectives closely corresponding to the real world. We assumed this definition of the conceptual model to emphasize the practical relevance of NHRD research, another area underexplored by HRD scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458567">Alagaraja, 2012</xref>). In fact, we were following the convention established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312458567">Cho and McLean (2004)</xref>, where they described five NHRD classifications as models. In hindsight, we wish we had been more circumspect in describing our conceptual model, as there are many valid approaches to model development.</p>
<p>Second, it was our intent to develop a case and propose a model-building process from the literature. Our efforts were aligned with the goal of <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic>, that is, to advance “literature reviews, theory building and conceptual pieces” and not utilize observed data. It was not our goal to identify variables and hypothesize relationships. We explored the possibilities for developing a process of model building using selective literature that supports and builds our arguments. In addition to the criticism for referring to our NHRD strategy development as a “model,” McLean also commented on our model-building process as inadequate and shared his concern that our model focused primarily on economic and historical perspectives. We address both issues in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>First, we believe our arguments were built on a broad review of literature. Unlike many studies, which rely heavily on a small volume of NHRD literature in HRD, we included a significant amount of related non-HRD literature to provide a holistic understanding of the topic under study. In fact, we decided to search for non-HRD literature based on the feedback from one of our reviewers. To our surprise and delight, the non-HRD NHRD-related literature not only explicitly stated the rationale for conducting cross-country comparisons but also offered systematic ways of investigating national-level HRD issues and challenges. Therefore, we believe our model-building process was well supported by the extant NHRD literature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we made it clear at the outset why we chose to focus on NHRD model building, an area that was left out by HRD researchers. We believe such a focus identified existing NHRD contributions that expands current knowledge and provides an alternative way of examining NHRD. It was not our intent at this stage of the development process to identify variables and establish hypothesized relationships as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">McLean (2012)</xref> suggested. His comments outline more opportunities for refining our model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534484312458567">
<title>Cross-Country Comparisons</title>
<p>We do not suggest that single-case-country NHRD studies to be less relevant than cross-country comparisons. If we are to advance research and theory on NHRD, we strongly suggest that cross-case comparisons are necessary, as they also help us identify and reveal NHRD challenges and opportunities. We also do not claim that two-country comparisons are adequate for developing a robust model-building process. We, however, do argue for the need for explicitly stating a rationale in the selection and choice of countries, whether it is a single-country study or cross-country comparison for future NHRD studies. We were surprised by the critique about our choice of references, as the references we utilized pertain to publications within the <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resource</italic>s (ADHR) issue that McLean felt was not included (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312458567">Lynham, Paprock, &amp; Cunningham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312458567">McLean, Osman-Gani, &amp; Cho, 2004</xref>). We do acknowledge, though, that instead of simply referencing the full edited issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312458567">McLean, Lynham, Azevedo, Lawrence, &amp; Nafukho, 2008</xref>). we referenced specific articles within that issue that were directly relevant to our article, which is the method we adopted to develop this conceptual paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534484312458567" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>It is important to clarify this article was a conceptual manuscript, not an integrative literature review. Therefore, we did not document in detail our literature selection process or indicate the databases we used because we did “not claim to conduct a thorough and detailed search of the literature to provide a data set; instead, [we] present carefully selected literature consistent with the premise of the manuscript” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312458567">Callahan, 2010</xref>, p. 302). Our goal was to identify literature that helps build a cohesive argument for developing a model-building process. Instead of evaluating our article using the criteria for an integrative literature review, the article should be treated as a conceptual essay with an intent to propose a model-building approach. Given that, we found much of McLean’s critique about the databases used was not in alignment with recommendations for constructing a conceptual manuscript as noted by Callahan in her <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic> article.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in our article, in order to make the research method transparent to the readers, we were very explicit about the criteria for selecting publications that met our needs to support our argument. Hence, the core issue to question should be whether the literature we have selected supports our argument, <italic>not</italic> whether there is more literature out there. As noted earlier, depending on the purpose of the article, an exhaustive review may not be necessary; this is our case.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we accept McLean’s suggestion about searching for literature in the authors’ native languages. In our experience, it can be very challenging to identify non-English literature through the databases available to us at U.S. institutions. For researchers who engage in cross-cultural or international research, we must make a special effort to identify means to gain access to indigenous literature.</p>
<p>To conclude, as emerging scholars who are engaged in research in a relatively new area such as NHRD, where no best research methods have been identified, we found this scholarly exchange valuable. It helps us to think more carefully and critically about our own research. It also motivates us to focus future efforts in articulating unstated assumptions and limitations. Finally, we are indebted to our reviewers, McLean, and the editor of <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic> for their constructive feedback and the opportunity to engage in a scholarly conversation. McLean’s statement, that our article “makes an excellent contribution to the growing number of articles that are addressing NHRD” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458567">2012</xref>, p. 1) renews us for future work on NHRD research and practice. We invite our readers to contribute to this discussion.</p>
