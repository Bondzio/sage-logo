<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in Asia is rarely evaluated on a large scale, and data on treatment outcome are scarce. The Pan-Asian CEPHEUS study aimed to assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal attainment among patients on lipid-lowering therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This survey was conducted in eight Asian countries. Hypercholesterolaemic patients aged ≥18 years who had been on lipid-lowering treatment for ≥3 months (stable medication for ≥6 weeks) were recruited, and lipid concentrations were measured. Demographic and other clinically relevant information were collected, and the cardiovascular risk of each patient was determined. Definitions and criteria set by the updated 2004 National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines were applied.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In this survey, 501 physicians enrolled 8064 patients, of whom 7281 were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 61.0 years, 44.4% were female, and 85.1% were on statin monotherapy. LDL-C goal attainment was reported in 49.1% of patients overall, including 51.2% of primary and 48.7% of secondary prevention patients, and 36.6% of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The LDL-C goal was attained in 75.4% of moderate risk, 55.4% of high risk, and only 34.9% of very high-risk patients. Goal attainment was directly related to age and inversely related to cardiovascular risk and baseline LDL-C.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A large proportion of Asian hypercholesterolaemic patients on lipid-lowering drugs are not at recommended LDL-C levels and remain at risk for cardiovascular disease. Given the proven efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs in the reduction of LDL-C, there is room for further optimization of treatments to maximize benefits and improve outcomes.</p>

<p>Controlling circulating lipids and, in particular, reducing the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a key intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826710397100">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826710397100">3</xref></sup> Clinical trials have shown that the impact of lipid-lowering treatment is predominantly dependent on the individual’s baseline risk of cardiovascular events, and risk reduction is proportional to the degree of LDL-C lowering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826710397100">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826710397100">4</xref></sup> Several cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention guidelines are in place to guide physicians in the clinical management of dyslipidaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826710397100">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826710397100">9</xref></sup> The updated 2004 Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III) on cholesterol management recommends a therapeutic LDL-C goal of &lt;100 mg/dl for those at high risk (coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents and 10-year risk &gt;20%) of cardiovascular events, with the option to further lower the goal to &lt;70 mg/dl for individuals at very high risk (established CHD plus multiple major risk factors, severe and persistent risk factors, metabolic syndrome, or acute coronary syndrome). The recommended LDL-C goal for those at moderately high risk (two or more risk factors and 10-year risk of 10–20%) is &lt;130 mg/dl, with an optional LDL-C goal of 100 mg/dl, on the basis of recent trial evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710397100">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outcome benefits of pharmacological interventions for individuals at higher risk for CVD are well documented;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826710397100">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826710397100">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826710397100">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826710397100">14</xref></sup> regardless of the drug used, successful interventions for elevated LDL-C reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events across a broad spectrum of patients at risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826710397100">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826710397100">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826710397100">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826710397100">14</xref></sup> However, in real-life clinical practice, a substantial proportion of patients undergoing treatment fail to attain target levels of LDL-C and other lipids, and remain at risk of cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826710397100">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826710397100">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dismal management of dyslipidaemia is also reflected by findings from the CEntralized Pan-European survey on tHE Under-treatment of hypercholeSterolemia (CEPHEUS) survey conducted during 2006 and 2007, which showed that 42.6% of patients on lipid-lowering drug therapy failed to attain their respective NCEP ATP III-defined LDL-C goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826710397100">19</xref></sup> Elsewhere, in the USA, although a follow-up study (2006–7) 10 years after the first Lipid Treatment Assessment Project (L-TAP) conducted during the period 1996 to 1997 showed an impressive 35% improvement in overall LDL-C goal attainment rate, only 30% of CHD patients with ≥2 additional risk factors managed to attain the optional LDL-C goal of &lt;70 mg/dl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826710397100">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826710397100">22</xref></sup> In Asia, comprehensive data on the use of lipid-lowering therapies and the extent to which patients manage to reach therapeutic LDL-C goals are limited. However, the recent retrospective Return on Expenditure Achieved for Lipid Therapy in Asia (REALITY-Asia) study on hypercholesterolaemic patients undergoing statin therapy in six Asian countries found that only 48% of patients attained the NCEP ATP III goals for LDL-C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826710397100">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Failure to attain therapeutic LDL-C goals may be attributed to several factors, including poor adherence to treatment guidelines by physicians, and non-compliance with drug regimens by patients. Recent studies found that, although physicians appreciate the risk of CVD, the importance of achieving healthy cholesterol levels does not seem to be widely endorsed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826710397100">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826710397100">25</xref></sup> These studies also found surprisingly poor knowledge of CVD risk among patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In Asia, the extent of physicians’ implementation of CVD prevention guidelines, and how well their patients fare in managing their lipid levels, remains largely unknown. The present survey aimed to fill that information gap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826710397100" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The CEPHEUS Pan-Asian study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00687492) was a prospective, multinational, cross-sectional survey of subjects on lipid-lowering pharmacological treatment. This multicentre survey was conducted at 405 sites in Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong SAR, China, with a target enrolment of approximately 8000 patients. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Investigational Review Board and the Ethics Committee governing each participating centre before the commencement of patient enrolment. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of good clinical research practice, and conformed to ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All participating patients provided written informed consent before being enrolled in the study.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826710397100"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Study subjects were patients who fulfilled the following criteria: (i) aged 18 years or above, (ii) had two or more cardiovascular risk factors as defined by the updated 2004 NCEP ATP III guidelines, and (iii) had at the time of enrolment been on lipid-lowering drugs for at least three months, with no dose change for at least six weeks. Patients were excluded if they were found to have participated in any interventional clinical study during the preceding 90-day period, were unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, or were personally involved in the conduct of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826710397100"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of patients on lipid-lowering pharmacological treatment attaining LDL-C goals, as defined by the updated 2004 NCEP ATP III guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710397100">7</xref></sup> Secondary objectives included: (i) determining the proportion of patients in primary or secondary prevention, and with metabolic syndrome (NCEP ATP III definition) who attained LDL-C goals; (ii) identifying the determinants of undertreatment of hypercholesterolaemia; and (iii) investigating patient and physician characteristics associated with the allocation of treatment approaches. For all purposes, definitions and criteria set by the updated 2004 NCEP ATP III guidelines were applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710397100">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826710397100"><title>Survey instruments and procedure</title>
<p>The survey instrument consisted of a questionnaire each for the attending physician and the patient and a case record form (CRF) for the physician to record the patient’s demographics, results of physical examination, cardiovascular medical history, known cardiovascular risk factors (including CHD or CHD risk equivalents and metabolic syndrome), past lipid profile (if any), current lipid-lowering therapy, and reason for the treatment. The physician questionnaire comprised 23 questions designed to collect information on the physician’s awareness and use of practice guidelines, therapeutic LDL-C goals adopted, their management of hypercholesterolaemia, and related communications with patients, as well as personal attitudes pertaining to hypercholesterolaemia and its management. The patient questionnaire comprised 17 questions designed to find out the patient’s perception of hypercholesterolaemia and its management, their compliance with lipid-lowering treatment, and personal satisfaction with the treatment.</p>
<p>On commencement of the study, each physician-investigator first completed the physician questionnaire. Consenting patients were then consecutively enrolled and assessed. Each participating patient completed the patient questionnaire before they underwent the assessment. On assessment, each patient’s data were entered into the individual CRF. An overnight fasting blood sample was taken for determination of blood glucose and lipid (total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides) concentrations. The biochemical analysis was performed at the local laboratory in individual hospitals. The cardiovascular risk profile of each patient was determined based on criteria set by the updated 2004 NCEP ATP III guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710397100">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826710397100"><title>Endpoints</title>
<p>The primary endpoint was the LDL-C goal attainment rate, defined as the proportion of patients (overall and by country) on lipid-lowering treatment achieving their respective therapeutic LDL-C goals. The secondary endpoint was the LDL-C goal attainment rate in primary and secondary prevention patients and patients with metabolic syndrome. Additional endpoints included the percentage of patients in different CHD risk groups achieving LDL-C goals, attainment of LDL-C goals according to individual CHD risk factors, LDL-C goal attainment according to lipid-lowering drug type, determinants of lipid-lowering drug prescription and goal attainment, LDL-C goal attainment by country, and follow-up treatment of patients not achieving LDL-C targets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826710397100"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Sample size was determined to ensure that the proportion of subjects reporting on the primary endpoint should be estimated with sufficient precision, overall and on a by-country basis, to represent the heterogeneity of the population. Accordingly, we determined that a sample size of 850–1600 patients per country was sufficient to ensure that the proportion of subjects reporting on the primary endpoint could be estimated with the width of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between ±2.4 and ±3.4%. The overall sample size for the entire study was targeted to be approximately 8000 patients.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed on the per-protocol population, which included 7281 consenting patients from the 405 study sites who completed the study, and whose attending physicians completed and returned the physician’s questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions, medians, means and standard deviations, were used to describe demographics data, anthropometric measurements such as body weight, height, and waist circumference, and concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides. In the analysis of the primary outcome variable (i.e. dichotomized results ‘yes/no’ in individual patients with regard to achievement of the LDL-C goals defined by the 2004 updated NCEP ATP III guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826710397100">7</xref></sup>), the percentage of patients achieving the LDL-C goals, together with the 95% CI was presented (overall and by country). Exploratory analysis was done to determine factors affecting achievement of LDL-C goals in individual patients. Factors to be identified were grouped into two categories: patient determinants and physician determinants. For patients, these included the 17 questions on the patient questionnaire, metabolic syndrome (yes/no) and individual components thereof, including blood pressure (yes/no); risk category and whether or not fulfilling a very high-risk category; type of therapy (statin or other monotherapy or combination therapy); previous lipid profile (i.e. total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglyceride levels before treatment); duration since drug initiation (years); and reason for prescribing current lipid-lowering drugs (primary prevention, secondary prevention, familial hypercholesterolaemia). For physicians, these included the 23 questions on the physician questionnaire, physician age (continuous variable), gender, years of practice (continuous variable), and specialization (general practitioner (GP), cardiologist, endocrinologist, other).</p>
<p>Patient factors were screened in a univariate analysis by means of logistic model analysis, and physician factors were screened in a univariate analysis by means of generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis with a random effect of physician using the NLMIXED procedure of the SAS system. In these univariate analyses, the response variable was the achievement of LDL-C goals in individual patients, and patient or physician factors were examined one at a time as an exploratory variable. The factors that proved to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the univariate analysis were then further evaluated in a multivariate analysis by means of GLMM approach for their possible association with the outcome (attainment of the set LDL-C goal). This significance level, which is stricter than that used conventionally, was used in order to avoid choosing meaningless variables that may be caused by the very large number of patients included in the data. Factors were chosen and added to the model one by one at each step until no factors with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 remained. For the final models, the following results were provided: regression coefficient estimate, standard error and <italic>p</italic>-value for each effect, and estimated odds ratio (OR) with associated 95% CI. In this analysis, the adjustment of the multiplicity of statistical testing was not made because this analysis was exploratory.</p>
<p>The association between follow-up plan when patients were not at treatment goal and the potential predictor variables (patient determinants) for the primary endpoint was evaluated. For categorical variables, cross-tables were produced. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics were calculated for each category of the follow-up plan.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826710397100" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Between 28 April and 31 December 2008, 501 of 719 invited physician-investigators from 405 study sites across Asia invited 8451 hypercholesterolaemic patients to become involved in the study (8064 were enrolled patients) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826710397100">Figure 1</xref>). Of these, 7281 (90.3%) patients with evaluable data (returned patient and physician questionnaire, and CRF completed with required laboratory data) formed the population for final statistical evaluation of the study endpoints.

<sec id="sec9-1741826710397100"><title>Physician-investigator characteristics</title>
<p>Among the physician-investigators who declined the invitation to participate in the study, reasons given included inadequate staff resources, conflicts with other studies or with professional schedule, lack of interest, lack of time, lack of patients and patients lost to follow-up. A total of 501 physician-investigators returned the physician survey questionnaire with at least one question answered. Overall, their mean age was 45.4 years, 65.2% were males, and they had been in practice for a mean of 16.9 years. Most were either cardiologists (48.3%) or GPs/primary care physicians (32.3%). Individual cholesterol targets were set for a mean of 78.0% of their patients. Nearly all the physicians (98.4%) stated that they used LDL-C levels as the laboratory measure for treatment target, but triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL-C were also used by some. The majority (92.7%) indicated that they used clinical practice guidelines to establish the therapeutic targets, including the NCEP ATP III guidelines in 83.6%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826710397100">Table 1</xref> shows physician-investigator characteristics by country.

<p>Patients’ responses in the survey questionnaires reflected generally poor compliance with drug treatment, with 44.1% sometimes forgetting to take their tablets, and 15.6% forgetting to take their tablets at least once a week (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826710397100">Table 2</xref>). In addition, 1708 (24.9%) of 6870 patients thought that missing their daily tablets more than once a week would not affect their cholesterol levels, and 3707 (54.0%) of them thought the same about missing their daily tablets at least once every two weeks. This suggests that some ignorance about the role of drugs in cholesterol management may have, in part, contributed to patients’ attitudes in terms of compliance with drug treatment regimens.</p>

The most commonly used statin in drug monotherapy was simvastatin, which was prescribed to 31.6% of patients on any monotherapy, followed by atorvastatin (27.7%) and rosuvastatin (26.6%). The most frequently prescribed daily dosage for monotherapy was 20 mg for simvastatin (14.0%; 924/6594 patients), 10 mg for atorvastatin (16.4%; 1080/6594 patients) and 10 mg for rosuvastatin (19.5%; 1289/6594 patients). Very few patients were on other classes of lipid-lowering drugs, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with statins or other drugs. Only 5.7% of patients on monotherapy were on fibrates, and 0.3% of patients used other monotherapies (nicotinic acid, ezetimibe or omega-3 acid ethyl esters).

<sec id="sec14-1741826710397100"><title>Determinants of drug prescription and LDL-C goal attainment</title>
<p>None of the physician-related factors assessed were found to influence drug prescription. However, patient’s lipid profile and cardiovascular risk profile significantly influenced the physician’s prescription of lipid-lowering drugs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Thus, patients with a baseline LDL-C concentration ≥120 mg/dl were 3.78 times more likely to be prescribed a statin as those whose LDL-C concentration was &lt;120 mg/dl (95% CI: 2.59–5.53; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Patients with CHD were 3.24 times more likely to be prescribed a statin as those without CHD (95% CI: 2.05–5.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, triglyceride concentrations had a less marked effect on statin prescribing: patients whose triglyceride concentration was ≥300 mg/dl were only 0.05 times more likely to be prescribed a statin as those whose triglyceride concentration was &lt;150 mg/dl (95% CI: 0.03–0.08).</p>
<p>The drug used and patient’s age, systolic blood pressure, baseline (pre-treatment) total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations, therapeutic LDL-C goals, and personal compliance with treatment were found to be significantly associated with the attainment of LDL-C goals (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.005; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1741826710397100">Table 5</xref>). The most significant predictor of LDL-C goal attainment was the patient’s cardiovascular risk level, as reflected by their individual lipid profile and LDL-C goal. Both higher baseline total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations were associated with a lower chance of attaining LDL-C goals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The likelihood of attaining LDL-C goal decreased with increasing baseline LDL-C OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.36–0.59 for every 100 mg/dl increment; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with lower chance of attaining LDL-C goal (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89–0.98, for every 10 mmHg increment; <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Contrary to common perceptions, older patients were more likely than their younger counterparts to attain their treatment goals (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05–1.22; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, for every 10-year increment in age). In terms of drug treatment used, patients on rosuvastatin monotherapy were more likely to achieve target LDL-C levels than those on combination therapies and other monotherapies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The effect of dose level of lipid-lowering drugs was also examined but found to be unimportant. As expected, patients with better compliance had a higher chance (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.27–1.76; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of attaining their goals compared with patients with poorer compliance.

<p>To identify patient characteristics that might determine the change in treatment plan in case of failure to attain LDL-C goal, we investigated the follow-up treatment given to 2424 patients whose LDL-C levels were found not to be at therapeutic goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1741826710397100">Figure 6</xref>). Of these patients, 1181 (48.7%) either had their existing drug medication dose increased (25.5%), were switched to another medication (16.8%), or had their existing dose increased and were given another medication (6.4%). Of the rest, 332 (13.7%) were advised to take on cholesterol management by lifestyle modification, and only 40 (1.7%) were recommended to take on other follow-up treatment plans. In addition, 871 (35.9%) patients were asked to maintain their existing treatment, and these tended to be older (mean age 63.5 years) and to have a higher cardiovascular risk (including 626 (38.1%) of the 1644 fulfilling the criteria of very high-risk patients, 53.1% of patients with CAD, 41.5% of patients with CHD, and 48.6% of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia). They also tended to be more compliant with their lipid-lowering treatment (including 39.7% of patients who disagreed that they sometimes forget to take tablets), and to be those on statin monotherapy (35.8%) or combination therapy (41.6%). On the other hand, patients who were switched to another medication, or a combination of another medication and increased dosage of existing medication tended to be younger (mean age 60.5 and 56.4 years, respectively). They also tended to be at lower cardiovascular risk, with only 15.4% of patients who switched medication being at very high risk and 25.7% of patients given an increased dosage of existing medication being at very high risk. Those asked to switch medication tended to be those on fibrate monotherapy (26.5%) rather than statin monotherapy (16.3%) or combination therapy (14%). Patients given an increased dosage of existing medication tended to be those on statin monotherapy; they included 28% of those on statin monotherapy but only 10% of those on other monotherapies.

<p>This multicentre, cross-sectional, observational study documents the current state of lipid-lowering drug treatment in hypercholesterolaemic patients in eight countries across Asia. The key observation from this study is that a substantial proportion of Asian hypercholesterolaemic patients, particularly those in the higher cardiovascular risk categories, are not attaining their therapeutic LDL-C goals, suggesting that current management of hypercholesterolaemic patients at risk of CVD remains suboptimal across Asia. This underscores the need to identify and further understand the underlying causes of failure to attain treatment goals so as to better strategize management of cholesterol levels in these hypercholesterolaemic patients.</p>
<p>At the time of the survey, more than half (50.9%) of patients were not at their recommended therapeutic LDL-C goals despite having been on lipid-lowering drug treatment for a mean duration of 2.7 ± 3.0 years, and for at least three months prior to enrolment in this study. Except for patients in Hong Kong SAR, China, where treatment goal attainment rate was 82.9%, patients in the rest of the countries surveyed had unacceptably low LDL-C goal attainment rates (31.3–52.7%). Of particular concern is the observation that the majority of patients who failed to attain therapeutic LDL-C goals were in the high or very high cardiovascular risk category. Despite 92.7% of the physicians in this study reporting that they used clinical practice guidelines, particularly the NCEP ATP III guidelines (used by 83.6%), to establish an individual patient’s treatment goal, it seems that there is still much room for optimization of patients’ treatment, whether from the perspective of treatment approach or management.</p>
<p>Although almost half of the study population were at high or very high cardiovascular risk, most patients were on regimens of low to medium equipotency doses of statins, and most (64.1%) were still on the same lipid-lowering drug as first prescribed. Furthermore, physicians increased the drug dose in less than half of the patients (48.7%) who could not attain their LDL-C goals. Ironically, patients who were recommended to maintain their drug dosage were predominantly those at very high risk for CVD. The reason for this conservative treatment approach is not entirely clear, but concerns of possible higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions from high-dose drug regimens often outweigh perceived benefits from uptitration of drug doses, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, physicians might be reluctant to increase drug dosage if the reason for a patient’s failure to attain the treatment goal was nothing more than a personal compliance problem. This, we suspect, could be the issue in many cases as patient compliance was often poor. As none of the physician characteristics that we investigated were found to be associated with patients’ attainment of therapeutic LDL-C, it is likely that patient-related factors, including compliance with drug treatment, played a central role.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, while a patient’s LDL-C goal attainment rate decreases with increasing baseline LDL-C, blood pressure and CVD risk levels, the propensity to attain the goal increases with age. The reason for lower LDL-C goal attainment rate among younger, usually healthier patients, is unclear. However, it is noted that a higher proportion of younger patients (10.9% versus 2.8% in those ≥70 years old) were prescribed non-statin drugs, which are known to be less efficacious for lowering LDL-C. In this study, the LDL-C goal attainment rate was highest in patients who were on statin monotherapy (50.1% versus 33.6% in those on non-statin drugs). The higher goal attainment rate with use of statins concurs with findings from the Pan-European CEPHEUS study which showed that, compared to other drug treatment, statin therapy resulted in the highest rate of LDL-C goal attainment (56.6% versus 37.6% for fibrates and 19.4% for other types of lipid-lowering drugs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826710397100">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall 49.1% LDL-C goal attainment rate among all patients surveyed across Asia is reflective of observations from the recent REALITY-Asia study, which reported that 48% of patients across all cardiovascular risk categories attaining NCEP ATP III targets for LDL-C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826710397100">23</xref></sup> The REALITY-Asia study was, however, a retrospective and a smaller study (<italic>n</italic> = 2622) conducted in China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Unlike the present study, which included patients on all drug treatments, the REALITY-Asia study population comprised only adults with hypercholesterolaemia newly initiated on statin monotherapy. Nevertheless, our key findings echo that of the REALITY-Asia study. The goal attainment rate in patients at high risk is, however, almost double that reported in a more focused 2006 Singapore study conducted only on survivors (5174 patients) of acute myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, in which approximately 70% of the patients were found to have failed to attain a LDL-C goal of &lt;100 mg/dl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826710397100">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, the overall LDL-C goal attainment rate found in both this and the REALITY-Asia study is much lower than reported in recent international studies conducted primarily in Caucasian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826710397100">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826710397100">22</xref></sup> In the L-TAP2 study, conducted in nine countries in Europe, America and Asia, the overall LDL-C goal attainment rate was 73% (range 47–83.5%), with the highest goal attainment rate recorded in Korea (83.5%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826710397100">22</xref></sup> Patients in Taiwan fared less well, with only 65.9% attaining their LDL-C goal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826710397100">22</xref></sup> but this is still higher than the 49.1% overall goal attainment rate in our study. Although lipid-lowering drug use in L-TAP2 is quite similar to that in this study, with predominant use of statin monotherapy (75% versus 85.1% in this study), the baseline LDL-C concentration of their patient cohort was much lower (100 ± 37 mg/dl versus 144.5 ± 45.6 mg/dl in this study).</p>
<p>Comparison of our study with the Pan-European CEPHEUS study shows a less substantial difference in the proportion of patients achieving their respective NCEP ATP III targets for LDL-C (57.4% versus 49.1% in this study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826710397100">19</xref></sup> This is despite the fact that, as with L-TAP2, patients in the Pan-European CEPHEUS study had a much lower mean baseline LDL-C concentration (105 ± 36 mg/dl versus 144.5 ± 45.6 mg/dl in this study), and a higher proportion of patients in the Pan-European CEPHEUS study were on statins (93.3% of those on monotherapy (90.3% of all patients) versus 75% of all patients in L-TAP2 and 85.1% of all patients in this study).</p>
<p>The LDL-C goal attainment rate of our patients in Hong Kong (82.9%) appears exceptionally high compared to results from a localized focus study in 196 adults at high cardiovascular risk in two public hospitals in Hong Kong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826710397100">27</xref></sup> In that study, 44% of patients who received at least one lipid-lowering therapy did not attain their LDL-C goal over 1.9 years. Given the same practice environment and assuming that treatment settings were similar in the hospitals in Hong Kong, the large difference in goal attainment rate may be surprising at first glance. However, the unusually high treatment goal attainment rate at our Hong Kong study centre could be attributed, at least in part, to the unique setting of the centre, which is an academic cardiology specialty practice. Management of dyslipidaemia at the centre is aggressive and participating physicians (100% cardiologists) follow international CVD prevention guidelines, assiduously monitor patients and uptitrate drug dosages whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Having said this, there are clearly a number of factors that may affect treatment compliance and goal attainment rates, including variations in practice patterns and medication pricing, and there may be marked differences within countries and even within regions. For example, individuals in rural areas may have more limited access to medical facilities and newer treatment options compared with those in urban areas. Conversely, urbanization and economic development have resulted in trends towards increased serum total cholesterol levels and mortality rates from CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826710397100">23</xref></sup> Less healthy lifestyle choices as a result of a lower level of education, poorer socio-economic status and even lower IQ can also increase the risk of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826710397100">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826710397100">29</xref></sup> There are several recent examples in Asian countries where educational intervention or clinical audit have been shown to improve lipid (and/or other) goal attainment rates in people at risk of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826710397100">30</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826710397100">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study result provides a useful overview of current cholesterol management and treatment outcomes in Asia. However, it needs to be interpreted within the context and limitations of the study. It must be noted that the population studied is small and considerable variability in practice environments exists between countries, and probably even between study sites. Moreover, our selection of participating physicians and patients was not randomized. For example, physicians were invited if they were experts in their field, had appropriate clinical specializations, clinical trial experience, were able to recruit large numbers of patients, and were interested in the study. The physicians then invited patients to participate. The cohort under study may therefore not be representative of the target study population. In addition, the population included only hypercholesterolaemic patients who were already on some form of lipid-lowering medication. It was not clear what proportion of eligible patients with appropriate risk factors were offered lipid-lowering medications in different countries. Such information would be important to evaluate the overall burden of the disease among untreated patients in various countries. Furthermore, we did not collect information on dietary and other lifestyle interventions, adverse events, nor on the socioeconomic status of the patients, some parameters of which might co-determine treatment compliance and LDL-C goal attainment in patients. As such, inferences derived from the data should be suggestive rather than conclusive. However, our results are comparable to the findings reported in previous clinical practice surveys in the region, and thus appear robust.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1741826710397100" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A large proportion of hypercholesterolaemic patients on lipid-lowering drugs across Asia are not at recommended therapeutic LDL-C levels. These patients, the majority of whom are at a high or very high cardiovascular risk, remain at risk for probable cardiovascular events. Given the proven efficacy of available lipid-lowering drugs in the reduction of LDL-C, there is clearly room for further optimization of drug treatments to maximize benefits and improve treatment outcomes.</p>
