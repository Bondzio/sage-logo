<p>Great changes in terms of land and labour systems have been brought about by the economic reform launched by the Chinese Government in the late 1970s. The new rural responsibility system, which was popularized in rural areas at the end of 1983, gave individual peasant households the right to contract land on a per capita or per labourer basis for their use over a fixed period of time, even though they did not own the land. Production was organized by individual rural households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211424253">Croll, 1988</xref>). At the same time, rural-to-urban migration, which was strictly constrained in the collective era,was relaxed somewhat, and peasants could go to the city to find a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094211424253">Entwisle and Henderson, 2000</xref>). This indeed resulted in unprecedented rural-to-urban migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211424253">Roberts, 1997</xref>). How have these changes affected farming arrangements in rural China? Who has been working on China’sfarms since the economic reform? Moreover, the family planning policy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211424253">1</xref></sup> introduced in the 1970s started affecting the labour market in the late 1990s, when the generation who had been born under the effects of this policy had grown up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211424253">Knight et al., 2010</xref>). How has this demographic transition impacted farming arrangements? Some scholars suggest that a phenomenon called the ‘feminization of agriculture’ is occurring in China, as is reported to be taking place in most developing areas such as Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211424253">Lastarria-Cornhiel, 2006</xref>), Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211424253">Deere, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211424253">Lastarria-Cornhiel, 2006</xref>) and Asia, especially India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424253">Kelkar, 2009</xref>). They insist that Chinese rural women are left behind to do farm work and earn less than men, who mainly engage in non-farming jobs. This is detrimental to the well-being of rural women and agricultural productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424253">Bossen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424253">Croll, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211424253">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211424253">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211424253">Davin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424253">Jacka, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211424253">Judd, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424253">Ren and Dong, 1997</xref>). Based on statistical studies, however, some other scholars suggest that the feminization of agriculture in China is not occurring; and even ifwomen were taking over farms, they suggest that the consequences in China would mostly be positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211424253">De Brauw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211424253">De Brauw et al., 2008</xref>). Based on quantitative data and ethnographic information collected in Lianhe, a central Chinese village, this article suggests that both sides might be correct in different contexts when demographic changes among different generations and cohorts of the farming populations, regional differences in industrialization and levels of rural-to-urban labour migration are considered. This article proposes that since the late 1970s there has been a transition from the feminization of agriculture to the ageing of farming populations, due to changes in demographic features and the household division of labour in successive generations.</p>
<p>This article first reviews the research literature on farming arrangements in rural China since the economic reform, contrasting opinions from both sides of the debate. After briefly introducing the setting of the village of Lianhe and the research methods, it then proceeds to focus on the demographic transition of the two generations of farming populations in Lianhe since the late 1970s and its impact on farming organization. Lastly it raises the question: Who will be farming in 10 years’ time? and discusses the implications for rural China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211424253"><title>Who has been working on China’s farms since the economic reform? A brief review</title>
<p>Who has been working on China’s farms since the economic reform? It has been suggested that able-bodied rural women were left to farm by their husbands, who migrated to cities for non-farming work. Based on qualitative and descriptive evidence, feminist scholars suggest that rural Chinese women are taking over farming in specific villages in Shandong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211424253">Judd, 1994</xref>), Sichuan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424253">Jacka, 1997</xref>), Yunnan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424253">Bossen, 2002</xref>) and Henan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424253">Ren and Dong, 1997</xref>). Wolf found that in1985, in villages in Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shaanxi, rural women tookup 59–88 percent of farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094211424253">Gao, 1994</xref>).With husbands absent, women could make their contribution more visible and therefore earn some household bargaining power. At the same time, playing a larger role in farming and family management could advance their self-consciousness and independence. The increased labour time and excessive responsibilities, however, could be harmful to their physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424253">Ren and Dong, 1997</xref>). Others worry that the dominant role of rural women, who are often less educated than rural men, will negatively impact China’s agriculture in terms of its operation, structure, and the promotion of agricultural skills, which will decrease productivity and further threaten national food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211424253">UNDP, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211424253">Yu et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A counter conclusion is offered by some agricultural economists whose works are based on quantitative and empirical studies. For example, based on household survey data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211424253">Alan de Brauw (2003)</xref> suggests that the proportion of farm work done by women declined over the late 1990s, and concludes that future feminization of agriculture in China is unlikely. Linxiu Zhang and her co-authors propose that even though rural women are left in charge of farming, crop productivity does not fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211424253">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). In a recent article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211424253">De Brauw and his co-authors (2008)</xref> claim to debunk the ‘myth’ surrounding Chinese women’s participation in farming and suggest that the feminization of agriculture in China is not occurring. Even if women were taking over Chinese farms, the consequences would be mostly positive rather than negative from a labour supply, productivity, and income point of view.</p>
<p>The analyses from both sides focus on particular areas. Even though the quantitative studies are based on large-scale statistical datasets, the datasets were collected incertain provinces. Therefore none of them can claim to represent the situation of the entire country. The quantitative studies, especially that of De Brauw et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211424253">2008</xref>: 329) correctly point out that a weakness of most descriptive studies is that they tend to treat rural Chinese women as if they all belong to a homogenous group. Their own empirical study, on the contrary, finds different involvement in farming by different cohorts of women. They conclude that the feminization of agriculture is occurring among middle-aged women (those born between 1955 and 1974), but not among either the younger cohort (those born between 1975 and 1984) or the older cohort (those born in and before 1954). Unfortunately they do not offer reasons for the differences in farming participation.</p>
<p>By contrast, statistical studies based on large datasets can overlook informative details. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424253">Ren and Dong (1997)</xref> find that in two Henan villages which have different distances to county towns or cities where the villagers could find non-farming jobs, rural women have different degrees of involvement in farming. In Zhangjiagou village, which is close to a large county town, most male villagers commute to the town to work and help their wives in farming during the busy seasons. In Tuyu village, male villagers migrate to faraway cities to work, only returning during the Chinese New Year and staying for less than a month. Women there take sole responsibility for minding the farms and tending to the family. This demonstrates that even within a province, the locations of the households and villages studied are important. Other factors, such as the immediate social context of the researched cohorts, including their education levels and family structures, are also not considered in the quantitative studies. As a result, the real picture of farming arrangements might be more complicated than what is revealed by these datasets.</p>
<p>And finally, both sides have given little attention to the immediate social contexts and demographic features of different generations and cohorts of rural populations. This has resulted in the neglect of the phenomenon of the aging of the farming population, which has been under way since the late 1990s. The descriptive studies were often based on data collected around or before the late 1990s, while the quantitative research was carried out in the late 1990s or during the 2000s. Farming arrangements during these two periods shifted from the ‘feminization of farming’ to the ‘ageing of the agricultural population’, and this can explain differences in the conclusions drawn. The current research tries to adopt the strengths of both viewpoints.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0269094211424253"><title>The setting and methods</title>
<p>This article mainly draws upon quantitative data and ethnographic information which the author collected in a central Chinese village, Lianhe, from September 2005 to May 2006. A later series of interviews via telephone and a short visit in 2008 also provided useful information. Situated in Sha County, central Hubei Province, Lianhe had approximately 450 households and 1600 residents in 2005 and, being a farming village, consisted of about 2200 <italic>mu</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094211424253">2</xref></sup>of farmland. Villagers there mainly rely on farming or jobs in faraway cities, or a mixture of farming and skilled manual or seasonal casual jobs in the county.</p>
<p>Within the local economy, agriculture is a large source of income, rice being the main agricultural product, followed by cotton, rape, and wheat. Since the early 1980s, factories such as those making wine, canned fruit, garments, and fertilizer, have been the main source of non-farming work. In recent years, the establishment of two textile factories has supplied more jobs for villagers especially women. But industrialization is still at a low level, which makes Sha County mainly an exporter in terms of rural-to-urban labour migration. According to the local government’s statistics, in 2005 about 54 percent of those aged between 18 and 35 left Sha to work in big cities.</p>
<p>The method used in this study is a combination of participant observation, qualitative interviews, and some quantitative data concerning demography and the household division of labour collected from the villagers. The author had lived in Lianhe until the age of 18, and had connections in the village. During the ethnography she lived with a rural family for eight months, and they acted as intermediaries to introduce her to more interviewees. As a result, a snowball sampling method was adopted. Participant observation and informal chats in the village provided another source of qualitative information. The quantitative data was mainly from the village council and the county government. Two sets of data on labour migration collected by the village council in 1995 and 2005 are central to the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211424253"><title>Demographic transition and farming in Lianhe: Findings</title>
<p>This section focuses on farming arrangements and the mechanism behind them in Lianhe since the late 1970s, and tries to answer the questions raised earlier.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211424253"><title>Who has been farming in Lianhe since the economic reform?</title>
<p>The village council was asked by the county government to collect data on migrants and labour migration through household surveys in the village in both 1995 and 2005. The figures they collected help reveal the farming organization in the village.</p>
<p>According to their statistics, in 1995 there were 430 households with 1521 villagers (739 men and 782 women; among whom 287 were male labourers and 309 were female labourers), and 2293 <italic>mu</italic> of farmland in Lianhe.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211424253">Table 1</xref>, ‘skilled manual labour’ means jobs such as masonry, carpentry, indoor decoration, hairdressing, tailoring, auto mechanics, etc. ‘Unskilled seasonal casual jobs’ include work on construction sites or in the abovementioned factories in Sha. In Lianhe in 1995, while 69.3 percent of male villagers in the 16–35 age group did skilled manual labour in Sha, only 7.3 percent of those in the 36–55 age group engaged in this. Of the latter group 83.2 percent were doing unskilled casual jobs. Similar differences also exist among female villagers from these age groups. Much higher percentages of the women aged 16–35 were doing non-farming occupations than those aged 36–55. My interviews reveal that women from the younger group either migrated to faraway cities to work, or worked in Sha as skilled hairdressers, tailors, or full-time in the canned fruit processing factory or garment factory. Very few women from the middle-aged group and none from the over 55 group worked in these capacities. A great majority of them were left on the farms, doing farming, housework, and care.

<p>Gendered disparity within each age group is far more noticeable. For example, only 5.1 percent of women, compared to 15.0 percent of men, from the 16–35 age group worked in faraway cities; and 8.3 percent of women from the same group did skilled manual labour in Sha, a figure strikingly less than that of the men: 69.3 percent. A similar gendered contrast can also be seen between menand women in the 36–55 age group. Men were generally involved in more diverse labour activities than women.</p>
<p>By inference, we can conclude that the percentages of women labourers who were left completely on the farms are 85.6 percent (age group 16–35), 99.2 percent (36–55) and 100 percent (over 55); compared to those of the male labourers: 7.3 percent (16–35), 7.4 percent (36–55) and 52.8 percent (over 55). Those men who migrated and worked outside of Sha had almost no part in farming; those who did skilled manual jobs or unskilled seasonal casual jobs in Sha were involved partly in farming since their non-farming occupations allowed them to commute between home and work sites. Unfortunately, the time spent farming by each group is not clear. Despite this, we can still observe the trend towards the feminization of farming in Lianhe in 1995. This supports the conclusions of the descriptive studies which were mainly carried out before or around the late 1990s.</p>
<p>The quantitative information was updated in 2005. In 2005 the village had 450 households with 1600 residents (including 626 labourers, 297 men, 329 women) and 2200 <italic>mu</italic> of farmland. Some changes had taken place in the local economy in the 2000s. First, the abovementioned factories had declined and some had closed. Some new factories, especially two large textile factories, have become the main revenue source of the local county government. Second, service industry has developed, and accommodates a greater labour force. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094211424253">Table 2</xref> shows the villagers’ involvement in non-farming occupations in 2005.

<p>An obvious change since the late 1990s is that dramatically increasing proportions of villagers, especially those aged 16–35, moved to faraway cities to work. In 2005 in Lianhe, 24.9 percent of labourers (among them 61.3% of men and 69.5% of women from the age group 16–35) were migrants working outside Sha County, compared to 3.8 percent in 1995. Within the age group 16–35, both men and women decreased their involvement in farming, the latter dramatically so. Only 0.8 percent of men aged 16–35 were completely left behind to farm in 2005, compared to 7.3 percent in 1995, while 0.7 percent of women from this age group worked only on the farms in 2005, whereas 85.6 percent had in 1995. The decline of young women’s roles in farming is especially striking.</p>
<p>In 2005, more men aged over 55 were left behind to farm (81.7% compared to 52.8% in 1995), but in both 1995 and 2005, all women over 55 were left on the farms. Within the 36–55 age group, a slightly smaller proportion of women were left completely on the farms in 2005 (95.2%) than in 1995 (99.2%), while the percentage of men in this group did not change significantly.</p>
<p>Based on these comparisons, a noticeable change in farming arrangements from 1995 to 2005 is the ageing of the farming population. More and more aged people, both men and women, are left on the farms and are engaging only in farming. Meanwhile a growing number of young villagers, including both men and women, leave farms and engage in non-farming jobs. The conclusion about the ageing of the farming population since the late 1990s can be reconciled withthe one drawn by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211424253">De Brauw (2003)</xref>, that the proportion of farm-work done by women declined over the late 1990s, and that the future feminization of agriculture in China is unlikely. How has this change taken place? In order to answer this question, it is important to examine the immediate demographic features of each age group, and then explore the demographic transition of the farming population in the village.</p>

<p>In 1995, the 16–35 age group consisted of those who were born between 1960 and 1979, while in 2005, the same age group were born between 1970 and 1989. The 10-year gap results in disparate demographic features which have different impacts on thefarming arrangements. The medical improvements after the 1949 revolution and the lack of a family planning policy before the 1970s created a ‘post-revolutionary baby boomer’ generation of children who were born between the 1940s and early 1970s and had a larger number of siblings. The strict enforcement of the family planning policy since the late 1970s has resulted in a ‘family planning’ generation, members of which had a very limited number of siblings. The two generations also differed in other ways: the age at which they began working, their training/schooling, family structure, and the household division of labour after marriage. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094211424253">Table 3</xref> lists the differences between them. These differences caused their disparate involvement in farming in the pre- and post-late-1990s eras, which have further resulted in the different configurations of farming arrangements.

<sec id="sec7-0269094211424253"><title>The ‘post-revolutionary baby boomer’ generation and the ‘feminization of agriculture’</title>
<p>The ‘post-revolutionary baby boomer’ generation have a large number of siblings, with significant age gaps between the oldest and the youngest. Within this generation, the economic reform starting in the late 1970s caused different opportunities for education, labour, leisure, and marriage between an old cohort who were born before the early 1960s and a young cohort who were born during the 1960s or the early 1970s. The latter were exposed to longer school education and better training in skilled manual labour due to the coming of the reform era which opened up China; while the older cohort only had limited school education and were trained for farming. Therefore, during the economic reform era, many more from theyounger cohort are able to engage in skilled manual labour while those from the older cohort can often only do unskilled seasonal casual jobs. This is reflected in the figures for 1995 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211424253">Table 1</xref>): 69.3 percent of men aged 16–35, most of whom were from the young cohort of the post-revolutionary baby boomer generation, were doing skilled manual labour. On the other hand, only 7.3 percent of those aged 36–55, most of whom were from the older cohort, were engaging primarily in skilled manual jobs. A comparable difference also exists between age groups for women, but the gendered disparities are far more obvious: many more women were left on the farms while more men were involved in non-farming occupations. By considering all groups’ education/training, the family structure and the household division of labour after marriage, the following tries to explain the gendered differences and reveal the mechanism behind the feminization of farming.</p>
<p>Limited schooling or occupational training has confined the older cohort to farming. Although husbands may have received more education or training than wives, this does not always guarantee them enough skills. The author’s interviews reveal that in the 1990s among this cohort, the mostcommon model of the gendered division of labour between husband and wife was that they both participated in farming, and the husband did some unskilled odd jobs such as that of a casual worker on construction sites, or in some factories in Sha during the slow seasons.</p>
<p>The stories of the younger cohort are different. Women from this cohort could often receive better school education and occupational training compared to their counterparts from the older cohort, but they were often held back from engaging in non-farming jobs while their husbands were mainly working off the farm. During her stay in Lianhe, the author found that many women from this cohort attempted to work in nearby factories in Sha or even in faraway cities in the south, such as Shenzhen or Guangzhou, but ended up coming back home after a short period. Family structure and the division of labour between husbands and wives are major factors that could hinder their success.</p>
<p>For this post-revolutionary baby boomer generation, the nuclear family has become the dominant family form since the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094211424253">Wang, 2006</xref>). The women constituteahousehold with only their husband and children. They do not get much help from their mother-in-law with housework or childcare, as her assistance is to be distributed among other children also. Under these circumstances, the women from this generation are often left behind on the farm doing farming, housework, and child-rearing by their husbands who concentrate on non-farming occupations which are often more profitable than farming. This is the most common pattern of the household division of labour for this cohort. In other words, in Lianhe, there was a trend towards the feminization of farming among the post-revolutionary baby boomer generation in the 1990s, especially among the younger cohort who were born in the 1960s or the early 1970s.</p>
<p>This pattern of household labour division helps to increase the family income and further improve the well-being of the whole family, as the husbands can earn more money by engaging in non-farming jobs. But it causes a cash income disparitybetween husband and wife, which will affect the power dynamics between them. The husbands might feel that they deserve more time and money for their own use and for leisure activities. But since wives also work hard for their families (especially through farming and unpaid domestic work which is often not appreciated), they are reluctant to let their husbands have what they consider to be a disproportionately larger share of resources for leisure. When they attempt to limit their husbands’ expenses or compete for a ‘fair’ share in household resources, disputes arise. In Lianhe, the great majority of the disputes between husband and wife are related to arguments over who is entitled to household resources, which is often defined by one’s cash income contribution to the family. This ultimately harms women’s well-being.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0269094211424253"><title>The ‘family planning generation’ and the ‘ageing of the farming population’</title>
<p>The ‘family planning generation’ have a very limited number of siblings and grew up to be mature labourers during or after the late 1990s. A smaller number of siblings and the improved economic situation have provided them with prolonged school education and better occupational training, which rural women have also benefited from, although possibly less than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094211424253">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). This has created what the market economy needed: young, educated people, with nimble fingers. The stories told by young women from the family planning generation reveal that not only their husbands, but they themselves have been freed from housework, care work, and farming by the older generation, that is, their parents/parents-in-law, and can thus focus on non-agricultural occupations. A new family structure, namely the ‘cooperative family’, makes this possible.</p>
<p>The formation of the cooperative family is a response to demographic changes such as small numbers of siblings and the impact of labour migration. Being a form between the stem family and nuclear family, it often consists of three generations, that is, a nuclear family and the parents of the husband or the wife in the case of uxorilocal marriage. Nevertheless, it is different from the traditional stem family as not all family members cook and eat together, due to labour migration. Also, they do not share a common budget whereas this is typical practice in stem families. In terms of budget arrangements, a cooperative family is more like the combination of two nuclear families where the younger generation keeps what they haveearned and the older also has their own account. The budget arrangement, however, varies according to different types of labour division and the respective levels of income between the two generations.</p>
<p>The normal pattern of household labour division is that the older generation stays at home, taking on all tasks of farming, housework, and care of grandchildren, while the younger generation focuses on non-agricultural income-generating work in or near the home town. Where the young generation work and how much the two generations can earn respectively are the determinants for the budget arrangement. Often the whole family will keep at least one main budget to which all cash income from both farming by the old generation and non-farming work by the young generation goes. This is the source for family expenses and is often under the control of the young generation,while the old generation keep a certain amount of money for their own use. But ifthe older generation can earn a considerable amount of cash from sources other than farming, both generations often have their own budgets, and both try to keep abalanced contribution to the family expenses.</p>
<p>A cooperative family normally exists when both members of the older couple are healthy enough to do farming and care work and transforms to a stem family when the older couple is too old to take on too much labour, or one of them passes away. The household arrangement of the cooperative family is actually a strategy to maximize villagers’ ability to earn money, while minimizing possible intergenerational conflicts.</p>
<p>The labour migration of younger villagers to big cities was due to economic incentives, as the average wage of rural-urban migrants is more than three times that of an average farmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211424253">Ha et al., 2009</xref>: 9). At the same time,they also migrate to escape boredom in the country. These young migrants have done little or no farming and they are not willing to do it in the future either. Their dream is to settle down where they have a non-farming job; and even though they may have to go back to their home town due to present legal restrictions and other structural obstacles that prevent them from permanently settling in a city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211424253">Connelly et al., 2010</xref>), they prefer to buy a house in a nearby town, county or prefecture and do business or other non-farming jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424253">Chang, 2009</xref>). Indeed, in Lianhe, several young couples have bought houses in Sha County or the Prefecture where they will live after they return to their home town, although they are currently working in faraway cities, leaving the farm and their children to their ageing parents. For the parents’ part, none of those interviewed wanted their children to stay in the countryside. Farming is absolutely at the bottom of their aspiration list for their children, as it is perceived as anunprofitable and menial occupation. All rural parents interviewed agreed that for their children, leaving the countryside through higher education and then obtaining a formal job in the city is their top priority. If their children do not have the potential or luck to achieve anything academically, to be a rural-to-urban migrant worker is the second option. To the younger generation, only ‘losers’ will stay in the countryside and work on the farm. This even affects their marriage prospects, as very few migrants, especially girls, want to marry those without migration experience, who are often thought of as having narrow horizons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424253">Chang, 2009</xref>). All of these factors contribute to the alarming situation facing rural China, that is, the retreat of a young labour force from farming and the ageing of the farming population.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094211424253">Table 2</xref>, we can see that in 2005, only very few young villagers aged 16–35 were left behind to farm (0.8% of men and 0.7% of women); while farming is mainly taken on by women aged 36–55, and both men and women aged over 55. According to the county government, excluding children under 16, the average age of the rural population currently residing in Sha is 46.1. Sha is not alone in this situation. Research shows the ageing of the farming population is also happening in Liaoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211424253">Li and Zhao, 2009</xref>), Jiangsu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094211424253">Liu and Zhou, 2008</xref>) and in inland western and south-western areas. Many old peasants from Sichuan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces are concerned about this and they bemoan the fact that ‘none of the young folks wants to do farming. Ten years later, we old folks will be too old to do it, then no one will be able to grow crops!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094211424253">Yang et al., 2006</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Many migrants’ aged parents, however, are not suited to farming. In this situation, they often find someone from the village to whom they sublet their farmland, and get some grain in return. Then again, farming in China is not only low profit, but also costly due to high prices of necessary industrial products like seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides. This makes few people want to subcontract farm land, unless their own land cannot produce enough grain provisions. In Lianhe, about two years ago, a couple who were in their mid-forties subcontracted approximately 30 <italic>mu</italic> of farmland from fellow villagers who were migrants. They hired middle-aged women from the village to work for them during the busy seasons. They worked very hard, but in the end what they earned was barely enough to pay the workers and cover the costs. The husband was so desperate that he moved the whole family to the county town of Sha, doing some unskilled casual jobs there with his wife, and swore that he ‘won’t even pee in the direction of that village’. The farmlands were given back to the migrant villagers from whom this couple subcontracted, and a large proportion of them were not put to use as a result. The phenomenon of abandoned farmland has drawn some attention in recent years, and it can often be observed in poor areas where a large proportion of young labourers migrate to faraway cities to work.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0269094211424253" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How have demographic transitions in relation to the family planning policy and rural-to-urban labour migration since the economic reform been affecting farming arrangements in rural China? While some scholars suggest women as a prominent group left on Chinese farms, others insist that the feminization of agriculture is not occurring. Based on quantitative information and ethnographic research in Lianhe village, this article reconciles the discrepancies between different discussions. After considering the demographic transition among different generations and cohorts of the farming population, regional differences in industrialization, and the extent of rural-to-urban labour migration, it suggests that since the late 1970s the configuration of farming in the village has experienced a transition from the ‘feminization of agriculture’ (from the late 1970s to the late 1990s) to the ‘ageing of the farming population’ (since thelate 1990s). This is largely due to the changing characteristics of two generations of the farming population: the ‘post-revolutionary baby boomer’ generation, and the ‘family planning’ generation. These include their school or occupational training, training for farming, household structure, and the gendered household division of labour after marriage. The effects of the feminization of agriculture are not as positive as proposed by some agricultural economists, as they might be detrimental to some rural women, who might lose bargaining power to their husbands due to their bringing in less cash income as a result of being left behind to farm. This demographic transition also implies a danger to farming in rural China because it is not clear who will be available to farm in the future. This danger is reinforced by the peasants’ general perception that farming is an unprofitable and menial occupation.</p>
<p>To some extent, the farming arrangement of a certain rural area depends on its level of industrialization and labour migration rate. The distance to where the villagers can find non-farming occupations is important. If a local area is moderately industrialized and its villagers, who are suitable for non-farming occupations, can commute between the work sites and their home, their involvement in farming would be greater. Before the late 1990s, this mainly affected the participation in farming of middle-aged men from the post-revolutionary baby boomer generation, and resulted in different degrees of feminization of farming in different rural areas. After the late 1990s, and with the growing up of the family planning generation, this distance mainly impacted young people’s decisions on where to find a non-farming occupation, and further caused disparate effects on the ageing of the farming population. In this sense, conclusions based on data collected in Lianhe, which holds a moderate position in terms of industrialization and labour migration, possibly do not represent the overall situation in rural China. The most disturbing conditions are in the least industrialized western and south-western rural areas of China that were subject to the worst effects of the feminization of farming in the 1990s and the ageing of the farming population after the late 1990s. The question of who will be doing the farming in the future is a more severe problem they will be facing.</p>
