<abstract>
<p>The current study examines the role of ethical cognition as a psychological mechanism linking ethical leadership to employee engagement in specific discretionary workplace behaviors. Hypotheses are developed proposing that ethical leadership is associated with employees’ negative moral equity judgments of workplace deviance (a discretionary antisocial behavior) and positive moral equity judgments of organizational citizenship (a discretionary prosocial behavior). In addition, hypotheses propose that moral equity judgments are a key type of ethical cognition linking ethical leadership with employee behaviors. Hypotheses are tested in a cross-organizational sample of 190 supervisor–employee dyads. Results indicate that employees who work for ethical leaders tended to judge acts of workplace deviance as morally inequitable and acts of organizational citizenship as morally equitable. In turn, these judgments guided employee regulation of behavior, and mediated the relationships between ethical leadership and employee avoidance of antisocial conduct and engagement in prosocial behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethical transgressions in business, sports, academic, and even religious organizations have been well documented over the past decade. While some transgressions are the result of intentional unethical behavior, many others occur because people fail to consider the ethical consequences of their actions and decisions. For example, the financial crisis of 2008 resulted from a complex combination of factors including high risk lending, passing on the risk in secondary markets, and corporate leaders failing to consider the potential consequences to borrowers, institutions, or markets. In contrast, ethical misconduct is less likely to occur when people recognize the ethical consequences of their actions. Organizational leadership plays a prominent role in managing ethical accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713481633">Barnard, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726713481633">Dickson et al., 2001</xref>); to so do effectively, leaders must help employees to understand ethically charged issues, and make appropriate judgments.</p>
<p>To better understand the linkages between leadership and organizational ethics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al. (2005)</xref> put forth a social learning-based theory that defined ethical leadership as ‘the demonstration of normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision making’ (p. 120). An emerging body of research provides support for a connection between ethical leadership and employees’ work-related attitudes and behaviors, such as commitment, psychological safety, voice, citizenship behaviors, and task performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713481633">Kalshoven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726713481633">Piccolo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713481633">Walumbwa and Schaubroeck, 2009</xref>). To date, however, surprisingly little research has examined the linkages between ethical leadership and employee ethical cognitions, particularly specific ethical judgments. This is an important omission as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño (2006)</xref> proposed that employees of ethical leaders should have a heightened awareness of the ethical implications of their actions and decisions, along with a tendency to make ethically appropriate decisions. In turn, ethical cognitions, such as ethical judgments, are thought to guide ethical intentions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726713481633">Hannah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726713481633">Rest, 1986</xref>). That is, ethical cognition provides a basis for behavior regulation; people are likely to engage in behaviors they deem as ethically appropriate and refrain from actions they deem as ethically inappropriate. As such, we expect that ethical judgments are a psychological mechanism that sheds new light on the relationships between ethical leadership and employee discretionary behavior. Research is now needed to examine these relationships empirically.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study is two-fold. First, we propose that employees who work for ethical leaders form moral equity judgments of discretionary prosocial (organizational citizenship; OCB) and antisocial (workplace deviance; WPD) behaviors. Second, we propose that these moral equity judgments are a cognitive psychological mechanism that links, or mediates, the relationships between ethical leadership and employee engagement in discretionary behaviors (both OCB and WPD). In doing so, we seek to contribute to the ethical leadership literature in two important ways. First, we demonstrate empirically that employees who work for ethical leaders form a salient understanding of the ethical implications of both prosocial and antisocial workplace behaviors in the form of moral equity judgments. Second, we demonstrate that a specific form of ethical cognition, moral equity judgments, is a psychological mechanism through which employees regulate their behavior, which in turn links ethical leadership to employee discretionary acts. As such, we provide evidence supporting the importance of ethical leadership for employee ethics-related judgments and behavior. In addition, we seek to contribute to the behavioral ethics literature by providing empirical evidence that people tend to engage in behaviors they deem as morally equitable and avoid behaviors they deem as morally inequitable. That is, moral equity judgments of specific behaviors provide a basis for understanding the linkages between moral cognition and moral conation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726713481633">Hannah et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Ethical leadership and discretionary behavior</title>
<p>Ethical leaders are moral people and moral managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713481633">Treviño et al., 2003</xref>) who use their social power to represent the best interests of their organization and employees, set a personal and professional example of ethically appropriate conduct, and actively manage ethical accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726713481633">De Hoogh and Den Hartog, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726713481633">Gini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726713481633">Resick et al., 2006</xref>). As moral people, ethical leaders demonstrate honesty, integrity, fairness, a broad ethical awareness, and are considerate and respectful of others; as moral managers, ethical leaders comply with laws and regulations, establish ethical expectations and hold employees accountable, and make decisions reflecting the best interests of employees and the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713481633">Kalshoven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726713481633">Resick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713481633">Treviño et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown and colleagues (2005)</xref> proposed that ethical leaders are ethical role models who provide ethical guidance to employees via social learning processes. According to social learning theory, individuals learn by observing role models’ actions, decisions, and subsequent consequences, and then emulating what they observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726713481633">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713481633">1986</xref>). To serve as an ethical role model and an ethical leader, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al. (2005)</xref> noted that a leader first needs to be perceived as attractive, legitimate, and credible. This perception is developed by demonstrating normatively appropriate behaviors, and explicitly discussing ethical expectations to draw employees’ attention to ethical issues. Leaders further become attractive and credible by modeling honest and fair behavior, treating others with consideration, and making decisions aimed at employees’ best interests. Leaders also become legitimate sources of ethical authority by using rewards and punishment to manage ethical accountability. All of these behaviors increase the effectiveness of social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Through these processes, ethical leaders are expected to influence employee ethical decision making, promote ethical and prosocial conduct, and inhibit deviant and unethical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have linked ethical leadership with employee prosocial OCBs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713481633">Kalshoven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2009</xref>). Citizenship behaviors are important for both individual and organizational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726713481633">Podsakoff et al., 2009</xref>), and include actions that are ‘discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate, promotes the efficient and effective functioning of the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713481633">Organ, 1988</xref>: 4). There are generally considered to be two broad dimensions underlying OCBs. One dimension is targeted at co-workers and includes passing along helpful information and going out of one’s way to help other employees. The second dimension is targeted at the organization itself and includes adhering to informal rules and promoting the organization’s products or services to others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713481633">Dalal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726713481633">Williams and Anderson, 1991</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713481633">Mayer et al.’s (2009)</xref> work, we specifically focus on interpersonal-focused OCBs. This set of OCBs are most relevant to our model because they are a reflection of a broad concern for others, they signal the importance of the work environment to the employee, and they are the most frequently studied OCBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726713481633">Podsakoff et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Workplace deviance is a contrasting set of discretionary behaviors that nearly all organizations must confront, and involves ‘voluntary behavior that violates significant organizational norms and in so doing threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726713481633">Robinson and Bennett, 1995</xref>: 556). WPD includes overt actions such as damaging property and instigating a confrontation, along with covert actions such as withholding effort or sabotaging a project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726713481633">Bennett and Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726713481633">Robinson and Bennett, 1995</xref>). There are two underlying dimensions of WPD behaviors, with one dimension targeted at harming co-workers through actions such as behaving rudely or publically embarrassing someone, and one dimension targeted at harming the organization by engaging in acts such as taking supplies, damaging property, or discussing confidential information with unauthorized personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726713481633">Bennett and Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726713481633">Robinson and Bennett, 1995</xref>). Both dimensions have been found to be highly intercorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713481633">Dalal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726713481633">Dunlop and Lee, 2004</xref>). In prior studies, Mayer and colleagues have found ethical leadership to be directly and negatively related to organization-focused WPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2009</xref>) and unethical behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713481633">Detert et al. (2007)</xref> found that ethical leadership was unrelated to objective indicators of counterproductive behaviors. In the current study, we focus on the full set of WPD behaviors to understand the implications of ethical leadership for inhibiting antisocial behaviors directed at both co-workers and the organization in general.</p>
<p>Ethical leaders are thought to influence the employee’s ethical understanding and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño, 2006</xref>); in turn, these ethical cognition provide a basis for behavior regulation (Hannah et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726713481633">Rest, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726713481633">Rottig et al., 2011</xref>). As such, we expect that ethical judgments are a psychological mechanism that sheds new light on the relationship between ethical leadership and both OCB and WPD discretionary workplace behaviors.</p>
<p>Several studies have provided insights into the psychological mechanisms linking ethical leadership and employee behavior (both prosocial and antisocial). Focusing on prosocial and general work-related behaviors, studies have found that motivation-related mechanisms such as effort, task significance, self-efficacy, and organizational identification mediate relationships between ethical leadership and both task and citizenship forms of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726713481633">Piccolo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726713481633">Walumbwa et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713481633">Walumbwa and Schaubroeck (2009)</xref> found that employees’ psychological safety partially mediates the relationship between ethical leadership and constructive voice behavior. In contrast, the psychological mechanisms linking ethical leadership with employee avoidance of deviance or ethical transgressions is somewhat less clear. Several studies provide some indication that ethical leadership inhibits antisocial behavior through its impact on the unit’s psychosocial environment, including ethical climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>) and ethical culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726713481633">Schaubroeck et al., 2012</xref>). Given the social learning basis of ethical leadership, surprisingly little research has examined the relationships between ethical leadership and the extent to which employees form judgments about the types of behaviors that are fair, just, and morally appropriate or inappropriate, and use these judgments to regulate behavior. We examine the intervening role of moral equity judgment in the next section.</p>

<title>Ethical judgments</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin (1990)</xref> posited that individuals use multiple philosophical perspectives of ethics and morals (e.g. justice, relativism, egoism, utilitarianism, and deontology) when making ethical judgments, and developed a scale to assess ethical judgments from three perspectives, including moral equity, contractualism, and relativistic judgments. The moral equity perspective focuses on evaluations of decisions or actions in terms of their moral rightness, justice, and fairness. Contractualism focuses on unspoken duties or obligations. The relativistic perspective focuses on the acceptability of an action or decision based on the contextual norms of the larger society.</p>
<p>In the current study, we focus specifically on the moral equity dimension and exclude contractualism and relativistic dimensions for several reasons. For one, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin (1990)</xref>, moral equity judgments reflect a broad-based ethical evaluation that is rooted in theories of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726713481633">Kristol, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726713481633">Nozick, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726713481633">Rawls, 1971</xref>) and deontological ethical philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726713481633">Kant, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726713481633">Ross, 1930</xref>). As such, moral equity judgments are a form of ethical evaluation that integrates both justice and behavioral ethics theories. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin (1990)</xref> argued that moral equity judgments have ‘the greatest relative impact in the evaluation process’ (p. 648), as the focus on fairness and morality allows for ‘a basic, [and] almost fundamental decision rule for evaluating the moral context of business decisions’ (p. 695). Third, contractualism and relativistic perspectives may be less appropriate for understanding the relationship between ethical leadership and employee ethical judgments. Contractualism judgments are ethical evaluations related to unspoken contracts or promises. These judgments are most likely to be influenced by organizational elements such as structure or culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726713481633">Schminke et al., 2000</xref>), given that these elements are unspoken or assumed, as opposed to the direct behaviors or narratives offered by ethical leaders. Similarly, relativistic judgments are ethical evaluations related to tradition or culture. These judgments are also most likely to be influenced by observed norms of the societal culture in which the person and organization are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726713481633">Douglas et al., 2001</xref>), as opposed to the role modeling or sensemaking behaviors of ethical leaders. Fourth, several recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713481633">Bailey and Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726713481633">Rottig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726713481633">Spicer et al., 2004</xref>) have argued that moral equity judgments are useful for evaluating a wide-range of work-related behaviors and focused exclusively on the moral equity dimension, and even more specifically on the fair, just, and morally right items from this dimension, to gauge ethical judgments. Therefore, in the current study, we assessed employees’ ethical judgments exclusively from a moral equity perspective using the fair, just, and morally right items.</p>
<p>Moral equity judgments are distinct from similar ethical cognitions, such as moral awareness, moral attentiveness, and justice perceptions. Moral awareness, which is widely viewed as the first step toward engaging in ethical conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726713481633">Rest, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726713481633">Treviño et al., 2006</xref>), represents the determination that a situation has a moral component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726713481633">Reynolds, 2006</xref>). Moral attentiveness reflects the extent to which a person ‘chronically perceives and considers morality and moral elements’ in their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726713481633">Reynolds, 2008</xref>). In contrast, moral equity judgments are evaluations of specific actions or events, and are not chronic approaches to decision-making. In terms of organizational justice, which examines how people perceive and react to distributive, procedural, and interactional forms of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713481633">Greenberg and Colquitt, 2005</xref>), moral equity judgments are broader evaluations that address fairness, justice, and morality.</p>
<p>In the workplace, supervisors are a critical source of proximal information about normatively appropriate conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726713481633">Grojean et al., 2004</xref>). Social cognition examines how people interpret social information to make sense of themselves and others, and use this information to make decisions and take action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726713481633">Fiske and Taylor, 1991</xref>). When employees view their supervisors acting in an ethical manner, treating others fairly and respectfully, making ethics-based decisions, and setting ethical standards, they should form a clear understanding of what constitutes fair, just, and morally appropriate behavior, and the need to consider the ethical appropriateness of their actions. Drawing on two social cognition processes, social learning and sensemaking, we examine the relationships between ethical leadership and employee moral equity judgments.</p>

<title>Social learning processes</title>
<p>Social learning theory indicates that individuals are more likely to pay attention to the behavior of attractive, credible, and high status models that have control over valued rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726713481633">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713481633">1986</xref>). In organizations, leaders are role models due to their status within the organizational hierarchy and their power to control resources. Employees come to learn what behaviors are ethically appropriate and rewarded, and what actions are unacceptable and punished by observing leader role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We point to three aspects of social learning theory that help to explain how ethical leaders influence employees’ ethical judgments. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al. (2005</xref>: 120) argued that leaders ‘become attractive, credible, and legitimate as ethical role models’ by consistently demonstrating behaviors that are normatively appropriate, such as being trustworthy, making fair decisions, and managing ethical accountability, as well as conveying prosocial motivation by being open to employee perspectives and treating others in a considerate and respectful manner. Second, for social learning to occur, individuals need to pay attention to both the model and behaviors being modeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726713481633">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713481633">1986</xref>). The actions and decisions of immediate supervisors are generally readily observable, and those behaviors that are rewarded or punished tend to attract attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Third, social learning is facilitated when individuals understand consequences in the form of rewards and punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713481633">Bandura, 1986</xref>). Through these processes, ethical leaders set an example of right and wrong behavior and provide cues that help employees to determine which courses of action are ethically appropriate (or inappropriate).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018726713481633">
<title>Sensemaking processes</title>
<p>A second way that leaders shape ethical judgments is through sensemaking, which occurs when people confront novel events and engage in a process of constructing meaning for what has occurred and what people should do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726713481633">Weick, 1995</xref>). More specifically, sensemaking is a social construction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726713481633">Berger and Luckmann, 1966</xref>) in which individuals ‘interpret their environment in and through interactions with others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726713481633">Maitlis, 2005</xref>: 21) to address the question, ‘what does an event mean?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726713481633">Weick et al., 2005</xref>: 410). Narratives are a core mechanism through which sensemaking processes occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726713481633">Cunliffe and Coupland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726713481633">Weick, 2012</xref>). Information presented in a systematic and organized manner, and conveyed with a high degree of animation, helps people to form a rich understanding of events, and leads to consistency of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726713481633">Maitlis, 2005</xref>). Leaders engage in sensemaking by monitoring the environment, interpreting issues and events, and constructing meaning; leaders use sensegiving to convey information in a manner that captures members’ attention and helps them to understand events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713481633">Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726713481633">Zaccaro et al., 2001</xref>). As such, leaders build, establish legitimacy for, and sustain organizational practices and norms through sensemaking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713481633">Maclean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726713481633">Maitlis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726713481633">Gioia and Thomas, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethical leaders help employees make sense of ethical expectations through the manner in which they convey ethical expectations, implications, and consequences. As moral people, ethical leaders convey the importance of honesty, integrity and fairness, as well as being supportive and respectful towards others; as moral managers, ethical leaders also convey ethical expectations by providing ethical guidance, taking ethical accountability, and holding others ethically accountable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713481633">Kalshoven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726713481633">Resick et al., 2011</xref>). One way that ethical leaders engage in sensemaking is through their retrospective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726713481633">Weick et al., 2005</xref>) to ethical transgressions or other workplace incidents. By presenting their reaction through an organized narrative that first identifies the critical incidents and responses, and then examines the consequences and implications, ethical leaders help employees make sense of behaviors that are morally equitable and morally inequitable. Ethical leaders also engage in sensemaking processes through the narratives contained in spontaneous and on-going communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726713481633">Cunliffe and Coupland, 2012</xref>) regarding issues such as organizational values, ethics policies, and general ethical expectations. Through sensemaking processes, ethical leaders help employees to clearly differentiate between ethically appropriate and inappropriate conduct.</p>

<sec id="section7-0018726713481633">
<title>Leadership and ethical judgments</title>
<p>By making fair and objective decisions, being approachable and open to new ideas, and not being malicious or condescending to others, ethical leaders set an example of appropriate workplace relations. Ethical leaders also comply with laws and regulations, establish clear ethics-related guidelines, hold themselves and staff accountable, pay attention to both process and results, and generally look out for the best interest of employees and the organization. In summary, employees use these social norms to form their own ethical evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713481633">Bailey and Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin, 1990</xref>). Thus, through social learning processes, ethical leaders establish social norms and expectations that employees should treat each other and the organization respectfully, and that acts of deviance are neither acceptable nor tolerated.</p>
<p>When leaders offer employees retrospective evaluations of ethically-related situations, or proactive narratives for how to approach ethically-related situations, employees gain a cognitive anchor that guides future ethically-related judgments. Thus, through sensemaking processes, ethical leaders help employees to make sense of the expectations of appropriate and inappropriate conduct and treatment of others. Therefore, through social learning and sensemaking processes, we expect that employees who work for ethical leaders to form judgments about acts that are dishonest, reflect a misuse of company resources, and disrupt workplace relations as being unfair, unjust, and ethically inappropriate. In contrast, employees who work for supervisors who model fewer ethical leadership behaviors may form a less clear understanding of the importance of workplace relations or the negative effects of organization-focused deviance. As leaders have not conveyed enough information to help employees learn or make sense of social norms and expectations regarding deviant acts, employees may evaluate the ethicality of such behavior less harshly. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726713481633" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Ethical leadership is related to negative moral equity judgments of workplace deviance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Ethical leaders take personal responsibility for their actions, actively consider the ethical implications of their behavior, and strive to do the right thing for the collective good of the organization. By being trustworthy and helpful, treating others with respect, making fair decisions, openly discussing ethical issues, and holding people ethically accountable, ethical leaders are role modeling the importance of good citizenship. Thus, through social learning processes, ethical leaders establish social norms and expectations that people should help each other to succeed and treat each other respectfully, and these norms shape employees’ ethical judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713481633">Bailey and Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>As ethical leaders develop narratives conveying organizational expectations regarding how to interact with co-workers, employees garner a clear cognitive schema that informs their future evaluations of discretionary helping behavior. Through ethical leaders’ sensemaking, employees form an understanding of how people are expected to cooperate and help one another. In turn, through social learning and sensemaking processes, we expect that employees will evaluate discretionary acts that involve assisting colleagues or creating a generally positive work environment as fair, just, and ethically appropriate. In contrast, we expect that employees who work for supervisors that model fewer ethical leadership behaviors are less likely to see acts of citizenship in that context as morally equitable. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0018726713481633" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Ethical leadership is related to positive moral equity judgments of organizational citizenship behaviors.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section8-0018726713481633">
<title>The mediating role of ethical judgments</title>
<p>The actions and decision-making approaches modeled by direct supervisors, coupled with explicit discussions of ethical norms and values reinforced through reward and punishment allocations, provide salient cues clarifying ethical expectations. In turn, through social learning and sensemaking processes, employees form a clear understanding of work-related ethical expectations, and are well-equipped to judge the ethical appropriateness (or inappropriateness) of potential decisions and behaviors. When ethical judgments are top of the mind, they create a ‘capacity for action’ that impacts the types of behaviors that people choose to engage in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726713481633">Weick et al., 1999</xref>: 88).That is, the normative information conveyed by ethical leaders informs the behaviors <italic>and</italic> judgments that employees make, which provides a basis for behavior regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726713481633">Bandura, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713481633">Brown et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Both WPD and OCBs are discretionary behaviors that are under an individual’s control. Specific, as opposed to general, beliefs and intentions have been found to be most closely aligned with specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726713481633">Ajzen and Fishbein, 1977</xref>); therefore, we expect that ethical judgments of specific sets of discretionary behaviors are likely to be aligned with engagement in those behaviors. That is, individuals are more likely to avoid acts of deviance if they judge those acts as morally inequitable. Conversely, people who judge deviant behaviors less harshly should be more likely to engage in those acts. At the same time, we expect that employees are more likely to engage in acts of citizenship if they view those specific acts as morally equitable, and less likely to engage in those acts if they form less favorable ethical evaluations. We further expect that ethical judgments are a mediating mechanism linking ethical leadership and employee avoidance of WPD and engagement in OCBs, and present the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list3-0018726713481633" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Moral equity judgments of workplace deviance behaviors are positively related to the engagement in workplace deviance behaviors and mediate the relationship between ethical leadership and workplace deviance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Moral equity judgments of organizational citizenship behaviors are positively related to the engagement in organizational citizenship behaviors and mediate the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational citizenship.</p></list-item>

<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>We recruited participants through StudyResponse, a non-profit service that matches social science researchers with individuals willing to complete online surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726713481633">Stanton and Weiss, 2002</xref>). Numerous studies have obtained samples using the StudyResponse service (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713481633">Barnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726713481633">Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006</xref>). StudyResponse first contacted potential participants to ask if they would be willing to complete a survey, ask their immediate supervisor to complete a separate survey, and provide a contact email for their supervisor. StudyResponse then randomly selected a subset of individuals who indicated ‘yes’ to the first survey and sent them an email inviting them to participate in the study and provided a link to an online survey containing measures of ethical leadership, and ethical judgments of WPD and OCBs. StudyResponse also sent a separate email to the employee’s supervisor with a link to a separate online survey asking them to rate the employee’s WPD and OCB behaviors. Both employee and supervisor participants received a US$5.00 gift card to an online store.</p>
<p>Invitations were sent to 255 individuals and their immediate supervisors. We obtained a final sample of 190 matched pairs (74.5%) after removing cases with incomplete responses and where the employee and supervisor completed the surveys within 30 minutes of one another, which we used to identify and remove potential irregularities. Employees were predominately male (54%) with a mean age of 36.5, and had worked for their organization (<italic>M</italic> = 8.1 years) and supervisor (41% indicating five or more years) at least one year. Employees represented a variety of occupational types and ethnic backgrounds (75.3% White/Non-Hispanic; 11.1% Asian; 4.7% Black/African-American; 3.2% Hispanic/Latino; 2.1% Pacific Islander; and 2.1% Native American; 1.5% other/not identified). The majority of employees (61.4%) indicated their education was a four-year college degree and 70.7% indicated over five years of work experience. Supervisors were predominately male (67%) with a mean age of 40, and represented a variety of ethnic backgrounds (79.5% White/Non-Hispanic; 7.4% Asian; 3.7% Latino; 3.7% Black/ African-American; 3.2% Pacific Islander; and 1.6% Native American; 0.9% other/not identified).</p>
<p>We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726713481633">Podsakoff et al.’s (2003)</xref> recommendations for minimizing the potential for socially desirable responding in survey administration. First, the survey introduction indicated that all responses would be kept private and confidential. Second, the instructions to each scale indicated that responses would only be used for research purposes, and stressed the importance of responding honestly. Third, we created a sense of psychological separation between the leadership and judgment variables by repeating the survey instructions, and again stressing the importance of honest responding.</p>

<p>We assessed ethical judgments of WPD by applying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin’s (1990)</xref> scale to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726713481633">Bennett and Robinson’s (2000)</xref> measure of WPD, which contains seven items focusing on interpersonal behavior (sample item = <italic>I acted rudely toward someone at work)</italic>, and 12 items focusing on organization-targeted behavior (sample item = <italic>I neglected to follow my boss’s instructions</italic>). Employee participants were presented each item and asked to judge the behavior depicted as: (a) just, (b) fair, and (c) morally right on a 1 (e.g. unjust, unfair) to 7 (e.g. just, fair) point range. We excluded Reidenbach and Robin’s fourth moral equity judgment, ‘acceptable/unacceptable to my family’ for three reasons. First, this item provides an external referent, which is inconsistent with the other items. Second, there is a potential for differences to exist in the behaviors that are acceptable (or unacceptable) at work and to one’s family. Our goal was to assess employees’ moral equity judgments of work as opposed to non-work behaviors. Third, recent studies using the moral equity dimension to assess ethical judgments focus exclusively on these items (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713481633">Bailey and Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726713481633">Rottig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726713481633">Spicer et al., 2004</xref>). In total, each employee made 57 moral equity judgment ratings of WPD items; these ratings were aggregated to the behavior level and then combined across behaviors to create a WPD moral equity judgment rating. Higher scores indicated that the behaviors were judged as morally equitable and lower scores indicated the behaviors were judged as not morally equitable.

<title>Analytical approach</title>
<p>We tested the hypothesized relationships with structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.8. To improve the sample size to number of parameters ratio we created three item parcels for ethical leadership and two item parcels for the moral equity judgments of WPD and OCB, and two item parcels for WPD and OCB behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726713481633">Landis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726713481633">Little et al., 2002</xref>). Similar to previous research evaluating ethical leadership and discretionary behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726713481633">Piccolo et al., 2010</xref>), we followed procedures put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726713481633">Landis and colleagues (2000)</xref>. For ethical leadership and OCB, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis, specifying a one-factor solution. We assigned the item with the highest factor loading into the first parcel and the second-highest in the second parcel (and for one construct, the third-highest in the third parcel). We continued with this process, assigning the next highest factor loading item to subsequent parcels until all items were assigned. For WPD, we created two parcels, one reflecting interpersonal WPD and one reflecting organizational WPD. We assessed model fit using the chi-square goodness of fit statistic, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the comparative fit index (CFI). For RMSEA, values below .05 are considered excellent fit, values between .05 and .08 are considered good fit, and values between .08 and .10 are considered adequate fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713481633">MacCallum et al., 1996</xref>). For CFI, values above .95 are considered excellent fit and values between .90 and .95 considered good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726713481633">Hu and Bentler, 1999</xref>). Additionally, we tested the mediation hypotheses (H3 and H4) following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726713481633">James et al.’s (2006)</xref> procedures for testing full mediation models using SEM. They argued that mediation is found when: (a) the mediation model demonstrates acceptable fit, (b) path coefficients from predictor to the mediator are statistically significant, (c) path coefficients from mediator to the outcome variable are statistically significant, and (d) the indirect effect is statistically significant.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Turning to employee discretionary behavior, moral equity judgments of WPD were positively related to employee WPD behaviors (<italic>β</italic> = .59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, ethical leadership had a statistically significant indirect effect on WPD behaviors (<italic>β</italic> = -.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). A similar pattern of relationships was found with OCBs. Employees’ moral equity judgments of OCBs were positively related to their engagement in OCB behaviors (<italic>β</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and ethical leadership had a statistically significant indirect effects on OCB behaviors (<italic>β</italic> = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Next, we conducted a series of analyses to further examine the direct and indirect relationships. First, we compared the fit of the hypothesized model to two alternative models. Alternative model 1, adding a direct path from ethical leadership to WPD behavior, did not fit better than the hypothesized structural model (χ<sup>2</sup> [69] = 93.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, RMSEA = .04, CFI = .99, Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 1.16, ns) and the path coefficient was not statistically significant (<italic>β</italic> = .10, ns). However, alternative model 2, adding a direct path from ethical leadership to OCB behavior did fit better than the hypothesized model (χ<sup>2</sup> [69] = 90.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, RMSEA = .04, CFI = .99, Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 4.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and the path coefficient was statistically significant (<italic>β</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). At the same time, path coefficients for the direct relationships between ethical leadership and moral equity judgments of OCB (<italic>β</italic> = .36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and moral equity judgments of OCB and OCB behavior (<italic>β</italic> = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), as well as the indirect relationship between ethical leadership and OCB behavior (<italic>β</italic> = .09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) remained statistically significant. Together, results indicate that the relationship between ethical leadership and OCB behavior is partially mediated by moral equity judgments, while the relationships between ethical leadership and WPD behavior is fully mediated. The standardized path coefficients from the final, partial mediation model are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726713481633">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Finally, to check the robustness of the mediation effects, we used a bootstrapping procedure originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726713481633">Shrout and Bolger (2002)</xref> and later refined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713481633">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>. The bootstrapping procedure derives an empirical sampling distribution to compute confidence intervals (CIs) of indirect effects (x → m → y). We used macros created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713481633">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> and report bias-corrected 95 percent CIs computed from 5000 bootstrap re-samples. For WPD, the 95 percent CI did not include zero [-.56, -.19] further supporting the statistically significant indirect effect from the final structural model (<italic>β</italic> = -.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). For OCBs, the 95 percent CI also did not include zero [.05, .20], again supporting the statistically significant indirect effect from the final structural model (<italic>β</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Therefore, we concluded that Hypotheses 3 and 4 were supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section22-0018726713481633">
<title>Summary of findings</title>
<p>This study applied a social cognitive lens as a means for understanding the linkages between ethical leadership, ethical cognition, and discretionary behaviors. Employees who worked for leaders displaying high levels of ethical leadership tended to form harsh evaluations of WPD behaviors, judging them as unfair, unjust, and morally inappropriate (i.e. morally inequitable). These same employees also tended to judge OCBs as fair, just, and morally appropriate (i.e. morally equitable). In contrast, employees who worked for supervisors demonstrating lower levels of ethical leadership tended to judge WPD behaviors less harshly and OCBs less positively. In turn, employees tended to engage in those behaviors they judged as morally equitable and refrain from those behaviors they judged as morally inequitable, providing evidence that ethical judgments of specific sets of discretionary behaviors link ethical leadership with employee discretionary behavior. Interestingly, ethical leaders were found to influence citizenship both directly and indirectly. We now examine the theoretical and practical implications of this research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0018726713481633">
<title>Theoretical and practical implications</title>
<p>Several theoretical implications stem from the current study, and inform the ethical leadership and behavioral ethics literatures. First, the findings indicate that ethical leaders play an integral role in the beliefs that employees form about appropriate conduct in the workplace, which provides empirical evidence supporting propositions from prior research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713481633">Brown and Treviño, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726713481633">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>). Findings suggest that ethical judgments are a cognitive psychological mechanism linking ethical leadership with employee deviant and citizenship behaviors. Through social learning and sensemaking processes, ethical leaders appear to deter acts of deviance and increase acts of citizenship by helping employees to understand what types of behaviors are ethically appropriate and inappropriate in the organization. The relationship between ethical leadership and employee ethical judgments may be a reflection of a learning process in which employees form ethical beliefs and build a capacity to make ethical judgments.</p>
<p>Second, this study extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713481633">Reidenbach and Robin’s (1990)</xref> work on ethical judgments and contributes to the WPD and OCBs literatures by indicating that people form moral equity judgments about discretionary workplace behaviors. The current findings are in line with previous findings that people are apt to judge behaviors that lead to negative consequences (e.g. loss of property) or have an identifiable victim (e.g. a demoralized co-worker) as particularly unethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726713481633">Gino et al.’s (2010)</xref>. In turn, people tend to engage in discretionary behaviors they judge as morally equitable, while avoiding those acts they judge as morally inequitable. Perhaps one reason for the strong link between ethical judgments and behavior is that we focused on congruent levels of judgment and behavior specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726713481633">Ajzen and Fishbein, 1977</xref>). Therefore, <italic>specific</italic> ethical judgments may have greater utility for understanding <italic>specific</italic> discretionary behaviors. The overall pattern of findings indicates that ethical judgments are a cognitive mechanism through which people regulate their behavior toward prosocial acts and away from antisocial conduct.</p>
<p>Turning to the practical implications of this research, findings suggest that organizations may benefit from efforts aimed at selecting ethical leaders and developing ethical leadership capabilities. Organizations may want to consider integrating measures of ethical leadership into leader assessment practices. At the same time, leadership development initiatives that focus on training leaders to develop a broad ethical awareness, make fair decisions, demonstrate consideration and respect for staff, and hold staff accountable should equip managers to role model ethically appropriate behavior and decision making. These leadership behaviors should help employees to understand ethical expectations and make ethical evaluations.</p>
<p>The findings also indicate that organizations are likely to benefit from investing in formal training programs targeted at improving employees’ capacity to make moral equity judgments. Training content could be developed to provide participants with an understanding of the firm’s position on ethically appropriate conduct focusing on specific sets of behaviors (e.g. specific unethical or deviant behaviors). As a return on their training investment, organizations are likely to see greater consistency among members’ ethical judgments, a stronger climate for ethics, lower levels of deviance, and higher levels of citizenship.</p>

<sec id="section24-0018726713481633">
<title>Limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>The findings of the current study must be considered in light of its limitations. The first set of limitations pertains to the use of survey research methods. Cross-sectional surveys are not ideal for testing causality as some ambiguity may exist in the direction of the relationships. For example, employees who refrain from deviant behaviors may do so because they judge these behaviors as morally inequitable or come to judge deviant acts as morally inequitable because they refrain from acts of deviance. Similarly, employees may perceive their supervisor as an ethical leader due to the leader’s actions, or because they work in a department where people frequently engage in acts of citizenship while acts of deviance rarely occur. As such, caution should be used in drawing causal inferences from the study findings. Similarly, the sample of participants were obtained using the StudyResponse service and some ambiguity exists regarding the similarity of individuals who volunteer to be part of their subject pool and the population of workers in general. Individuals in the StudyResponse subject pool may be more willing to help others, and less prone to antisocial behavior than individuals who are not part of the sample pool. Therefore, the extent to which the findings are representative of the general population is unclear. In addition, the use of a third party to identify potential participants limited our quality control over the recruitment process. We took steps, such as removing cases where supervisor and employee surveys were completed within 30 minutes of one another, to minimize potential inaccuracies. However, the extent to which inaccuracies exist among the participants’ responses is unknown. Despite these limitations, this approach enabled relationships to be tested using a sample of individuals across a wide range of job types and organizations, geographically dispersed through the USA. The design also enabled participants to respond privately and anonymously, and allowed the researchers to continuously remind participants that responses would only be used for research purposes. These factors may have reduced levels of socially desirable responding. Future research should use experimental research methods and cross-lagged surveys to determine the robustness of the pattern of findings.</p>
<p>Second, as employees provided ratings of ethical leadership and ethical judgments, there is a potential for the effect sizes to be inflated due to common method bias (CMB). However, self-report measures are arguably the most appropriate technique to assess perceptions and judgments. Additionally, we took steps to eliminate a potential source of common method bias by asking employee participants to provide ethical judgments of the discretionary behaviors and supervisors to provide assessments of employee engagement in those behaviors. As a result, the strong relationships between employees’ ethical judgments and engagement in discretionary prosocial and antisocial behaviors do not seem to be influenced by CMB.</p>
<p>Third, the current study is based exclusively on the individual level of analysis. Several studies have indicated that ethical leadership across multiple levels is related to unit-level culture and behavior (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713481633">Mayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726713481633">Schaubroeck et al., 2012</xref>). Future research is needed to determine the extent to which ethical leadership is associated with the emergence of collective moral equity judgments about discretionary antisocial and prosocial behaviors among coworkers within teams, departments, and broad organizational divisions.</p>
<p>Fourth, the results are based on a sample of participants from the USA, which could introduce a cultural bias to the study. Prior research has found cultural convergence and divergence in ethical decision making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713481633">Bailey and Spicer, 2007</xref>), and ethical leadership beliefs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726713481633">Resick et al., 2006</xref>). As such, future research is needed to better understand the societal factors impacting ethical leaders’ behavior and influence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Nearly a century ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713481633">Barnard (1938)</xref> argued that leadership is not only responsible for ensuring compliance with a ‘complex code of morals but also the creation of moral codes for others’ (p. 270). The current study demonstrates that ethical leaders help employees to make sense of ethical expectations by signaling what behaviors constitute fair, just, and morally appropriate or inappropriate conduct. In turn, the moral equity judgments that employees form provide a basis for thoughtful behavior regulation, linking ethical leadership and employee discretionary workplace behaviors.</p>
