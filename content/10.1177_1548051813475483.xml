<abstract>
<p>Previous research has shown that psychological capital (PsyCap) is associated with desired employee behavioral and performance outcomes. Extending previous research, we examine, in two studies, if the PsyCap of Norwegian air traffic controllers is related to their perceptions of safety climate. Based on bootstrapping procedures, results from Study 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 77) and Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 38) revealed that PsyCap was positively correlated with safety climate. In Study 1, PsyCap explained 31% of the variance in safety climate. Controlling for mediating effects of positive and negative emotions in Study 2, PsyCap explained 15.5% of the variance. These results provide first-time empirical evidence linking PsyCap to safety climate in safety critical organizations.</p>

<p>Organizational climate is conceived as an empirically measurable component of culture and is linked to a number of important organizational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051813475483">Zohar, 2002</xref>). In safety critical organizations such as air traffic control, the concept of safety climate is more often used than the more general organizational climate, to emphasize the importance of ensuring a focus on safety issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051813475483">Cox &amp; Flin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051813475483">Wiegmann, Zhang, &amp; von Thaden, 2001</xref>). Thus, safety climate is often referred to as a state-like construct, providing a snapshot of selected aspects of an organization’s safety culture at a particular point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051813475483">Mearns, Whitaker, &amp; Flin, 2003</xref>). Although causal relationships have been difficult to establish, an accumulating body of research has linked safety climate to outcome variables such as risk perception, unsafe work behavior, accidents, and injuries at work—most notably rule violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051813475483">Mearns, Flin, Gordon, &amp; Fleming, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051813475483">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051813475483">Mearns, Whitaker, &amp; Flin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051813475483">Neal, Griffin, &amp; Hart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051813475483">Rundmo, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051813475483">1992b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051813475483">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051813475483">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051813475483">Zohar &amp; Luria, 2005</xref>). Following from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051813475483">Quick (1999)</xref>, a healthy work environment also includes a good safety record in addition to factors such as low absenteeism, employee satisfaction, and productivity. In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051813475483">Zohar (2010)</xref> concludes that the relationship between safety climate and safety outcomes seems well established in the literature, but that our theoretical understanding of antecedents, mediators, and moderators of this relationship is still limited. To date, no studies have looked at psychological capital (PsyCap; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051813475483">Luthans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, &amp; Avolio, 2007</xref>) as a possible antecedent of safety outcomes in safety critical organizations. From emerging research in safety science, it has been proposed that PsyCap may be associated with worker perceptions of safety climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051813475483">Eid, Mearns, Larsson, Laberg, &amp; Johnsen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the intrapersonal concept of PsyCap, safety climate relates to interpersonal and organizational factors such as perceived group attitudes, management policies, safety procedures, safety equipment, and available resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051813475483">Mearns and Yule (2008)</xref> have, from cross-cultural studies of organizational safety, laid out empirical evidence suggesting that more proximal influences, such as perceived management commitment to safety and the efficiency of safety measures, exert more impact on workforce behavior and subsequent accident rates than fundamental national values. This research indicates that certain managerial attributes such as how production managers prioritize and express a personal commitment to Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) objectives will influence safety in the form of worker behavior and attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051813475483">Zohar (2010</xref>, p. 1519) describes safety climate as “perceptions regarding both an overall organizational climate as well as a local group-level climate where these two climates may be well aligned and consistent or quite inconsistent and discrepant.” In the present study, we have used the same conceptualization and reserve the term <italic>safety climate</italic> to describe how air traffic controllers perceive both management and group commitment to safety in their everyday work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051813475483">Holte, 2007</xref>). In the following, we will lay out why PsyCap may represent an interpersonal variable that may influence how air traffic controllers evaluate the safety climate in their units or how they see their managers instill safety focus in the organization.</p>
<p>PsyCap is commonly referred to as an individual’s positive psychological state of development as opposed to more stable character strengths and trait-like capacities. According to Luthans and colleagues, PsyCap resources are conceptualized to be “more stable than states such as moods or emotions, but not as fixed as personality traits such as conscientiousness or core self-evaluations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avey, Avolio, &amp; Peterson, 2010</xref>, p. 44). A given person’s PsyCap profile can be described along the following four dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) having confidence (self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now and in the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary, redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency) to attain success. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These four resources are suggested to load onto the higher-order core construct of PsyCap and have been shown to demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity with similar constructs such as core self-evaluations and relevant personality traits such as conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>). Research has shown that the PsyCap construct is validly measureable and related to several key workplace outcomes including employee performance, job satisfaction, absenteeism, and employee well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051813475483">Avey, Luthans, Smith, &amp; Palmer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051813475483">Avey, Patera, &amp; West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis indicated a positive impact of PsyCap on employee attitudes, behaviors, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051813475483">Avey, Reichard, Luthans, &amp; Mhatre, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a Study 1–Study 2 design, the aim of this article is to broaden the empirical foundation of the positive psychology literature by examining the relationship between the core construct of PsyCap and safety climate in air traffic control. In Study 1, we examined the relationship between PsyCap and safety climate, as well as explored potential relationships between safety climate and the PsyCap facets of hope, efficacy, optimism, and resiliency. As the impact of PsyCap on safety climate can be influenced by individual differences in the experience of emotions, the effects of positive and negative emotions were controlled for in the second study.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051813475483">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Air traffic controllers have a cognitively complex job, and they are selected and trained to maintain a high safety standard. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051813475483">Van Meeuwen, Brand-Gruwel, Van Merriënboer, De Bock, and Krischner (2010)</xref>, efficacy was viewed by experts and trainers as an important indicator for successful learning in air traffic controllers. The concept of efficacy is derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051813475483">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> social cognitive theory and implies that employees have confidence to take on and to succeed when confronting new tasks. The construct of efficacy denotes “an individual’s conviction about his or her abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources and courses of action needed to successfully execute a specific task within a given context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051813475483">Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, 1998</xref>, p. 66). In air traffic control, the operators must feel confident that they have the necessary skills and technical knowledge required to understand and estimate risks involved in work operations and the necessary professionalism and self-confidence to report potential hazards to their superiors. Thus, efficacy is vital to increase safety-focused behavior.</p>
<p>Trainees in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051813475483">Van Meeuwen et al. (2010)</xref> study, on the other hand, identified the ability to adjust task performance and the orientation on task performance as the most important indicators of success. This finding suggests that hope may be an important factor for air traffic controllers, because it includes the ability to find new solutions to a problem when necessary. Hope is defined as a positive motivational state based on an interactively derived sense of successful agency and pathways or “the will and the way,” that is, how many different ways you can think of doing something, and if you have the willpower to do it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051813475483">Snyder, Irving, &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>, p. 287). Hope also reflects the ability to generate multiple paths to accomplish the same goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>) and may represent a motivational resource for air traffic controllers in adapting a flexible and focused attitude to solve problems at work before they develop into major safety issues.</p>
<p>The responsibilities associated with the job and the continuous need to stay vigilant and prepared to cope with unexpected and potentially time-critical events indicate that resiliency and the ability to overcome setbacks and adversities are equally important to air traffic controllers. The concept of resiliency refers to the individual tendency to sustain and bounce back when beset by problems and adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051813475483">Luthans, 2002</xref>). To not give in and to seek to overcome problems and obstacles will represent a valued asset in air traffic control when confronting sustained difficulties and seeking out new procedures or actions to solve the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Finally, faced with the repetitious but still stressful and safety critical nature of their work, it is also likely that realistic optimism in the form of positive outcome expectancies may represent an important aspect of air traffic control. Optimism is defined as the attributions one makes and the explanatory style one uses in response to situations and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051813475483">Seligman, 1998</xref>). Optimism will in this case refer to the air traffic controllers’ preferences and tendencies to make positive and realistic attributions about succeeding at work. This tendency to take action when it comes to dealing with work-related issues will be significant forces to promote safety-focused behavior in air traffic control. In a recent review of safety climate research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051813475483">Zohar (2010)</xref> suggests that safety climate is created by workers who share a common outlook of the organization and salient work attributes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The meaning of things and the interpretation of events arise from the interplay between one’s own perceptions and those of others in the same situation. During such a process, one’s perceptions are being checked and modified in light of others’ observations and assessments. . . . Such convergence promotes the emergence of climate because group members come to share the meanings of their organizational environment. (p. 1519)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on our discussion so far, one could speculate that PsyCap, through its components efficacy, optimism, hope, and resiliency, relates to attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions at the collective or organizational level regarding safety climate, which in turn will facilitate health and safety outcomes. If PsyCap is positively related to safety climate, strengthening these factors could also be an important part of the training for air traffic controllers. With this in mind, we hypothesize the following linkage between the intrapersonal level variable of PsyCap and the group and organizational level indicators of safety climate:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1548051813475483">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Questionnaires containing measures of PsyCap and safety climate were sent to 119 employees from two different Norwegian air traffic control centers in Southern Norway. The sample represents about 25% of all air traffic controllers in Norway (close to 500). A total of 77 valid questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of 65%. The sample was predominantly male (79%) with a mean age of 39 years (range = 27-65 years). The survey was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Service and assessed by The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. Participation was voluntary, and responses were returned anonymously to the researchers in sealed envelopes to ensure the privacy of the respondents.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1548051813475483">
<title>Psychological capital (PsyCap)</title>
<p>PsyCap was assessed with the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>). The PCQ draws from widely recognized published standardized measures for each of the dimensions that make up PsyCap: (a) Hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051813475483">Snyder et al., 1996</xref>), (b) Resiliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051813475483">Wagnild &amp; Young, 1993</xref>), (c) Optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051813475483">Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985</xref>), and (d) Self-Efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051813475483">Parker, 1998</xref>). The PCQ has demonstrated high reliability and construct validity in earlier studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051813475483">Avey, Luthans, &amp; Youssef, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051813475483">Luthans, Norman, Avolio, &amp; Avey, 2008</xref>). The 24-item PCQ has six items for each subscale of hope, resiliency, optimism, and efficacy. Responses are scored on a 6-point Likert-type scale with anchors of 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. To reflect the state-like quality of PsyCap, the questions were framed to ask the participants how they felt “right now.” The instrument can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al. (2007</xref>, pp. 237-238). Sample items include the following: “At the present time, I am energetically pursuing my work goals” (hope); “I can get through difficult times at work because I’ve experienced difficulty before” (resiliency); “I feel confident presenting information to a group of colleagues” (efficacy); and “When things are uncertain for me at work I usually expect the best” (optimism). The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for the overall PsyCap scale in the present study was α = .86. Cronbach’s alpha was satisfactory for all subscales of PsyCap (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051813475483">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Safety climate</title>
<p>A Nordic questionnaire on work-related safety in the building and construction business was used as a point of reference. From this instrument, 14 items (with responses ranging from 1= <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) were extracted, tapping into general aspects of workplace safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051813475483">Holte, 2007</xref>). Items that were generic in nature were preferred over domain-specific items to index general aspects of safety climate and avoid potential measurement errors due to cultural misconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051813475483">Reis, 2009</xref>). Items that reflected both group-level and management-level commitment to safety at the workplace were carefully selected based on their face validity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051813475483">Zohar (2010)</xref> shows how social interaction and shared perceptions between employees, and observing and exchanging information with the leader, are important parts of the safety climate. As the two levels of safety climate were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .79), only a total safety climate index was used in the subsequent analyses. Questions included how the air traffic controllers judged their supervisors’ attention to safety issues (e.g., “We who work here have confidence in the management’s ability to handle safety”). Questions also addressed how the employees handled safety issues at work and their relations to safety in everyday work life (e.g., “We who work here help each other to work safely”). The internal consistency for the safety climate scale as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was .92.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051813475483">Table 1</xref> presents means, standard deviations, reliability alphas, and intercorrelations for PsyCap and safety climate. The air traffic controllers rated their PsyCap as very good (means from 4.56 to 5.03 on a 6-point scale). As expected, PsyCap was significantly related to safety climate (<italic>r</italic> = .52; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, with the exception of efficacy, all the components of PsyCap were also significantly correlated with the measure of safety climate (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .41; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>To further investigate the relationship between PsyCap and safety climate, two sets of hierarchical regression analyses using bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples were conducted. Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that allows you to calculate effect sizes and hypothesis tests for an estimate even when you do not know the underlying distribution. Using bootstrap methods to assess mediation is especially recommended in small to moderate samples with low statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051813475483">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). In the first analysis, we investigated PsyCap as a predictor for safety climate, controlling for the effects of age and gender (women = 0; men = 1) of the respondents. Entering age and gender in Step 1 did not result in an overall significant model (<italic>F</italic> = .45; <italic>df</italic> = 2/73; <italic>p</italic> = .25), and none of the predictors significantly predicted safety climate. Adding PsyCap resulted in a significant increase in the explained variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .31; <italic>F</italic> change = 33.29; <italic>df</italic> = 1/70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The final model showed significant relationships between gender and safety climate (<italic>B</italic> = −.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.54 to −0.08), as well as between PsyCap and safety climate (<italic>B =</italic> .80; 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.13), whereas no relationship was established between age and safety climate (<italic>B</italic> = −.00; 95% CI = −0.02 to 0.01).</p>
<p>In the second analysis, the relationship between the four PsyCap subdimensions and safety climate were assessed. Age and gender were included as control variables also in this second analysis. Altogether, the variables explained 40% of the variance in safety climate (<italic>F</italic> = 7.57; <italic>df</italic> = 4/67; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Significant relationships with the dependent variable were found for gender (<italic>B</italic> = −.30; 95% CI = −0.53 to −0.04), and hope (<italic>B</italic> = −.35; 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.54), but not for efficacy (<italic>B</italic> = −.13; 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.31), resiliency (<italic>B</italic> = .35; 95% CI = −0.08 to 0.82), or optimism (<italic>B</italic> = .20; 95% CI = −0.04 to 0.43).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The air traffic controllers in general rated their safety climate as very good. Still, gender and assessments of PsyCap together explained more than one third of the variation in safety climate. Female air traffic controllers rated the safety climate significantly higher than their male counterparts. Research on gender and safety climate is lacking, but previous research indicates that women appear to be more sensitive to safety issues and are more risk aversive in the workplace than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051813475483">Byrnes, Miller, &amp; Schafer, 1999</xref>). In line with our first hypothesis, PsyCap was associated with, and explained a substantial part of the variation in safety climate. From the somewhat repetitious and routine work of the air traffic controllers, it is perhaps not surprising that their ability to redirect their efforts to reach their objectives (i.e., hope) was the only individual PsyCap factor significantly related to safety climate.</p>

<sec id="section9-1548051813475483">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Although the PsyCap concept is assumed to be state-like, one cannot rule out a selection hypothesis in this cross-sectional study. Psychological selection requirements for air traffic controllers are high, and it is possible that individual characteristics such as high emotional stability have had an impact on all responses. In Study 2, we examined if the proposed relationship between PsyCap and safety climate was mediated by positive or negative emotions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051813475483">Figure 1</xref>). Additional empirical evidence suggests that PsyCap plays an important role in explaining employee attitudes and behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051813475483">Avey, Wernsing, and Luthans (2008)</xref> found that PsyCap was related to positive emotions, which in turn were related to employee attitudes and relevant organizational outcomes. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051813475483">Avey, Wernsing, et al. (2008)</xref> showed that heightened awareness interacted with PsyCap in predicting positive emotions and that positive emotions generally mediated the relationship between PsyCap and the attitudes and behaviors.</p>

</fig>
<p>In Study 2, we included measures of positive and negative affectivity—traits that are moderately stable over time and social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051813475483">George, 1990</xref>). Individuals who are high in positive affectivity tend to be cheerful, enthusiastic, energetic, confident, and alert, indicating a higher level of life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051813475483">Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007</xref>). Even with state-like constructs such as PsyCap, it is therefore likely to assume that individuals who tend to see the world through rose-tinted glasses (i.e., a positive affectivity lens or predisposition) will be more likely to endorse constructs such as for instance hope and optimism. This assumption is supported by previous research that indicates that stable dispositions may influence the relationships between variables in organizational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051813475483">Jex &amp; Spector, 1996</xref>). Given the nature of work in air traffic control centers, it is also interesting to note that positive affectivity is proposed to increase attention focus so that the individual may see new opportunities or ways to use personal resources to overcome or deal with distressing situations. Based on this, we therefore propose the following hypothesis:</p>

<sec id="section11-1548051813475483">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Following Study 1, new questionnaires comprising measures of PsyCap, positive and negative affect, and safety climate were sent to 85 air traffic controllers from eight additional air traffic control centers who had not been invited to participate in the first study. A total of 38 valid questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of 45%. The mean age of the respondents in Study 2 was 38 years (range = 24-56 years). As in Study 1, participants in this study were predominantly male (97%). The procedures for collecting the data followed the ones outlined in Study 1.</p>

<title>Psychological capital and safety climate</title>
<p>Psychological capital and safety climate was measured by the same instruments as in Study 1. Cronbach’s alpha values for psychological capital (.87) and safety climate (.91) also indicate high internal consistency for the scales in this study.</p>

<sec id="section14-1548051813475483">
<title>Positive and negative affect</title>
<p>A Norwegian translation of the 10-item international Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051813475483">Thompson, 2007</xref>) was used to assess affectivity among respondents in Study 2. This version of the questionnaire lists five negative emotions (nervous, afraid, upset, hostile, and ashamed) and five positive emotions (alert, active, determined, attentive, and inspired). The respondents were asked to rate the extent to which they usually experience each particular emotion on a 5-point scale ranging from 1= <italic>very slightly</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>. The internal consistency was adequate, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .60 for Negative Affectivity and .79 for Positive Affectivity. Although reliability estimates &lt;.70 are generally considered to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051813475483">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>), lower values of Cronbach’s alpha can be expected from shorter scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051813475483">De Vellis, 2003</xref>). Comparable alpha levels for negative affectivity can also be found in other published studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051813475483">Kunst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051813475483">Schanowitz &amp; Nicassio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051813475483">Wong, Ho, Li, Shin, &amp; Tsai, 2011</xref>). Thus, both positive and negative affectivity indexes were included in the subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To test the proposed hypothesis, we followed the guidelines described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051813475483">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>. The Preacher and Hayes approach is a method with high statistical power and has several advantages compared with traditional approaches to testing mediators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051813475483">Hayes, 2009</xref>, for a complete overview). It is a more rigorous approach than the typical stepwise regression techniques, as all paths are measured simultaneously rather than step by step. It is also a nonparametric test and can be used on small samples (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 25). The approach allows for multiple mediators, statistical control of covariates, pairwise comparisons between indirect effects, as well as bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051813475483">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051813475483">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> list several advantages of specifying and testing a single multiple mediation model: including multiple mediators simultaneously (a) “purifies” indirect effects by controlling for all the other mediators, (b) reduces the alpha inflation that would result from using a series of single mediator models, and (c) makes it possible to determine which mediators are more successful than others.</p>

<p>A multiple mediation analysis, with negative and positive affectivity as the mediators, was performed to investigate the indirect effect of PsyCap on safety climate.

In line with the findings from Study 1, a strong direct relationship was established between PsyCap and safety climate (<italic>B</italic> = .57; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This direct relationship was sustained when the total effect was divided into the direct effect of PsyCap and the accumulated indirect effects through positive and negative affectivity (<italic>B</italic> = .69; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Study 2, positive affectivity and negative affectivity did not mediate the relationship between PsyCap and safety climate. PsyCap still explained a significant proportion of variation in the safety climate perceptions of air traffic controllers after controlling for the effects of positive and negative affectivity. Although optimism was the only one of the four PsyCap factors that had a direct effect on safety climate, this lends support to the implicit assumption that PsyCap might represent a potentially effective and new approach to increase safety awareness in safety critical organizations. The findings of Studies 1 and 2 are discussed in more detail below.</p>

<title>General Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study extends previous research in positive organizational behavior by showing that the core construct of PsyCap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, &amp; Avey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>) is positively related to safety climate indicators. Although our study confirms that air traffic controllers in general are highly focused on safety issues, individual differences in PsyCap still explained about 15.5% of the variation in safety climate, after positive and negative emotions were controlled for. In particular, the positive resource of hope emerged as the variable with the highest unique contribution in explaining air traffic controllers’ perceptions of safety climate in Study 1. This is noteworthy since hope is most often seen as a positive psychological resource that is related to work happiness, organizational commitment, employee performance, and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051813475483">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051813475483">Youssef &amp; Luthans, 2007</xref>). Hope has been found to lead to higher work performance outcomes across a number of independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051813475483">Peterson &amp; Byron, 2008</xref>). Research into performance psychology has also indicated that people with a high degree of hope are more likely to view impediments as challenges than those with less hope and that they tend to use negative feedback as guidance to find alternate ways to reach their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051813475483">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>). The significance of hope is also interesting to note in that the air traffic controllers in Study 1 had been exposed to a major organizational restructuring some years earlier. Although sick leave numbers were high in the restructuring period, at the time of this survey sick leave was reduced by about 50%, indicating that the air traffic controllers had been able to adapt and readjust to the new organizational structures and demands. People who score high on hope tend to internalize the work goals already set for them, and in addition set their own goals for their work. By making the work goals their own, it is more probable that they will be committed to them and that they will make the effort needed to reach them. Hence, effective goal-setting is important for performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study also revealed that the positive resource of optimism explained a significant part of the variance in air traffic controllers’ perceptions of safety climate in Study 2. Despite commonly held misperceptions in the general population, optimism—in the form of realistic optimism—includes an objective assessment of what one can accomplish in a specific situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051813475483">Peterson, 2000</xref>). Although optimism is commonly seen to represent an attribution style, it is susceptible to influence from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051813475483">Luthans, Youssef, et al., 2007</xref>). Employees with a more optimistic outlook tend to be happier, have more job satisfaction, and show better performance than their more pessimistic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051813475483">Youssef &amp; Luthans, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051813475483">Seligman, 1998</xref>). Thus, in the air traffic industry, realistic optimism would seem to be consistent with a favorable perception of safety climate. They have to believe that they can do something to influence the situations they meet in their everyday work. Having an optimistic explanatory style is therefore crucial for air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Efficacy and resiliency were not significantly correlated with safety climate. A plausible explanation for the lack of relationship may be that in order to work as an air traffic controller you need to have high levels of confidence to succeed at a task and the ability to keep going on after setbacks. The air traffic controllers have to make important decisions all the time and communicate them rapidly to the pilots. If they could not do this, they would not be able to be air traffic controllers. Consequently, one would expect air traffic controllers in general to exhibit relatively high levels of efficacy. According to our data, this seems to be the case since the air traffic controllers showed very high levels of efficacy and resiliency with very little variation, indicating a possible “ceiling effect.” As a consequence, efficacy and resiliency in general did not differentiate well between the controllers.</p>
<p>Some issues and potential limitations need to be considered when interpreting these results. First of all, the response rate in Study 2 was relatively low. However, this is in line with the average response rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051813475483">Baruch and Holtom (2008)</xref> found in their meta-analysis of 1,607 studies in organizational research published between 2000 and 2005. These authors found an average response rate of 52.7% in studies that collected data from individuals and an average response rate of 35.7% in studies that collected data from organizations. In our study, it was experienced that air traffic controllers is a difficult group to recruit into research due to their high-pressure job, where adequate rest breaks are critical for continued high performance, thus making it difficult to recruit participants when they are at work. Their work cycles also pose challenges since survey instruments have to be distributed to off-duty personnel. Still, we have little reason to believe that nonrespondents had a very different outlook on their work and safety challenges associated with their duties. It should also be noted that there is a possibility that perceptions of PsyCap and perceptions of safety climate may be a product of a larger unmeasured construct. Future studies should measure the predictor variable and the outcome variable at different times to further test the hypothesis of a relationship between the two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051813475483">Avey, Luthans, &amp; Mhatre, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study found significant positive associations between safety climate and PsyCap, as well as between safety climate and the PsyCap facets of hope and optimism. The findings of this study highlight the important role PsyCap seems to play in developing and sustaining safety climate, which has important practical implications for a new approach to developing and managing human resources in safety critical organizations. Future studies should aim to expand our findings and examine the relationship between PsyCap and safety climate in other organizations than air traffic control.</p>
