<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Ross procedure is the aortic valve replacement of choice in children. Nonetheless, late autograft reoperation for dilatation and/or regurgitation is concerning. We examine whether Ross procedure is suitable in children with rheumatic fever. <bold>Methods:</bold> Medical records of 104 children with rheumatic fever who underwent Ross procedure were reviewed (1991-2004). Competing risks methodology determined time-related prevalence and associated factors for two mutually exclusive end states: autograft reoperation and death prior to subsequent reoperation. <bold>Results:</bold> Mean age was 13.8 ± 2.7, 83 (80%) were males. Hemodynamic dysfunction was primarily regurgitation (n = 92, 88%) and stenosis/mixed (n = 12, 12%). Competing risks analysis showed that in ten years after the Ross procedure, 1% of patients died, 32% underwent autograft reoperation, and 67% were alive and free from reoperation. Ten-year freedom from aortic regurgitation greater than or equal to moderate was 63%. Ten-year freedom from autograft reoperation was 65% for regurgitation versus 90% for stenosis/mixed disease. Risk factors for autograft reoperation were earlier surgery year (PE: 0.26 ± 0.06 per year; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), additional surgery (PE: 0.82 ± 0.39, <italic>P</italic> = .04), no annular stabilization (PE: 1.21 ± 0.61, <italic>P</italic> = .05). Ten-year freedom from homograft replacement was 83%. Risk factors were fresh homografts (PE: 1.36 ± 0.71; <italic>P</italic> = .06) and aortic homografts (PE: 1.15 ± 0.59; <italic>P</italic> = .05). Ten-year freedom from any cardiac reoperation was 53%. Concomitant cardiac surgery was risk factor (PE: 1.37 ± 0.47; <italic>P</italic> = .004). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ross procedure in children with rheumatic fever is associated with excellent survival but results are plagued by aortic regurgitation and frequent autograft reoperation. Risk factors include preoperative regurgitation, concomitant surgery, dilated annulus, and earlier surgery era. Better patient selection in later era has mitigated autograft reoperation risk. Continued, improved candidate selection, along with modifications in autograft implantation and root/sinotubular stabilization techniques, may further decrease late autograft failure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The incidence of rheumatic fever has significantly decreased in the Western world; however, rheumatic fever remains a major cause of valve disease in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425066">1</xref></sup> Recent experience with aortic valve repair techniques showed encouraging short-term and midterm results in rheumatic aortic valve disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111425066">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111425066">3</xref></sup> Nonetheless, in patients with significant valve destruction or repair failure, aortic valve replacement is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Ross procedure is considered by many as the aortic valve replacement of choice in children and young adults as it is associated with excellent hemodynamics and cardiac recovery, it offers growth potential, and it does not require long-term anticoagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the procedure is technically demanding and late autograft failure, aortic root dilatation, and homograft reoperations are concerning despite excellent long-term survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425066">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Children with underlying rheumatic fever may be at special risk of having higher failure rate following the Ross procedure due to several factors such as multiple valve involvement, risk of recurrent disease, and the common presence of dilated aortic annulus and open regurgitation prior to surgery. Rheumatic fever was identified in several prior reports as a risk factor for late autograft failure following the Ross procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111425066">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425066">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We aim in the current report to examine time-related survival and freedom from reoperation following the Ross procedure in children with underlying rheumatic etiology and to assess risk factors that affect the risk of late autograft failure and subsequent aortic valve replacement. Ultimately, the goal is to improve patient selection and identify the best candidates to receive the Ross procedure among children with rheumatic aortic valve disease.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-2150135111425066">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>From 1991 to 2004, 104 consecutive children younger than 18 years of age with rheumatic aortic valve disease underwent aortic valve replacement utilizing the Ross procedure at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients were identified using the hospital surgical database. Clinical, operative, and outcome data were abstracted from their medical records. Approval of this study was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at our institution and requirement for individual consent was waived for this observational study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111425066">
<title>Operative Details</title>
<p>Midline sternotomy was performed and standard cardiopulmonary bypass and myocardial protection techniques were used in all cases. The pulmonary autograft was implanted as a full root with coronary transfer in all cases. The autograft muscle cuff was trimmed with sutures placed almost directly at the base of the cusps. The proximal suture line was performed using running polypropylene sutures. The proximal suture line was enforced with a felt strip in 30 (29%) older patients with dilated annulus. The distal suture line was occasionally reinforced with Teflon felt in patients with a dilated ascending aorta (n = 8). None of the patients required annular enlargement (modified Ross-Konno procedure).</p>
<p>Right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) continuity was established with a homograft in all patients. The mean homograft size utilized for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract was 24 ± 2 mm. Fresh homografts (locally prepared antibiotics-preserved homografts from donor hearts that were not suitable for transplantation) were utilized in 54% of patients, while cryopreserved homografts were used in 46%. Pulmonary homografts were used in 88% of patients, while aortic homografts were used in 12%. Homografts were not generally matched for the blood group of the patients.</p>
<p>Thirty-six patients (35%) required concomitant cardiac surgery including mitral valve repair (n = 33), ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure (n = 2), and pulmonary artery augmentation (n = 1). The immediate postoperative results were assessed in all patients in the operating room by means of transoesophageal echocardiography.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111425066">
<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>Patients were evaluated clinically and by means of detailed echocardiography upon discharge, six weeks after the operation, at six months, and yearly thereafter. Late outcomes were determined from recent office visits at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center or from direct correspondence with patients’ families. Follow-up was complete in 88% of patients. Mean follow-up duration was 8.8 ± 5.2 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150135111425066">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as means with standard deviation, medians with minimum and maximum, and frequencies as appropriate. Time-dependent outcomes (death and reoperation) after the Ross procedure were parametrically modeled. Parametric probability estimates for time-dependent outcomes use models based on multiple, overlapping, and phases of risk (available for use with the SAS system at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/hazard">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/hazard</ext-link>). The hazard procedure uses maximum likelihood estimates to resolve risk distribution of time to event in up to three phases of risk (early, constant, and late). Competing risk analysis was performed to model the probability over time in each of the two mutually exclusive end points: autograft reoperation and death without autograft reoperation, the remainder of patients being alive and free from autograft reoperation. In addition, parametric survival models were created for the following end points: homograft reoperation, cardiac reoperation other than autograft and homograft reoperation, and freedom from aortic regurgitation more than mild. Variables potentially influencing the likelihood of outcomes in the competing risk models were sought in a stepwise multivariate regression model (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 to enter) to obtain the final model for each outcome. Effects of covariates on the probability of outcomes in competing risk models are given as parameter estimates (change in hazard associated with change in one unit of the independent variable, positive estimates associated with increased risk, negative estimates with decreased risk) and percentage reliability in the bootstrap algorithm. Clinical relevance of identified covariates to likelihood of selected outcomes was established by solving the regression equations for multiple “typical” test patients. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software v9.1 (The SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-2150135111425066">
<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>There were 83 male patients (80%). Median age at the Ross procedure was 14.2 years (range 5.8-18 years). The hemodynamic aortic valve dysfunction was primarily regurgitation in 92 patients (88%), while the remaining 12 patients (12%) had either stenosis or mixed disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150135111425066">
<title>Competing Risk Analysis for Death or Subsequent Aortic Valve Replacement After the Ross Procedure</title>
<p>Following the 104 initial Ross procedures, 27 patients (26%) had their autografts subsequently replaced and 1 patient (1%) died without a further reoperation. A second patient died late following a subsequent aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis.</p>
<p>The hazard function for time-related transition to autograft reoperation was characterized by the presence of a late hazard phase that peaks around two to four years postoperatively but persists as years progressed since surgery (Figure 1A, B). The hazard function for time-related transition to death without autograft reoperation was negligible with only two deaths before four years after surgery and a stable survival thereafter. The competing risks of the two events showed that at ten years following the Ross procedure, approximately 1% of patients died, 32% underwent autograft reoperation with aortic valve replacement, and 67% were alive and free from autograft reoperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111425066">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150135111425066">
<title>Factors Associated With Mortality</title>
<p>There was no operative mortality. At the last follow-up, there were a total of two deaths including one death at home within a year of surgery and one late death in a patient in whom the autograft had been replaced by a mechanical prosthesis, and he had mechanical valve-related mortality. The number of mortalities was too small to permit risk factor analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2150135111425066">
<title>Factors Associated With Subsequent Aortic Valve Replacement</title>
<p>During follow-up, there were 27 autograft reoperations (26%). All autograft reoperations were due to the development of aortic regurgitation. The predominant pathology causing regurgitation was annular dilatation with cusp prolapse and failure of coaptation (n = 16), recurrence of inflammatory valvulopathy similar to that in rheumatic fever (n = 8), unknown (n = 2), and endocarditis (n = 1). All autograft reoperations required aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. Parametric freedom from autograft reoperation was 99% at 1 year, 76% at 5 years, and 66% at 15 years. There were no differences between parametric and nonparametric freedom from aortic valve replacement. Ten-year freedom from autograft reoperation for patients with preoperative regurgitation versus stenosis or mixed aortic valve disease was 65% versus 90%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135111425066">Figure 3</xref>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite its decreased incidence in the Western world, rheumatic fever remains an important cause of aortic valve disease in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425066">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111425066">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref></sup> As the valve becomes involved with the inflammatory process leading to commissural fusion, cusp infiltration, and retraction and calcification formation, patients develop symptoms of aortic valve disease. The manifestation of aortic valvulopathy in children is predominantly regurgitation due to cusp infiltration, retraction, and lack of coaptation; predominant rheumatic aortic stenosis disease is seen less commonly in children.</p>
<p>Aortic valve repair in children with rheumatic aortic regurgitation using cusp extension techniques has been reported by several authors with acceptable early- and midterm results; however, aortic valve replacement is necessary in those in whom the valve is extensively damaged or following repair failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111425066">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111425066">3</xref></sup> The Ross procedure is considered by many surgeons the preferred aortic valve substitute in children with congenital aortic valve disease, especially the smallest children in whom aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis is associated with high early mortality and late complication rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425066">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref></sup> Nonetheless, there are several concerns regarding the use of the Ross procedure in children with rheumatic valve disease such as the presence of concurrent or late other valve involvement, development of recurrent inflammatory disease in the autograft, progression of annular and root dilatation leading to autograft failure, in addition to the requirement of homograft replacement in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425066">12</xref></sup> Given that children affected with rheumatic fever are relatively old compared to those with congenital aortic valve disease, other alternatives may be suitable in this patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425066">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111425066">15</xref></sup>

<title>Survival</title>
<p>Despite surgical complexity, the Ross procedure is safe in experienced hands; in the International Ross Registry, reported overall mortality is 2.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425066">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111425066">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111425066">18</xref></sup> Operative mortality is higher in children with congenital heart disease mainly in smaller children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425066">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111425066">19</xref></sup> Infants and neonates are particularly at highest risk of operative death, especially when simultaneous arch and mitral intervention is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425066">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111425066">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111425066">21</xref></sup> In our current series, we demonstrated that the Ross procedure can be safely performed in older children with rheumatic valve disease with no operative mortality despite that many of the patients required concomitant mitral valve repair.</p>
<p>Most importantly, survival following the Ross procedure was stable with only two late deaths, one of them related to complications of a mechanical valve in a patient who had required autograft reoperation and replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. This very low late mortality compares favorably with mechanical prostheses that are associated with continuous attrition with time due to thromboembolic/hemorrhagic complications in children in whom proper anticoagulation is difficult to attain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Of interest, despite the frequent reoperation rate for autograft failure in our current series, cardiac reoperation was associated with low operative risk. Aortic valve replacement following the Ross procedure was done without the requirement for root replacement but rather by placing the prosthesis within the neoaortic annulus after excising the cusps of the failing autograft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425066">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111425066">15</xref></sup> Redo root replacement may expose the patient to higher morbidity and mortality risk but that was not necessary in any patient in our current series.

<p>Several risk factors for late autograft failure have been identified such as the presence of bicuspid aortic valves, dilated ascending aortas, primarily preoperative aortic regurgitation, geometric mismatch between the two semilunar valves, and rheumatic fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425066">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Preoperative aortic regurgitation and geometric mismatch between the aortic annulus and the pulmonary valve diameter, commonly seen in patients with rheumatic aortic valve disease, have been reported in several series to be associated with autograft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425066">12</xref></sup> Laudito et al described a series of 72 Ross procedures in children. Autograft reoperation was necessary in the follow-up period in seven patients for severe aortic regurgitation. The presence of predominant preoperative aortic regurgitation was a risk factor for autograft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066">11</xref></sup> Similarly, Elkins et al showed that children with a diagnosis of aortic regurgitation were at increased risk of autograft reintervention following the Ross procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref></sup> While the majority of those series involved patients with congenital aortic disease, this failure mechanism is probably true in patients with rheumatic aortic regurgitation and dilated annulus and is likely due to the development of poor central coaptation by the widely splayed commissures and dilated annulus.</p>
<p>The association between autograft reoperation and rheumatic fever has been highlighted previously in reports from our institution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425066">14</xref></sup> Modes of failure at our center were mainly aortic root dilatation and cusp prolapse in 46%, recurrent rheumatic activity in 25%, inflammatory process that was likely recurrent rheumatic disease in 18%, aneurysm formation without regurgitation in 7%, and endocarditis in 4% of failures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref></sup> We have previously identified the risk factors for autograft failure, which included active rheumatic heart disease, concomitant severe rheumatic mitral regurgitation, predominant aortic regurgitation with severe dilatation of the aortic annulus greater than 28 mm or discrepancy between aortic annulus and pulmonary valve greater than 2 to 3 mm in favor of the aortic annulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111425066">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425066">14</xref></sup> Since the beginning of 1999, we have created a new selection criteria, avoided patients with active rheumatic fever with elevated titers and inflammatory markers, concomitant severe mitral involvement, and dilated aortic annulus more than 28 mm. In addition, we adapted surgical modifications such as careful trimming of the muscle rim under the autograft and suturing close to the base of the cusps as this muscle rim may dilate and contribute to future failure, enforcement of proximal suture line using a felt strip in older children with aortic annulus diameter more than 26 mm, and occasional enforcement of the dilated sinotubular junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425066">14</xref></sup> Our current results indicate that the incidence of autograft failure and subsequent aortic valve replacement has been alleviated following the adaptation of those changes. Despite a relatively shorter follow-up, this finding is encouraging considering that most failures were previously evident in the first two to four years following surgery, which is different from the later failure incidence seen in other Western series in children with predominantly congenital aortic valve disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425066">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425066">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>All patients in our series received the full root autograft implantation technique. Recent literature suggests that alternative implantation strategies such as the subcoronary or miniroot inclusion techniques may be associated with a lower incidence of autograft failure and may be considered in patients at high risk of root dilatation and autograft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111425066">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111425066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135111425066">24</xref></sup> Alternatively, annular reduction and stabilization techniques have shown some reduction in autograft failure rates in adults; however, they were not commonly used in the pediatric population. In our series, we did not perform annular reduction and attempted annular stabilization with proximal suture line enforcement using felt in older patients with dilated aortic annulus. We found in our analysis a trend to decreased autograft reoperation in those who had annular stabilization. This trend did not reach statistical significance, may be, due to the small sample size of our series. We currently do not use the Ross procedure in patients with aortic annulus larger than 29 to 30 mm, and we use the felt strip for proximal line enforcement in older patients with aortic annulus diameter more than 26 mm.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, several authors described surgical modifications to prevent autograft dilatation. Mortiz et al reduced the diameter of the aortic annulus and wrapped the pulmonary autograft with an absorbable mesh.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150135111425066">25</xref></sup> Pacifico et al described an operative technique wherein the entire pulmonary autograft was wrapped with glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium to prevent dilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150135111425066">26</xref></sup> Most recently, Slater et al described a modification in which the pulmonary autograft was encased in a Dacron tube to prevent dilatation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150135111425066">27</xref></sup> Those techniques are suitable only for patients who will not need growth of the autograft because the outer shell prohibits this; therefore, older children with rheumatic aortic regurgitation may be good candidates for those modifications. Further follow-up is required to confirm the hypothetical advantages of those modifications. Meanwhile, we have not utilized any of those modifications at our center.</p>
<p>One final notable advance is the progress in valve-preserving root replacement techniques. Those techniques have been successfully utilized following the Ross procedure in patients with root dilatation and autograft regurgitation and may increase valve longevity despite aortic wall reintervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150135111425066">28</xref></sup> Those procedures are likely successful in patients in whom the mode of failure is due to annular dilatation and failure of coaptation. In those with recurrent inflammatory disease affecting the cusps, valve replacement with stented prosthesis within the neoaortic annulus is required and usually done with low operative risk.</p>

<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>This case series is subject to the limitations inherent in all retrospective observational studies such as selection bias and lack of randomization. In addition, the multiple variables in this series that reflect changes in selection criteria and development of different surgical modifications all preclude sophisticated statistical analyses and limit the power of the study to identify clinically significant risk factors. Finally, our series lacks a retrospective assessment of aortic dimensions, left ventricular (LV) size and function, aortic regurgitation, and outflow gradients in serial echocardiographic examinations by an independent cardiologist, and hence the pattern of progression of all those parameters is not well described in this report.</p>

<sec id="section19-2150135111425066">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The Ross procedure in children with rheumatic aortic valve disease is associated with excellent survival. Nonetheless, late autograft failure due to recurrent inflammatory disease, autograft regurgitation, with or without dilatation of the root and sinotubular junction is a major concern. Patients with predominant preoperative aortic regurgitation, especially those with associated risk factors such as dilated annulus and concomitant mitral regurgitation are at higher risk of autograft failure. Better patient selection by avoiding those with active inflammatory disease, predominant regurgitation, dilated aortic root and annulus, and significant geometric mismatch between the two semilunar valves have resulted in a substantial decrease in the rate of autograft failure and reoperation. Patients without the above mentioned risk factors may be suitable candidates for the Ross procedure; however, as other alternatives may be available for this age group, optional substitute choice should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. Surgical modifications aiming at limiting autograft dilatation can be used in older patients and may further mitigate late autograft failure risk; however, longer follow-up is required to confirm those theoretical advantages.</p>
