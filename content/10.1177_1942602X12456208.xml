<abstract>
<p>While all schools in Washington State have had to deal with shrinking financial resources, small, rural school districts, with fewer than 2,000 students, face unique circumstances that further challenge their ability to meet rising student health needs. This article will explore how small districts utilize the services of the Washington State School Nurse Corps (SNC), an innovative program that supports student health and safety while reducing barriers to learning. Through direct registered nursing services and regional nurse administrative consultation and technical assistance, the SNC strengthens rural school districts’ capacity to provide a safe and healthy learning environment. In addition, we will examine current research that links health and learning to discover how the SNC model is successful in addressing health risks as barriers to learning. Lastly, as resources continue to dwindle, partnerships between schools, the SNC, and state and local health and education organizations will be critical in maintaining health services and learning support to small, rural schools.</p>

<p>The current economic crisis has impacted every system supported by public funding, and schools are no exception. They have had to cope with budget cuts and shift funding to areas of highest priority—priorities often determined by the schools’ pressing need to meet federal and state standards of student achievement.</p>
<p>While all schools have had to deal with shrinking financial resources, small school districts, with fewer than 2,000 students, face additional circumstances that challenge their ability to meet student needs. In 2002, Washington State convened a summit of leaders interested in the success of small schools within the state. The summit report, <italic>Achieving Small School Success</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12456208">Boyle, 2002</xref>), identified four barriers to student learning that small schools encounter more often than their larger counterparts:</p>
<list id="list1-1942602X12456208" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Poverty: 45.2% of students in small districts are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch compared to 34.3% of students in larger districts with an enrollment of more than 2,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12456208">Boyle, 2002</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Language: A larger proportion of small schools have students with limited English proficiency.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Long Bus Rides: Students in small schools are often more dispersed and have longer bus rides; some students in Washington ride 3 hours each day.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limited Access to Resources:
<list id="list2-1942602X12456208" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Small districts may be in communities with limited financial resources to support school funding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students often must travel long distances to access supportive health care and counseling services.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>

<title>Health and Learning</title>
<p>These four barriers to learning also make it difficult for small schools to meet the health needs of their students. Research demonstrates that health and learning are inextricably linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12456208">Basch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12456208">Eide, Showalter, &amp; Goldhaber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12456208">Haas &amp; Foss, 2008</xref>). Health affects student success from test scores to graduation rates. Not only do children with poor health have lower educational attainment, they exhibit a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors than their healthy peers. The impact of health on student learning cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>A recently published report, <italic>Research Review: School-Based Health Interventions and Academic Achievement</italic>, describes the link between health factors and academic risk in Washington State. Julia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12456208">Dilley (2009)</xref> analyzed data from the <italic>Washington State Healthy Youth Survey</italic>. She examined the relationship between high school and middle school student reports of academic risk and common physical and mental health risk factors. <italic>Academic risk</italic> was defined as students’ self-report of getting mostly C, D, and F grades. Thirteen mental and physical health risk factors were selected to correlate with academic risk (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12456208">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Dilley compared reported health risks to the students’ grades. The analysis showed that the more health risks students had, the more likely it was that they were also at risk for academic failure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942602X12456208">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this relationship.</p>

</fig>
<p>Note that with a total of six health risks, about 50% of the students were at academic risk. Each health risk was associated with approximately a 7% point increase in academic risk. Using a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, and socioeconomic status, the association remained. Conversely, data indicated that removing one risk has the potential to positively influence academic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12456208">Dilley, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Professional school nurses and other health professionals are needed to address the health and behavioral needs of students. Burdened with budget constraints and rural isolation, small schools are more likely to have difficulty finding and retaining qualified school nurses to provide the leadership necessary for a successful school health program. Given their limited resources, how do small schools develop and maintain a system to promote and support the health and learning of their students?</p>

<title>An Innovative School Nurse Program</title>
<p>School districts in Washington State have struggled with this question for many years, especially our small, rural districts. Because of substantial changes in health care and educational systems during the last decades of the 21st century, the need to address the issue became urgent. New technology made it increasingly possible for medical procedures to be performed in home and school settings. Federal legislation required a free and appropriate education for all students despite often complex health care needs. School health leaders in our state recognized that some schools did not have registered nurses available to meet these needs, which compromised both student safety and district liability. In 1997, in response to their concern, the Washington State Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) commissioned a statewide survey of school nurses, <italic>Survey of School Nurses Report</italic>. The purpose of this survey was to determine the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1942602X12456208" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The number of registered nurses (RNs) and other health workers in the K–12 public education system;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The type of health services being provided;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The nature and frequency of those services; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Existing student health conditions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Two hundred eleven (211) of 296 public school districts participated in the survey, a 71% response rate. The findings were significant. Small districts with less than 2,000 students had a higher ratio of RN to students (1:2300) than districts with greater than 2,000 students (1:1650). Additionally, 44 of the 45 districts with no RN services were small, rural schools (JLARC, 1997).</p>
<p>Some school districts also reported that non-licensed staff were administering medication and providing tube feedings, tracheostomy suctioning, and other nursing tasks without RN assessment, training, supervision, or delegation. Furthermore, school nurse time was being consumed by activities that non-licensed staff could perform, for example, immunization data entry and state reporting, minor first aid care, and health screenings. Yet, students needing complex nursing care to support a safe and healthy learning environment were not adequately served. Consequently, many school districts had no written nursing health care plans for students with life threatening or chronic health conditions. When student health care needs are not addressed or are poorly managed, absenteeism increases, student safety risks increase, and ultimately learning is compromised. Finally, the survey gave very clear priority to small, rural schools as those in most need of assistance.</p>
<p>In response to these demonstrated needs and indications for action identified in the survey, the Washington State School Nurse Corps program was established in 1999 by the Washington State legislature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1942602X12456208">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The SNC program is administered through a statewide framework by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), Washington State’s department of education. Nine SNC nurse administrators direct the program from regional Educational Service Districts (ESDs) throughout the state by assessing and analyzing student health needs, allocating resources, consulting, mentoring, and building partnerships (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1942602X12456208">Map 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The program was created to maintain and increase student health and safety. This is accomplished through two essential service strategies. Direct RN services are delivered to the “neediest” small schools determined by case load, student need, and district demographics. Additionally, all school districts, both small and large, have access to a regional SNC nurse administrator for consultation, technical assistance, professional development, and resources regarding school health services.</p>
<sec id="section3-1942602X12456208">
<title>Supporting Student Success</title>
<p>Through these essential services, the SNC supports student success and strengthens rural school districts’ capacity to provide a safe and healthy learning environment. The program is a unique, efficient, and successful model for learning support and quality assurance that can reduce barriers to learning and other challenges facing small, rural schools. For example, SNC nurses make a difference by decreasing risk of student injury and death through the development and implementation of nursing care plans, improving attendance for students with special health care needs, and lowering the significant ethical and legal risks that small schools confront as they strive to achieve positive health and educational outcomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1942602X12456208">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Since the inception of the SNC program, dramatic improvements in the provision of health care services and subsequent learning support for small, rural school districts have been noted. According to the 2007 School Nurse Corps program report <italic>Healthy Students Learn</italic>, prior to the SNC, 35% of Washington’s districts with 2,000 or fewer students did not have RN services. During the 2010–2011 school year, SNC nurse administrators reported that close to 100% of Washington State small schools now have RN services. Most importantly, students with critical physical and mental health needs in the neediest districts are safer, present at school, and ready to learn.</p>
<p>While the program continues to make a positive impact, this report also found that rising unmet student health care needs persist. These needs have surpassed capacity and are creating program challenges without a concomitant increase in funding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1942602X12456208">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>The Challenges Ahead</title>
<p>While the SNC has proven to be a successful model for addressing the health care needs of students in small, rural schools, it is evident that the program has and should continue to evolve in response to the changing needs of children, schools, and their communities. As resources dwindle, we look for new ways to overcome the many challenges that students bring with them to school each day. It is unrealistic to expect schools to meet these challenges alone. Community collaboration is essential. A key role of SNC nurse administrators is to develop and foster partnerships with health and educational organizations at local, regional, and state levels. Together we must invest our resources to create vibrant and healthy schools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1942602X12456208">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Schools offer a tremendous opportunity to shape the health of future generations. This opportunity cannot be ignored if we are to achieve the goal that all children are safe, healthy, and successful lifetime learners. Through continued research, quality assurance monitoring, creative thinking, and collaboration, the SNC will be an innovative model that continues to help move Washington State closer to this ideal.■</p>
