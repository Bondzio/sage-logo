<abstract>
<p>Priming linear versus cyclical conceptions of time influences affective forecasts and descriptions of grief. Relative to a linear or static prime, a cyclical prime prompted predictions of shorter grief duration, reliance on cyclical language, characterization of recovery as return to routine, and reduced characterization of the bereaved person as passive. To contrast, a linear prime uniquely prompted spatiotemporal metaphors, advising against pressure to “move forward” too soon.</p>

<p>People view the world through various temporal filters, including pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12446600">Conti, 2001</xref>), linearity versus cyclicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12446600">Ballard &amp; Seibold, 2004</xref>), scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12446600">Kurtz, 2008</xref>), and dynamicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12446600">Glicksohn &amp; Ron-Avni, 1997</xref>). Time flies, repeats itself, gets used up, and races past. These temporal perspectives can influence how people interpret and behave in the social world. With respect to scarcity, for example, if people view the same objective amount of time as limited rather than extensive, they report increased well-being and take advantage of time-bounded opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12446600">Kurtz, 2008</xref>). The present study examines the effects of linear versus cyclical perspectives, specifically addressing how these perspectives influence how grief is described and understood.</p>

<title>The Problem of Cyclical Time</title>
<p>Variously dubbed mechanistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12446600">Calkins, 1970</xref>), Western (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X12446600">Zakay &amp; Fleisig, 2011</xref>), or Newtonian time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X12446600">Saunders, van Slyke, &amp; Vogel, 2004</xref>), linear time stretches unidirectionally from an irrevocable past to an unknown remote future: It does not repeat. In contrast, cyclical time—often tied to solar, lunar, and seasonal patterns—is by definition repetitive: The past can be expected to repeat itself in the future. Social scientists whose primary levels of analysis lie with groups and societies—anthropologists, organizational scholars, and sociologists—long have distinguished between linear and cyclical time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12446600">Adam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12446600">Crosson, Cunha, Vera, &amp; Cunha, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12446600">Lévi-Strauss, 1967</xref>) as have science historians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12446600">Gould, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446600">Kuhn, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Curiously, the linear–cyclical distinction is virtually absent from the social psychological literature. Indeed, within human psychology as a whole, cyclical notions largely are reflected in biological patterns (e.g., circadian rhythms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12446600">Moore-Ede, Sulzman, &amp; Fuller, 1982</xref>). At the level of the individual, little empirical or theoretical work considers how a cyclical construal of time relates to memory, social inference, or language (for a notable exception with children’s memory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12446600">Friedman &amp; Lyon, 2005</xref>). Arguably, despite the apparent disinterest of social psychologists, cyclical time remains a critical feature of contemporary life: People prepare for hurricane season and chat excitedly about football. Of course, people also can be aware of linear time: They memorialize historic events and discuss retirement. Whether a cyclical or linear perspective is salient changes how people view the same objective period of time, specifically in their focus on repetitive patterns (e.g., weather, exams) versus movement along a linear trajectory (e.g., the curriculum vitae in the tenure portfolio).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0261927X12446600">
<title>Affective Forecasting and Grief</title>
<p>As an initial effort to consider the linear–cyclical distinction, the current work focuses on how grief is described and understood. Grief is associated easily with both linear (e.g., moving forward) and cyclical (e.g., birth–death–rebirth) notions of time. Extreme events such as tragic loss elicit predictions about the experiencer’s emotions, which are relatively accurate with respect to valence but not duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446600">Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, &amp; Wheatley, 1998</xref>). For instance, academics denied tenure are miserable, but they overestimate how long misery will persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446600">Gilbert et al., 1998</xref>). People overestimate duration because they attend primarily to the precipitating event and fail to consider adaptation to new circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12446600">Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005</xref>). When they recognize that people resume daily activities, estimations shorten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12446600">Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, &amp; Axsom, 2000</xref>). Especially germane to present purposes, primes with temporal features can influence affective forecasts. For example, individuals primed with notions of temporal change (e.g., the ozone layer is decreasing) forecast quicker dissipation of their own emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12446600">Igou, 2004</xref>). Similarly, individuals primed to view time as stationary (i.e., people move through time) predict grief to subside more quickly than do individuals primed to view time as moving past stationary people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>How would affective forecasts differ under a cyclical versus a linear perspective? By definition, a cyclical perspective connotes repetition so it conceivably evokes thoughts and comments about routine and repetition. As noted earlier, recognizing that routine activities resume after a focal event helps abbreviate forecasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12446600">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, such abbreviated forecasts of <italic>future</italic> duration parallel estimations of <italic>past</italic> duration: Routine events are remembered as having shorter durations than nonroutine events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12446600">Avni-Babad &amp; Ritov, 2003</xref>). Routine events seem short, because they are not encoded as new experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12446600">Block, 1985</xref>). Indeed, expecting to respond to a predictable pattern allows shorter response time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X12446600">Stefanics et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, when things happen over and over again—and are expected to happen over and over again—durations seem relatively short. A cyclical perspective therefore should prompt affective forecasts of relatively shorter grief duration.</p>
<p>To contrast, in a linear perspective, time stretches from a known past into an unforeseen future. Scholars propose two primary linear temporal metaphors, both of which consider the relative movement of people to time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12446600">Clark, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12446600">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980</xref>). In the person-moving perspective, a person moves through time, as though journeying on a one-way street. In the time-moving perspective, time moves past the stationary person, like a river flowing past people on an embankment. The affective forecasts associated with these perspectives follow logically: When the person is stationary, affective forecasts for grief are longer than when the person is moving (i.e., past her grief and the focal event; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>). In the present study, time passing was depicted without human agents (i.e., a flower blooming). Consequently, the linear perspective examined here follows the time-moving perspective and should prompt forecasts of relatively longer grief duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261927X12446600">
<title>Time and Language</title>
<p>Temporal perspective also should influence how people describe the experience of grief. First, verbal characterizations of grief should be consistent with affective forecasts. A cyclical perspective evokes the notions of daily routine that attenuate predicted grief duration, whereas a linear time-moving perspective implicates stationary people waiting for grief to pass (which lengthens predicted duration). When asked what resumption of normal life means, people operating under a cyclical perspective should reference daily routine, whereas people operating under a time-moving linear perspective should reference the dissipation of negative affect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, linear versus cyclical perspectives should evoke language that is, at face value, linear or cyclical. The cyclical metaphor for time evokes repetition, so people thinking through this lens likely use language that denotes repetition such as <italic>back to</italic> or <italic>return</italic>. In contrast, linear metaphors for time reflect not only the absence of repetition (i.e., avoidance of cyclical language) but also implicate the relative position of the person to time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12446600">Clark, 1973</xref>). Expressions such as <italic>move forward</italic> connote the person moving past the focal event into the future; expressions such as <italic>grief runs its course</italic> implicate the tragic event striking the person and then dissolving into the past.</p>
<p>Third and finally, temporal perspective can alter inferences about others’ causal agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12446600">McGlone &amp; Pfiester, 2009</xref>). In the linear time-moving perspective, approaching events “happen” to people rather than being caused by them. The characterization of events as occurrences rather than actions can be implied linguistically in several ways, such as converting grammatical subjects to objects or using passive voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446600">Brown &amp; Fish, 1983</xref>). Statements such as “Something bad has happened to her” connote a world in which bad things come along, someone is victimized, and others (not the victim) respond. When negative circumstances lack a human perpetrator (e.g., natural disaster, terminal illness), passive characterizations are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12446600">Dewart, 1979</xref>). In the linear time-moving case, then, the stationary grieving person is likely characterized as a passive recipient of events rather than as an active causal agent.</p>
<p>How a cyclical perspective might influence descriptions of agency is less obvious. On one hand, there is no reason to presume a high degree of agency: Whether the person takes action or not, the cycle repeats (e.g., sunrise follows sunset). On the other hand, the process of entrainment synchronizes an internal pattern with an external temporal pattern (i.e., the <italic>zeitgeber</italic> or time-giver; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12446600">Moore-Ede et al., 1982</xref>). In addition to natural synchronies such as circadian rhythms, entrainment can include volitional patterns such as synchronizing one’s tapping to a metronome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X12446600">McAuley, Jones, Holub, Johnston, &amp; Mille, 2006</xref>). When synchrony is interrupted, people often try to get themselves back into sync (e.g., managing jet lag; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12446600">Sack, 2010</xref>). Thus, although cyclical time implicitly includes an external influence on behavior—seasons, daylight—individuals behave in ways that reestablish synchrony. Through the cyclical lens, a grieving individual, who gradually returns to daily routine, likely seems less passive than the stationary figure who awaits grief to pass.</p>

<title>Overview and Predictions</title>
<p>Participants were exposed to a cyclical, linear time-moving, or static temporal prime. They then read about a woman whose child died and rendered inferences about grief intensity and duration; they also responded to open-ended questions.</p>
<p>Relative to the other primes, the cyclical prime should prompt predictions of shorter grief duration, reference to daily routine, use of cyclical language, and characterization of the bereaved as neither active nor passive. To contrast, the linear prime should prompt longer grief duration, characterization of recovery as the passage of negative affect, invocation of linear spatiotemporal metaphors, and characterization of the bereaved as passive.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0261927X12446600">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample comprised 79 university students (32 male, 47 female; <italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub> = 19.05) in the United States who participated in exchange for extra credit. Most (66%) had lost an adult member of their extended family (e.g., grandparent) and a few (4%) of their immediate family; none knew a close friend or family member who had lost a child under the age of 21 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261927X12446600">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Experimenters conducted participants in groups of three to six individuals; sessions were assigned randomly to prime condition. Because of their symbolic importance for grief, the temporal primes depicted flowers. The linear prime comprised a sequence of four color photos of a flower, from completely closed to fully open; the photos were arranged horizontally from left to right (i.e., objects to the right are interpreted as the future; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12446600">Ouellet, Santiago, Funes, &amp; Lupiáñez, 2010</xref>). The cyclical prime showed the same sequence, arranged in a circle with arrows between the photos. Finally, the static control comprised four photos of books stacked on shelves; photos were arranged horizontally and were the same size as the flowers, but no sequencing was implied. Experimenters remained unaware of hypotheses throughout the study and left the room after distributing surveys to minimize expectancy effects. To be certain that participants noticed the prime, the survey requested that participants describe the picture in their own words; all participants complied, typically with brief acknowledgements such as “a flower blooming” or “stacks of books.”</p>
<p>Following the prime, the survey asked participants to imagine the grieving process of a woman who had lost her only child, a 7-year old boy, to a degenerative childhood disease. On a 7-point Likert-type scale, participants estimated distress intensity immediately after the event. Then they estimated how long that intense distress would last in terms of days, weeks, months, or years. Their estimates were converted to number of days prior to analysis (e.g., 1 month = 30 days); in a handful of cases, participants’ responses were interpolated (e.g., 1½ months = 45 days). Next, participants indicated in a free response item what returning to a normal life would denote for someone who had experienced this type of loss. Finally, participants indicated in two free response items what kinds of behaviors by friends and family might be helpful or unhelpful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261927X12446600">
<title>Data Coding</title>
<p>Two condition-unaware individuals coded open-ended responses, as follows:</p>
<sec id="section9-0261927X12446600">
<title>Recovery</title>
<p>On free responses to the query of what comprises a return to normal life, coders designated the response into one of four mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories based on prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>). Comments focused on (a) resumption of normal daily tasks and routine (e.g., <italic>she goes about her daily stuff</italic>), (b) awaiting dissipation of negative affect (e.g., <italic>she can talk about him without crying</italic>), (c) impossibility of normalcy (e.g., <italic>no one could recover from this</italic>), and (d) finding new meaning (e.g., <italic>she’ll find a new purpose in life</italic>). Each participant therefore received a 1 for the represented category and a 0 for the remaining four categories. Intercoder agreement on these mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories was good at 92%, κ = .87.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261927X12446600">
<title>Agency</title>
<p>Many participants provided multiple phrases in response to the question, “What comprises a return to normal life?” An experienced coder first separated the responses into independent clauses. For example, “She goes out with friends, and is trying to get back to routine” comprise two distinct thoughts. Then, condition-unaware coders indicated whether each clause portrayed the bereaved person as an active human agent (e.g., <italic>she goes out with friends</italic>) or as a passive recipient of events and others’ actions (e.g., <italic>there’s an ability to go out with friends</italic>). Intercoder agreement was adequate, κ = .89.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261927X12446600">
<title>Cyclical language</title>
<p>Coders recorded the use of cyclical language (e.g., <italic>back to, as before</italic>); although the prompt included the word “return,” use of cyclical terms across conditions was not inevitable. There was adequate agreement (91%, κ = .80) on whether cyclical terms were present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261927X12446600">
<title>Metaphors</title>
<p>Coders assessed responses to the queries of what behaviors were helpful and unhelpful. Germane to the present investigation were spontaneous use of spatiotemporal metaphors that implied forward or upward direction (e.g., <italic>pushing her to move forward</italic>); 90% indicated that forcing forward direction was unhelpful. Coders also noted other spatial metaphors (e.g., <italic>give her space</italic>) that occurred only rarely and the absence of spatial metaphors. Intercoder agreement was adequate at 93.5%, κ = .85.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were entered into separate analyses of variance with prime as the grouping factor; significant effects were followed up with Scheffé contrasts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12446600">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261927X12446600">1</xref></sup> Primes did not influence expectations of immediate affect intensity, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. In contrast, primes influenced duration estimates, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = 3.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .09. A cyclical view of time led to estimations that initially intense negative affect would dissipate in about 6 months, a linear view almost a year, and the static control little more than a year.</p>

<p>Participants’ characterization of recovery had been placed into one of four mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories, and the dichotomous data were entered into separate ANOVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12446600">Lunney, 1970</xref>). Cyclical time predicted an emphasis on the cyclical pattern of daily routine, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = 3.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04, η<sup>2</sup> = .09, and reduced focus on the dissipation of negative affect, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = 6.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003, η<sup>2</sup> = .14, relative to linear time-moving or static control. No effects emerged for views that recovery was impossible, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = 1.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .23, nor for achievement of higher meaning or purpose, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = .65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .52.</p>
<p>The number of clauses that depicted the bereaved person as an active human agent and as a passive recipient of life was entered into separate ANOVAs. The ANOVA on active agency detected no effect of temporal primes, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. To contrast, cyclical primes attenuated the portrayal of passivity, <italic>F</italic>(2, 76) = 4.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .10.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As predicted, a cyclical prime prompted relatively shorter estimates of grief persistence, evoked cyclical language and notions of routine, and undercut characterization of the grieving person as a passive agent. To contrast, the linear prime generally produced patterns similar to the static control (i.e., longer grief persistence, passive agency). Conceivably, bereaved individuals are viewed by default as nonagents, and mourning lends itself to a linear “person stationary” view of time. The notable exception was that the linear prime uniquely evoked linear spatiotemporal metaphors: Participants spontaneously warned against pushing the person to “move forward too quickly.” That spatial primes can influence temporal perceptions is not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12446600">Boroditsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X12446600">McGlone &amp; Harding, 1998</xref>), but only limited empirical work has considered their effect on relatively unconstrained language production (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446600">Ruscher, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study specifically focused on relatively unconstrained descriptions of a (presumably hypothetical) stranger whose child died. As such, it provides insight into how people may speak about or toward others who are in grief. Bereaved individuals often report that others express unhelpful sentiments, including implications that grief should have passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X12446600">Wilsey &amp; Shear, 2007</xref>) or that death no longer is an appropriate discussion topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12446600">Toller, 2005</xref>). Current findings suggest that a linear time-moving perspective is unlikely to underlie such comments. To contrast, because observers primed with cyclical time apparently expect quicker recovery and resumption of routine, they may convey that expectation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12446600">Lehman, Ellard, &amp; Wortman, 1986</xref>). Invocation of cyclical images intended to comfort—rebirth, seasons, platitudes—may or may not have the intended effect.</p>
<p>Given that many social psychological topics involve repetitive events and cyclical patterns, understanding the relation between cyclical time and language might provide fresh insights. Negotiations <italic>end up where they started</italic>, intimate relationships <italic>go in circles</italic>, person perception involves inferences of <italic>consistency</italic> in behavior, and daily stressors prompt exasperation (e.g., <italic>Here we go again</italic>). A pattern’s unpleasantness might be betrayed, in part, by paralinguistic variations such as depressed speech rate or tempo, droning tone, and verbal repetition. (e.g., <italic>We go through this day after day after day</italic>). Verbalizations may signal desire for another pattern (e.g., a new partner or job) or the need for an alternative conception of time (e.g., linear ego-moving or upward spiral). Future research may wish to consider how the experience of cyclical time as positive (i.e., comforting rhythm) versus negative (i.e., routine drudgery) influences perceptions and language.</p>
