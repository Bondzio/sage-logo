<p>Thanks to the efforts and vision of Mark Davison, the previous editor, <italic>Applied Psychological Measurement</italic> (APM) has successfully carried on its role as the foremost source of research in psychological measurement and stood among the most cited journals in the field in the last six years. With this transition of editorial leadership, APM will not only continue the tradition but will also strive to be even better.</p>
<p>Today, more and more talented researchers and practitioners around the world are joining the field of psychological measurement, which greatly empowers the innovations of modern measurement methodologies and their applications into emerging new areas. Moreover, as modern technology that supports and reforms educational and psychological measurement develops at an accelerating speed, an exciting growth and expansion of the field is ready to be witnessed. APM, with its leading voice around the world, will take an active role to support and reflect important cutting-edge research progress and encourage new perspectives that will enrich the field. With these motivations, some changes to the journal will occur, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<sec id="section1-0146621612464945">
<title>Encouraging submissions with new applications</title>
<p>Today we are challenged to formulate new theories and methods for problems such as multidimensional fMRI data analysis, web-based assessment, and measurement for patient reported outcome. At this point, it is vital to encourage submissions that will address new issues for new applications. APM will also try to help authors who have innovative ideas, but whose manuscripts may not initially fall into traditional criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146621612464945">
<title>Encouraging international submissions and subscriptions</title>
<p>Research and applications of modern measurement methodologies are experiencing rapid global development. APM will pioneer the globalization of the field by encouraging and supporting more international submissions and subscriptions. By fostering international communication and uniting wisdom globally, the development of the field will undoubtedly be proliferated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146621612464945">
<title>Encouraging short articles</title>
<p>Quality short articles, such as brief research reports with significance, software review notes that are helpful to relevant researchers and practitioners, and reports of newly emerged computer programs to implement newest methods, are valuable information sources and should be encouraged. Short articles will go through the same peer review process to ensure the quality of the published.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146621612464945">
<title>Brining new members to the Editorial Board</title>
<p>We have invited many emerging leaders in both the operational and the academic world of our field to join the journal’s Editorial Board. The new blood brings in enthusiasm, power, and broadened expertise to the journal. With them, APM will be kept young and vigorous.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for all authors, reviewers, associate editors, and editorial board members, who have been or will be contributing to APM. It is their persistent efforts and talented creativity that brings vitality to the journal and the field.</p>
