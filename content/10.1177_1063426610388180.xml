<abstract>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with poor academic performance, but little is known about learning trajectories and risk factors for poor academic outcomes. This study investigates the relationship between ADHD and academic performance in students with ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 87), students with subclinical ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 23), and matched comparisons (<italic>n</italic> = 112), accounting for exceptional student education (ESE) status. Academic outcomes included reading and math scores on a state-mandated achievement test, the <italic>Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test</italic> (FCAT), grade point averages, retention, and graduation. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and ESE, to test ADHD status as an independent outcome predictor. Students with ADHD received more special education services (53%) than subclinical (26%) and comparison (10%) students (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). ADHD was associated with poorer academic performance on all outcome measures, but only when ESE status was not accounted for. In the longitudinal analysis students with ADHD and special education needs consistently achieved lower FCAT scores than peers in the comparison group but showed comparable learning gains, or slopes, over time. Students without special education needs and gifted students with ADHD had comparable achievement and learning gains as comparison students of the same ESE status. Results suggest that special education status is a driving factor in underachievement among students with ADHD.</p>

<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is estimated to affect between 3% and 7% of the U.S. school-age population, an average of one child in every classroom. Children with ADHD display significant levels of inattentive and hyperactive behaviors leading to functional impairment in at least two live domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610388180">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994</xref>), and as they enter school these core symptoms may manifest as difficulties following teacher directions, inability to sustain attention, careless mistakes, poor organizational skills, and problems completing schoolwork on time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426610388180">Murray et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, it is not surprising that students with ADHD tend to have poorer academic achievement than would be predicted based on intellectual ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610388180">Loe &amp; Feldman, 2007</xref>). Compared to non-ADHD controls, students with ADHD perform significantly below expected levels in reading, writing, and math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610388180">DeShazo Barry, Lyman, &amp; Klinger, 2002</xref>) and, on average, score two thirds of a standard deviation below their peers in reading and math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610388180">Frazier, Youngstrom, Glutting, &amp; Watkins, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several clinical characteristics have been explored to improve the detection of children with ADHD that may be at particularly high risk for poor academic outcomes. Achievement discrepancies may be related to inattentive features of ADHD, as students with this subtype achieve lower reading, spelling, and mathematics scores over time than children with other ADHD subtypes and those without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610388180">Massetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>). Achievement discrepancies and poor academic outcomes in children with ADHD may also signal the presence of a learning disability (LD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426610388180">Faraone, Biederman, Monuteaux, Seidman, &amp; Doyle, 2001</xref>), which are estimated to co-occur in 20% to 30% of children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610388180">Schnoes, Reid, Wagner, &amp; Marper, 2006</xref>). Conversely, among children with LD, prevalence estimates of ADHD range from a low of 16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426610388180">Bussing, Zima, Belin, &amp; Forness, 1998</xref>) to a high of 31% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426610388180">Lopez, Forness, MacMillan, Bocian, &amp; Gresham, 1996</xref>), with others at around 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426610388180">Barkley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426610388180">McConaughy, Mattison, &amp; Peterson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Several longitudinal studies have reported significant relationships between childhood ADHD symptoms and poor academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610388180">Galera, Melchior, Chastang, Bouvard, &amp; Fombonne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610388180">Massetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>). The relationship appears robust because these studies used different methodologies and case ascertainment. For example, prior studies included participants from large, nationally representative U.S. and Canadian samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>), participants from multisite randomized intervention studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>), hospital-based birth cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>), and a nationwide sample of French youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610388180">Galera et al., 2009</xref>). Relationships between ADHD and academic outcomes have been established for studies using different informants, including parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610388180">Galera et al., 2009</xref>) and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>), and were predicted by inattention symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610388180">Galera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>) as well as hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>). In addition, negative academic outcomes have been linked to subclinical symptom levels below those required for an ADHD diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to inform the development of educational interventions for children with ADHD, research is warranted to identify critical time points for intervention. Few if any studies focus on the trajectories of relevant academic achievement parameters or learning slopes, using repeated measures designs. Such studies could inform us (a) whether students with ADHD learn at rates comparable to unaffected peers and (b) whether learning gaps appear to accelerate through the course of their academic careers. Information generated by such studies would provide a first step toward identifying critical time points for intervention. The current study seeks to provide some initial answers to these important questions.</p>
<p>In addition, little is known about how system-level educational factors, such as special education status, may influence the child’s risk for poor academic outcomes if she or he has ADHD. Exceptional student education (ESE) services include special education services for children under the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426610388180">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004)</xref> and gifted education. Among a nationally representative longitudinal sample of U.S. children, improvement in academic achievement related to medication treatment was tempered by special education status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426610388180">Scheffler et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, children in gifted programs may have greater exposure to more intensive instruction. Although IQ has not been found to attenuate the relationship between ADHD and poor academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>), information on access to gifted programs was not assessed. Little is known about predictors of special education identification for children with ADHD, but several studies have indicated that racial/ethnic disparities exist in labeling children with ADHD as either learning disabled or emotionally disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610388180">Mandell, Davis, Bevans, &amp; Guevara, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, special education outcomes appear to vary, such that children classified as emotionally disturbed experience worse outcomes than children served in other special education categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610388180">Anderson, Kutash, &amp; Duchnowski, 2001</xref>). Exploration of how ESE status may influence the relationship between ADHD and academic outcomes is of significance because as of 2007 more than 11% of children ages 6 to 17 receive special education services each year.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between ADHD and academic performance over time in a community-derived diverse sample. We sought to address several of the limitations in the current knowledge base mentioned above. First, we selected children from a diverse longitudinal cohort sample who met criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610388180">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994</xref>) for ADHD or had a specific subclinical ADHD presentation to contribute to the emerging literature on effects of subclinical ADHD presentations on academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610388180">Loe &amp; Feldman, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we obtained academic achievement data from consecutive school years Grades 3 through 10 and could conduct cross-sectional analyses of outcomes at critical grade levels. In Florida, student promotion and graduation are tied to <italic>Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test</italic> (FCAT) results, such that promotion from 3rd to 4th grade requires passing scores in reading and graduation requires passing scores on 10th grade reading and mathematics. Therefore, we chose performance outcomes in Grades 3 (to capture promotion), 6 (to capture middle school performance), and 10 (to capture graduation readiness). Furthermore, the consecutive achievement data allow longitudinal analysis of learning slopes. Last, considering the discrepant reports on the role of specific learning disabilities and giftedness in academic outcomes of students with ADHD, we sought to account for exceptional student special education and gifted status in our analyses. The study has the following specific aims:</p>
<list id="list1-1063426610388180" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Aim 1</italic>: Aim 1 is to describe and compare unadjusted cross-sectional academic performance among a diverse community sample of children with ADHD, children with subclinical ADHD, and a non-ADHD comparison group. Based on the well-documented problems with academic performance exhibited by children with ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610388180">Frazier et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that children with ADHD and subclinical ADHD would exhibit lower academic performance indicators than non-ADHD comparisons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Aim 2</italic>: Aim 2 is to compare cross-sectional academic performance indicators adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and for exceptional education status among a diverse community sample of children with ADHD, children with subclinical ADHD, and a non-ADHD comparison group. Because children with ADHD may differ significantly from controls on factors that are known to be related to academic outcomes, such as gender, socioeconomic status (SES), special education status, and ethnicity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610388180">Schnoes et al., 2006</xref>), it is necessary to control for these factors to isolate effects from ADHD. Consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610388180">Massetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>), we hypothesized that children with ADHD and subclinical ADHD would exhibit lower academic performance indicators than non-ADHD comparisons, after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Only one study has examined the relationship of ADHD and special education status on academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>). This study found that ADHD had a significant effect on academic achievement that was independent of special education status. Thus, we further hypothesized that the relationship between ADHD and cross-sectional academic outcomes would remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and ESE status.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Aim 3</italic>: Aim 3 is to describe and compare learning slopes on reading and math achievement scores between a diverse community sample of children with ADHD or subclinical ADHD and a non-ADHD comparison group over a 10-year period. To our knowledge, no study to date has examined whether there are differences in the rate of achievement between ADHD or subclinical ADHD children and control children. There are, however, indications that when children with ADHD reach middle school they may begin to experience increased problems with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610388180">Langberg et al., 2008</xref>), and students with disruptive behavior disorders are more likely to progress academically at a slower rate than are students with LD. For these reasons we hypothesized that children with ADHD or subclinical ADHD would exhibit slower learning slopes than non-ADHD comparisons on reading and math achievement.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This research uses observational data from a cohort study assessing ADHD detection and service use in a representative sample of elementary school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426610388180">Bussing et al., 2003</xref>). A random sample of 3,158 children, oversampling girls by a factor of two, was derived from public school records of 12,009 kindergarten through fifth grade students from a north Florida school district. Contact could be made with 64% (<italic>n</italic> = 2,035) of the invited sample, and 1,615 consented to complete interviews, yielding a cooperation rate of 79%. Nonparticipants either could not be reached after 10 attempts (<italic>n</italic> = 1,123) or refused to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 420). Of the 1,615 children screened in 1998, 29.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 476) were identified as high risk for ADHD because they (a) were already diagnosed with or treated for ADHD, (b) elicited parent or school concern about behavioral problems thought to be ADHD, or (c) elicited parent or school concern about behavior problems and parent scores on the <italic>Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV</italic> (SNAP-IV), a standardized ADHD screening measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426610388180">Bussing et al., 2008</xref>), were elevated 1.5 standard deviations above the norm.</p>
<p>Between 1998 and 2008, high-risk children participated in several waves of data collection, and for the final outcomes assessment we matched them by gender, race, poverty status, and age with a comparison group of peers classified as low risk in 1998. Inclusion criteria for the this educational outcomes article were (a) parent permission to obtain school district academic records, (b) high-risk students meeting childhood <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for ADHD of any subtype or for childhood subclinical ADHD (defined as having four or five inattentive and/or hyperactive or impulsive <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms), and (c) comparison students did not meet childhood <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD criteria for the full or subclinical syndrome. Thus, students originally categorized as high risk who subsequently did not meet sufficient ADHD symptom criteria were excluded from this article. Other exclusion criteria were (a) receipt of special education services for mental retardation or autism because of diagnostic exclusionary requirements of ADHD diagnoses and (b) receipt of special education services for orthopedic impairment because only 5 students with ADHD were served in this category and the number was too small to support separate analyses. The final study sample of 222 study participants was on average 16.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.3) old at the outcome interview (range = 13.8–20.5 years); they included 111 (50%) females and 77 (35%) African Americans. Also, 120 (54%) received lunch subsidies, an indicator of poverty. Sociodemographic characteristics did not differ by ADHD status. Further information about their sociodemographic characteristics is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610388180">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The study was approved by the university institutional review board and the school district research office. Trained graduate research assistants obtained informed written consent from all parents prior to the start of personal interviews, and with parental permission youth provided written informed assent before participating in interviews. In case adolescents had reached the age of 18 by the interview date, they provided written informed consent rather than assent. Participants received a stipend of $40 (parents) or $30 (adolescents) for their participation. Trained research assistants conducted personal interviews with parents and adolescents in homes, in community locations, or at our research center. With parental permission, we obtained school district records of achievement scores, grade point averages (GPAs), and ESE status. Cumulative records of achievement scores and grades were obtained for the students’ entire school history in the school district, covering kindergarten through high school, amounting to 9 or more years of academic outcome data for more than 80% of students. Unique school identifiers were matched with study identification numbers to create merged data sets that linked academic outcome data with cohort data predictor variables.</p>
<p>School district information. Information about school district characteristics was derived from administrative data sets contained in the Florida School Indicators Report published by the Florida Department of Education and through information obtained from the director of special education. The district has a stable enrollment and over the past 10 years has served on average 28,357 (<italic>SD</italic> = 268) students in 23 elementary schools, 7 middle and 7 high schools, and 6 special educational centers. The district consistently has served a high proportion of students in poverty, with 56% of elementary students, 45% of middle school students, and 46% of high school students receiving free or reduced-price school lunches. These estimates are consistent with the state average. The racial/ethnic composition of school district students is 49% White, 36% African American, 5% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 6% Hispanic. About 18% of students receive special education services and 15% receive services for gifted students. District identification criteria closely mirror federal guidelines.</p>

<title>ADHD diagnosis</title>
<p><italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnoses were assigned based on parental interviews conducted by trained graduate research assistants in clinical or educational psychology with documented reliability in administering the assessments. We used the <italic>Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version 4.0</italic> (DISC-IV) after the screening interview of high-risk students and the <italic>Kiddie-SADS-Present and Lifetime Version</italic> (K-SADS-PL) at the outcomes assessment for the comparison group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426610388180">Kaufman, Birmaher, Brent, Rao, Flynn, Moreci et al., 1997</xref>). We chose the semistructured K-SADS-PL because we considered it more sensitive than the DISC-IV to ascertain lifetime prevalence for ADHD, a condition that may have been outgrown by late adolescence. Based on ADHD symptom counts from the diagnostic interviews, we constructed a three-level ADHD status variable distinguishing ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 87) and subclinical (<italic>n</italic> = 23) <italic>DSM-IV</italic> childhood ADHD from children without ADHD, termed comparison (<italic>n</italic> = 112). The subclinical assignation was made for children who displayed four or five of the nine possible ADHD subtype symptoms. Diagnostic assignments are supported by significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) in mean (<italic>SD</italic>) scores of inattention/hyperactivity teacher SNAP-IV ratings at screening among the ADHD, subclinical, and comparison groups, such that scores of the ADHD and subclinical groups were significantly higher than those of the comparison group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610388180">Table 1</xref> for further details).</p>

<title>ESE status</title>
<p>Information regarding special education status was obtained from the school district record. Exceptional education status was categorized as special education and gifted. The special education category was further divided into (a) emotional/behavioral disabilities, (b) specific learning disabilities, (c) speech/language, and (d) other health impairment/hospital-bound or homebound. To qualify as gifted, students needed to have (a) a measured IQ 2 standard deviations above the mean (130 or 132 on most tests), (b) a majority of characteristics on a district-created gifted checklist, and (c) a need for gifted programming.</p>

<title>Academic Outcomes</title>

<title>Achievement</title>
<p>Starting in 2000, Florida school districts began annually administering the FCAT to all students in Grades 3 to 11. Student promotion and graduation are tied to FCAT results, such that promotion from 3rd to 4th grade requires passing scores in reading and graduation requires passing scores on 10th grade reading and mathematics. From 2000 to 2008, all students in Grades 3–10 were required to take the <italic>FCAT Norm Referenced Test</italic> (NRT); from 2000 to 2004, scores were based on the <italic>Stanford Achievement</italic>; from 2005 to 2008, the NRT portion of the FCAT was based on a custom form of the <italic>Stanford 10</italic>, published by the Psychological Corporation (a division of Pearson; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fcat.fldoe.org/nrinfopg.asp">http://fcat.fldoe.org/nrinfopg.asp</ext-link>). We utilized raw scaled FCAT NRT achievement scores for reading and mathematics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1063426610388180">
<title>GPAs</title>
<p>We calculated unweighted cumulative high school GPA by assigning each high school course grade a point value (A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0) with pluses and minuses ignored. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses were not given added weight. The unweighted cumulative high school GPA was then calculated as the average point value for all of the courses the student completed as a high school student.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1063426610388180">
<title>Retention</title>
<p>The grade retention variable was determined from school records and applied to any student whose record indicated a repeated grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1063426610388180">
<title>Graduation rate</title>
<p>We calculated graduation rate according to the formula used by the Florida Department of Education. Specifically, all students who were in ninth grade at least 4 years prior to the end of the 2007–2008 school year (the last year that we collected school data) and who had not transferred or withdrawn from the school district were considered eligible for graduation. All students who earned a standard, special, or general equivalency diploma were considered to have graduated. The graduation rate was calculated as the percentage of graduation eligible students (<italic>n</italic> = 101) who actually graduated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1063426610388180">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>SAS software (Version 9.2) was used for all data analyses, and we used the default dummy coding in SAS, which allowed us to make group comparisons of interest. The level of significance was set at .05; all tests were two-tailed. Our dependent variables were three continuous variables (reading and math scores, GPA) and two dichotomous outcomes (retention, graduation failure). Our independent variables were ADHD status (ADHD, subclinical ADHD, comparison group), special education services (yes–no), and giftedness (yes–no). We also controlled for three covariates (gender, race, subsidized lunch status) in multivariate models.</p>
<p>For Aim 1 we used χ<sup>2</sup> and ANOVA procedures to examine the relationship between ADHD status and sociodemographic variables as well as academic achievement. Tukey’s multiple comparisons procedure and 2 × 2 χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to investigate how risk groups differed in pairwise comparisons. To quantify effect sizes we calculated Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> for continuous variables and odds ratios (ORs) for categorical variables.</p>
<p>For Aim 2, we conducted a series of regression models to investigate the academic outcomes of GPA, 10th grade reading FCAT, 10th grade math FCAT, retention, and graduation failure. One set of models (Model A) was used to analyze Research Hypothesis 2a; these models included ADHD group status and were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Furthermore, to address Research Hypothesis 2b, whether the relationship between ADHD and school outcomes is confounded by ESE status, we used a second set of regression models (Model B) that included special education services and giftedness as predictors.</p>
<p>Finally, for Aim 3, two longitudinal analyses of repeated FCAT measures for Grades 3 to 10 were conducted using the MIXED procedure to model academic achievement trajectories by ADHD status. For Hypothesis 3a, the longitudinal models included sociodemographic covariates (Model A), and for Hypothesis 3b they included sociodemographics and special education services and giftedness (Model B). An autoregressive covariance structure was used for both model types.</p>
<p>For Aim 3, to further investigate interactions between ADHD status and achievement trajectories, we depicted FCAT reading and math means stratified into 5 groups (ADHD/ special education, ADHD/gifted, ADHD/non, comparison/ non, comparison/gifted). For these final analyses, the ADHD and the subclinical groups were combined to form one ADHD group. To test group differences of the trajectories, we conducted longitudinal analyses using the MIXED procedure and LSMEANS.

<title>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610388180">Table 1</xref>, students in ADHD, subclinical, and comparison groups did not differ in sociodemographic characteristics. At screening, students in ADHD and subclinical groups had significantly higher inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and ODD scores than the comparison group without ADHD, from parent as well as teacher perspectives. Significant score differences between ADHD and subclinical groups were found only for parental inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity ratings, whereas childhood parent ODD ratings and all teacher ratings did not statistically differ between the ADHD and subclinical groups. A different pattern emerged for adolescent symptom ratings. Parent scores of ADHD and disruptive behaviors differed among the three groups, such that adolescents with ADHD received the highest, those with subclinical intermediate, and the comparisons without ADHD the lowest scores.

<title>ESE Status</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610388180">Table 1</xref>, students in the ADHD, subclinical, and comparison groups did not differ in the rate of gifted assignation but did significantly differ (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in their receipt of special education services. Slightly more than one half (53%; <italic>n</italic> = 46) of students with ADHD had received special education services, compared to one quarter of their peers in the subclinical group (26%, <italic>n</italic> = 6) and 10% of the comparison group (<italic>n</italic> = 11). For students in ADHD or subclinical groups special education services mostly addressed specific learning disabilities (32%, <italic>n</italic> = 28 and 22%, <italic>n</italic> = 5, respectively), whereas comparisons without ADHD most frequently received special education services for speech or language delays (10%, <italic>n</italic> = 11).

<title>Aim 1: ADHD and Unadjusted Cross-Sectional Academic Performance Outcomes</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610388180">Table 2</xref> summarizes the cross-sectional findings of four important academic outcomes, namely FCAT testing scores, high school GPA, grade retention rates, and failure to graduate. We selected FCAT reading and math scores for three critical time points, namely 3rd grade (where FCAT scores determine promotion to 4th grade), 6th grade (signaling the beginning of middle school), and 10th grade (where passing FCAT scores are required for graduation). Students in the ADHD group did not differ from subclinical or comparison groups on their 3rd grade FCAT reading or math scores but scored lower than comparisons for both topics at 6th and 10th grade testing. Furthermore, they fared significantly worse academically than comparisons on all other academic outcomes. Of students in the ADHD group, 28% experienced graduation failure compared to 9% of comparisons (OR = 3.9). Differences in graduation failure reached only a trend level of significance (<italic>p</italic> = .0578), but our graduation variable was applicable to only 101 study participants, limiting our power to detect statistically significant differences. Academic outcomes of students in the subclinical group could not be distinguished from those in the ADHD group or from comparisons. Further details of the results of comparison testing and effect size estimates are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610388180">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Model A shows that after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, ADHD remained an independent predictor for all academic outcomes, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426610388180">Table 3</xref>. Compared to unaffected students, ADHD was associated with lower GPA scores (−0.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and lower FCAT reading (−14.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and math scores (−19.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); it nearly tripled the odds of grade retention (OR = 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3–5.8) and increased the odds of graduation failure nearly fivefold (OR = 4.9, 95% CI = 1.3–18.7). Compared to unaffected students, subclinical ADHD was associated with two adverse academic outcomes, lowered FCAT reading scores (−23.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and quadrupled odds of grade retention (OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.4–13.8).</p>
<p>Model B shows that ADHD did not independently predict academic outcomes after accounting for special education status and giftedness. However, compared to unaffected students, subclinical ADHD remained a predictor of grade retention (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.1–10.98). Receipt of special education services was associated with lower FCAT reading scores (−17.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and increased risk of grade retention (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1–5.8), whereas giftedness was associated with higher GPA (0.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and higher reading (18.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and math (38.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) FCAT scores.</p>

ESE students without ADHD are not included because of their low sample size. This approach yielded five comparison groups for statistical analysis. The figures also show the school district average scores, obtained from the Florida Department of Education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fcat.fldoe.org/results/default.asp">http://fcat.fldoe.org/results/default.asp</ext-link>); however, district scores were not part of the statistical analysis. Statistical significance testing confirmed that students with ADHD plus special education performed worse than the four other groups in reading and math throughout all grades, whereas gifted students with ADHD, like their gifted peers without ADHD, performed better than the remaining groups. Finally, students with ADHD without special education or giftedness performed similar to unaffected peers of the same special education and gifted status.</p>
<p>To determine whether learning slopes of students in the ADHD group differ from those in the comparison group, longitudinal modeling was conducted and results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1063426610388180">Table 4</xref>. In Model A, which does not account for special education or gifted status, ADHD was associated with lower intercepts in reading and math but not with differences in slopes. In other words, students with ADHD consistently achieved lower FCAT scores than peers in the comparison group but showed comparable learning gains over time. In Model B, which accounted for special education and gifted, ADHD status no longer was independently associated with achievement scores. Instead, special education status was associated with lower and giftedness with higher achievement scores in reading and in math. For reading, giftedness was also associated with relatively smaller learning gains over time compared to nongiftedness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study are consistent with previous reports that children with ADHD have poorer educational outcomes than unaffected peers, including lower levels of academic achievement, lower high school GPA, and higher retention rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610388180">Breslau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie &amp; Stabile, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610388180">DeShazo Barry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610388180">Galera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610388180">Loe &amp; Feldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610388180">Massetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426610388180">Molina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610388180">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>), confirming Hypotheses 1 and 2a. However, contrary to Hypotheses 2b and 3b, in analyses adjusting for exceptional education status, ADHD status no longer independently predicted academic outcomes. We further discuss these results and their implications below.</p>
<p>Effects sizes for reading (0.4) and math achievement scores (0.6 to 0.7) in our study are comparable to those reported in meta-analysis of academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610388180">Frazier et al., 2007</xref>). Our cross-sectional analysis reveals achievement differences across groups at 6th and 10th grades but not in 3rd grade; this may be the result of lower variability in achievement at the 3rd grade level. Our findings suggest that academic difficulties manifest early and the gap between ADHD and unaffected peers widens by middle school. The ADHD group also obtained lower high school GPA scores than the comparison group. The academic performance differences at the middle and high school grade levels may be related to increasing demands on students’ individual responsibility to prepare for academic instruction (e.g., bring necessary materials, complete assigned readings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610388180">Gureasko-Moore, Dupaul, &amp; White, 2006</xref>) and may be related to the transition to the junior high school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610388180">Langberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between ADHD status and grade retention appears complex. In our unadjusted analyses both ADHD and subclinical groups had more than twice the odds of comparison peers to be retained; only the ADHD group estimate was statistically significant, likely reflecting the smaller size of the subclinical group. Both the ADHD and subclinical groups were significantly more likely to be retained than comparisons after we adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Subclinical group status also significantly predicted grade retention even when we accounted for ESE status. We hypothesize that elevated retention rates in the subclinical group may be the result of the fact that fewer of them received special education services. This is consistent with other reports that additional educational services can lower the chances of retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426610388180">Bauermeister et al., 2007</xref>). A similar pattern emerged for graduation failure. Both clinical and subclinical groups were more than twice as likely to experience graduation failure. We would caution that power was low for testing both retention and graduation failure. Despite the lack of statistical significance in some analyses, the elevated risk of adverse academic outcomes for the subclinical group is a matter of concern. Our findings suggest that even when a child does not manifest sufficient number of symptoms to meet <italic>DSM-IV</italic> standards for an ADHD diagnosis, there is still an elevated risk of academic underachievement. Yet absent an ADHD diagnosis these students may not qualify for special education services unless they have other qualifying conditions, such as learning disabilities. These children, however, could be eligible for services under Section 504 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610388180">Reid &amp; Katsiyannis, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the rate of academic progress or learning slopes for students with ADHD has not been described in previous studies. Knowledge about learning slopes is important because if students with ADHD progressed academically at a slower rate than their peers, their risk for academic disadvantage would progressively worsen over time and place them at increasing risk for adverse social and career outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610388180">Schnoes et al., 2006</xref>). There is evidence that suggests students with externalizing behavior disorders do not progress academically at the same rate as other students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426610388180">Coutinho, 1986</xref>); thus, it is important to determine whether ADHD also similarly adversely affects academic progress. Results of this study showed that there was no difference in achievement slopes for either the ADHD or the subclinical group when gender, race, and SES were controlled, even though both the clinical and subclinical groups had lower intercepts on the math and reading measures. This finding is encouraging as it suggests that the clinical and subclinical groups did not fall progressively further behind as their academic career proceeded. Of note, even though the ADHD ESE group had the lowest intercept achievement scores, their learning slopes did not differ from other groups, suggesting that the ESE services they received were beneficial.</p>
<p>More than one half of the clinical group had an ESE assignation. This finding is consistent with previous research showing high rates of ESE among students with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426610388180">Reid, Maag, Vasa, &amp; Wright, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610388180">Schnoes et al., 2006</xref>). One surprising result was the importance of accounting for ESE status when examining academic outcomes of students with ADHD, a finding that contrasts with other studies of educational outcomes associated with ADHD that controlled for specific learning disabilities. DeShazo Barry (2002) found that children with ADHD exhibited a significant discrepancy between predicted and actual achievement even in the absence of specific learning disabilities and that ADHD symptom severity was a good predictor of academic underachievement. However, DeShazo’s findings are limited by nonrepresentative sampling and a very small sample size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610388180">Currie and Stabile (2006)</xref> analyzed large, representative Canadian and U.S. data sets and reported negative effects of hyperactivity scores on achievement test scores and schooling attainment, even after excluding students who had specific learning disabilities. Like many large survey studies, Currie and Stabile did not assign <italic>DSM-IV</italic> based ADHD diagnoses or test for learning disabilities but constructed a hyperactivity score from parent and teacher reports and assigned LD diagnoses per parent report. This approach likely yielded considerable false negative rates because less than 3% of their U.S. sample was reported to have learning disabilities, limiting study conclusions about the role of learning disabilities in academic outcomes associated with ADHD. When ESE status, which represents more than the presence of learning disabilities, is controlled in our study, we find no significant differences for reading or math achievement, high school GPA scores, retention, and graduation failure by ADHD status, with the exception of retention rates for the subclinical group, already discussed above. Our findings are not the result of disproportionate numbers of ESE in the clinical group because similar results are obtained when contrasting non-ESE clinical and comparison groups. In addition, there was no appreciable difference in non-ESE clinical group scores from the county average. Thus, ESE status rather than ADHD appears to be the factor that is responsible for differences in adverse academic outcomes in this study cohort. Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426610388180">Faraone et al., 2001</xref>), the combination of ADHD and ESE status appears to predict the greatest risk for adverse academic outcomes. It is important to keep in mind that assigned ESE status or placement does not indicate which services a student received. Furthermore, little is known about what predicts whether children with ADHD and academic problems get labeled as having learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, or other health impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610388180">Mandell et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first study to report longitudinal data on gifted children with ADHD in the public schools. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of giftedness across the groups, and the subclinical group had exactly the same proportion of gifted students as the comparison group. This finding was surprising as there is some evidence that on average IQ is lower for ADHD groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610388180">Frazier, Demaree, &amp; Youngstrom, 2004</xref>). Both clinical and comparison group gifted students demonstrated higher levels of achievement than nongifted peers, and there were no differences in slope between gifted groups. This is encouraging as it suggests that gifted ADHD students are not underachieving relative to their unaffected peers. However, there is still cause for concern as there is evidence that high IQ does not inoculate students with ADHD from school-related problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610388180">Antshel et al. (2007)</xref> found that students with ADHD and a high IQ were more likely to have repeated grades, needed more academic supports, and had more comorbid psychopathology compared to high IQ peers without ADHD.</p>
<p>Study findings have to be considered within several study limitations. First, although our sample is representative of the school district, our data collection was conducted in one southeastern school district, and our findings may not generalize to other geographic areas. The school district’s demographic composition included fewer than 5% of students of Hispanic origin and races other than Caucasian or African American, restricting the sample’s racial/ethnic diversity. Second, our ESE variable was based on school district classifications of ESE and gifted without verification by our own psychoeducational testing; therefore, we may have underestimated the presence of learning disabilities and giftedness in our sample. Third, the analysis of graduation rates was restricted to the 101 students who would have qualified for high school graduation by the end of our data collection, limiting our power to detect statistically significant differences. Finally, because of the longitudinal nature of our study and the repeated school changes as cohort children aged, we did not adjust for school characteristics as a potential confounder of academic outcomes.</p>
<p>Our results confirm the risk of poor educational outcomes associated with ADHD, and they also indicate that special education status is a driving factor in underachievement. This suggests that students with special education diagnoses and ADHD should be targeted for early and intensive educational interventions. In addition, interventions should be sensitive to how ADHD affects learning. For example, children with ADHD often have deficits in working memory that are related to inattentive behavior and executive function deficits that are associated with increased likelihood of special education status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426610388180">Alloway, Gathercole, Kirkwood, &amp; Elliott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610388180">Diamantopoulou, Rydell, Thorell, &amp; Bohlin, 2007</xref>). Interventions should be sensitive to these deficits and incorporate techniques that have been shown to be effective with students with ADHD such as scaffolded instruction and self-regulation strategies that directly address these difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426610388180">Reid, Trout, &amp; Schartz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610388180">Rogevich &amp; Perin, 2008</xref>). In addition, educators should be sensitive to changing demands placed on students in the middle school environment. Students with ADHD will likely need assistance with organizational skills and classroom skills such as note taking to successfully transition to junior high or high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610388180">Gureasko-Moore et al., 2006</xref>). Schools should develop early, ongoing, and systemic programming to deal with the needs of students with ADHD (both clinical and subclinical) who have comorbid disorders that affect learning. Together, these findings suggest that interventions to promote academic success for children with ADHD should be targeted at both the individual and system levels, taking account of special education status while adapting instructional approaches.</p>
