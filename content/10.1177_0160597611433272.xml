<abstract>
<p>Utilizing a “layered” account that overlies personal experience with feminist, sociological, and pedagogical theory, this article explores the material reality of student mentors assisting in college-level courses offered in a prison site to incarcerated women. The authors present analyses of their developing understandings of theory-in-action as they engaged in symbolic interactions within the carceral environment. The authors offer reflective representations of their experiences mentoring incarcerated women and they explicate a variety of epistemological positions. The article draws attention to structural boundaries and barriers, both physical and emotional; to the construction and maintenance of “safe” classroom space; and to mirror reflections, that is, to seeing self in the “other.”</p>

<p>These directives are the repetitive exercises upon our entry into our fellow students’ world: that is, the world of college classes in a Michigan state women’s prison. We, the student authors of this article, were all members of the Women in Learning and Leadership (WILL) program at the University of Michigan–Dearborn, a program that encourages our participation as community leaders. Through WILL, we were expected to choose the means and methods of our learning and leadership; we chose to mentor incarcerated women taking the college-level classes initiated by Dr. Lempert and offered by instructors from the university. Christina LaRose mentored in an Introduction to African American Literature course, Laura Freeman mentored in a Social Problems class, and Lesia Liss mentored in an Introduction to Women’s Studies course. Because it is against the law in the State of Michigan to offer college-level courses to inmates at taxpayer expense, our professors volunteer their time and expertise to provide these educational opportunities to women “inside.” As student mentors, we were also volunteers.</p>
<p>Our article discusses sociological, feminist, and pedagogical theory as enacted in these classes. As our initial expectations gave way to the reality of our on-going experiences inside, we were changed and challenged. We grew, matured, and learned, as we became more analytically aware through interactions with our incarcerated peers. We came in wanting to change the prison system; we still want that. But through the mentoring process, we also experienced the importance of building learning communities with women inside, of a respect for the process of intelligent thinking, and of the importance of helping ourselves and other women find the language necessary to critically examine opportunities and obstacles in the lives of differentially situated women. In this article we present analyses of our developing understandings of theory-in-action (Bunch 1987) as we engaged in symbolic interactions within this prison environment. These are our reflections.</p>
<p>Consequently, our voices direct the narrative of this article. We do not present the voices of incarcerated female students. We do, however, convey <italic>our</italic> observations about the women’s words and reported experiences. We acknowledge that our impressions may be both imprecise and subject to what Margolis (1970) called “ascribing motives,” that is, we are interpreting the women’s actions from our own frames of reference. We also recognize that developing an analysis through the voices of these incarcerated women might seem most appropriate, nonetheless, we chose not to do so for a number of reasons. First, the Michigan Department of Corrections and the university Institutional Review Board prohibit use of inmate course materials/productions for research and/or publication without the specific consent of each woman enrolled in the classes. Second, some women come to these classes unable to believe their good fortune and sure that they are part of a research experiment. Using their work, or their reactions/responses to course material, would constitute a violation of assurances to them that they are students, not subjects, in these classes. Third, imprisoned women are subject to all manner of personal violations endemic to incarceration. For them, as for others, safe spaces are integral to the meaningful expression of missing discourses (Fine 1988), their own and others, particularly so in the dispossessing environment of the prison. The university classes in which we mentored were intended to be such “safe spaces” (Richardson 1997). Finally, we cannot speak with the authority that belongs to the women. Our representations would necessarily be truncated interpretations of their intentions. As students ourselves, we are just not qualified to speak their meanings. We can only speak <italic>our</italic> meanings.</p>
<p>Consequently, this article offers our reflections on mentoring experiences as we assisted in the delivery of these college level courses to incarcerated women. Our discussions are informed by sociological, feminist, and pedagogical theory. In our presentation, we “layer” our accounts, alternating our subjective experiences and introspections with “objective” layers of analysis (Ronai 1992, 1995) to illustrate both theory and its impressionistic elements.</p>

<title>The Context</title>
<p>Since 2003 Dr. Lempert has been offering and coordinating college level courses to women incarcerated at a local Michigan state prison. Although taught on site in the prison, these are the same courses with the same requirements as those taught at the university. Since 2003 over 350 incarcerated women have completed at least one of the courses, that is, they have successfully fulfilled all of the requirements of a college-level course, including readings, papers, exams, group work, and projects. The course offerings have covered a range of academic disciplines reflecting varied faculty expertise. Faculty have been invited to participate on the basis of their reputations as instructors who value analysis and critical thinking, and their interest in social justice (broadly defined). Most of the instructors have come from the Women’s and Gender Studies Program as well as the Social and Behavioral Sciences Department, particularly the disciplines of sociology, history, African American studies, and anthropology.</p>
<p>Women in the prison where we mentored reflected the demographics of incarcerated women across the country. Research in Michigan and elsewhere has long demonstrated that disproportionate numbers of female inmates are undereducated. At the time of our mentoring, 46.2 percent of the women at this prison had not completed high school. Most women in the nation’s jails/prisons come from economically disadvantaged African American and Latino communities (Camp and Camp 2000); 51.1 percent of the women incarcerated at this facility were African American, 1.3 percent were Native American, and 1.3 percent were Latinas (MDOC Corrections Management Information Systems 2004). Conservative estimates suggest that between 30 percent and 60 percent of incarcerated women have experienced sexual abuse prior to being incarcerated (Flavin 2009). Although we do not know the percentage of women in this facility who were violated, Lesia, the mentor in Women’s Studies, notes that the women frequently described taken-for-granted gendered violence in the reading response journals they wrote for each class session. In their contemplations of the assigned readings, some also considered their personal and collective “pathways to prison” (Richie 1996):<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: Violence, abuse, incest, rape, prostitution were some of the reoccurring themes and experiences the women had prior to their imprisonment. Some spoke of their juvenile delinquencies, their first “trouble with the law,” running away from home and ending up unimaginably in worse situations.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Their journal entries anecdotally validate the national statistics.</p>
<p>The following sections detail our own pathways to prison and our experiences as mentors to these “forgotten women” (Lempert et al. 2005).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0160597611433272">
<title>When and Where We Entered As Mentors?</title>
<p>Our university mission statement promotes experiential learning and the skills and knowledge necessary for active citizenship and leadership (UM Dearborn Mission Statement 2004). Faculty members consequently designed the “prison courses” to include mentoring opportunities for WILL students that would link university community outreach to the correctional facility. Christina, the mentor in African American Literature, explains how this connection occurred for her:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: I come from a working class background but I love the academic world of literature and critical thought. While organizing an Amnesty International Chapter [on campus], I became very aware of neglected imprisoned populations. After becoming involved with the Women’s Clemency Program in Michigan, I wanted to reach out to these populations in my own community, and this program provided a way for me to do that.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>An activist already, Christina refocused her advocacy through this mentoring opportunity. Experiential learning, like the WILL program, aims to enhance academic training. It provides opportunities for university undergraduates to develop strategies of inquiry that challenge the accumulations of passive, classroom information, what Freire (1997:56) calls “the banking concept of education.” Working with women in prison provided us with occasions to transform inert theory into feminist practice. Unlike Christina, a seasoned, young, feminist activist, Lesia was new to feminism when she began mentoring. Assisting in teaching as a form of activism, however, became central to her burgeoning concept of herself as a feminist (Bailey 2001):<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: As a returning student to UM–Dearborn I did not know that a Women’s Studies program even existed. I spent my life in the traditional female occupation of nursing. After completing Introduction to Women’s Studies, I had knowledge about women’s issues in society and more confidence in myself. I wish I had learned this information earlier in my life and I relished the chance to share in empowering other women.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lesia’s pathway to prison mentoring reflects the structure and culture of the Women’s and Gender Studies Program. She learned to connect the personal to the political by linking theory to activism on behalf of imprisoned women.</p>
<p>The effects of these links extend beyond our own personal changes. Mentors in this program participate in offering quality educational opportunities that, during and after prison, have enormous benefits for the women involved, their families, and their communities. College courses build a “tool kit” for transformation and responsibility that incarcerated women take with them as they leave the facility and return to their homes and families (Fine et al. 2001). Those women who receive a college education, or who begin the degree process while in prison, fare better when they rejoin society than those who do not (Fine et al. 2001; Vacca 2004). The critical thinking and analytical skills explored in college level classes also assist women in assessing how the structural conditions of their preincarceration (and postrelease) lives connect their private troubles to the larger public issues (Mills 1959) of gender inequality, educational stratification, economic marginalization, and violence.</p>
<p>Laura, mentor in a Social Problems class, came to mentoring as a consequence of her own life experiences and her personal transformation from an abused woman to an honors student in sociology. She recalls a lesson she offered to help the women in class begin their own interpretive processes:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: Becoming part of this program was a chance for me to utilize the “Sociological Imagination” that had been such an integral part of my personal transformation from a battered wife to an honor student in Sociology. One day I drew a gridded cube on the board to represent social structures like class and education and I asked the students to imagine how hard it is to understand why you’re stuck on the bottom unless you learn how to back away and see the whole picture.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Laura presented a potential frame for the women to use in deepening their understandings of their own lived experiences, that is, a matrix analysis in which they could situate themselves (Collins 1990). Without the tools of structure and agency so central to sociological analysis, incarcerated women can remain locked in self-defeating narratives of personal responsibility that ignore the constraints of impoverished contexts. Like their prison custodians, our incarcerated student peers often seem to interpret their circumstances through an individual frame and blame themselves for their imprisonment. Certainly, they made bad choices. Yet, like Laura’s abuse, their personal biographies are also located in wider social contexts that remain invisible when their crimes are blamed on their personal failings.</p>
<p>Baron (2000), a social psychologist, provides an analytical frame for understanding the influential role of prison discourse in women’s judgments of themselves. Baron’s work on extreme groups suggests that the powerful influence of these groups over members can be understood in terms of rendering recruits incapable of thinking carefully or systematically about themselves or their circumstances. We see the same process in this environment where our student peers are required to unquestioningly accept the prison staff’s rules and definitions of them (Jewkes 2005; Owen 1998; Ross and Richards 2003). In prison parlance the women become “prisonized,” when they accept the beliefs, definitions, and rules of the institution unquestioningly. Baron argues that such indoctrination involves multiple stages. In the first stage, new recruits, or in this case inmates, are isolated from friends and family to cut them off from their former lives and put them into situations where they are receptive to the institution’s message. In the next stage, recruits/inmates are asked to acquiesce to the demands of the institution, to overtly “play the role” (Mead 1934) of the new member/inmate. Internalization quickly follows and public compliance is replaced by inner acceptance (Baron 2000).</p>
<p>Without analyses that challenge prison discourse, women struggle to maintain narratives that counter prison definitions of them as unworthy. These women, with a lot of “street sense” but very little analytical training, often lacked the networks of information and the skills necessary for framing an alternative analysis. Laura dexterously challenged the influential, carceral definitional processes when she offered the women her analysis of the marginality of both abused women and women prisoners. She redefined them as agents of knowledge. She illustrated the means by which analysis could help locate their individual choices within a “matrix of domination” (Collins 1990). By demonstrating how the women could redefine themselves when they understood the “whole picture” of race, gender, and class oppression, Laura modeled the ways that analytical skills could assist them in disrupting the prison’s controlling narrative and in thinking critically about their lives and present circumstances, as well as the ways that their marginality also created useful knowledge.</p>
<p>Moving from the context of the classes and our personal journeys into prison mentoring, the remaining sections of this article will explicate a variety of our epistemological positions. We will draw attention to the structural boundaries and barriers that we encountered as mentors; to the feminist construction and maintenance of “safe” classroom space within the carceral environment; and to our mirror reflections, that is, to the ways that we so often saw ourselves in the incarcerated “other.”</p>

<title>Boundaries and Barriers: Physical Barriers</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: The prison’s orientation session felt like a day out of Kafka’s “The Trial.” We had been told it would last one or, at the most, two hours, but the new orientation officer kept us waiting for hour after hour, and then told us we would need to complete another full day of training. Some of the professors left in disgust, but I kept trying to follow the rules and make sense of his escalating demands. After a while I started to feel like the officer was making up rules as he went along.</p>
<p>What bothered me the most was the derisive way he talked about the prisoners. It reminded me of why women whose husbands beat them didn’t want to involve the authorities: we want to avoid the stigma of “abused wife.” As he kept warning us about the way “they” were, the training officer ended up making me sympathize with the inmates. When I left that day I kept thinking about those who were still stuck there behind the barbed wire.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To volunteer as mentors at the prison, we were required to participate in an orientation covering such relevant topics as safety issues and prison rules, responsibilities, and expectations, as well as such framing topics as manipulation, deception, and the “conning strategies” of inmates. For the prison administration charged with keeping us safe, the orientation information is essential. It is designed to familiarize us with administrative expectations and practices and to warn us about possible inappropriate interactions with inmates. In essence, this session was intended to familiarize us with the do’s and don’t’s of prison engagement and to remind us that we are “guests” in the prison subject to prison rules.</p>
<p>Prisons, by definition, are environments that secure the safety of the citizenry by isolating and confining lawbreakers. They meet deep societal needs by reaffirming that justice has been done and dangerous criminals have been removed from public space. The site for our classes, a former men’s prison, was a multicustody security level facility for women of all ages. It housed upward of 850 women and served as the reception center for all newly sentenced female prisoners in Michigan. Security on site included two 12 foot chain link fences with concertina wire, an electronic perimeter detection system, electrically powered gates to isolate each wing in the housing units, and a perimeter road that surrounded the facility and that was constantly surveyed by armed staff in a patrol vehicle. The administrative emphasis was consistently on “security.” The physical environment alone was daunting evidence of our tenuous roles in prison hierarchies.</p>
<p>The legitimate concerns of the facility administration, however, were offset by the “hidden agenda,” or perhaps just the incompetence, of the Orientation Officer. Instead of a rational program, the instructors and mentors were oriented to the arbitrary, petty, capricious, and idiosyncratic power and authority of officers in total institutions. In prisons correctional officers have total power; the lives of inmates are regulated and dictated by limitations imposed by institutional rules. “Security” is omnirelevant in prison space.</p>
<p>Although our experience lasted only a few hours, it served as an initiation into the ubiquity of powerlessness that our imprisoned student peers live with on a daily basis. We experienced directly the contradiction that Goffman (1961:74) identified as the context of correctional officers’ work activity. Total institutions, like prisons, are “storage dumps for inmates” but they present themselves as rational organizations consciously designed to produce officially approved outcomes. The orientation for volunteers is part of the rational organization presentation; the conduct of the orientation, however, was irrational and produced the unintended consequence of arousing our sympathies and sensitivities to the daily environment of our students. Laura reiterated the empathic link forged for her through the stigmatization that connects abused women with incarcerated women. She saw her abuse experiences refracted through the imprisoned “other.”</p>
<p>Much of the language of the orientation session focused on “security.” “Security” is ethereal in prison. It is an omnirelevant phrase that defines <italic>every</italic> activity and action within the prison. It underscores <italic>all</italic> explanations and is offered as the justification for <italic>any</italic> restrictive treatment of our student peers. Security appeared to be about more than our safety, as Lesia noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: The rules were presented as being enforced to protect the visitors, the volunteers. I soon realized that they were also in place to control the women, to treat them inhumanely, to show no care or concern. We [instructors and mentors] were to remain impersonal and [uninvolved] during class. There were constant reminders of the fact that this was no ordinary class, this was a prison and we were to act accordingly and to abide by the rules or we would be permanently dismissed.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lesia’s comments illustrate the ways that we were all—incarcerated students and “free” mentors/instructors—subject to the same control structures and authority while we were in the facility. As our student peers were constantly reminded of their status as prisoners, we were constantly reminded of the limits of our roles as educators in the prison. Our student peers were present as the subjects of the state; we were present as “guests” through the permission of the warden. Correctional officers reminded us frequently that the permission could at any time, for any reason, be withdrawn. It was intimidating. The expectation that we might, unknowingly or naively, commit a “security violation” that would end the program was ever-present. Lesia continues as she remembers the orientation lessons and her first class:<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: Once I crossed the threshold [of the prison] the transformation occurred. I was no longer in the free world. I was among prisoners and, according to my orientation officer, I was never to let my guard down, never to reveal any personal information about myself, never to give the prisoners anything that they could later use to bargain amongst themselves, and I was never to interact with any of them. The restrictions were too many to list and I was sure that I would fail.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These “security” reminders were the constant context of our experiences. At each arrival on site, for example, we were subject to multiple surveillance and security procedures. Christina describes the second stage of the security process that opened this article:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: “Gate A,” the officer announces as he ushers us from the lobby and into the plexi-glass “bubble.” I empty my loose change and keys from my pocket, clink the items into a plastic jar, and hesitantly step through the metal detector for the pat down.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what to do with the PPD—personal protection device—I’m required to carry—it's bulky, the metal clasp claws into my skin, and there is no effective way to hide it. I decide to slip mine over my belt and tug the bottom of my blazer down. We make our way down a narrow winding hallway. We show our ID cards to the officer, wait until he opens the gate to the compound, and walk to the education building for our evening class.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Heading to class, the security checks require that we allow at least half an hour to traverse a distance we could walk in 5 minutes in our own environments. These physical barriers create the distinct awareness that we are entering a new, separate, alien world where familiar rules and stable expectations no longer apply. The “rules” appeared to us to be arbitrarily enforced, for example, sometimes we were asked to itemize materials we were bringing in, other times not; sometimes we had to remove our shoes and socks, other times not; our ears and mouths would be checked for contraband, but our coats, jackets, and sweatshirts were not; sometimes pat downs were thorough, other times brusque and inconsequential; and so on.</p>
<p>Additionally the uncertainty of the seemingly idiosyncratic calling forth of new “rules,” or reinterpretations of old rules, by correctional officers in the interests of “security” often resulted in our feeling helpless and/or disoriented. We knew how to be students; we even knew how to be mentors, but we did not know how to be persons without autonomy and common sense. Correctional officers challenged use of classroom space, educational interactions, and sometimes even student seating arrangements. Lessons were continuously interrupted by the omnipresent loudspeakers: <italic>Jones 123456 report to housing unit, Jones 123456 report to housing unit…Clark telephone line two, Clark telephone line two…open sally port; open sally port.</italic>
</p>
<p>Although we understand that some of these barriers are a necessary part of prison, which by definition is a removal and isolation venue, as Lesia notes, even the conduct of our classes does not allow escape from what Lorna Rhodes (2001:66) described as the “prison’s disciplinary orbit”:<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: Not once did the classroom feel like the one that took place on campus, there were too many interruptions and reminders that—class or no class—these women were prisoners, and they were controlled and distracted at all times. Frequently women were called out of the classroom for medications. They had to ask permission to go to the bathroom, a room with a glass wall where the stalls had no doors and the cement block side walls just covered a little above the waist. We[instructor and mentor] were reprimanded for turning off the lights during the showing of a film by the guard who stayed immediately outside the classroom door. He made it known that he was the one who was really in charge.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The correctional officers defined our space and interactions in the prison; like our student peers, we were subject to their authority. The instability was constant even though we knew that we had the safety of exiting the compound in a few hours and regaining our personal independence. For our student peers, personal autonomy is alien in this environment, and personal privacy is a luxury denied. We became concerned about the profound and disturbing effects of objectification and stigmatization on them. As Goffman (1961) noted many years ago, the lack of privacy and control results in a sense of role dispossession and personal violation—or a sense of contamination—especially when male guards are managing female prisoners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597611433272">1</xref>
</sup> Many of the classroom journal entries and personal reaction papers of our mentored peers spoke of these losses. They would recall wistfully the last time that they showered in private, or could lock a door and simply be alone, without noise and without the continuous interruptions of public speaker announcements: <italic>Walkway closed. Walkway is now closed. Walkway closed.</italic>
</p>
<p>As intrusive as the mutable barriers separating the “inside” from the “outside” were for us to deal with, we were always aware that they have a much greater significance for our student peers, whose very lives have been “shaped and coded” (Goffman 1961:18) by the process of entry into the machinery of the institution. “The barrier that the total institutions place between the inmate and the wider world marks the first curtailment of self” (Goffman 1961:24; Law 2009) for the women who are students in these classes and for those of us who mentor them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0160597611433272">
<title>Boundaries and Barriers: Social Barriers</title>
<p>In <italic>Total Institutions, </italic>Erving Goffman (1961) argues that a central characteristic of encompassing institutions like prisons is that they handle the many human needs of whole blocks of people through bureaucratic organization. In prison, individuality is erased and prisoners are roused and treated and transported in analogous bunches, like widgets. Consequently, our student peers treasured individualized responses—being called by their first names, being warmly greeted as they entered the class, chatting with them on breaks about their lives, making specific comments on their work, and even grades that they received in classes. We came to appreciate that simply treating our student peers as individuals, instead of as part of a homogenized and controlled group, was part of what made us, and the college classes, unique and valuable to them within the carceral environment.</p>
<p>These mundane (for us) acts of interaction challenged established prison social boundaries of “us” and “them.” At our orientation, we were alerted to the staff-inmate division that is the ultimate, impermeable barrier between “us” and “them.” The intensity of these bifurcations was often a revelation for us. We noted with interest what these interactions looked like in practice, as Laura notes in a particular instance:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: Once we had class scheduled for a different day than our usual meeting time. We were all talking before class and waiting for the professor when someone mentioned that “Thomas” was coming and there was a collective groan and things got quiet. The guard strutted into the room and he pointed to a couple of students asking where their “blues” (blue button-up prison shirts) were. I wondered what the problem was because the women often wore regulation white t-shirts to class, but this guard made them go “by the book” and class was delayed while the students had to go back to their rooms to change their shirts.</p>
<p>“He’s the worst, but they're all that way,” the women explained to me. “That’s what they’re like, they just like to hassle us for nothing.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Warned continuously by the staff and through our orientation experiences that the inmates were dangerous and deceitful, we were also frequently told by students that the guards were bullies and petty control freaks. Typically, as prison researchers have noted (Author 2005; Goffman 1961; Jewkes 2005; Law 2009; Owen 1998; Rhodes 2001; Watterson 1996) and as we observed, inmates felt the guards were arrogant, arbitrary and mean, and the guards treated the inmates as untrustworthy, manipulative and morally inferior.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate results of this “us” and “them” split is the debilitating effect it has on inmates’ self respect, sense of personal identity, and trust. In an environment characterized by disrespect and derision, where the uses (and abuses) of power and authority appear idiosyncratic and unpredictable, as Lesia recalls, our student peers were suspicious about our motives:<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: Day one was particularly tense. After having been through a thorough inspection by security (shoes and socks off, frisked, tongues out) we found ourselves in a room filled with approximately forty prisoners. We were forewarned [by a guard] that the women at the table near the front of the class were from a locked down control unit. The room was filled with fear. The security guards outside the classroom escalated our fear. We were instructed to fear them [the students] and they feared us as well. We later found out that they believed that they were part of some kind of experiment. They could not believe that someone would actually volunteer their time, or as one woman put it “waste their time on me.” The low self-esteem, low self worth was evident in every single journal [all term long].</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The women had no reason to trust our assurances. These classes <italic>were</italic> in a way social “experiments” for all of us. The environment was new and challenging for the faculty instructors. None of the mentors had ever been inside a prison and we certainly did not perceive ourselves as having “authority.” We too felt powerless in dealing with the correctional officers; nonetheless, we did have more social power on site than the women enrolled in our classes because we were “outsiders”. Power and authority, we learned, are relative to situation.</p>
<p>As student mentors to student prisoners we operated outside of the harsh dichotomy of “us” and “them”. We were positioned in a netherland between the two. The barriers were permeable. We surely were not “us” in this liminal space, but we were also not “them.” Prison rules required that we observe the policies and regulations that aligned us with “them.” Yet, we personally identified with our fellow students. Throughout our time in the prison class, we negotiated our anomalous identities. We rejected conventional “savior” roles, very easy to don, for ultimately they too were oppressive. Constructing ourselves as “rescuers” simultaneously constructed our fellow students as “other,” and it also inflated our sense of our own importance. Christina narrates her process finding a non-rescuer prison identity:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: I could not be a rescuer at [prison]; I could not be a hero—and yet I now realize that I was in a position to do neither. I came into the prison armed with books and a hope that their experience with the class would compel some of the women to enroll in college after their release.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While struggling to interpret our personal identities in the prison classes, we also tried to challenge our fellow students’ complete identifications with the restrictive role of “prisoner.” We hoped that, even for a brief time, our classroom would provide them with a respite from prison and would help them to envision themselves as “college students.” Sometimes it happened<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597611433272">2</xref>
</sup>, as Laura relates:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: Yesterday a student told me that she wore her “own” coat to class because it made her feel special, like a real college student.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We all, instructors and mentors, agreed that a feminist college classroom, enacted in an environment of deprivation, must be open, safe, and trustworthy. It must be bounded by the topic and material, but it must simultaneously invite, even temporarily, the assumption of an alternative identity as an antidote to the pervasive feeling of oppression that prison creates. And it must employ what Crawley (2008) calls full-contact pedagogy, lectures with questions and student-centered assignments aimed at inciting self-reflexivity on the part of faculty and students and, we would add, mentors.</p>

<title>Negotiating the “Us” and “Them” Binary</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: While the professors introduced themselves, the purpose and expectations of the class, and also me as the student mentor, the air was thick with emotion. I could smell the fear, the anxiety as we, the professors and I, were trying to figure out what kind of women were in the class, while the prisoners were trying to figure out “what is it that these people want? Are we part of some kind of experiment?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As “free” people in a prison environment, we are reminded again and again of the on-going reality of being subject to the power and control of the carceral system staff and officers. The binary they instruct us to observe between “us” and “them,” begins in the required orientation to prison processes, and initially continues in the classes. Correctional officers act as “border patrol” agents (Lorber 1999) reinforcing over and over again the distinction between “incarcerated” and “free,” or even more essentially “dangerous” and “safe.” With each interaction, the social construction of this boundary is made evident (Lorber 1999). Because difference is socially constructed, we could modify and spin it in the direction of more relaxed engagement in our classes. And, as Laura humorously relates, sometimes we did.<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: One of my jobs as class mentor was to maintain attendance records. The listing was confusing until I saw that the names were not arranged alphabetically, but rather according to the number assigned to the women as inmates. The list I was given was arranged according to the inmates who had been “inside” the longest to the newest entrant. The internal logic of incarceration trumped everything, even their names. We had been told not to use first names, and that was another boundary to cross.</p>
<p>“OK, the roll will now be read in <italic>alphabetical </italic>order. When I call your last name, tell me what you prefer to be called in class.”</p>
<p>Some preferred their first names, some their last, some had nicknames that I rushed to write down. One whispered response wasn’t audible to me.</p>
<p>“Ho?” I asked, concerned about a problematic nickname.</p>
<p>“No, Hope.” The student responded louder as the class began to snicker.</p>
<p>When I saw Hope was her given name, I shook my head saying, “I’m an idiot” and the class all laughed. I love that sound.</p>
</disp-quote>
Opposites, like inside and out, “us” and “them,” symbiotically depend on each other for contrast and meaning (Lorber 1999). One method for the construction of “them” is the use of prison numbers. Using numbers instead of names to address people converts convicted women into objects of prison bureaucracy. Numbers erase individuality and personality. Initially our students, so accustomed to the ubiquity of their numbers, placed them under their names on the papers they submitted in class. Without instruction from us and, in apparent recognition of the irrelevancy of prison identification numbers in a college class, the least “prisonized” (Jewkes 2005; Owen 1998; Ross and Richards 2003) students begin to leave their numbers off their papers as the class progressed.</p>
<p>In our classrooms, representation by institutional identification numbers can be symbolically resisted. Humor and humanity can challenge artificial categories and blur their borders. But muting these boundaries does not erase them. The carceral system creates “inmate” as a salient, homogenous identity with which we, the instructors and mentors, are required to interact. Our use of our students’ first names is a miniscule interruption of the one-size-fits-all construct, but an important one that eases the “us” and “them” binary. Nonetheless, our autonomy outside prison boundaries and our exit after each class continue to identify both instructors as mentors as not-“us”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160597611433272">
<title>Safe Space</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: We had a discussion in class one day that really surprised me. One of the students related that she was afraid of being released because of the way people would treat her. She said she felt that when she walked into a store people would be able to tell she had been in prison. I tried to tell her that she didn’t have any tell-tale marks or habits that would give away her history, but she was sure that she would be seen as a “prisoner,” even after her release.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The prison experience feels indelible. Laura’s reassurances do not reassure. This woman’s surety that her imprisonment has left physical cues that others can detect is yet another example of the reach of “prisonization.” Female inmates are silenced by their required consent to the exigencies of the prison, as well as by the “us” and “them” binary inherent in their marginality as prisoners, their isolation from contemporary life, and their preincarceration histories. Additionally the prison warehousing environment lacks safe space where women can think quietly and critically consider and conceptualize their own, and others’, experiences. Without feminist analytical tools, they are captive to the definitions assigned to them by their imprisonment.</p>
<p>Feminist sociological theorists, like Collins (1990), have long noted the association between marginal positions and both knowledge and power. The marginalized know more about the power of the dominant group than vice versa because their survival depends on it. Our student peers had, we learned, a well developed sense of power and its implications, but they lacked the language to theorize it, as Christina’s classroom anecdote demonstrates:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: The late 16th century engraving, “Amerigo Vespucci Discovering the New World,” features Vespucci standing beside a reclining indigenous female figure lying on a hammock in the background. While Vespucci is dressed in regal clothing and holds a flag and a compass, the indigenous woman is naked, hesitantly holding out her arm toward the explorer. We hope that the image will evoke discussions about the gendered nature of colonialism.</p>
<p>“Who has the power in this situation?” I ask a silent room. After a few moments, a woman in the front chimes in.</p>
<p>“Well, he has the power because he has the knowledge.”</p>
<p>“What sort of knowledge?”</p>
<p>“Well, he has the ships and the compass. Geographical knowledge.”</p>
<p>A woman in the back of the room raises her hand to object.</p>
<p>“I think she really has the power – the power to manipulate him.”</p>
<p>“And how would she do that?” I ask.</p>
<p>“She’s the one who knows the area. She knows where the food is, where the resources are.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so there are different types of knowledge?” the instructor asks. There are a few nodding heads. “So why is it that one ends up winning out?”</p>
<p>“He has the knowledge of war, so he has power over her.” A woman with short dark hair adds.</p>
<p>“Whoever has the guns has the power. It’s still the same now.”</p>
</disp-quote>
In prisons the officers have the weapons. Power is unambiguously marshaled in the interests of control, authority, and “security;” incarcerated women are at the mercy of a system with a monopoly on the use of force.</p>
<p>Discussions such as these invite our student peers to find their authentic voices, to learn a subject so as to learn to speak their own thoughts on it (Palmer 1998). In this temporary space carved out of the prison regimen, we realized that prisoners are often hungry to respond to Audre Lorde’s (2001) invitation to transform silence into language and action. Lorde presents this transformation as an act of self-revelation, albeit one that may be fraught with danger in this environment, as Christina discovered:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: As I read through the essays later that night, I was troubled to find that one student wrote that she could relate to Harriet Jacobs’ experience [<italic>Incidents in the Live of a Slave Girl] </italic>with sexual harassment – she indicated that the officers at [prison] whisper sexually suggestive comments to her as a means of reinforcing their power.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There is no “security” or safety for women in prison; for the terms of their sentences, they are ceaselessly locked into interactions with correctional officers. College courses do not protect them from harassment, but the classes can provide space for expressions of the experience of harassment. Both the course content and structure of a sociology class can provide tools for transforming silence into the language that reveals the experience.</p>
<p>From a pedagogical perspective, such safe spaces are central to the meaningful expression of missing discourses (Fine 1988), to reclaiming the lost narratives of women in prison. In “Of Other Spaces,” Foucault (1986) theorized the importance of spaces where “subjugated knowledges” could be voiced, and where surveillance and intimidation would thus be minimized. The open discourse in classes in carceral environments appropriates the space of subjugated knowledges to encourage women’s voices, to listen closely to their messages, to note that these voices are tangled up with social forces that confiscate, punish, and delimit their expressions (Harris 2005). Christina continued:<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: She [Dr. Lempert] tells me that I’ve fallen into one of the ethical dilemmas of doing this work and that, while the student does have an option to file a complaint, she may receive more harassment as a consequence. Since what the student wrote was extremely vague, there were no names, no dates—nothing, in short, that would provide evidence for legal action—I realized that the student wanted to reveal her experience, not necessarily to take action.</p>
<p>I begin to realize that my role at the prison is not to fight harassment in an overt sense, but rather to teach students resistance strategies—to provide them with a theoretical space in which they can use their minds, develop alternative identities, and develop writing, reading, and speaking skills that will serve them after their releases.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The critical awareness evident in this exchange between Christina and the student’s revelation of harassment on site reflects a link between their intersecting personal biographies and the broader social contexts within which they occur. In <italic>The Sociological Imagination,</italic> C. Wright Mills (1956) described the biographical necessity of seeing the relationship between individual experiences (personal troubles) and the larger society (public issues). By personal troubles he referred to private matters with which the individual struggles, like sexual harassment from a correctional officer or revelations of said harassment. He theorized public issues as outside individual control, but which form the context of daily life, like the situation of inmates who are supervised by personnel in an institution that is identified as <italic>belonging to</italic> them (Goffman 1961; emphasis in original). Both Christina and the student are negotiating individual responses to the broader carceral forces controlling their experiences. In this environment, the student can tell her story; Christina can listen empathically. Christina can act as witness to the student’s narrative, but the witnessing can only offer a partial dilution of overarching prison control. Neither of them can change the structural conditions that contain the exchange.</p>
<p>As university students, we know little to nothing about the personal lives of incarcerated student peers. We are encouraged by the program director to keep it that way. Yet as we learned, we do not need to know about their lives to mentor their classroom experiences. We also do not need to know the nature of the crimes that resulted in their imprisonment. While it is public information, easily available on the Michigan Offender Tracking Information System (OTIS), we do not look. Boundary violations occur frequently in prison because there are no boundaries between self and environment. Incarcerated students cannot prevent mentors and instructors from seeing them in humiliating circumstances. <italic>Any </italic>member of staff can discipline <italic>any</italic> inmate at <italic>any</italic> time (Goffman 1961; emphasis in original). OTIS (Offender Tracking Information System) facts, available to us on the net in our “outside” lives, are unavailable to our student peers for comment or correction. The information available on OTIS would be irrelevant to us in conventional interactions outside the prison environment. It is incongruent then for us to violate the confidentiality of our student peers by accessing this information, to “know” about them, to react to crimes that will place them in the “class” of people defined by labels like murderer, thief, and robber. Nonetheless, this personal information is sometimes revealed to us in unconventional ways, as Laura experiences:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: My eyes locked with a woman whose eyes were filled with tears. She wrote in the next paper that she understood Kafka’s Metamorphosis because she had woken up one morning changed into a murderer after shooting her abusive husband.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Conclusion: Mirror Reflections</title>
<p>As student mentors, we strove to be “contextually self conscious” (Naranyan 1997) in order to facilitate our communications with our fellow students. In the context of women’s studies, ethnic studies and sociology courses, female prisoners and mentors were all encouraged to experience the world from one another’s perspectives. Seeing the prison students as peers was not difficult for any of us, perhaps because we had applied and been selected, in part, for our already developed empathic skills. As one mentor pointed out, in many cases the difference between “them” and “us” was one bad choice. This “mirroring,” or seeing the other in the self, is not to say that we appropriated our students’ experiences for ourselves, but rather that we focused on the needs and goals that we shared, in spite of the varieties of privilege and hardship contained in our backgrounds. It also meant that we could share stories of challenges and strategies for success in authentic and mutual ways. Laura continues her story of her experience moving from battered woman to sociology honors student:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: The professor asked me to tell the students about how I had entered into college on a special program while I was getting counseling for victims of domestic abuse. I told them about the drug use, the fear and the violence that had been my life before I left my husband and returned to college. When I talked about lying awake wondering if my husband was arrested or dead or just out getting high and mean, most of them looked at me with recognition of living in constant danger of having your life fall to pieces. I recounted a dream I had where I was knocked off a tall building and survived by letting go of my anger and concentrating on landing on my feet.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The authenticity of this mentor’s story, as well as her willingness to share it, provides context and support for our student peers to engage in critical analyses of their own circumstances. She is, and can be, part-“us.” Lesia comes to the same realization via an alternate experience:<disp-quote>
<p>Lesia: My first impression in the classroom was amazing. The students looked like you and me. I could have easily been one of them. I could have been with the wrong person and convicted for possession of a drug. I could have been accused of murder while I was acting in self defense. That realization was an awakening and a thought that I carry with me to this day.</p>
<p>At the end of my ten months with these women I noticed the changes that took place within them. They now had some knowledge about the women's issues in society (some commented that they believe that had they had this knowledge earlier in their lives, they may not have ended up in prison); they had more confidence (I noted this in their journal entries and in the way they spoke up in class); and after completing one course, they were eager to learn more. This is exactly how I felt after completing my first class at the University of Michigan–Dearborn, the same class I mentored: <italic>Introduction to Women's Studies</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This mentor’s conclusions reflect a feminist epistemological model. When confronted with women whose social locations and life experiences were different than her own, by rejecting the “us” and “them” dichotomy of the prison location, and by enacting a feminist epistemology she put herself in the place of the students. She “took the role of other” (Mead 1961), and she found commonality across the boundaries of place and space (Belenky et al. 1986). She found her own experiences mirrored in the classroom experiences of her fellow students.</p>
<p>Classes and experiences end. In the prison class, they end with a celebratory Completion Ceremony.<disp-quote>
<p>Christina: At the end of the year, in June, I attend the annual “Completion Ceremony.” The prison gym swells with special guests—professors and student mentors, supportive politicians and academics, teachers at the correctional facility [but never family members, they cause “security” problems]. The women sit in a block of folding chairs in the center of the room. At the front of the gym there is a raised platform with a podium—it’s actually a pulpit decorated with a large cross on the front of the wood—making anyone speaking at the podium, including the Dean of my university, look like a televangelist.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the students’ accomplishments, to hand out their certificates. Prisoners enrolled in the culinary arts program have prepared special appetizers for the event—cake with pink frosting, chocolate-covered strawberries, sparkling punch. [After the formal ceremony] I sit at one of the tables with a couple of the students and we talk about the college classes that will be offered next year. One plans to take a math class; another vacillates between American Women’s History and Introduction to Sociology. While I won’t be back next year, I promise to stay in touch. The ceremony is over quickly—too quickly. I tell both women, the best writers in the class, that their work is exceptional. Both of them are lifers.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ceremony follows the traditional graduation format, that is, a welcome by the program director, welcome by the warden, greetings from the university dean, a “keynote” speaker, a student speaker from each of the classes, and a word from the mentors. For many of the student speakers, this is their first public-speaking event. They are nervous. They know they must speak for their “class.” The speeches are always heartfelt and empowering for both the speaker and the audience. This ceremony also gives mentors a chance to speak about how their lives have been enriched by the experience, from relishing the opportunity to reach beyond the “ivory tower,” to the empowerment of giving back after being helped by social programs during our own times of crisis. Laura closes her circle:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura: Being part of this felt like a full circle to me, like it had all had a purpose. After everything I had been through and all the hard work I could help other women the way I had been helped. I was not a victim any longer.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We, the mentors, speak highly of our experiences teaching in the prison. One of us has changed her career choices as a result of insights she gained while with the program, deciding to remain involved with these “forgotten women” (Lempert et al. 2005). In women's studies classes, we are taught that “the personal is political.” The interface with the prison system drives that observation home and gives us a chance to address some of the more egregious results of social inequities through our own praxis. By expressing and embodying the transformative power of education, we are ourselves transformed by our role. We mirror our fellow students. As we encourage incarcerated women to identify as college students, they mirror us. Our liberation links one with the other.</p>
<p>The program has produced several students who have gone on to enroll at the University after their release/parole. University enrollment, and ensuing success, gives former prisoners a renewed sense of belonging to society, even before they exit the prison. Rather than dividing the world between “us” and “them,” the program re-establishes membership in a cohesive community, so that at the university, in the free world, we can all be “us.”</p>

<title>Epilogue</title>
<p>After the program won the 2006 American Association of University Women Progress in Equity Award and $5,000 honorarium, the women voted to use the money to “take it to the men.” Their new critical awarenesses helped them to articulate that a lack of understanding of gender dynamics, the public issue, was often at the heart of their personal circumstances, their private troubles. So in January 2007, Lora Lempert trained with the Inside Out Prison Exchange Program founded by Lori Pompa at Temple University, and she (and another trained colleague) now offer the only courses in Michigan that combine university students and incarcerated students in the <italic>same</italic> class, as peers, in a state men’s correctional facility. The course content is race, class, and gender in the <italic>criminal justice system.</italic>

<p>In January 2009, many of the students in our classes, who had participated in a class-action lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections, won a $100 million judgment. The suit was first filed in 1996. Eighteen women testified against the MDOC; more than 400 others joined the suit. In an unprecedented move, members of the jury in the first suit wrote and read an apology to the women on behalf of the citizens of the State of Michigan.</p>
