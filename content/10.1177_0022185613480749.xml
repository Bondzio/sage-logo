<p>The Fair Work era promised us a modern industrial relations system that enables representation in the workplace, places collective agreements at its centre and balances fairness (read: ‘employee interests’) and flexibility (read: ‘employer interests’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185613480749">1</xref></sup> Historically, the Australian industrial relations system has given unions an institutionalised role as the representatives of employee interests. What we hoped for in the Fair Work system was a restoration of that role, which had been significantly restrained in the WorkChoices era.</p>
<p>What we have found instead is that unions are still expected to do the heavy lifting on the ‘fairness’ side of the bargain, with little to support or resource them in that work. The biggest losers in this scenario are those workers in small or poorly unionised workplaces, but, over time, we will find that all workers will suffer from the decline in unionism and reduction in the role that unions play in improving the working lives of all Australians, even those who do not work in unionised workplaces or under union-negotiated enterprise agreements.</p>
<p>At a recent industrial relations practitioner event, a colleague from an employer association complained bitterly that the Fair Work Act forces employers to bargain with a union even though the union may only have one member in that workplace or, in the case of a greenfields agreement, potentially no members when the site opens. Of course, those of us who have worked in unions know that the reality is that bargaining where you have low membership density or limited potential for membership growth is a fool’s errand. It is well and good for an employer to complain that they should not have to bargain with a union that represents a small portion of its workforce, but it is equally reasonable for a union to say that it will not represent a workforce that is not well unionised. Union income is predominantly reliant on membership fees, and enterprise bargaining is a resource-intensive endeavour. Unions need to be strategic in choosing which workplaces they will bargain in.</p>
<p>The result is that union activity, especially bargaining, is concentrated where the union will get the ‘best bang for its buck’, and that tends to be large workplaces or workplaces that are well unionised. While the Fair Work Act does permit employees to self-represent in bargaining, without the expertise and resources of a union, their bargaining position is likely to be significantly inferior. A legislative focus on enterprise bargaining – particularly with pattern bargaining outlawed – fails workers in small or poorly unionised workplaces who do not have the benefits of collective action and specialist expertise that a union brings.</p>
<p>The low-paid bargaining stream introduced in the Fair Work Act had the potential to redress this failure in the enterprise bargaining system by enabling wages to be lifted across low-paid industries, such as aged care or child care, which are characterised by just such workplaces. Regrettably, the decision of the Full Bench of Fair Work Australia in a low-paid bargaining application for the aged care industry to exclude employers with a history of enterprise bargaining, limited the ability for the low-paid bargaining stream to achieve its potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185613480749">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the low-paid bargaining stream, United Voice’s strategy to lift wages in the aged care industry was to target large residential providers for enterprise bargaining. This bargaining strategy reflects a pragmatic response to a legislative context that fails to provide for true access to collective representation in small workplaces or workplaces that are not traditionally unionised, but it has limited scope to deliver real wage increases across the industry. That is where the low-paid bargaining stream should have provided a legislative mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185613480749">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Fair Work system relies on unions to represent workers. Unsurprisingly, the sole application for an equal remuneration order since the introduction of the Fair Work Act was made by a consortium of unions. What individual employee has the resources to bring such an application? Similarly, it was unions who represented workers in the award modernisation process and who continue to represent workers in award reviews and award variation applications. It is not feasible for that kind of work to be done by individual workers.</p>
<p>Of course, the Fair Work Act has a whole suite of minimum employment standards that apply to all workers regardless of their union membership, but it remains unions who are the primary lobby group advocating for the inclusion of, and lifting of, employment standards generally. Across the system – whether their employment conditions are directed by the minimum standards, an award or an enterprise agreement – all workers benefit from the representation provided by unions, members or not. The system in fact relies on unions to perform a representative role on behalf of all workers. Yet the Fair Work system does little to ensure that unions are able to maintain the resources required to perform this role.</p>
<p>Of greater concern is that the Fair Work system, while relying on the representative role of unions, simultaneously undermines them in that role. The ability for employees to appoint a non-union bargaining representative, even if they are a union member, has caused havoc at the negotiating table and is a case in point. Despite the availability of bargaining orders to remedy a multiplicity of bargaining representatives hindering a bargaining process, a situation in which there are a number of individual bargaining representatives representing their own interests and personal agendas and undermining the collective strength of the workforce is not uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185613480749">4</xref></sup> Similarly, in my experience, the requirement that a bargaining representative is free from the control or improper influence of another bargaining representative has not prevented employers coercing workers to nominate management as their bargaining representative.</p>
<p>In order to gain the membership levels required to make unions viable representatives for workers generally, and not just those in large or well-unionised workplaces, unions need access to resources and, in particular, unions need access to workers. The Fair Work Act prohibits bargaining fees. It has loosened the constraints on enterprise agreement content, but continues to restrict the bargain employers and unions can strike with regard to right of entry.</p>
<p>There are no explicit provisions for the role of union delegates, and, in my experience, the freedom of association provisions are more often used by employers to deny unions access to their workers and to protect the choice <italic>not</italic> to join a union than they are to defend the right to be an (active) union member. In any event, what good is the freedom of choice to join a union if there are no viable unions left to join (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613480749">Lambropoulos, 2012</xref>)?</p>
<p>In its objects, the Fair Work Act promises to ‘enable fairness and representation at work’, but, in practice, what does that mean? If unions are not enabled to perform a representative role effectively, then relying on unions to speak for workers in bargaining and in legislative and award review processes is not only meaningless, it is unfair.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0022185613480749"><label>1</label><p>It is true that the Fair Work Act also sought to enhance flexibility for workers, for example, in the right of an employee who has responsibility for the care of a child to request flexible working arrangements, but this sort of employee-driven flexibility tends to be reserved for workers whose position in the labour market grants them that kind of bargaining power. For the workers I have represented in the low-paid, feminised ‘care’ industries (child, aged, disability and health care), the only flexible ‘choice’ is to take up casual work, with all the job and income insecurity that entails.</p></fn>
