<p>Applications are invited for the next editor of <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic>. The official term for the new editor (or co-editors) will commence in January 2015 (the editorial transition will be in summer 2014) and is for a minimum of three years (until December 2017), with a possible reappointment of up to an additional three years.</p>
<p><italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> appears quarterly and publishes articles, notes, and reviews intended to be helpful to the discipline’s teachers. Articles range from experimental studies of teaching and learning to broad, synthetic essays on pedagogically important issues. Notes focus on specific teaching issues or techniques. The intent is to share theoretically stimulating and practically useful information and advice with teachers. Formats include full-length articles; notes of 10 pages or fewer; interviews; review essays; reviews of books, films, videos, and software; and conversations.</p>

<sec id="section2-0092055X13485551">
<title>Selection Process</title>
<p>Applications will be reviewed by the Committee on Publications in December 2013. It is possible that prospective editors will be contacted to clarify any issues raised in the deliberations. A list (which may be ranked or unranked) will be forwarded to ASA Council for review in early 2014. The Council appoints the editors. The chosen editors are contacted by the ASA Secretary.</p>
<p>Given that the Committee on Publications receives a number of qualified applications, appointment to the editorship of an ASA journal is highly selective. The guidelines below offer suggestions that are designed to streamline the application process for applicants and the committee.</p>
<p>The application packet should be no morethan six pages (excluding vitae) and include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0092055X13485551" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Vision Statement:</italic> Set forth your goals and plans for the content of the journal. This may include an assessment of the current strengths, weaknesses, or gaps that you plan to address and how you will implement your plan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Abbreviated, Anonymous Vision Statement:</italic> Also include an abbreviated vision statement that focuses on ideas for moving the journal forward, including any weaknesses you perceive, and any plans you envision for addressing them. These statements will be posted anonymously on the ASA website and members will be invited to comment on them. The Committee on Publications will take this feedback into consideration in the selection process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Editor/Co-Editor Background Information:</italic> The name, affiliation, and other important information about the potential editor and, if applicable, co-editors are required. Describe the qualifications of each person that support his or her inclusion. Evidence of the ability and experience of the editor and editorial team to provide sound judgment and guidance to potential ASA authors is central to the application. Provide a clear description of and justification for the structure of the editorial office and responsibilities, as you envision them at this point. Name only those individuals who will serve as editor or co-editor. Please do not include names of individuals that you would like or plan to include on the larger editorial board. Contacting potential editorial board members can be a time-consuming task that should be done only after an editor is selected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Institutional Support:</italic> It is important for candidates to consider and address the feasibility of serving as editor in light of the resources ASA can provide and those likely to be available to the candidate. The ASA does not pay for office space or release time but does provide basic financial support for office resources as necessary to journal editors. This support may include funds for clerical assistance, office supplies, postage, and telephone beyond what will be provided by the editor’s home institution. Since the support offered by different institutions varies widely, you are encouraged to contact the ASA Executive Office as necessary to ensure the feasibility of your application. At this point in the submission process, letters of support from deans or other appropriate institutional officials are recommended but not required. Specific arrangements with a potential new editor and with that individual and his or her institution will occur after the ASA Council makes a selection and the ASA Secretary, with support from the ASA Executive Officer, works out the final agreement with this candidate.</p></list-item>
