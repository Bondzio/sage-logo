<abstract>
<p>Two novel phosphorous–nitrogen type phosphoramidate derivatives, dibutyl octadecylphosphoramidate and dimethyl 4-dodecylphenylphosphoramidate, were synthesized and applied as lubricant additives in rapeseed oil. Using a four-ball machine and standard method, the tribological behaviors of these additives in rapeseed oil were compared with commercial lubricant additives dodecan-1-aminium butyl 7-methyloctyl phosphate (coded T308B) and dibutyl phosphonate (coded T304). The results show that the phosphoramidate derivatives possess excellent antiwear, friction-reducing properties and good extreme pressure capacities. The tribological mechanism was investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. It is proposed that the prepared compounds as additives in rapeseed oil form a protective film on the rubbed surface, and the film contains phosphate and/or polyphosphate which can affect the tribological behavior.</p>

<p>Antiwear and extreme pressure (EP) additives are added to lubricating oils, especially gear oil and hydraulic oil to decrease wear and prevent seizure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111435034">1</xref></sup> A wide variety of antiwear and EP additives are commercially available, and the early additives contained chlorine, zinc, lead, etc. Lead naphthenates and chlorine-containing additives were extensively used in lubricating oils early, but environmental concerns have led to their disappearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111435034">2</xref></sup> Zinc dialkyldithiophosphates are the best known and most widely used antiwear additives in engine and hydraulic oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111435034">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111435034">4</xref></sup> However, the concern for zinc as an environmental contaminant and for phosphorus poisoning of automotive catalysts has resulted in finding ashless and phosphorus-free or low-phosphorus replacements for both automotive and industrial applications. Without heavy metal elements, some heterocyclic compounds containing sulfur,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111435034">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111435034">6</xref></sup> phosphorus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111435034">7</xref></sup> and nitrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111435034">8</xref></sup> could be promising substitutes as environmental friendly lubricating additives. Sulfur and sulfur–nitrogen additives are used to provide protection against high pressure, metal-to-metal contacts in boundary lubrication and good EP properties, but they lead to corrosion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111435034">9</xref></sup> Phosphorus and sulfur–phosphorus additives are used to provide protection against pressure and metal-to-metal contacts, too. Unlike sulfur additives, where their EP activity must be balanced against performance requirements for thermal stability and mild corrosivity toward copper, phosphorus-containing additives usually possess corrosivity control, but the phosphorus content is high. Ashless phosphorus–nitrogen additives with lower phosphorus content such as amine dithiophosphates, amine thiophosphates, amine phosphates, and phosphoramides can be easily prepared and extensively used as multi-functional antiwear/antirust additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650111435034">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650111435034">13</xref></sup> Low phosphorus and multi-function are the inevitable trends in lube processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650111435034">14</xref></sup> As to base oil, for environmental consideration, a renewable resource, rapeseed oil (coded RSO) is employed, because it is a good alternative to mineral oil for its environmental friendly, non-toxic, and readily biodegradable nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650111435034">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650111435034">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In view of the fact that the reactions during the friction process are extraordinary perplexing and cannot be detected in situ up to date, surface analysis after rubbing system is an effective method to explore the mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111435034">18</xref></sup> X-ray absorption near edge structure (coded XANES) spectroscopy is a convinced potential tool used to investigate the nature of tribofilm, because it can provide important chemical information about a sample without destroying it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650111435034">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111435034">19</xref></sup> A large number of studies about XANES analysis of tribofilm have been performed by many researchers, especially on phosphorous- and sulfur-containing additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111435034">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650111435034">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, two novel phosphorous–nitrogen (P–N) type phosphoramidate derivatives, dibutyl octadecylphosphoramidate (coded DBOP) and dimethyl 4-dodecylphenylphosphoramidate (coded DMDP), were synthesized and applied as lubricant additives in RSO. Using a four-ball machine and standard method, the tribological behaviors of these additives in RSO were compared with commercial lubricant additives dodecan-1-aminium butyl 7-methyloctyl phosphate (coded T308B) and dibutyl phosphonate (coded T304). The results show that the phosphoramidate derivatives possess excellent antiwear, friction-reducing properties and good EP capacities. The tribological mechanism was investigated by XANES spectroscopy. It is proposed that the prepared compounds as additives in RSO form a protective film on the rubbed surface, and the film contains phosphate and/or polyphosphate which can affect the tribological behavior.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1350650111435034"><title>Synthesis of additives</title>
<p>The novel additives were readily synthesized with the procedure as follows. In a 500-mL round bottomed flask, 26.9 g (0.1 mol) of octadecan-1-amine and 19.4 g (0.1 mol) of dibutyl phosphonate were added to some solvent, and catalysts were added to the above mixture with the temperature lower than 50°C. As the reaction proceeded, more and more precipitates were found. The obtained slurry was refluxed for 2 h till the reaction terminated. The solution was filtered, evaporated, and treated with routine protocol and finally produced 45.0 g (yield 97.5%) DBOP.</p>
<p>When octadecan-1-amine and dibutyl phosphonate were replaced with 4-dodecylaniline and dimethyl phosphonate, respectively, DMDP was obtained with 92.0% of yield as the same procedure as represented above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1350650111435034"><title>Friction and wear test</title>
<p>The tribological performances such as friction-reducing and antiwear capacities of the additives are evaluated on an MRS-1J four-ball machine. The wear scar diameters (WSD) are measured by an optical microscope, and the friction coefficients are automatically recorded. The test conditions are rotating speed of 1450 r/min, testing duration of 30 min, and room temperature. The balls used in tribological test are in the size of 12.7 mm diameter and made of GCr 15 bearing steel (chemical composition: C, 0.95–1.05%; Si, 0.15–0.35%; Mn, 0.20–0.40%; P, 0.027%; S, 0.020%; Cr, 1.30–1.65%; Ni, 0.30%; Cu, 0.25%) with an HRC of 59–61 hardness. The load-carrying properties of the samples (maximum non-seizure load, <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> and weld load, <italic>P</italic><sub>D</sub>) are measured by an MQ-12-EP four-ball machine. Chinese National Standard GB3142-82 similar to ASTM D-2783 is adopted for all the tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1350650111435034"><title>XANES analysis of the worn surface</title>
<p>XANES analyses were performed at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), situated at the 2.2 GeV storage ring, Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). Phosphorous K-edge spectra were collected on the double-crystal monochromator covering an energy of 2140–2180 eV. The photo-adsorption spectra were collected with fluorescence yield (FY) modes of detection to provide chemical information on the bulk of the reaction film.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1350650111435034"><title>EP properties</title>
<p>The EP properties of the additives in RSO were evaluated by the maximum non-seizure load (<italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value) and the weld load (<italic>P</italic><sub>D</sub> value).</p>
<p>The <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value of the RSO, 1.5 wt% DBOP/RSO, 1.5 wt% DMDP/RSO, 1.5 wt% T308B/RSO, and 1.5 wt% T304/RSO are shown as columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111435034">Figure 1</xref>. The results show that DBOP and DMDP enhanced the <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> values of base oil, indicating that these additives have good EP property. The <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value of DBOP which contains longer chain in molecular structure is higher than that of DMDP and T308B, suggesting that the additive containing shorter chain possesses poorer load-carrying capacities in RSO. Possible reason for this phenomenon is that the additive with longer chain can form thicker film on the surface. The <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value of T304 is higher than that of other additives, but the severity of corrosive wear far exceeds those of DBOP, DMDP, and T308B. The results show that acidic phosphate ester (T304) has more adsorption force than that of other phosphonate esters, and the results also indicate that the former can react with metal surface faster than others as the test only is performed in 10 s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650111435034">24</xref></sup>

<p>The <italic>P</italic><sub>D</sub> value of RSO, 1.5 wt% DBOP/RSO, 1.5 wt% DMDP/RSO, 1.5 wt% T308B/RSO, and 1.5 wt% T304/RSO, are shown as columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111435034">Figure 2</xref>. The results match with the <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value and also indicate that the additive containing longer chain in molecular structure is harder to weld than those with shorter chain in RSO. The <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value of T304 is higher than other additives, too. The tendency matched well with <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub> value.

<sec id="sec9-1350650111435034"><title>Antiwear properties of phosphoramidate derivative additives</title>
<p>The variation of WSD with the concentration of the additives in RSO under 392N is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111435034">Figure 3</xref>. It indicated that DBOP, DMDP, and T308B can improve the antiwear property of RSO, whereas the DBOP is the best at the same concentration, and possible reason is that the additive with longer chain can form thicker film on the surface. And when DBOP or DMDP was added to RSO in different concentrations, the WSD varied a little. Because of the corrosive wear, T304 cannot serve as an antiwear agent in RSO. Suitable concentration of the additives is 0.5–1.5 wt% which can be added to base oil to enhance the antiwear property. It was reported that the antiwear properties of phosphorous-containing additives were related to hydrolytic stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650111435034">24</xref></sup> and the additives with high hydrolytic stability tended to have poor antiwear property. Possible reason for the phenomenon was that the adsorption of low-hydrolytic stability additives was stronger than that of the high-hydrolytic stability additives.

<p>In addition, curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111435034">Figure 4</xref> depict the antiwear properties of 1.5 wt% additives in RSO under different loads. It can be seen that the WSD of DBOP and DMDP are far less than those in RSO, which suggests that these additives can improve the antiwear performance of RSO under applied load 196–588 N. Moreover, DBOP shows better antiwear property at 196–588 N. T308B can reduce the WSD, but seizure happened when the load was added to 490 or 588 N. And the phenomenon of severe corrosive wear can also be observed when T304 was used. It is reported that film thickness decreased when load increased, and then WSD increased which matched well with the results as the indicated by the curves.

<sec id="sec10-1350650111435034"><title>Friction-reducing properties of phosphoramidate derivative additives</title>
<p>From 0.5 to 3.0 wt%, different concentrations of synthesized compounds, T308B and T304, were added to RSO, and the variation of friction coefficient under 392 N is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111435034">Figure 5</xref>. The curve shows the friction coefficient significantly decreased when DBOP or DMDP was added to RSO. It is worth mentioning that the friction coefficient of RSO is 0.104, and 40.4% of which decreased to 0.062 when 1.5 wt% DBOP was added. DBOP shows excellent and stable friction-reducing properties at concentration of 0.5–3.0 wt% in RSO, and DMDP performs well. Suitable concentration of additives in base oil is 1.0–1.5 wt%. The decrease in friction coefficient of the samples can be explained that the additives form the adsorption film and/or reaction film on the rubbing surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111435034">7</xref></sup> From Stribeck Curve, additives with low concentration formed thinner film which caused higher friction coefficient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111435034">1</xref></sup> while friction coefficient lower with the concentration enhanced or the film thickness increased.

T308B reduces the friction coefficient in the load of 196–392 N, but seizure happened when the load was added.

<p>Phosphorus K-edge X-ray absorption spectra can give the detailed information about the oxidation of phosphorus in a film or on a surface. Thermal films provide some useful information about the pathways of decomposition taking place before the friction process. Thermal films were prepared by the following procedure, the balls were put into 1.5 wt% additive-containing RSO and continued for 6 h at 150°C,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650111435034">24</xref></sup> and then they were ultrasonically cleaned with petroleum ether and dried before analysis. The analysis of the thermal films generated from additives can be helpful for explaining the chemical properties of the tribofilms. P K-edge XANES spectra of the thermal films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435034">Figure 7</xref>, in which the spectra of some model compounds are also listed and their peak positions along with some relevant model compounds are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650111435034">Table 2</xref>.

<p>As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435034">Figure 7</xref>, the thermal films generated from 1.5 wt% DMDP/RSO and 1.5 wt% T308B/RSO are solely composed of the peak of 2152.3 eV, which matches the model compound phosphate well. While the additives are replaced with 1.5 wt% DBOP or 1.5 wt% T304, the spectra are clearly different from the above two. The thermal films consist of the adsorbed additives and mainly polyphosphate that demonstrated by the fine structure of weaker peaks at about 2157 eV as literature reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350650111435034">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650111435034">26</xref></sup> The results show that tribo-heat plays a very important role in the whole lubricating process. From the results of thermal films, we can also see that under tribo-heat conditions, the additive molecules were adsorbed on the iron surface, and then some molecules will react with iron and form the film on the surface.</p>

<p>The tribofilms generated from 1.5 wt% DMDP/RSO shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650111435034">Figure 8</xref>(a) are simply composed of the model compound phosphate. From the XANES spectrum of 1.5 wt% DBOP/RSO, we can see that it is composed of the adsorbed additive, phosphate, and a little polyphosphate. When the additive was replaced with 1.5 wt% T304, the main compound changed to more additive, phosphate and polyphosphate. Associating these results with tribological data, the conclusion can be drawn that the tribofilms are composed of phosphate and polyphosphate, and a suitable ratio of the mixtures of phosphate and polyphosphate in the tribofilms will get better antiwear and friction-reducing performance than a single component. As can be seen from the spectroscopy of tribofilms, there is no weak pre-edge feature at approximately 2148.0 eV (the peak is the characteristic of Fe (III) phosphate according to the studies of Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111435034">18</xref></sup> and Lin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650111435034">19</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>, which indicates that the cation in the films is mainly Fe (II) and not Fe (III).</p>
<p>The P K-edge XANES (FY) of tribofilms generated from different concentrations of DBOP additive in RSO are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650111435034">Figure 9</xref> and in which synthetic diester (coded DE) and mineral oil (coded 5CST) are also displayed. The peak positions of each spectrum and model compounds are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350650111435034">Table 4</xref>. From the spectra, difference of the polyphosphate is apparently found between 0.5 wt% DBOP/RSO and 3.0 wt% DBOP/RSO. Compared with 1.5 wt% DBOP/RSO, more polyphosphate was found when the base oil was replaced with DE or 5CST.

<p>From the spectra of EP films, we can see that they match the tribofilms well. It suggests that more polyphosphate are benefit for EP properties, and a little amount of polyphosphate is propitious to antiwear and reducing coefficient. If simple and sole phosphate was produced, the above two properties are both negative.</p>
