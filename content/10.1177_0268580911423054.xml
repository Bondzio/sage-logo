<abstract>
<p>This study seeks to extend the theoretical explanation of victims’ crime reporting behavior to a social-structural framework by partially using Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic> theory in a non-western context. Black’s theory of law postulated that police reporting varied according to five aspects of social life: stratification, morphology, culture, organization and social control. Drawing on the most recent victimization survey conducted in Taiwan, this study focuses on victim reporting of assault, robbery and larceny. Some findings replicated the expectations proposed by Black’s propositions, but others were contrary to expectations. Female robbery victims reported to the police approximately three times more than males. The plausible reason might involve the notion of relational distance taken from Black’s morphology perspective. It was also found that the severity of infraction was positively related to crime reporting. The coexistence of a strong effect of the variable ‘crime seriousness’ and the statistical significance of Black’s social dimensions might imply that Black’s theory has value in forming the broad social context of social action but is insufficient as an explanation of individual behavior.</p>

<p><bold>Les comportements en matière de déclaration des délits et La Conduite du droit de Black</bold></p>
<p>Cette étude a pour objet d’intégrer le cadre socio-structurel à l’explication théorique du comportement des victimes de délits, en utilisant partiellement la théorie de La Conduite du droit de Black, mais dans un contexte non occidental. Dans sa théorie du droit, Black postulait que la déclaration d’un délit à la police variait en fonction de cinq dimensions de la vie sociale : la stratification, la morphologie, la culture, l’organisation et le contrôle social. Cette étude, qui s’appuie sur la dernière enquête réalisée à Taiwan sur les victimes de délits, est centrée sur les victimes qui portent plainte pour agression ou vol. Certaines conclusions recoupent les hypothèses de Black, mais d’autres s’y opposent. Les femmes victimes de vol portent plainte trois fois plus que les hommes. La notion de distance relationnelle développée par Black lorsqu’il traite du critère morphologie est une explication plausible. Mais il a également été établi que la gravité de l’infraction était en corrélation avec le nombre des plaintes déposées. La coexistence de l’effet déterminant de la variable « gravité du délit » et de l’importance dans les statistiques des dimensions sociales décrites par Black, donne à penser que la théorie de Black est utile pour déterminer le contexte social général de l’action sociale mais se révèle insuffisante pour expliquer le comportement individuel.</p>

<p>Este estudio trata de extender la explicación teórica de la denuncia de delitos por parte de las víctimas a un esquema socio-estructural usando parcialmente la teoría del comportamiento del derecho de Black en un contexto no occidental. La teoría del comportamiento del derecho de Black postuló que la denuncia policial varía según cinco aspectos de la vida social: la estratificación, la morfología, la cultura, la organización y el control social. Tomando como base la encuesta de victimización más reciente en Taiwán este estudio se centra en las denuncias de víctimas de asalto, robo y hurto. Algunos resultados son congruentes con las hipótesis propuestas de Black mientras que otros han resultado contradictorios. Las víctimas femeninas de robo denunciaron a la policía aproximadamente tres veces más que los hombres. La explicación más plausible puede estar relacionada con la noción de distancia relacional tomada de la perspectiva morfológica de Black. También se ha encontrado que la gravedad de la infracción estaba correlacionada positivamente con la denuncia del delito. La coexistencia de un fuerte efecto de la variable gravedad del crimen y la significación estadística de las dimensiones sociales de Black pueden implicar que la teoría de Black tenga valor en la formación de un contexto social amplio de acción social pero que sea una explicación insuficiente del comportamiento individual.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Crime reported to the police by victims is a primary source for understanding the prevalence, trends and crime patterns in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423054">Chiu and Sheu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423054">Fajnzylber et al., 2000</xref>). As victims underreport crime the dark figure rises, undermining the foundation of effective interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423054">Fajnzylber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423054">Skogan, 1984</xref>). International victimization data, which spanned 17 industrialized countries including the US, have shown that only half of crimes were reported to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423054">Bouten et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies on crime reporting have unveiled some explanatory factors, such as characteristics of victims or situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>); many of the studies, however, tended to be atheoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423054">Chiu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al., 2001</xref>: 343). This present study seeks to expand current knowledge on reporting behavior by placing it within a general theoretical framework derived from Donald Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic> theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> conceptualizes law as ‘governmental social control’, which is broadly interpreted as ‘a call to the police, a visit to a regulatory agency, or a lawsuit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 2–3). His theory also formulated a series of systematic, parsimonious and straightforward propositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423054">Bernard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423054">Sherman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423054">Tucker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner, 2002</xref>). Though often cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner, 2002</xref>: 664), Black’s theory has been underutilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423054">Doyle and Luckenbill, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423054">Lessan and Sheley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner, 2002</xref>). The paucity of empirical tests for Black’s theory might be due to the comprehensive and abstract philosophy embedded in his theory that was difficult to operationalize for specific behaviors. Of the few published empirical tests of Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic>, most were undertaken in a western context; very few involved a non-western culture, though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> claimed that his theory was applicable to various contexts and times. This study examines Black’s theory on crime reporting using victimization data gathered in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan has undergone a dramatic economic transformation over the past four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423054">Shu, 2002</xref>); the GNP per capita grew 100-fold from US$145 in 1957 to US$16,907 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423054">National Statistics, ROC (Taiwan), 2008</xref>). Crime rates also demonstrated an upward trend, increasing over 150 percent between 1961 and 2001, which has been attributed to increased industrialization and urbanization resulting from the rapid economic boom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423054">Shu, 2002</xref>). The 2000 Taiwan criminal victimization survey revealed that crimes in Taiwan have been underreported, as in western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The issue of underreporting seemed to be largely understudied, however. Of about 4000 scholarly works in academic criminological journals since 1991, no more than 10 published works involved empirical investigation of crime reporting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423054">Young, 2005</xref>). Although the first national criminal victimization survey was conducted in 2000 and provided important information on victimization, it was criticized for being overly complex and may inaccurately estimate the prevalence of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423054">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>). Five years later, a nationally representative victimization survey was conducted which applied rigorous multistage sampling methods and contained refined measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423054">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>). Improvements notwithstanding, the 2005 victimization data have not yet been used to explore the determinants of crime reporting.</p>
<p>This study examined reporting crime to the police by applying part of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black’s (1976)</xref> 29 propositions. The 2005 Taiwan criminal victimization survey was employed to empirically assess the utility and generalizability of these propositions in a non-western context.</p>

<title>Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic></title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> defined law as dynamic behavior, which can be measured as ‘the number and scope of prohibitions, obligations, and other standards to which people are subject’, and it is quantified as ‘more or less’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>: 3). Filing a complaint to a legal official, for example, is more law than no complaint so reporting a crime to the police equates to more law than an absence of reporting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> proposed that the quantity of the law varied according to five aspects of social life: stratification, morphology, culture, organization and social control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> provided a broad interpretation on these five dimensions of social life; the following definitions are relevant for the testing conducted in the present study.</p>
<p>Stratification refers to the ‘vertical aspect of social life’ and emerges when wealth and rank is unevenly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 17). To elaborate, people with less wealth and of lower social rank, thus, are less likely than those wealthier and of higher rank to mobilize the legal system. In the literature, gender, race, age and income have been linked to the concept of stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423054">Braithwaite and Biles, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423054">Kruttschnitt, 1980–1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423054">Mooney, 1986</xref>). Females, people of color, the young and the less affluent are less likely to access (or have access to) legal resources than do males, whites, the mature and the more affluent.</p>
<p>The second social dimension is morphology, which is defined as ‘the horizontal aspect of social life, the distribution of people in relation to one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 37). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> posited that the degree of integration or participation in social life affected whether individuals would draw upon legal resources or not. It is assumed that more socially integrated people are more likely to mobilize the law more than those who are less socially integrated. An employed or married person, for instance, is more integrated into the social mainstream than an unemployed or single person. This leads to the expectation that employed or married victims are more likely to report the crime to the police than unemployed or unmarried victims.</p>
<p>Another dimension proposed by Black is culture. Culture is defined as ‘the symbolic aspect of social life, including expressions of what is true, good, and beautiful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 61). Black theorized that law varied directly with culture. Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>: 64) used education as an indicator of culture and posited that ‘literate and educated people are more likely to bring lawsuits against others’.</p>
<p>Organization is expressed as ‘the corporate aspect of social life, the capacity for collective action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 85). It is measured by ‘the presence and number of administrative officers, the centralization and continuity of decision making, and the quantity of collective action itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 85). A more organized society will have more extensive legal activity than a less organized society. Also, people who are more integrated into organizations would tend to be more litigious than those not so integrated.</p>
<p>The final dimension is social control, which means the ‘normative aspect of social life’ that defines ‘what is right, what is a violation, obligation, abnormality, or disruption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 105). Social control contrasts with law as social pressure to conform rather than governmental legal action. Social control deters some deviance, so law varies inversely with social control.</p>
<p>Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423054">2004</xref>) conceptualized the behavior of law from a social-structural perspective that disregarded unobservable motivation and perceptions of human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423054">Tucker, 2002</xref>: 661). Whereas Black’s theory of law was seen to create ‘a new strategy of explanation’ in criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423054">Tucker, 2002</xref>: 662) that inspired considerable intellectual discussion, it also invited a great deal of controversy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423054">Greenberg (1983)</xref> heavily criticized Black’s pure sociological approach that resisted conventional approaches which were able to better account for social behavior. Black’s theory of law is still not fully understood through empirical verification, and warrants further inquiry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0268580911423054">
<title>The social context in Taiwan</title>
<p>Taiwan has experienced rapid social change since the retreat from Mainland China in 1949 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423054">Thornton and Lin, 1994</xref>), which may be attributed to a variety of factors including economy, politics, society and culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black’s (1976)</xref> general theory asserted that law varied according to stratification, morphology, culture, organization and social control. This implies that reporting behavior would change as socioeconomic conditions (stratification), population composition (morphology), cultural diversity (culture), political conditions (organization) and informal social constraints (social control) changed in society. As Taiwan’s social and economic conditions converged with western countries, reporting behavior also became more formalized, as in the West.</p>
<p>During the emergent state period, which was ruled by the authoritarian regime, reporting deviant activities to the police was propagandized as an obligation of ‘solid’ and ‘patriotic’ citizens. Police visited households to collect intelligence, providing an opportunity for residents to report deviant acts committed by their neighbors or community members. Police had broad discretion to interpret what constituted ‘crime’ against the nation and how to handle it, as their primary role was to maintain order for the ruling regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423054">Chang, 1995</xref>). Reporting crime behavior at this time was not a concern for the criminal justice system as citizens would report suspicious behavior to the police if for no other reason than to allay possible suspicion from themselves.</p>
<p>Between the 1960s and 1970s, Taiwan’s economy boomed, hastening the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy, leading to what many have termed an ‘economic miracle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423054">Chow, 2002</xref>). During this period of time, the middle class emerged and grew, pressing the regime to repeal restrictions on the freedom of speech and press, which were both protected under Taiwan’s Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423054">Rigger, 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, industrialization stimulated urbanization as workers moved from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors, causing the cities with populations of over 50,000 to increase by 10,941,000 persons within 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423054">Chang and Lin, 2005</xref>). In urban settings the traditional (informal) social control mechanisms began to break down. The values that solidified people in traditional society were replaced by materialism and individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423054">Lin, 2007</xref>). Under such dramatic transformations within a compressed timeframe, the overlap of declining and emerging values produced a multicultural phenomenon within Taiwanese society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423054">Lin, 2007</xref>). As individual privacy and rights were valued in a multicultural society, crime control, which formerly depended on collective and voluntary reporting from citizens, greatly declined. Crime reported by individual victims, therefore, became vital for crime control and prevention, which also gave rise to concern for victim reporting behavior within the criminal justice community.</p>
<p>The crime rate increased with growing economic affluence and democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423054">Shu, 2002</xref>), which triggered organizational changes in policing. In the 1970s, Director General Kong Ling-Cheng adopted the standards of professionalism developed by an American scholar, OW Wilson, to replace outdated police policies and procedures, and to modernize police equipment and technology. The ‘110 calling system’ (equivalent to 911 in the US) was accordingly established to streamline crime reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423054">Kuo, 2001</xref>). In 1995, the National Police Agency required the police to issue a confirmation copy of the crime report to victims. Presently, people who report crime can track their reports and police action online, which has further enhanced accountability but has pushed the reporting system to more formalized and impersonal levels.</p>
<p>Despite major changes, empirical research on crime reporting behavior has been given little attention in Taiwan. Through tremendous and sudden economic, political and social changes, Taiwan’s social-structural context is converging with western countries. We therefore hypothesize that Black’s propositions, which were formulated in a western context, will also explain reporting behavioral patterns in modernized Taiwan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0268580911423054">
<title>Relevant studies</title>
<p>Studies that have explicitly or implicitly tested Black’s general theory of law have produced mixed results. The following illustrate some prior research that related victims’ reporting patterns to the various social structures proposed by Black.</p>
<p>Making use of aggregated data of various crime types from the National Crime Survey data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang (1979)</xref> applied cross-tabulation and found weak relationships between Black’s five aspects of social life and victims’ reporting behavior. Affluent people, for example, did not necessarily contact the police more than poor people when they fell victim to crime. The only morphological finding consistent with Black’s propositions was that married persons were more likely to report crime to the police than single persons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423054">Braithwaite and Biles (1980)</xref> claimed the results obtained from Australian national crime victims data were mostly similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang’s (1979)</xref> study. They concluded that Black’s propositions were partially supported. With the data of the National Crime Victimization Survey (1992–4), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al. (1999)</xref> studied victims’ decisions to call the police for various crimes and the police’s decisions to arrest. The authors concluded that the social predictors suggested by Black did not uniformly apply across all legal stages. The victims who were poor actually called on the police more than did middle-class victims, but reported victimizations of wealthy people resulted in more arrests than did those of poor victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>). Focusing on reporting behavior of fraud victims, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al. (2001)</xref> conducted a telephone survey of residents of Knox County, Tennessee. They found that lower-class citizens invoked more law than the middle-class citizens, agreeing with preceding research, but contradictory to the proposed theory. Reflecting on the group differences in arrest rates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al. (2001)</xref> concluded that older and better educated victims appeared to have ‘accumulated more legal capital than others’, as hypothesized.</p>
<p>Two studies on victims’ mobilizing government response that did not directly test Black’s theory of law also demonstrated mixed findings. Using several different theories and adopting social-structural characteristics proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423054">Kaukinen (2002)</xref> examined how gender and victim–offender relationship correlated with victims’ help-seeking strategies. The author found that men were more likely to report an attack to the police than women, supportive of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black’s (1976)</xref> assertion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al. (2007)</xref> integrated Black’s behavior of law into a hierarchical model to explicate victims’ reporting behavior in Tianjin, China, finding that the measures of victims’ social status (e.g. age, gender and income) exhibited little effect on reporting.</p>
<p>While inconsistent support for Black’s theory is common in previous research, both in western and eastern countries, some notable limitations have appeared in the previous research as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang’s (1979)</xref> research aggregated the reporting behavior for various crime types that masked the effect of specific reporting behavior for a variety of personal and property crimes. They also applied bivariate analysis, which did not control for confounding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>). A similar issue was raised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423054">Braithwaite and Biles’ (1980)</xref> analysis, which used descriptive percentages that were unable to factor out the confounding influences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al. (2007)</xref> gathered data that covered victimizations over the previous five years to overcome low numbers of victimization. While the longer time interval increased victimization counts, the potential loss of validity from telescoping or fading memory is well known.</p>
<p>Of the few studies on reporting behavior conducted in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423054">Chiu, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423054">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423054">Chiu and Chuan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423054">Chiu and Sheu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423054">Sheu and Chiu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423054">2006b</xref>), many suffered from methodological shortcomings. Most of these studies have relied on small samples (from eight to 20 subjects) that were purposely chosen, which discredited their generalizability. The only study on reporting behavior with a large sample (533 property victims) was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423054">Chiu (2007)</xref>, extracting the data from the first large-scale Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey in 2000. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423054">Chiu (2007)</xref> found that female and young burglary victims were more likely to report their victimizations than males and older victims. Larceny victims holding higher educational attainment were more likely to report the crime than those with lower education. In spite of the impressive sample size used in Chiu’s study, the original data source has been criticized for having overly complex items, confounding household victimizations and self-reports, and for being unable to accurately estimate the dark figure of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423054">Huang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423054">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2005 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey was the source of data for the current study, which asked about respondents’ personal victimization experience for one year prior to the survey. The 2005 victimization data contained items that applied to many of Black’s social-structural domains, enabling this study to examine reporting behavior in a theoretically grounded manner. The large sample size also made it possible for this study to adopt a crime-specific approach to better control for potential pattern variations in reporting behavior. By examining victim reporting behavior for three different crimes, assault, robbery and burglary, this study was able to compare relationships between Black’s social dimensions on a range of crimes against persons and property.</p>

<title>Data and methods</title>
<p>The 2005 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey utilized a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) system to interview respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423054">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>). The interviews were monitored and recorded throughout the data collection period from 18 February to 15 April 2005 in order to reduce interviewer errors and elevate the quality of interviews.</p>
<p>This survey involved multistage sampling that covered all 23 cities and counties in Taiwan. Each city or county was divided into three hierarchical administrative strata, including townships, cities and districts. Sampling units were selected from each stratum in proportion to the population. The survey was conducted on households with one respondent over the age of 12 in each chosen household being interviewed. If there was more than one eligible respondent in the household one was randomly selected to be interviewed. The chi-square goodness of fit test was run during the investigation to check the representativeness of the selected samples. No significant difference in age and gender was discovered between interviewees within each stratum and that stratum’s population. The investigation successfully collected 18,064 valid surveys with a response rate of 72.2 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423054">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0268580911423054">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>The present study selected only victims of larceny, robbery and assault. Larceny refers to taking items from others without their knowledge, including stealing of bicycles and taking items from automobiles. Robbery is defined as taking items from others by using force or threat of force. Assault means to intentionally cause physical injury or injury to the health of another. The dichotomous dependent variable was whether victims reported the designated crime to the police, with reporting coded as 1 and not reporting as 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0268580911423054">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The independent variables were selected from indicators in the data that were related to Black’s five social dimensions. The following discussion defines each social dimension and indicates how each are operationalized in this study. The organization dimension is not included because the data set did not provide data from which a measure of organization could be derived.</p>

<title>Stratification</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> assumed that social rank varied positively with the quantity of law. This implies that those with higher socioeconomic status have greater access to law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), and socioeconomic status was affected by gender, race and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes, et al., 2001</xref>). Race is not relevant as Taiwanese are racially homogeneous. Following Black’s theory and previous studies, this study hypothesized that people who are wealthy, male and old are more likely to invoke law than those who are poor, female and young because of their higher socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al., 2001</xref>). The variables measuring stratification in this study included victims’ family income per month, gender and age. Income was collapsed into three levels from nine optional responses: US$1212 or less (= 1); between US$1212 and US$2424 (= 2); and more than US$2424 (= reference group). Gender was defined based upon biological attributes, female = 0; male = 1. Victims’ age was an ordinal variable with 14 response categories in the original dataset, ranging from 12 to over 70 years old. These fourteen response categories were divided into three groups: 12–34 years old (= 1); 35–54 years old (= 2); and over 54 years old (= reference group).</p>

<title>Morphology</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> related morphology to centrality in social life. The more people are integrated into the social mainstream the greater their access to legal resources. Married people are considered to be more socially integrated than singles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). It is hypothesized that married people are more likely to seek police intervention than the unmarried when victimized by crime. In the present study, morphology was measured by victims’ marital status, which comprised six categories and was collapsed to two groups: 0 = not married (including never married, widowed, separated, or divorced); and married or cohabiting (= 1).</p>

<title>Social control</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> predicted that social control is inversely related to law. He (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>: 110) argued that ‘private settings have more social control than public settings and thus less law’. Following Black’s postulate, indoor settings are more informally protected than outdoors. Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>: 110) also stated that law ‘varies with the hours of the clock’ and as people rest at night, social control relaxes and law increases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al. (1999)</xref> explained this might be due to people’s daytime behavior being more closely monitored through interpersonal interactions, leading to fewer crimes occurring and fewer calls to the police. Two variables were employed to measure social control. The first was whether the crime occurred in a public or private location. There were eight optional responses in the question item, from the greatest level of informal social control in private areas (e.g. in the home) to the least informal social control in public areas (e.g. on the street). Replicating the measurements used in past research, the relatively ‘structured’ and protective environments were classified under the category of private locations entailing home, in front of home, offices and schools (= 0), and the areas with less notable features were placed under the category of public locations encompassing the street, train stations, markets, airports and other public places (= 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423054">Gottfredson and Hindelang, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423054">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>: 253). The second variable reflecting social control was whether the crime occurred during the day or at night. A substantial number of larceny victims expressed that they did not know when the crime occurred (<italic>n</italic> = 117; 5.8 percent). These victims were included in the analysis as a separate group. This variable was classified into three clusters: crime occurred during the day (= 1); time of occurrence is unknown (= 2); and crime occurred at night (= reference group).</p>

<title>Control variable</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> argued that the quantity of law varied according to his five proposed dimensions of social life, regardless of the characteristics of crime. This research utilized the gravity of the offenses to test his argument. If Black’s argument holds true, there would be no significant association between the seriousness of crime and crime reporting. This control variable was stated in a different manner due to the nature of the offenses and the availability of the information. Given approximate dollar value lost to measure the level of seriousness in larceny and robbery victimizations, the control variable for larceny and robbery was categorized as: &lt; US$60 (= 1); US$60–US$300 (= 2); and &gt; US$300 (= reference group). The greater amount of monetary loss resulting from larceny and robbery, the higher the likelihood for victims to report the crime to the police. Offense gravity for assault was dichotomized to two levels: serious (= 1); and not serious (= 0). It was assumed that the gravity of assault was positively related to reporting behavior.</p>

<sec id="section13-0268580911423054">
<title>Analysis plan</title>
<p>Logistic regression was applied separately to each of the three offenses in order to analyze the relationships between respondents’ reporting behavior and the independent and control variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> contended that all his proposed aspects of social life shared equal weight in accounting for the use of law and treated them as distinct theoretical categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423054">Copes et al., 2001</xref>). Our analysis was performed in two stages to test Black’s contention. First, each social-structural category was regressed individually against reporting behavior with crime seriousness as a control variable. The rationale for this was to test whether the dimensions were independent by comparing the coefficients of individual models against the coefficients of the dimensions to those in the second stage.</p>
<p>The second stage of the analysis involved a full model that regressed Black’s dimensions and the crime seriousness control variable against crime reporting. If Black’s contention of independence among dimensions holds true, the regression coefficients for each dimension in the full model should be similar to the coefficients for the corresponding dimensions reported in the first stage. Higher levels of covariation among dimensions would result in more pronounced differences in the regression coefficients, increased variance inflation and reduced significance levels.</p>
<p>Each offense analysis in the first stage, thus, included four logistic regression models, one for each of Black’s social dimensions and crime seriousness. Prior to proceeding to analysis, the data were screened for collinearity (<italic>r</italic> &lt; .65) and outliers. No violations of either assumption were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423054">Pallant, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423054">Table 1</xref> outlines the descriptive statistics for reporting crime and social-structural variables analyzed in this study. Crime reporting rates varied across the three offenses: larceny being reported the least (24.6 percent), followed by assault (38.8 percent) and robbery (58.6 percent). The tendency that personal crimes (assault and robbery) were reported to the legal system at a higher rate than the property crime (larceny) paralleled the reporting patterns shown in the data for the US and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423054">Maston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). In the victimization data gathered in Tianjin City, China, the reporting rates for personal theft, assault and robbery were 19 percent, 55 percent and 61 percent, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423054">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Assault</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423054">Table 2</xref> displays the results for reporting assault to the police. Of the stratification variables (Model I), income was the only significant variable. The victims with low and medium family income were around 78 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .215) and 81 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .194) less likely to report assaultive offenses to the police than those with high family income, which is consistent with the hypothesis. Age, gender and the seriousness of assault exhibited no significant effect on crime reporting. Two measures in Model II (morphology) were significant in relation to crime reporting. Unmarried victims and the victims who did not perceive the crime as serious were both 61 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .385) less likely to notify the police than married victims and the victims who rated the crime as serious. While the marital status result was in consonance with Black’s thesis, crime seriousness was inconsistent as Black did not accept situational variables involving personal value and perception. Education as a proxy for culture (Model III) demonstrated a non-significant result but the seriousness of crime (control variable) remained significant. The likelihood of reporting assault for those who considered the crime to be not serious was almost 58 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .416) less than for those victims who rated the crime as serious. In Model IV time of occurrence and the seriousness of infraction reached statistical significance levels at .01 and .05, respectively. The odds were that the victims who experienced assaultive attacks during the daytime would report their crime around 84 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .159) less than for those who experienced assaults at night, supporting the hypothesis. The victims who reported that their victimization was not serious were about 62 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .377) less likely to report than those victims who reported their victimization as serious.</p>

<p>In the full model, notably, all significant variables in each individual model remained significant with slight changes in effect. Moreover, all significant social-structural variables moderated reporting behavior in the expected direction. In other words, the victims who were wealthier, married and who experienced an assaultive attack at night reported the crime to the police more than those who were less wealthy, not married and were attacked during the day. Crime seriousness, as a controlling variable, also consistently exhibited a significantly positive effect across all models except for the stratification category.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423054">Table 3</xref> summarizes the logistic regression of robbery on the independent variables. In Model I (stratification), other than the control variable, the only significant variable was gender. Female robbery victims were about three times (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 3.356) more likely than male victims to report their victimization, contradicting the proposed hypothesis. The results of the control variable revealed a positive relationship between the amount of monetary loss and reporting likelihood. The victims losing more than US$300 and between US$60 and US$300 were respectively about six times (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 6.354) and three times (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.952) more likely to inform the police than the victims who lost below US$60. In Model II (morphology) and Model III (culture), marital status and education were significantly related to reporting with the directions as hypothesized. Place of occurrence in Model IV (social control) presented no significant effect on police reporting but time of occurrence demonstrated that daytime robberies were two times (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.097) more likely to be reported than robberies that occurred at night, contradicting the hypothesis.</p>

<p>In the full model, the significant differences in the odds of reporting behavior by marital status (Model II) and time of occurrence (Model IV) disappeared once all social dimensions and the control variable were introduced. This indicated that the covariation of morphology and social control with reporting behavior were mediated by other theoretical categories. This challenged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black’s (1976)</xref> assertion of the equal importance of each conceptual category, implying that the assertion might not be completely sustained, and that some theoretical categories might provide stronger predictions of law for reporting some types of crime but not for others.</p>
<p>The two significant social-structural variables in the full model were gender and education. The coefficient for gender did not follow the hypothesis but the education coefficient did. Female victims were almost three times (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.799) more likely to report robbery than male victims. The likelihood of reporting was 73 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .270) less for victims with less education than for those with more. The seriousness of crime revealed consistent patterns in all models in which the more victims lost in the crime the more likely they would be to report it to the police. In summary, victims who were female, who were college educated and experienced greater loss expressed a greater willingness to contact the police than victims who were male, with less than a college education and who lost less.</p>

<title>Larceny</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0268580911423054">Table 4</xref> shows the results of separate analyses of larceny on each and all social categories. In Model I (stratification), age and the control variable were significantly associated with larceny reporting. The victims belonging to younger age groups (12–34 and 35–54 years old) were 25 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .745) and 37 percent (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = .626) less likely to report larceny victimizations than those older than 55 years. This result agreed with the theoretical prediction. Education (culture), place of occurrence and time of occurrence (social control) significantly covaried with reporting behavior, when tested alone with the control variable. The directions between reporting and the significant variables followed the hypotheses. The control variable (seriousness) showed a significant effect on reporting in all models. For victims suffering larceny losses of more than US$300 and US$60–US$300, the likelihood for them to notify the police was higher than those suffering a loss of less than US$60, approximate six times and three times, respectively, across models.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic> served as a general theory for explaining aspects of social life in relation to the structural elements of a society without recourse to human minds, thoughts, feelings and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423054">Black, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423054">Lu and Miethe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner, 2002</xref>). Taiwan’s comparable level of modernization with the West provided a non-western setting to test Black’s theory of law. This study was the first attempt to partially utilize Black’s theory of law as a theoretical foundation to examine variation in reporting crime victimization to the police in Taiwan. Some findings supported Black’s propositions, but some significant and contrary findings were also produced.</p>
<p>The significant theoretical categories conforming with the predicted expectation in the full model for the three types of crimes included income, marital status and time of occurrence for assault; education for robbery; and age (35–54 years old), education, place and time of occurrence for larceny. The poor (stratification) and unmarried victims (morphology) were less likely to contact the police about assaultive victimizations than affluent and married victims, which, from Black’s perspective, would be due to their lower social status and deviation from the center of social life. Reporting was more likely for crimes that occurred at night than during the day, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black (1976)</xref> rationalized as a consequence of informal social control being dormant when people were asleep. Robbery and larceny victims with lower educational attainment (culture) were less likely to report the offense to the police than the victims with higher educational attainment, because educated people tended to be ‘litigious’, engaging formal social control rather than seeking informal remedies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>: 64). The younger larceny victims did not mobilize law as much as their older counterparts, again due to their lower social status. Moreover, larceny crimes taking place in public places were reported to the police more than those that occurred in private places because more formal social control was exercised in the public than the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the significant variables, the only social-structural variable running counter to the hypothesis in the full model was gender (stratification) for robbery reporting, in which females were nearly three times more likely to report than males (Exp(<italic>B</italic>) = 2.799). This might be related to victim–offender relationships, which is reflected in the notion of ‘relational distance’ taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">Black’s (1976)</xref> ‘morphology’ perspective. Black defined morphology as ‘the distribution of people in relation to one another’ and ‘intimacy’ constituted one of the components in the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423054">1976</xref>: 37). Black assumed that relational distance determined the quantity of law; the less intimate the relationships between people, the greater the degree of legal intervention would be introduced. The literature has provided empirical evidence relevant to this assumption. According to data from the 1993 Canadian Violence Against Women Survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423054">Gartner and Macmillan (1995)</xref> discovered that regardless of types of violence, intimate violence was the least likely to be acknowledged to the police. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423054">Felson (2000)</xref>, in his self-reports of violent disputes that were reported to the police, found that the effect of gender diminished as relational distance was considered. Women were more reluctant to seek legal assistance when their assailants were acquaintances rather than strangers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423054">Pino and Meier’s (1999)</xref> study on gender differences in rape reporting found that the odds for women to report rape doubled in cases involving unknown assailants. This result echoed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423054">Kaukinen’s (2002)</xref> study that female victims frequently reported assaultive attacks committed by unknown perpetrators to the police, but sought informal means when dealing with assaults committed by their intimate partners. Victimization surveys have consistently shown that robbery is more likely to be committed by strangers than are other violent crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423054">Janhevich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423054">Maston, 2010</xref>). Females’ motivation to contact the police, therefore, might have been enhanced since robbery was mostly committed by strangers on the street.</p>
<p>The findings showed that social dimensions might have differential weight in accounting for reporting behavior for different crime types, which contradicted Black’s assertion of equal importance of each social dimension. This raises a question regarding the generalizibility of his theory. To illustrate, marital status (morphology) and time of occurrence (social control) in robbery and the 12–34 age group (stratification) in larceny were significant when analyzed individually but became non-significant as all variables were entered in the full model. The equal assertion and the generalizability may be further challenged by the inconsistent effects across crime types. Income (stratification), marital status (morphology) and time of occurrence (social control), for example, contributed to accounting for assault, but not robbery. Furthermore, there were null effects for social dimensions across all three investigated crimes, strengthening the notion that Black’s theory may explain some reporting behavior, but not all. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423054">Avakame et al.’s (1999)</xref> study, in which they noted that Black’s theory might not be able to universally and uniformly generalize the diverse behavior of law.</p>
<p>The control variable demonstrated positive and significant correlations with the decision to report crime for all three crime types. The strong effect of the variable ‘crime seriousness’ and the coexistence of statistical significance of Black’s social dimensions in this study might imply the hierarchal relationship between social-structural and social-psychological variables. Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423054">2004</xref>: 14) stated that the behavior of law was explained and predicted corresponding to its ‘location and direction in social space’ – its ‘social geometry’, which defined the social context in which law and legal actions unfold. Social structure forms the context for social action, which is typically mediated by other, more direct, social-psychological factors, such as the severity of infraction. Black’s ‘pure’ sociological approach has value in forming the broad social context of social action but, as others have concluded, is insufficient as an explanation of individual behavior which is more directly influenced by social-psychological effects, such as the seriousness of the crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423054">Greenberg, 1983</xref>). Turner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">2002</xref>: 667) commented that Black made efforts to consolidate theories and created a grand theory, rather than focusing on middle-range theories involving ‘the motivational and social psychological dispositions of actors’, as many sociologists do. Turner’s statement provides an illustration for our reasoning of the hierarchical relationship between social-structural and social-psychological variables.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to extend research on reporting behavior to a non-western context with a partial application of Black’s behavior of law thesis. The findings partially support Black’s theory of law, implying that his theory may not be as comprehensive as he claimed and other aspects of variables may need to be considered as well.</p>
<p>As this research added some understanding to the topic studied and to the literature evaluating Black’s theory of law, limitations in several areas emerged. First, the unavailability of the information on constructing Black’s organizational dimension rohibited this study from testing the impact of organization on the quantity of law. The lack of data on victim–offender relationships also left the explanation for gender differences in reporting robbery unverified. Third, a small size of assaultive (<italic>n</italic> = 103) and robbery (<italic>n</italic> = 157) victimizations in the study reduced the statistical power of the social-structural variables. Moreover, Black’s framework is highly general and is intended to apply to all law, contexts and times. This study only tested part of Black’s propositions within a one-year time period. How reporting behavior varies over time with a complete model of Black’s theory of law remains untested. Fifth, some confounding factors were not controlled in this study because of inadequate information on the necessary variables. Caveats should be made, therefore, when results of this study are interpreted. It is also important for future studies to improve on these limitations so the factors and mechanisms that shape respondents’ reporting behavior can be further explicated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner (2002)</xref> stated that Black has done his job of developing a general theory, and established a conceptual framework for understanding the application of law that transcended the scope of middle-range social-psychological theories. It is now time for researchers to test his theory to make the discipline a more ‘mature and respected science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423054">Turner, 2002</xref>: 667). This study has generated results that both supported and challenged Black’s <italic>Behavior of Law</italic> theory and will hopefully contribute to further refinements of these concepts.</p>
