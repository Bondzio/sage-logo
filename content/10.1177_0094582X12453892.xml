<p>Martins and Galli have organized an anthology focused on major issues and changes in the international capitalist and global system. They bring together scholars from diverse countries and academic disciplines to question the role of multilateralism in a moment of great changes in the balance of power. Specifically, they seek to understand how international finance institutions have intervened and influenced governments and civil society. They are particularly interested in alternative political and developmental endeavors in South America, where new progressive regimes and alternative regional institutions are seeking autonomy and threatening to break up the world system. Further, they wish to study the uneasy relations between multilateral institutions and nation-states in an era of financial instability. The essays mix historical analysis with empirical research and theoretical reflection. The authors represent various South American nations (Argentina [2], Brazil [3], Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela), as well as Australia, England, and the United States (2), and a number of disciplines (political science, economics, sociology, history, international relations, and educational science).</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections. The first analyzes the international system of finance, with useful essays by Galli, offering a historical view of the origins and evolution of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and pondering the prospects for these institutions when capitalism is in crisis; by João Márcio Mendes Pereira, analyzing the intellectual production of the World Bank and its influence through research and publication; and by Susan Park, tracing the activism of militant environmentalists and their positive influence on public policy. The second section looks at case studies in South America and national and regional resistance to international financial institutions. Pablo Dávolos examines the neocolonial practices of international agencies in Bolivia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Paraguay, and Ecuador. Mônica Martins and Sergio Daniel Pistolesi delve into the Argentine crisis of 2001, which produced a break with international agencies and reform at the level of state and nation. Héctor Mondragón turns to agriculture in Colombia and points to the tendency for World Bank credits to favor the latifundio. Finally, Marília Fonseca focuses on the ideological and financial influences of the World Bank on education in Brazil. The final section concerns regional initiatives, with an essay by Atilio Borón on the capitalist crisis and analyses by Pia Riggirozzi on the tendency toward post-neoliberal regionalism in Latin America, by Reinaldo Rojas on the ideological origins of the Bolivarian revolution (1992–2010), by Martin Hart-Lansberg on the Alianza Boliviariana para las Américas, and by Immanuel Wallerstein on the contradictions in the Latin American left.</p>
<p>This book contributes to an understanding of the role that international organizations play in the current global crisis. Readers should also find it helpful in considering the prospects and alternatives for South American multilateral agencies.</p>
