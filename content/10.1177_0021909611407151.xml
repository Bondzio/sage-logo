<abstract>
<p>Based on household food security surveys conducted in Ethiopia, this study seeks to understand the roles and limitations of income transfer projects as determinants of households’ food security. By covering the Food-For-Work Programs (FFWPs) and the Productive Safety Net Programs (PSNPs), the study shows that these programs served as temporary safety nets for food availability, but they were limited in boosting the dietary diversity of households and their coping strategies. Households which participated in the programs increased their supply of food as a temporary buffer to seasonal asset depletion. However, participation in the programs was marred by inclusion error (food-secure households were included) and exclusion error (food-insecure households were excluded). Income transfer projects alone were not robust determinants of household food security. Rather, socio-demographic variables of education and family size as well as agricultural input of land size were found to be significant in accounting for changes in households’ food security. The programs in the research sites were funded through foreign aid, and the findings of the study imply the need to reexamine the approaches adopted by bilateral donors in allocating aid to Ethiopia. At the same time the study underscores the need to improve domestic policy framework in terms of engendering rural local institutional participation in project management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper examines the roles and limitations of income transfer projects as determinants of food security of rural households in Ethiopia. It considers the extent to which food and cash-based income transfer projects accounted for the positive changes in the level of rural households’ food security. In agrarian countries where the majority of the poor live in rural areas with high degree of land fragmentation/degradation and rapid population growth, reforms such as agricultural land redistribution may not extend benefits to all. One reason is that these countries experience limited agricultural resource base. The most ‘intractable problem of development’ – landless households and those with access to small pieces of land as well as few assets – are easily affected during lean periods or seasonal weather variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611407151">Herring and Edwards, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>One strategy devised as a temporary welfare net is labor-intensive rural resource transfer and employment projects. They are known by different names as rural public works (RPW), employment generation schemes (EGS), income generation schemes (IGS), rural employment guarantee schemes (REGS), public employment schemes (PES), food-for-work projects (FFWP), productive safety net programs (PSNP) and so on. They aim to transfer income in the form of cash, in-kind payment, commodities and credits, as well as provide public goods through possible multiplier effects.</p>
<p>This study did not, however, compare the FFWPs and the PSNPs, nor did such an exercise have reliability due mainly to important differences in a range of aspects. The two interventions have similarities in their design and objective, even though various assessments including the official line maintain that this is not the case. The scope and timeline of the schemes differ, as do the payment method and scale of funding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611407151">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The assessment of household food security in this study is limited to changes in household dietary diversity score (HDDS) and coping strategy index (CSI). HDDS indicates the amount of food groups and items that households consume in a 24-hour period for seven days. CSI shows mechanisms that households adopt during food stress and shocks. The index mainly constitutes severity of mechanisms (based on ranking) and frequency of adoption (either weekly or monthly).</p>
<p>The findings of the current study show that income transfer projects alone did not account for changes in households’ food security in the research sites. Rather, education, family size and land access were found to be strong predictors of households’ food security. Controlling other predictors, an increase by one person in a household will have the probability of decreasing dietary diversity score (HDDS) and increasing coping strategy index (CSI) of households by 1.230 from the FFWPs and 1.983 from the PSNPs. Similarly, an increase by one year of schooling will have the probability of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households’ food security by 0.387 (FFWPs) and 0.458 (PSNPs). Finally, an increase by one hectare of agricultural land will have the likelihood of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households by 0.754 (FFWPs).</p>
<p>Gender in the form of household head was, as expected, negatively related to households’ food security even though the relationship was not statistically significant. Regarding water access, the majority of the households relied on rain, spring/well/borehole/pond. Only 27% (FFWPs) and 32% (PSNPs) had access to dam/irrigation. In addition, more than 62.2% (FFWPs) and 49.4% (PSNPs) of the households expressed fear of risk in taking credit, which did not have positive impact on the food security levels of households.</p>
<p>From a socio-political angle, the projects were characterized by exclusion and inclusion errors. Successive Ethiopian states view resources including foreign aid as important sources of power in mobilizing rural communities. Rural resource transfer programs, which are funded by foreign aid, are used by successive states in ‘how best to incorporate’ different groups, and particularly peasants of different regions, into the process of state formation and power consolidation. The projects are part of political and administrative decisions by the center (in the capital city or centers of major regions) on ‘who gets what when and how’. As recently as January 2010, opposition parties, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media openly accused the current ethno-political state of using resource transfer projects as political tools in excluding communities sympathetic towards the opposition. While this study was not able to substantiate claims of exclusions based solely on political grounds, administrative impediments and broader political goals of mobilizing rural communities appeared to influence the programs. This was also pointed out in July 2010 by the Development Assistance Group (DAC), an Addis Ababa-based body comprising 26 agencies, which recommended that existing systems that provide checks on ‘distortion for political gain’ should be strengthened further ‘through the generation and dissemination of information, independent monitoring, and the incentives which drive performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611407151">DAC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the FFWPs, from a total of 450 targeted and non-targeted households, 247 households or 54.8% were food-insecure in both research sites of Atsbi (Tigray) and Kalu (Wello). Out of the food-insecure households, 172 were successfully targeted, and 135 out of 203 food-secure households were included in the project. The percentage of under-coverage and leakage were 30.36% and 43.9%, respectively. In the case of the PSNPs, out of 178 food-insecure households, 109 were successfully targeted, and 122 out of 188 food-secure households were included in the project. The percentage of under-coverage and leakage were 38.76% and 42.02%, respectively.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the paper provides an overview of rural income transfer projects in Ethiopia. This is followed by a brief discussion of similar projects from other regions. The paper further discusses the methodologies used to assess the projects and provides the findings as well as the conclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021909611407151">
<title>Rural income transfer projects in Ethiopia</title>
<p>Several factors served as a drive towards adopting projects, particularly the FFWPs, as rural intervention strategies in Ethiopia. First, in line with the economic and institutional access argument, the FFWPs were seen as appealing alternatives in resource/income transfers. Second, concern about the negative effects of free relief distribution prompted policy makers to devise ways of making beneficiaries work for the payment they earn. The FFWPs were approached as ‘lesser evil’ in creating dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611407151">Kiros, 2005</xref>: 109–10). Finally, the largest share of emergency aid and the desire to link available resources to the creation of public goods through the FFWPs was another important factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611407151">Dercon, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The history of the FFWPs in Ethiopia dates back to the beginning of the 1970s through funding from the United States (US) food aid public law (PL) 480. The first bilateral food aid was through PL 480 in 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611407151">Lirenso, 1986</xref>). Conservation activities and small-scale road constructions were undertaken in the then Eritrea, Tigray and Wello provinces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611407151">Rahmato, 2003</xref>: 213–14). These were later expanded to bigger projects when the World Food Program (WFP; project 2,488) started one of the largest interventions in Africa. This coincided with the socio-economic and political changes in the country. First, Ethiopia was hit by one of the worst famines in the history of the African continent in the 1970s and 1980s. There was a belief that directing aid to areas that mainly accounted for the cyclical famine would be more pertinent than simple relief handouts. Deforestation, soil erosion, and micro-dam constructions were undertaken.</p>
<p>Second, gaining allegiance from the ‘rural’ and ‘peasants’ was seen as political strategies for consolidating the power of the Marxist state (1974–91), and countering armed oppositions operating in urban and rural areas. The ‘Land to the Tiller’ dictum necessitated visible and long-lasting projects specifically targeting highly food-insecure regions, which was an attempt to underscore a departure from the feudo-monarchial regime of Haile Selassie I (1930–74).</p>
<p>Third, the country was also exploring ways of coordinating and institutionalizing large flows of aid and mushrooming international NGOs through creating the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) in 1974. This was the first attempt in the history of the country. The projects also strengthened the role of government ministries and cadres in mobilizing the peasantry and controlling dissent.</p>
<p>The new government of Ethiopia that came to power in 1991 introduced the PSNPs in 2004. These programs were the biggest in Africa, which aimed at transferring resources by employing cash to food-insecure population in <italic>weredas</italic> (sub-districts) chronically affected in ‘a way that prevents asset depletion at the household level and creates assets at the community level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611407151">Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MoARD], 2006</xref>: 6). <italic>Weredas</italic> in eight regions of Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SPNN), Afar, Somali, rural Harari and Dire Dawa are classified as chronically food-insecure. Participation in the programs requires that these <italic>weredas</italic> have been receiving food aid for at least the last three years. From 2002 to 2007 there were 262 such <italic>weredas</italic>.</p>
<p>Household selection in these projects is carried out using administrative and community knowledge. Targeted households include those that have faced food shortage for the last three years, lost their assets and are unable to support themselves, and do not have any family support and other social protection. Additional criteria include land holding and its quality, food stock, non-farm income, and support/remittance from relatives or community. The food gap or the number of months of need for households is determined, first, by family size and number of dependents, and second, by household production in relation to monthly consumption requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611407151">MoARD, 2006</xref>). Targeting problems are addressed by community committees at the peasant association (PA) level. The PA selects participants and the process has to be reviewed and accepted by a general assembly. Complaints about the selection are referred to an appeal committee. Each able-bodied adult works for five days a month for every member of the household.</p>
<p>The programs have two components of public works and direct support (mainly for people with disabilities, widows and female-headed households). The main activities undertaken include water harvesting, irrigation, feeder roads, reclamation and rehabilitation of grazing land, agro-forestry, livestock activities and resettlement. Final decision is made by <italic>weredas</italic> in line with their needs. Activities in principle should take place on public lands. In general, the activities in the program should be labor-intensive (with a ratio of labor to capital of 20%, but depends on the <italic>wereda</italic> and activity covered), it can benefit communities and is acceptable to them, should be feasible, sustainable, productive (durable), environmentally sound and gender-sensitive. The planning and implementation of the programs follow elaborate bureaucracy and organizational taskforces from federal to regional, <italic>wereda, kebele</italic> (lower administrative organ) and then communities.</p>
<p>Few studies so far provided mixed assessments of the PSNPs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611407151">Andersson et al. (2009)</xref> found that the PSNPs increased areas covered with forest, but did not show any evidence of protecting or increasing important assets, mainly livestock. By categorizing households based on the amount of payment and type of total program participation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611407151">Gilligan et al. (2008)</xref> reported that households receiving any payment did not show any change, while households receiving at least US$9 improved their mean calories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611407151">Sharp et al. (2006)</xref> identified some concerns in terms of delay in payment, low success rate for appeals, arbitrary selection of beneficiaries for direct payment, skepticism in the program’s ability to address dependency problem, and mismatch between number of households in need of support and available resources for the program.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611407151">Nigussa and Mberengwa (2009)</xref> argued that the programs were fraught with corruption/nepotism, misguided selection, weak institutional linkages and less community participation. Grosh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611407151">2008</xref>: 420) viewed the PSNPs positively, and their qualitative and quantitative assessment showed that the programs improved well-being of beneficiaries. Specifically, the programs helped three out of five people from selling their assets for the purpose of buying food.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned background on rural income transfer projects in Ethiopia, the following section provides a brief review of past studies from other countries. It is possible to see that, while the projects attempted to address food insecurity of agrarian communities and households, most of the projects were used as temporary state welfare interventions while at the same time attempting to move agrarian populations into wage/industrial labor.</p>

<title>Review of projects in other regions</title>
<p>The earliest employment guarantee scheme at a state level was in Maharashtra state of India that started in late 1960s. It was extensively studied and replicated in other countries with large populations of poor people in the rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611407151">Sarma, 1989</xref>: 379; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611407151">Islam, 2006</xref>: 123). In addition to India, rural resource transfer and employment projects have also been practiced in other Asian countries with varying degree of success and scope. In Bangladesh the FFWPs started in 1975 funded by external donors until their decline by the end of the 1990s. The projects were used as one means to create employment and supply of food items for poor households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611407151">Ahmed et al., 1995</xref>: 46). After the 1998 floods, the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) program was introduced, which distributed cards that entitled beneficiaries to monthly food aid. The VGF was scaled up to include households hit by the 2007 <italic>Sidr</italic> (cyclones) paying 15 kilograms of rice per month and small-scale cash-for-work projects were undertaken targeting disaster victims and female-headed households.</p>
<p>In China the RPW/FFWP or <italic>yigon-daizhen</italic> (literally translated as ‘employment for redressing poverty’) were extensively used in the 1980s in rural areas with the objective of bridging the poverty gap between rural and urban areas following gradual economic reforms. Since 1999, China embarked on ambitious conservation programs called ‘Grain for Green’ that essentially use the FFWPs for increasing farmers’ income and enhancing environmental protection in degraded and vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>Pakistan undertook RPWs as well as People’s Works Programs (PWPs) which had their genesis in earlier local rural interventions in the form of Village Aid Program (VAP) during the 1950s and 1960s and India’s RPWs. Initially the projects targeted flood prone parts of East Pakistan (Comilla) through road construction and water drainage to improve the agricultural productivity of the region and income of farmers. They were enlarged to cover other parts of the country in later years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611407151">Gilbert, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611407151">Thomas, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>In most African countries resource transfer and employment generation projects were not practiced until the beginning of the 1980s. Resource transfer and employment creation projects took place in food-deficit rural communities and highly-vulnerable urban centers, and in-kind payments were the dominant form. The sources of funding were substantially external aid, and over half of the food aid given to the countries from the mid-1980s to the beginning of 1990s, for instance, was for natural disaster and internal conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611407151">von Braun, 1995</xref>: 263).</p>
<p>Cases from Botswana and Kenya showed that households with few assets and restricted private income transfer participated, and they were assessed to have enabled poor households to increase their net income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611407151">Assefa, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611407151">Teklu and Assefa, 1999</xref>). Mozambique introduced the food subsidy program during the end of the 1980s that consisted of cash transfer. Since then a combination of food rationing and cash transfers through program and project aid was found to have resuscitated the war-ravaged rural economy by serving as welfare to the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611407151">Sahn and Desai, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611407151">Tschirley et al., 1996</xref>). The 1991 National Agricultural Commission (CNA) in Rwanda also attempted to create off-farm income sources for households. The provision of agricultural inputs after the war to refugees in Goma during the mid-1990s was reported to support their calorie intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611407151">Borton et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Rural poverty and the question of resource (re)distribution marked the history of countries in South America. Agrarian reforms with strong state involvement were accompanied by external pressure for Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs). These were spearheaded by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that required the creation of RPWs, the FFWPs and rural safety net programs to address the high social costs. Comparatively, programs in South America stressed more on ‘social investment funds’ than countries in Asia and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611407151">Wurgaft, 1995</xref>: 223). States were highly involved in managing and directing food aid, as seen in the National Office of Food Aid of Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611407151">Lentz, 1999</xref>: 115). Bolivia, Chile and Peru also used RPWs as a strategy to tackle decline in labor demand due mainly to SAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611407151">Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 1993</xref>: 35). Particularly the Chilean program that set the wage of RPW at 70% of the national minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611407151">Franco, 2007</xref>: 424) was praised for its success in raising the mean income of the rural population in all deciles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611407151">World Bank, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Having the background on the experiences of rural resource transfer projects from other regions, the next sections directly go to explaining the methods used to assess the FFWPs and the PSNPs in Ethiopia followed by discussion of findings and conclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021909611407151">
<title>Assessment procedure</title>
<p>The sampling of households relied on common steps in sampling techniques of deciding on the sample unit (rural households), identifying the ‘universe’ or the population/group of interest (Atsbi in Tigray and Kalu in Wello), building the sampling frame (household lists), deciding on the sample size (project areas with targeted and non-targeted households), and choosing the sample (multistage or cluster sampling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611407151">Carletto, 2001</xref>: 79). Lists of households were available from local councils or sub-<italic>kebeles</italic> (<italic>baito</italic> in Tigray and <italic>tabia</italic> in Wello).</p>
<p>The surveys for the FFWPs (1995–2000) were conducted with frequent visits to the regions and 450 households were covered. Including the surveys for the PSNPs (2009–10) focusing on 300 households, longitudinal structured questionnaires, interviews with key informants, group discussions and personal observation were used to elicit information. In the absence of truly-experimental results, quasi-social experiments are taken as an attempt to understand the impacts of rural public works. Conventionally using before–after comparison is the best available method to appreciate the impacts of interventions on a treated group vis-à-vis a control (comparison) group. Yet the method has the risk of becoming misleading since it may reflect all the possible changes over the period of the intervention. These changes may be related to the impact of the intervention, or unrelated temporal events. One way of minimizing this bias is randomizing samples into treatment and control (comparison) groups. The latter is used as implied counterfactual.</p>
<p>For the design to be reliable, data both on the level of food security and other determinants should exist for the two groups before and after the project. The difference between the treatment group (in this case household targeted by the projects) and control group is assumed to be constant, or it follows parallel paths over time. This methodology is called difference-in-difference (DID).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611407151">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The validity of the DID approach is beset by two challenges. First, pre-targeting can be influenced by transitory shocks on households (or Ashenfelter’s dip). During the FFWPs there were drought and food stress, and the PSNPs were affected by both drought and the 2007–8 food price hikes in Tigray and Wello. Food price inflation in Ethiopia was 81.1% in September 2008, one of the highest in the world. It has reduced reserves to US $0.9 billion which is equivalent to 1.2 months of imports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611407151">IMF, 2009</xref>). Second, the interventions in principle intend to target households with worse food security levels. This has the potential of making the comparison with the control group difficult.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611407151">Table 1</xref> presents variable definition and descriptive statistics of the FFWPs and the PSNPs. Four models, including income transfer projects as a predictor, socio-demographic variables, economic/income determinants as well as agricultural input factors were used. The dummy variable of the level of food insecurity of households (FOODINSE) was assessed based on HDDS and CSI. HDDS of households below 6.00 and CSI above 107 were taken as a reference point to classify households as currently food-insecure. The values were based on the calorie intake for households classified as food-insecure with less than 2,100 Kcal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611407151">Ministry of Finance and Economic Development [MoFED]/Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia/United Nations Country Team [UNCT], 2002</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: <sup>a</sup>TLU = tropical livestock unit, which compares different kinds of livestock. One TLU represents approximately 250 kilograms of live-weight animal. 1 cattle = 1 TLU, 1 poultry = 0.005 TLU, 1 goat = 0.15 TLU, 1 horse = 1 TLU, 1 donkey = 0.65 TLU, 1 mule = 1.15 TLU, 1 camel = 1.45 TLU. TLU is imprecise in informing biomass because of variations in weights and species.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>HDDS was calculated by dividing the number of food items consumed with the total number of food items in each main food group and then multiplying it by seven (total observation day). The total score indicates the sum of the scores of the seven main groups. HDDS covers at least 0.1 gm from the main food items consumed. The data excludes food prepared, purchased and consumed outside the household as well as consumption/fasting during special occasions/festivals. In the research sites most adult males, especially husbands, ate alone or with their wives while other members of the households ate from one plate. Separate weighing or measurements of servings of food items were therefore difficult. Estimates were made from samples of servings consumed from the total population.</p>
<p>Research studies in various countries documented the contribution of HDDS as an important indicator of food security. Some of these include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611407151">Hatløy et al. (1998)</xref> in Mali, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611407151">Hoddinott and Yohannes (2002)</xref> in 10 developing countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611407151">Ogle et al. (2001)</xref> in Vietnam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611407151">Mirmiran et al. (2006)</xref> in Iran, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611407151">Ekesa et al. (2008)</xref> in Kenya.</p>
<p>The reliability and accuracy of HDDS has been questioned due to methodological problems. First, there is no universally-accepted standard as to what type of main food groups or food types to be used. Second, HDDS is able to show changes in dietary energy consumption of households, but it has not been easy to empirically show the significance of HDDS in nutrient adequacy. A number of research studies employed cut-off points based on sensitivity/specificity analysis as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611407151">Hatløy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611407151">Hoddinott and Yohannes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611407151">Torheim et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The CSI indicates the sum of the scores of each mean multiplied by the corresponding value of the severity from one to 11. CSI constitutes mechanisms rural households employ to tackle their food insecurity level. Adopting a coping strategy or set of strategies often occurs in a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611407151">Corbett, 1988</xref>). The strategies differ from country to country as well as from region to region and households depending on the availability of alternatives. Coping strategies of rural households can be classified as short-term or seasonal mechanisms where households will regain or replenish their assets during post-shock period, and strategies that have protracted/structural impacts and substantially erode assets which are difficult to regain. They indicate frequency and severity, signalling how often a strategy is employed and how serious the level of the food insecurity is, respectively. Yet seasonal CSI is bedevilled by the challenge that some food items which are consumed by food-insecure households may also be eaten by households with better food security status, because they just prefer or like the taste. This was less likely at least in the research sites due to socio-cultural factors, even though there is a need to substantiate this with further research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611407151">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021909611407151">3</xref> show the results of the logistic regression and the different models. The first model included project participation. The Wald statistic of 45.23 for the FFWPs and 52.35 for the PSNPs showed that it was significantly different from zero, thereby confirming that it could serve as a good predictor of the outcome. The values for Wald statistic for this predictor and for others, however, are not reported because of the inaccuracy associated in inflating the standard error when the values of the coefficients are large. Instead, the <italic>exp b</italic> is reported, which is the change in odds due to the changes in the independent variables. When the value of <italic>exp b</italic> is greater than one, it points out that, with an increase in the predictor, the odds of households’ food insecurity increase. On the other hand, a value less than one reveals when the predictor increases, the odds households’ food insecurity decrease. Thus, for a household targeted in the FFWPs and the PSNPs, it has the probability of increasing its HDDS and decreasing CSI by 0.234 and 0.409, respectively. The values for the confidence interval for the predictor were less than one. This increased the confidence that the values for the <italic>exp b</italic> in the population would fall within these ranges.</p>

<p>The −2 Log likelihood of the FFWPs and the PSNPs showed the strength or accuracy in predicting households’ food security. In other words, the value should be less when only the constant is employed in the regression. Compared to the model with only the constant, the FFWPs and the PSPNs improved the prediction accuracy of the model by 56% and 64%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611407151">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Controlling other variables, assessing the significance of the projects to seasonal coping strategies of households was done by looking into the extent the projects helped households adopt lower coping mechanisms, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021909611407151">Table 4</xref>. Comparing the seasonal coping strategies of targeted and non-targeted food-insecure households showed that the number of targeted food-insecure households that adopted higher coping strategies was smaller than non-targeted food-insecure households. Yet, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021909611407151">Figure 1</xref>, the projects did not show substantial difference in terms of lower coping strategies. This perhaps is an indication that dietary diversification was lower and most households were not able to access other food items.</p>

<p>The second model included the dummy household head (HEAD), family size (FAMSIZE) indicating the number of people living and eating together, and education (EDU) of the household head measured in year of schooling. Only family size and education were statistically significant. Controlling for other variables, an increase in the family size by one person has the probability of decreasing HDDS and increasing CIS of a household by 1.456 (FFWPs) and 1.592 (PSNPs). An increase in education by one year of schooling has the likelihood of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of a household by 0.342 (FFWPs) and 0.415 (PSNPs). The values for the confidence interval for the two predictors were greater and less than one, respectively. This increased the confidence that the values for the <italic>exp b</italic> in the population would fall within these ranges.</p>
<p>The Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test was 0.342 (FFWPs) and 0.478 (PSNPs), supporting the fact that the model predicted actual data well. The overall model accounted 49.4% (FFWPs) and 46.6% (PSNPs) of the variance in households’ food security. This suggested more than 50.1% (FFWPs) and 53.4% (PSNPs) of households’ food security were unexplained by the model.</p>
<p>The third model included agricultural inputs of farm size measured in hectares, cattle (oxen and cows) in tropical livestock unit (TLU), fertilizer use in kilograms and water availability constituting dam/irrigation. Only farm size and fertilizer use were found to be statistically significant in predicting households’ food security. Controlling for other variables, an increase in one hectare of land holding has the probability of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of a households’ food security by 0.788 (FFWPs) and 0.924 (PSNPs). Using one kilogram of fertilizer has the probability of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households’ food security by 0.276 (FFWPs) 0.452 (PSNPs). Possessing one TLU of cattle has the likelihood of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households by 0.410 (FFWPs) and 0.341 (PSNPs).</p>
<p>The values for the confidence interval for the two predictors were less than one, which increased the confidence that the values for the <italic>exp b</italic> in the population would fall within these ranges. The non-significant value of 0.329 (FFWPs) and 0.428 (PSNPs) suggested the model was reliable in predicting households’ food security.</p>
<p>The fourth model included economic/income factors, such as non-farm income measured in US dollars. These two predictors were found to be statistically significant in explaining households’ food security. Holding other variables constant, earning a dollar as non-farm income has the probability of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households’ food security by 0.747 (FFWPs) and 0.995 (PSNPs). Earning a dollar as credit has the likelihood of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households’ food security by 0.754 (FFWPs) and 0.99 (PSNPs). Besides, the FFWPs and the PSNPs were found to be statistically significant. Thus, if a member of a household participates in the programs, the household will have the probability of increasing its HDDS and decreasing its CSI by 0.331 (FFWPs) and 0.461 (PSNPs). The values of 95% confidence interval for all the three were less than one thereby increasing the accuracy that the values for the whole population would lie somewhere between these values. However, the confidence interval for credit was higher than one which lowered our confidence that the values would lie within the range for the whole population.</p>
<p>The economic/income model’s accuracy of predicting outcome households’ food security showed that the model improved by 25.434 (FFWPs) and 30.883 (PSNPs) from only when the constant was used. The model explained only 10.23% (FFWPs) and 7.92% (PSNPs) and Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test was significant, which showed that it was unreliable model (FFWPs = sig. .001; PSNPs = 0.021).</p>

<p>Controlling for other predictors, an increase by one person in a household will have the probability of decreasing HDDS and increasing CSI of households by 1.23 (FFWPs) and 1.983 (PSNPs). Similarly, an increase by one year of schooling will have the probability of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households’ food security by 0.387 (FFWPs) and 0.458 (PSNPs). Finally, an increase by one hectare of agricultural land will have the likelihood of increasing HDDS and decreasing CSI of households by 0.754 (FFWPs) and 0.693 (PSNPs).</p>
<p>The full model accounted 39.06% (FFWPs) and 45.52% (PSNPs) of the variation in the probability of households’ food security. The Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test showed a non-significant value of .196 (FFWPs) and .250 (PSNPs) confirming that this model reliably predicted households’ food security. The table in the output of the SPSS title ‘variables not in the equation’ table (not presented here) for the model showed that the predictors not included were all non-significant, which indicated their coefficients were significantly different from zero. The model if term removed output also showed all the significant predictors would have affected the accuracy and reliability of the models’ prediction had they been removed.</p>

<title>Discussion of findings</title>
<p>Both the FFWPs and the PSNPs showed exclusion and inclusion errors as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021909611407151">Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021909611407151">Figure 2</xref>. There is no available standard/threshold to classify an intervention as a failure or success in targeting beneficiaries. Ideally a project would need to have zero errors. Seen from conventional project assessment tools, it is self-explanatory that socio-economic exclusion accompanied by rent-seeking and capture of projects by local elites as well as relatively well-to-do beneficiaries reduce the efficacy of intended outcomes.</p>

<p>Interviewed households claimed bias in the selection process. Officials in <italic>kebeles</italic> as well as <italic>baitos</italic> and <italic>tabias</italic> emphasized that the process was mainly executed based on self-targeting. The high involvement of government bureaus and officials in implementation and evaluation of projects offered limited political space for other agencies to confirm and address some of the easier and short-term difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611407151">Bashaw, 2001</xref>). Interviewed households stated that households with relatively better food security status were part of the projects at the expense of more needy households, and there were cases where expectations for benefits in food payments led to intentionally avoiding/postponing agricultural activities (crop production). A large number of targeted households spent considerable time on the projects which could have been used for other activities. The activities (terracing, afforestation, road maintenance, borehole digging, and micro-dam construction) required intensive labor and some of the interviewed households claimed they did not eat for the whole day while participating in the projects.</p>
<p>Related to the positive and statistically-significant variable of education of this study, Yamano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611407151">2005</xref>: 285) reported in Ethiopia that each completed grade of mothers’ education in the household was linked to an additional 0.16 cm growth of children aged 25–60 months. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611407151">Christiaensen and Alderman (2004)</xref> also noted that the effect of female education was twice as more than male education by improving a child’s height-for-age score by 0.03. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611407151">Shamebo et al. (1994)</xref> in the Butajira Demographic Surveillance Site (DSS) also found out that parental illiteracy affected mortality of children under five. Mekonnen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611407151">2005</xref>: 24), however, indicated children of better educated male parents in Ethiopia were less stunted than better educated women parents. Measuring child mortality in the Tigray region based on parental education, the finding from Kiros and Hogan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611407151">2000</xref>: 447) showed the rate was the highest among children with illiterate parents and this was found to be more critical during famine or food stress.</p>
<p>Family size was inversely related to households’ food security, and households with large families tended to have lower food security levels. This was mainly due to increased need for more consumption, and most of the households were less capable of providing diverse diets to all members, and particularly children. This was contrary to the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611407151">Christiaensen and Alderman (2004)</xref> who reported that larger family size in Ethiopia led to better heights of children because such households would benefit from economies of scale as well as better experience in parenting.</p>
<p>Gender in the form of household head was, as expected, negatively related to households’ food security even though the relationship was not statistically significant. My previous study on gender and resource access and control in Ethiopia also showed female-headed households lagged in efficiently utilizing land resources thereby affecting their food security status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611407151">Bashaw, 2004</xref>). Identifying gender differences at the household level is an underlying feature of gender analysis with the potential to enhance the food security status of rural households, and most importantly the nutritional status of children. This was supported by empirical research in Jordan and Malawi by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611407151">Miles-Doan and Bisharat (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611407151">Castle (1995)</xref>, respectively. The finding in the current study was contrary to the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611407151">Nyariki et al. (2002)</xref> in Kenya where households headed by women were more food-secure.</p>
<p>Water access and its relation with food security were assessed based on the role of micro-dam/irrigation for agricultural productivity and food consumption. The majority of the households relied on rain, spring/well/borehole/pond. With an increase in the availability of micro-dams and irrigation systems (along measures to address complementary problems such as salinity and malaria prevention), water access would be expected to have a more positive impact than found in the present study. Water access and utilization was also associated with the prevalence of water-borne disease (diarrhea), water-based disease (bilharzias) and water scarce diseases (trachoma, scabies, flea- and lice-borne infections).</p>
<p>Regarding credit availability, more than 62.2% (FFWPs) and 49.4% (PSNPs) of the households expressed fear of risk in taking credit. This probably was due to their vulnerability and fragile assets in paying back loans (plus uncertain weather conditions) coupled with the strong social cohesion in which default leads to social ostracism. Poor households relied on informal lenders and traditional associations, such as <italic>Idirs</italic> (funeral associations) and <italic>Iquibs</italic> (rotating credit associations). The finding of this study was contrary to previous research covering 819 households in Ethiopia who participated in a microfinance program. That study suggested that, although there was no clear-cut enhancement of coping mechanisms, the program helped households improve their nutritional status and well-being (particularly females and their households).</p>
<p>For agricultural land size, the finding of the current study was in line with the bulk of previous empirical studies on Ethiopia that concur on positive outcomes. Regressed alone (by controlling other variables), land accounted for more than 60% (FFWPs) and 57.2% (PSNPs) of the variance in households’ food security. Since the ‘Land to the Tiller’ revolutionary motto of the Marxist state, land inequality has remained a serious issue with a Gini coefficient of 0.47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611407151">World Bank, 2005</xref>: vii). Particularly, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611407151">Setotaw et al. (2003)</xref> showed that, by holding land quality/soil fertility constant, a 32% of improvement in the level of food security was observed for each additional unit of land cultivated. This was further supported by the finding that a one hectare increase in land size would contribute to a decrease in food insecurity by 57.66% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611407151">Ramakrishna and Demeke, 2002</xref>: 139).</p>
<p>Fertilizer use was limited and, on average, households used 6.37 kilograms (FFWPs) and 10.23 kilograms (PSNPs) of fertilizer. This was too small compared to other African and Asian rural households. Access to cattle ownership was 2.6 (FFWPs) and 3.02 (PSNPs). On average 42.8% (FFWPs) and 39.02% (PSNPs) of the households had three TLU. Cattle ownership was limited given the large cattle population in the country and the importance of cattle ownership as a source of agricultural productivity, food consumption, and wealth ranking. More than 10% of the households did not own cattle. The average non-farm income was equal to the national per capita income of US$100, and the largest part of the income was indirectly earned through the sale of agricultural produce.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The underlying purpose of this paper was to examine the roles and limitations of income transfer projects in enhancing the food security of rural households. It looked into the extent that the food and cash-based income transfer projects accounted for positive changes in the level of rural households’ food security. It showed the urgency to address the core issue of food insecurity in the country, and the relevance of rural income transfer projects. The experience from other countries further showed the significance and challenges associated with implementing rural transfer projects.</p>
<p>The findings from the two field research sites in Ethiopia showed that income transfer projects alone did not account for changes in households’ food security in the research sites. Rather, education, family size and land access were found to be strong predictors of households’ food security. Increased focus on these sectors and redirection of the large inflows of humanitarian aid to address education, family planning and land conservation is expected to maximize the positive return to aid interventions in the country.</p>
<p>The finding of this study reinforces the significance of agriculture as an engine to economic growth of mainly low- and middle-income developing countries, particularly in addressing food insecurity, that was emphasized in the 2008 World Development Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611407151">World Bank, 2007</xref>). The sector will continue to be a source of livelihood for more than 75% of the world’s poor who live in rural areas. The agriculture sector is estimated to be four times more effective in reducing poverty by raising income than gross domestic product (GDP) growth from other sectors. This sector received 18% of total official development assistance (ODA) in 1979 and just 3.5% in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611407151">OECD, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611407151">World Bank, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the study suggested that income transfer projects would have efficient results with improved local participation in rural project management. While administrative constraints are easier to identify and tackle, broader political/institutional impediments appeared to be deep-rooted in the rural areas of the country.</p>
