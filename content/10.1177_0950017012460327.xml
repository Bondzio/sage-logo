<abstract>
<p>This article defends Richard Sennett’s sociology of work under ‘new capitalism’ against claims that his analysis lacks empirical foundation and methodological rigour. While studies of aggregate labour market trends in recent criticisms imply that predictions of an ‘end of work’ or ‘age of insecurity’ are premature, the article demonstrates that Sennett’s sociology is not committed to these predictions. Instead, his research provides a targeted critique of specific management practices and of those social transformations that share the same ethos. More constructively, Sennett’s sociology articulates a unique concept of workplace insecurity and raises pressing issues in contemporary <italic>experiences</italic> of work and citizenship, rather than – as critics presuppose - in workers’ contractual conditions as such.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A series of publications have taken aim at the perception in academic and general literature that contemporary work is becoming especially insecure or short-term (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460327">Auer and Cazes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460327">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460327">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre, 2007</xref>). Numerous sociologists are cited as academic promulgators of this perception, including Ulrich Beck, Manuel Castells, Anthony Giddens and Richard Sennett, all of whom putatively forecast an ‘end of work’ or ‘age of insecurity’, characterized by more temporary employment, shorter job tenure and widespread fears of job loss. According to critics like Doogan and Fevre, however, these sociologists have all made a fundamental error, because large-scale data reveals no structural shift towards more insecure or transitory work after all. If Doogan and Fevre are right, they provide a devastating critique of a wide range of influential sociological theories. Not only are numerous high-profile sociologists empirically uninformed, they are also unwittingly serving powerful state and corporate interests by portraying workers as more vulnerable to market discipline than they are in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460327">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, despite the wealth of evidence that Doogan and Fevre provide, it is puzzling that so many sociologists should have made the same basic oversight, especially given the diversity of theories that they critique. This article distinguishes the claims of one sociologist of work – Richard Sennett – from the broader ‘end of work’ and ‘age of insecurity’ theories with which he has been associated, and assesses his analysis more precisely. While Sennett has been criticized from various perspectives – for example, for being overly nostalgic for a bygone industrial age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460327">Strangleman, 2007</xref>) and for ignoring the potential for new human freedoms to emerge from contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460327">Joas, 2004</xref>) – this article focuses on only Doogan’s and Fevre’s claim that Sennett’s sociology is inconsistent with aggregate labour market data. The article argues that Doogan and Fevre misrepresent Sennett’s analysis overall, because Sennett’s research primarily evaluates changes in people’s <italic>experiences</italic> of work, rather than in their contractual conditions as such.</p>
<p>The article has five main sections. The first section reconstructs Doogan’s and Fevre’s criticisms of the ‘end of work’ or ‘age of insecurity’ hypotheses, while the second section demonstrates that Sennett’s sociology of work is not reducible to these claims. The article then reviews three issues that <italic>are</italic> central to Sennett’s sociology in light of Doogan’s and Fevre’s critiques: Sennett’s account of ‘new capitalism’ (in the third section); his critique of the <italic>ideology</italic> of new capitalism (in the fourth section); and his analysis of employment insecurity (in the fifth section). The article concludes by highlighting issues in contemporary workplace organization that Sennett’s research emphasizes.</p>

<title>New age nightmares?</title>
<p>While summations of ‘end of work’ and ‘age of insecurity’ hypotheses vary, the specific claims that Doogan and Fevre critique can be reconstructed using the main empirical criteria they apply. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460327">2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre (2007)</xref> use three main indicators to assess the state of employment across the UK, EU and OECD from approximately the mid-1980s to 2006:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0950017012460327">1</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list1-0950017012460327" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>types of employment contract (e.g. proportion of workers on temporary rather than permanent contracts);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>length of employment tenure (e.g. proportion of workers with the same employer for over 10 years); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>subjective job insecurity (e.g. workers’ perceived likelihood of losing their job in the next 12 months).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Doogan focuses on trends in long-term employment (LTE), while Fevre analyses changes across all three indicators. Consistent with other analyses over a similar period (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460327">Auer and Cazes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460327">Erlinghagen and Knuth, 2004</xref>), neither Doogan nor Fevre find an especially high incidence of, or growth in, insecure or transitory employment across advanced capitalist nations overall, or a sustained shift towards such employment types. While Doogan does find industry specific declines in LTE, these are concentrated in ‘old economy’ industries like mining and agriculture, rather than in the technology rich ‘new economy’ with which insecurity hypotheses are associated.</p>
<p>More recent data complicates Doogan’s and Fevre’s analysis, but does not repudiate their main argument. First, ever since the 2008 financial crisis, temporary employment has remained low and relatively stable in proportional terms, at 6.4 per cent of all workers in the UK in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460327">ONS, 2011</xref>: 24) and around 12 per cent in the OECD between 2007 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460327">OECD, 2011</xref>: 256). Second, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460327">Faggio et al. (2011)</xref> find – contra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan (2001)</xref> – that LTE in the UK steadily declined between 1982 and 2009, average job tenure and short-term employment remained stable, and so do not reveal a collapse in job tenure overall. Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460327">Green (2009)</xref> finds that subjective job insecurity declined internationally between 1997 and 2005 and, since these falls are statistically explained by changes in unemployment rates, that subjective job insecurity largely followed capitalist economic cycles. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460327">Chung and Van Oorschot (2011)</xref> find that cross national variation in subjective employment insecurity in Europe in early 2009 is explained by differences in unemployment and GDP growth rates. Hence, even increases in subjective insecurity post-financial crisis do not in themselves demonstrate that structural – rather than cyclical – changes have occurred in capitalist labour markets.</p>
<p>In summary, Doogan and Fevre argue that ‘end of work’ or ‘age of insecurity’ theories imply a large underlying increase in insecure or short-term contracts, or in perceived job insecurity, across advanced capitalist nations, or at least in a technology intensive ‘new economy’. However, since there are at most only cyclical or ‘old economy’ increases in these indicators, such claims are empirically false. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460327">2009</xref>) argues that inflated claims about workplace insecurity contribute to what he terms ‘manufactured uncertainty’: the social instability deliberately engendered by state policies that use market forces to discipline workers. By lowering workers’ expectations and inflating their perceived vulnerability, theorists like Beck, Castells, Giddens and Sennett may be inadvertently complicit in this process.</p>

<sec id="section3-0950017012460327">
<title>Sennett’s sociology of work</title>
<p>One reply to Doogan’s and Fevre’s critiques is to challenge their interpretation of the indicators cited above. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460327">Hazel Conley (2008)</xref> disaggregates UK labour market data to reveal a concentration of temporary work among women, ethnic minorities and migrants. Hence, she argues, Doogan and Fevre miss the <italic>significance</italic> of temporary employment for already marginalized social groups. This article develops a second reply to Doogan and Fevre, which is to argue that the empirical indicators they review are not valid tests of all the various theories they critique, and of Sennett’s sociology in particular. As this section explains, the main changes Sennett describes in the social organization of work are degradations of the work <italic>experience</italic>, which, he argues, harms workers’ character and relationships. Hence, Sennett’s sociology overlaps with an extensive body of literature which – like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460327">Harry Braverman’s (1974)</xref> famous critique of Taylorism – argues that capitalist <italic>production</italic> processes systematically damage workers’ well-being. Since these critiques focus on changing working conditions, they need not entail widespread transformations in aggregate labour market data.</p>
<p>More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett’s (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">2006</xref>) major texts on workplace reorganization primarily critique the dismantlement of large bureaucratic firms in favour of more ‘flexible’ management structures, characterized by flatter hierarchies, malleable workplace teams, project or network-based organization and short-term profit horizons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: chapter 3). While these management practices may <italic>accompany</italic> increased numerical flexibility (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: 23), they are also compatible with the relative stability in large-scale external labour market data that Doogan and Fevre report. For instance, both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460327">OECD (1999</xref>: chapter 4) and academic critics of insecurity hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460327">Auer and Cazes, 2000</xref>: note 19) find that certain flexible working <italic>practices</italic> increased over the period Fevre and Doogan review. In any case though, Sennett himself only ascribes the above workplace transformations to a sub-set of ‘cutting-edge’ firms, which comprise just ‘a small part of the whole [US] economy’ (2006: 10). Hence, his analysis of new production regimes does not entail a reorganization of work across either the entire US or OECD economies.</p>
<p>For Sennett, the harms flexible management practices cause workers stem from the destruction of routine work <italic>time</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460327">Smith, 2008</xref>). First, Sennett claims that unstable working groups undermine <italic>relationships</italic> between workers that require shared time to grow, of which relations of trust are a paradigmatic case. Trust in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett’s (1998</xref>: 141) sense requires long-term, collective time because it is a product of accumulated experiences rather than just hope, and, in particular, the experience of learning who can be counted on in a crisis. Flexible work teams undermine this type of trust overtly by creating shorter-term relationships, and more subtly by rewarding those workers who shift most seamlessly between contexts and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: 110). Almost by definition, such workers are weakly attached to others, because weak attachment is a prerequisite of easy movement from one work group to another.</p>
<p>Second, Sennett argues that flexible workplace practices degrade the work <italic>task</italic>, most notably by undermining the ‘craft’ aspiration ‘to do a job well for its own sake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2008</xref>: 9). Craftsmanship requires routine time in part because working well involves honing one’s skills through repetition. However, unlike stable working roles, project-based work rewards the capacity to continually <italic>adapt</italic> to new tasks rather than to progressively master just one: in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett’s (2006)</xref> terms, those with <italic>talent</italic> rather than craft. Craftsmanship also sits uneasily with a demand for quick profits, because good work may be less profitable than fast work in the short-term. For example, one computer programming firm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett (2006</xref>: 106) studies curtailed craftsmanship for profit by releasing products without proper testing, leaving their customers to test and report their products’ faults.</p>
<p>Third, Sennett argues that flexible work can damage workers’ self-<italic>identity</italic> or character. While it is not uncommon to represent capitalist production methods as harmful to work-based identities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460327">Braverman, 1974</xref>), Sennett’s unique critique stems from the ‘hermeneutic’ idea that people need to interpret their experiences within a coherent life narrative, which links their past, present and future actions into a larger, meaningful whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460327">Smith, 2008</xref>). In Sennett’s view, career paths support this type of self-understanding by providing a formal path of development and institutionalized recognition of one’s contributions and skills. By contrast, constant change in skills, colleagues and projects under flexible regimes undermines workers’ capacity to interpret their activities as a meaningful progression, rather than merely a haphazard series of events. Hence, workers in flexible working regimes risk directionless ‘drift’, where – in Sennett’s subject’s words – you are ‘always starting over’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>Of course these criticisms require evidence, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460327">Doogan’s (2005</xref>: 66) charge that Sennett provides ‘assertion rather [th]an analysis’ is not unprecedented (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460327">Fischer, 1978</xref>). However, while Doogan and Fevre only review large-scale data sets, Sennett’s critique is based on detailed interviews with workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460327">Sennett and Cobb, 1972</xref>) and qualitative workplace studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: chapter 4) over almost 40 years. Not only is there is a clear disjuncture between quantitative and qualitative studies of temporary employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460327">Conley, 2008</xref>), but Sennett (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460327">Sennett and Cobb, 1972</xref>: 40–46) has also stated explicitly that his interviews are not intended to be formally representative. Instead, Sennett argues that his interviews unearth aspects of people’s work experiences that large quantitative studies overlook, because they emerge from tensions or ambiguities in how people narrate their life experiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460327">Sennett and Cobb (1972)</xref> infer certain conflicts between achievement and solidarity in working class communities from workers’ tendency to describe their individual achievements in ‘passive’ terms (e.g. 1972: 193–6).</p>
<p>While Sennett’s more recent work lacks explicit methodological discussion, it displays this same basic strategy. For example, ‘Rico’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>) simultaneously disdains workplace ‘time servers’ and laments his incapacity to demonstrate long-term commitment to his children; for Sennett, this tension reveals a conflict between good work and good character that is typical of flexible working practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">1998</xref>: 31). Since Rico is not a representative subject he provides only indicative evidence of this conflict, and Sennett could more carefully observe this limitation. Nonetheless, since Sennett’s research methods specifically target aspects of workers’ experience that quantitative data would miss, Doogan and Fevre should at least assess his results. Such assessment is critical because – as the next two sections explain – Sennett’s interviews also provide indicative evidence for his broader <italic>social</italic> critique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012460327">
<title>Sennett’s ‘new capitalism’</title>
<p>While the concept of ‘new capitalism’ has been widely criticized (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460327">Doogan, 2009</xref>), there has been little analysis of precisely what this concept means for Sennett, or of how it relates to his qualitative research. Sennett’s new capitalism is best explained by contrast with ‘old’ or ‘social capitalism’, which, like many other sociologists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460327">Boltanski and Chiapello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460327">Castells, 2000</xref>), Sennett locates from the post-World War Two boom to the mid-1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2006</xref>: 6). While social capitalism partly denotes a familiar set of institutions – ‘strong unions, guarantees of the welfare state and large-scale corporations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett, 1998</xref>: 23) – the defining feature of this era is the order these institutions provided to social <italic>time</italic>. Sennett draws on Max Weber to elaborate: under social capitalism, large social institutions smoothed the economic instability of capitalist markets by sharing risk and helped alleviate social instability by providing mass employment within their extensive lower tiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">2006</xref>: 20–23).</p>
<p>Against this background, new capitalism has two interrelated dimensions. The first is a weakening of the large public and corporate institutions that collectively mitigate social risk and instability, as in decreasing union density, stricter welfare provisions and weaker commitment from large firms to providing mass employment. These shifts are partly driven by economic processes, such as the growing power of financial institutions seeking short-term profits relative to state and corporate managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2006</xref>: 37). However, and second, new capitalism also stems from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett (2006)</xref> terms a new ‘culture of capitalism’, but which also denotes a new <italic>ideology</italic> of capitalism in Boltanski and Chiapello’s sense: a change in the ‘shared beliefs [that are] inscribed in institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460327">2005</xref>: 3). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett (2006</xref>: 46) partly attributes stricter welfare provisions to the successful promulgation of an idealized image of the independent agent, which in turn ‘justifies’ attacks on the institutions of social capitalism for fostering dependency and stifling self-reliance.</p>
<p>Contra Doogan and Fevre, neither dimension of new capitalism entails empirically implausible claims. On the institutional side, credible trends include a decline in union density (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460327">Wilson, 2004</xref>), stricter limits on social welfare (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460327">Ladipo and Wilkinson, 2002</xref>) and a relative increase in the scope – and therefore influence – of national and international movements of financial capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460327">Castells, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460327">Ladipo and Wilkinson, 2002</xref>). Measuring ideological claims is more difficult, yet this second dimension of new capitalism overlaps with Doogan’s own concept of ‘manufactured uncertainty’, as when Doogan stresses:
<disp-quote>
<p>the critical role of government intervention to bring about the marketization of public services, the withdrawal or weakening of social protection system [sic], and the opening of national economies to international competition. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">2001</xref>: 439)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Doogan’s claim here is that certain types of social insecurity are consequences of deliberate policy choices, rather than the result of a passive erosion of state power by global economic forces. Yet Doogan’s alternative narrative – that social insecurity in the UK reflects ideology as much as economics – is consistent with Sennett’s account of new capitalism as inherently an ideological phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0950017012460327">
<title>Social critique and ideology</title>
<p>So ‘new capitalism’ is at least an empirically plausible concept, albeit not one that Sennett defends in depth. What remains unclear though is how Sennett defends his <italic>critique</italic> of new capitalism given that his subjects’ experiences are not even representative of widespread labour market practices. Presumably, it is this apparent mismatch between Sennett’s wide-ranging social critique and his small sample research that leads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre (2007)</xref> to interpret Sennett’s sociology as merely illicit generalizations from his own experiences: his own ‘nightmares’ writ large. However, what Fevre overlooks is that Sennett’s social critique targets the <italic>ideology</italic> of new capitalism, and it is this ideology that ‘cutting-edge’ firms are meant to reveal or (roughly) represent. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett (2006)</xref> states that he is ‘unabashedly inferring the <italic>culture</italic> of the whole from a small part of society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">2006</xref>: 12, emphasis added). In other words – like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460327">Boltanski and Chiapello (2005)</xref> once more – Sennett views flexible management practices as manifestations of the values that legitimate new capitalism, and which influence its development over time.</p>
<p>Sennett’s social critique focuses on one legimating value of new capitalism in particular; namely, an individualized concept of <italic>freedom</italic> from institutional restraint (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2006</xref>: 13). At the workplace level, this value is revealed in the implicit promise that dismantling bureaucratic hierarchies will liberate workers from Weber’s ‘iron cage’ of organized time. In response, Sennett uses his interviews and workplace studies to argue that this promise of freedom remains unfulfilled. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett (1998</xref>: 55) contends that far from dispersing power, flatter management structures concentrate power in the hands of fewer managers and the rhetoric of self-responsibility and ‘team-work’ merely obfuscates this fact. Meanwhile, by weakening workers’ attachments to each other and their crafts, flexible working groups undermine the human bonds that substantive autonomy requires. Thus, Sennett claims, ‘revulsion against bureaucratic routine and pursuit of flexibility has produced new structures of power and control, rather than created the conditions which <italic>set us free</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">1998</xref>: 47, emphasis added).</p>
<p>If Sennett’s research demonstrates that the freedom promised by new workplace practices proves illusionary, then – so his analysis suggests – the promise of freedom on the same basic terms from defenders of new capitalism is also called into question. It is almost trivial to observe that – like new forms of work – neo-liberal politics has long been sold as liberating citizens from overbearing institutions like the state (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460327">Friedman, 1982</xref>). More specifically though, Sennett writes that the ‘values of the new economy have become a reference point for how government thinks about dependence and self-management in health care and pensions, or again about the kind of skills the education system provides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">2006</xref>: 8). Hence, just like corporate ‘time servers’ in the flexible firm, citizens who cannot navigate market-based health care or education find little assistance or support, partly because an inability to adapt is itself a moral failing in the new normative order (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2006</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>In response, part of Sennett’s argument is that in contemporary capitalism new – but no less compelling – forms of control replace the old: like the ‘self-discipline’ of the autonomous work team, the ‘soft-power’ of the market is no less forceful for lacking a figure-head. More fundamentally though, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">Sennett (1998</xref>: 63) contends that genuine freedom under new capitalist regimes requires people who can feel <italic>at home</italic> in institutions that persistently fragment stable relationships and shared social time. While Sennett is not explicit on this point, his workplace studies can be interpreted as <italic>indicative</italic> evidence that there are limits to people’s capacity to meet this requirement, because what Sennett’s subjects all share is a finite capacity to bear instability and fragmentation at work without suffering. Hence, at least <italic>these</italic> subjects are unlikely to benefit from social processes that dismantle ‘old’ institutional orders.</p>
<p>It still remains unclear how widely the responses of Sennett’s subjects are shared, and whether they or others might find unanticipated ways to flourish amidst changing work or social regimes. The point here though is that, contra recent criticisms, Sennett’s social critique does not entail that labour practices in ‘cutting-edge’ firms represent broader labour market trends. Rather, what the firms Sennett studies purportedly share with social transformations is a broadly neo-liberal ideology, which promises to ‘free’ workers and citizens respectively from the demands of institutional control and routine social time. If this interpretation is right, then Sennett’s research aims to interrogate neo-liberal ideology at the micro-level, using detailed interviews to ‘test’ how workers cope when its underlying logic is applied. Far from being naively complicit in a discourse of ‘manufactured uncertainty’ then, Sennett in fact uses qualitative research to bring this discourse to account.</p>

<title>Making sense of insecurity</title>
<p>While aggregate labour market trends in contract type and tenure are peripheral to Sennett’s critique, his focus on changes in workers’ experiences means that subjective insecurity remains a central concept in his analysis. However, Doogan’s and Fevre’s critiques only measure subjective <italic>job</italic> insecurity, meaning the welfare cost of uncertainty about the <italic>income</italic> that work provides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460327">Green, 2009</xref>: 347). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett (2006</xref>: 94) does associate new capitalism with an increased risk of job loss for some workers, this is not the only or even primary type of insecurity he identifies. Consider the experiences of ‘Rose’, a former bar-owner who accepted employment in a New York advertising firm:
<disp-quote>
<p>Though she [Rose] had a formal two-year contract, ‘they made clear that they could buy me out and let me go at any time’. Since she had leased [her] bar, this didn’t prove a mortal threat. What got under her skin was more subtle: she felt constantly on trial, yet she never knew exactly where she stood. There were no objective measures which applied to doing a good job, apart from buzzing and whatever skill is required to ‘let nothing stick to you’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460327">1998</xref>: 79)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this excerpt, Rose indeed understands her job as insecure in the sense that she might lose it at any time; however, insecurity in this sense is neither her nor Sennett’s main concern. Rather, the concern here is another sense in which Rose’s work can legitimately be described as insecure, which is in the lack of a stable foundation that allows her to understand her efforts as part of a meaningful ongoing project. Hence, insecurity in this sense stems from the ‘hermeneutic’ critique of flexible working practices outlined in the second section, which stresses people’s need to understand their experiences as part of a larger and coherent life narrative. In particular, for Sennett the dismantlement of the institutional structures that assist workers to interpret their experiences in this way – such as stable working relationships, ‘craft’ standards and formal career paths – create insecurity at work by removing more or less objective markers of workers’ self-development and contributions over time.</p>
<p>While not directly comparable, measures of workplace insecurity that assess contemporary <italic>experiences</italic> of work reveal a different picture to measures of job security concerned with income and tenure alone. Interestingly, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460327">Doogan (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre (2007)</xref> cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460327">Burchell et al.’s (1999)</xref> study of subjective employment insecurity in the UK, a study which uses multi-dimensional measures of people’s perceived risk of losing valued job <italic>features.</italic> As Fevre records, this study finds that ‘feelings of job insecurity in the late 1990s are higher than at any point in the post-war years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">2007</xref>: 526). Doogan praises Burchell et al. for disaggregating different dimensions of job insecurity, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460327">Fevre (2007</xref>: 526–7) describes their analysis as a ‘slippery’ conflation of different concepts of insecurity. However, neither critic acknowledges the <italic>significance</italic> of these findings for Sennett’s sociology, which is that the multi-dimensional measures of the perceived security of workplace conditions used by Burchell and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460327">Ashford et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460327">Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984</xref>) are closer to the experiential forms of insecurity that Sennett articulates.</p>
<p>Not only is citing measures of job security as criticisms of Sennett’s sociology a misinterpretation of his analysis overall, it also misses the constructive potential of Sennett’s qualitative research to inform future studies of workplace insecurity, by highlighting a type of experiential insecurity at work that contemporary discussions generally overlook. Such studies would first require a clear distinction between employment insecurity, which includes all ‘uncertainty at work’, and job insecurity alone (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460327">Green, 2009</xref>: 347). Second, they would require greater differentiation between different <italic>aspects</italic> of employment insecurity, as, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460327">Blau et al.’s (2004)</xref> analysis of job feature insecurity among health care professionals.</p>

<title>Conclusion and future directions</title>
<p>Contrary to recent criticisms, Sennett’s sociology is not a dystopian ‘end of work’ or ‘age of insecurity’ nightmare. Rather, Sennett documents ‘flexible’ working practices in particular cutting-edge firms, which derive their broader social significance from the ‘profound <italic>moral</italic> and <italic>normative</italic> force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460327">Sennett, 2006</xref>: 10, emphasis added) these changes represent. His critique of these practices entails:</p>
<list id="list2-0950017012460327" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>an account of the damage these practices cause to workers; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an attempt to unmask what he thinks is a disingenuous ideology behind both new workplace practices and changes in social policies and institutions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While Sennett studies a relatively small number of subjects, his social critique uses these detailed studies of people’s experiences to uncover otherwise ‘hidden’ consequences of the new ideology of capitalism.</p>
<p>Of course, the conclusions Sennett draws from his interviews are contestable. His analysis is also partial; for instance, extrapolating from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460327">Conley’s (2008)</xref> critique of Doogan and Fevre, it might be argued that Sennett also gives inadequate attention to the experiences of women. Yet, the risk of avoiding Sennett’s sociological <italic>approach</italic> is to miss potentially harmful changes in people’s working conditions, as highlighted, for instance, by the rise in work-related mental health problems across OECD nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460327">OECD, 2008</xref>: 222). Against this background, Sennett’s sociology of work directs attention to a different, though no less important, set of questions about contemporary workplace trends, which concern how changing management practices, working relationships and technologies affect people’s capacity to <italic>cope</italic> with the demands of their work tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0950017012460327">2</xref></sup> In their efforts to redress genuine overstatements about contemporary <italic>employment</italic>, Sennett’s critics risk marginalizing these pressing issues in the state of contemporary <italic>work</italic>. Even amid the serious job insecurity created by the latest crisis in capitalist labour markets, care is required to ensure that changes in contemporary experiences of work and citizenship – and thereby in the critical resources with which to assess them – are not inadvertently lost from view.</p>
