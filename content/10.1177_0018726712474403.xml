<p>Marie T Dasborough (University of Miami, USA)</p>
<p><bold>Deadline for submission: 1 April 2013; please do not submit before 1 March 2013</bold></p>
<p>Within contemporary management research, there is a symmetrical assumption that so-called positive emotions and positive concepts yield positive outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712474403">Bono and Ilies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712474403">Salovey et al., 2002</xref>), whereas negative emotions and negative concepts lead to negative outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712474403">Gardner et al., 2009</xref>). Our primary intention with this special issue is to challenge these basic assumptions by problematizing this body of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712474403">Alvesson and Sandberg, 2011</xref>). Specifically, our proposed alternative is premised on the fact that the realities of organizational life do not reflect such a neat juxtaposition. For instance, Gray and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712474403">2011</xref>) demonstrate that sadness motivates the positive behavior of building social connections. In an earlier example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712474403">Storbeck and Clore (2005)</xref> show that happiness actually impedes memory accuracy (i.e., positive emotion having a negative outcome). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712474403">Lindebaum and Fielden’s (2011)</xref> study partly dispels the myth that anger is <italic>always</italic> related to negative outcomes at work. That is, anger was related to perceived leader success in the context of the construction industry. Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712474403">Dasborough (2006)</xref> empirically showed that individuals tend to recall more negative events with leaders than positive events.</p>
<p>In terms of so-called positive concepts, a very similar picture emerges. For instance, the concepts of emotional intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712474403">Mayer et al., 2008</xref>), positive identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712474403">Dutton et al., 2011</xref>), or compassion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712474403">Lilius et al., 2011</xref>) are nearly exclusively framed within the positive psychology domain, consistently linked with positive outcomes such as better health and life satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712474403">Mayer et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, an emerging body of empirical and theoretical studies show that emotional intelligence, for instance, is related to deviant behaviors at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712474403">Winkel et al., 2011</xref>). Curiously, such deviance has been linked to positive outcomes for organizations in the long-run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712474403">Lindebaum, in press</xref>). At the heart of our theorizing is a wider recognition of potential asymmetrical constellations between emotions/concepts and particular outcomes. Thus, it is too simplistic to assume that there will always be symmetry between positively/negatively valenced concepts and their outcomes. And yet, the hegemony of studies that apply the symmetrical lens we take issue with is palpable. In particular, we are concerned that the symmetrical hegemony may start to constrain wider social inquiries by privileging ways of doing research and setting research expectations that do not always reflect organizational realities. This concern is eloquently echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712474403">Learmonth and Humphreys (2011)</xref>, who skeptically respond to recent studies on positive identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712474403">Dutton et al., 2011</xref>) by highlighting that such work implicitly seeks to eliminate the ‘negative’ aspects of work. Similarly, they are explicit that important parts of this literature have been omitted, such that “<italic>resisting</italic> the traditional interests of managers can provide workers with satisfying and meaningful identities” (p. 425, italics in original).</p>
<p>With this special issue in <italic>Human Relations</italic> we wish to address this hegemony, and re-direct the ongoing symmetrical debate toward a wider recognition of asymmetrical relationships we identified above. Importantly, we apply a broad view on the nature of concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712474403">Blumer, 1954</xref>) to imply both quantitative and qualitative connotations. Thus, we welcome quantitative contributions that examine, for example, independent variables and their outcomes, and qualitative studies that seek to elicit underlying processes and meanings that individuals attach to the phenomenon under investigation.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold></p>
<p>In light of the hegemony we seek to scrutinize, the overarching aim of the special issue is to problematize the symmetrical relationships discussed above and to re-conceptualize them into asymmetrical ones. Our aim includes several broad objectives:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726712474403" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to challenge researchers to reconsider how we conceptualize the link between discrete emotions and emotion-related concepts and particular outcomes at work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to elicit individual processes and meanings attached to when it can be good to feel bad and bad to feel good at work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to generate theory that provides alternative insights on (i) the use of emotions at work and (ii) how certain emotion-related concepts influence outcomes at work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to encourage empirical investigations that puts this theorizing to the test, and leads to improved organizational practices</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><bold>Example questions:</bold></p>
<list id="list2-0018726712474403" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What factors (e.g., context, individual differences, dyadic relationships, industry expectations, display rules) influence the development of symmetrical or asymmetrical relationships between emotions/concepts and their outcomes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In particular, what is the role of individual skills (e.g., emotional regulation, emotional labor) in influencing or determining the development of symmetrical or asymmetrical relationships between emotions/concepts and their outcomes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Given that there can be considerable differences <italic>between</italic> and <italic>within</italic> levels of analysis in terms of how outcomes might be interpreted (e.g., individual, group, or organization), to whom do such qualifications like positive or negative apply?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Please note that we are especially receptive to (i) contributions from a variety of ontological traditions, (ii) papers conspicuous by innovative and challenging theorizing, and (iii) studies from a multiplicity of methodological backgrounds. However, a prerequisite for <italic>all</italic> submissions must be firm theoretical grounding in the relevant literature. For theoretical pieces, we expect that they also offer significant novel theoretical insights. For empirical papers, we expect that they have a strong methodological design, competently execute the data analysis, and offer significant new insights as a result. Authors are strongly encouraged to refer to the <italic>Human Relations</italic> website and the instructions on submitting a paper for more details about the types of manuscripts that will be considered for publication.</p>
<p><bold>Contributors should note:</bold></p>
<list id="list3-0018726712474403" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>This is an open and competitive call for manuscripts, and the submitted manuscripts will be blind reviewed by experienced scholars in the field.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Submitted manuscripts must be based on original material not accepted by or under consideration by any other journal or publication outlet.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For empirical papers based on data sets from which multiple papers have been generated, the guest editors must be provided with copies of all other papers based on the same data to ensure a unique intellectual contribution is being made.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The guest editors will select a number of papers to be included in the special issue, but other papers submitted in this process may be considered for publication in other issues of the journal.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The deadline for submissions is <bold>1 April 2013</bold> with submissions submitted no earlier than 01 March 2013. The special issue is intended for publication in 2015.</p>
