<p>In this study, we developed a nanoparticle system for drug delivery across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The nanoparticle consisting of loperamide and poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymer were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method; then the nanoparticles were coated with poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80. The effects of poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80 on the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the coated nanoparticles were investigated. Loperamide, which does not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) but exerts antinociceptive effects after direct injection into the brain, was encapsulated by different polymeric materials and used as a model drug. The <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB penetration study shows that the surfactant-coated PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles could have penetration of 14.4–21.2%, which was better than the PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PEP) (8.2%) and the PLGA nanoparticles (PN) (4.3%). The biopsy studies also confirm that the PEP coated by surfactant could increase the penetration. The results of nanoparticles accumulation in brain tissue show that the PEP coated by surfactant had a much higher concentration than both the PEP and the PN. Moreover, the maximal possible antinociception effect (MPE) for the surfactant-coated PEP was 21–35% at 150 min after administering the drug intravenously, which was significantly better than just the PEP (MPE: 11.6%). The results of the formalin test show that the surfactant-coated PEP administered intravenously 150 min prior to the formalin injection could greatly reduce the pain response in the first phase. The results demonstrate that the surfactant-coated PEP could help to deliver loperamide across the BBB.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211429495" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug delivery to the brain is becoming more and more important. However, this delivery is severely restricted by the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which represents an insurmountable barrier to many essential drugs, including antibiotics, cytostatics, and central nervous system-active drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211429495">1</xref></sup> Since the majority of the active drugs that targeted central nervous system (CNS) cannot cross the BBB, the treatment of CNS infections becomes a major challenge issue. The BBB is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211429495">2</xref></sup> These cells may influence the formation and function of the BBB in several ways, such as having a reduced rate of pinocytosis, a decreased number of transcellular fenestrations and intercellular clefts, and an increased number of tight junctions. The delivery of drugs to the brain by the transvascular pathway is virtually impenetrable by the majority of drugs, that is, approximately 100% of large-molecule drugs and greater than 98% of small-molecule drugs do not cross the BBB. It is a major challenge for new drug development to overcome the problem of crossing the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211429495">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nanoparticles have been shown to be able to transport a number of drugs across the BBB that normally cannot cross this barrier after i.v. injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211429495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211429495">5</xref></sup> Targeting ligands could be attached or conjugated to the nanocarriers to achieve optimal targeting efficiency. Some examples of BBB targeting ligands have been reported, which includes surface modification by coating with nonionic, PEG-containing surfactants such as polysorbate 80 and poloxamers, or conjugating ligands such as apolipoproteins, peptides, and growth factors onto the biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211429495">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211429495">9</xref></sup> The more precise engineering-targeted nanodevices can be achieved through chemical conjugation of endogenous ligands to the surface of polymeric nanoparticles. Physical adsorption of such ligands still represents a much simpler and milder approach that may reduce the bioactivity of the ligand to be bound to its corresponding receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211429495">10</xref></sup> The mechanism of the enhanced BBB transport with polysorbate 80-coated poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles has not yet been fully elucidated. Kreuter et al. postulated that the polysorbate coating nanoparticles led to the adsorption of apolipoprotein E and possibly apolipoprotein B from the blood after the i.v. injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211429495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211429495">5</xref></sup> Thus, the nanoparticles could mimic lipoprotein particles, which would then interact with the lipoprotein receptors located on the brain capillary endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211429495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211429495">5</xref></sup> A subsequent endocytosis of the nanoparticles together with the bound drugs would then occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211429495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211429495">5</xref></sup> Apolipoprotein E plays an important role in the transport of lipoproteins to the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211429495">11</xref></sup> Bounded lipoproteins are internalized by the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and the LDL-R-related protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211429495">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211429495">13</xref></sup> The LDL-R is specifically up-regulated on the surface of the endothelium that forms the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211429495">14</xref></sup> It was shown that the surfactant coating is the key factor for the successful brain delivery. The polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 coated PBCA nanoparticles can selectively adsorb the apolipoproteins E and B from blood, and these proteins promote receptor-mediated endocytosis of the nanoparticles by the endothelial cells from the BBB, thus facilitating the delivery of the nanoparticle into the brain. Indeed, drug loaded PBCA nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 can induced considerable CNS effects, whereas the free drugs that are unable to cross the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211429495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211429495">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nanoparticle-mediated drug transport to the brain is strongly depending on the type of surfactant coating. Kreuter and Schroeder reported 12 different surfactants coating onto the surface of poly PBCA nanoparticles and injected intravenously to mice to evaluate the influence of surfactant on the analgesic effects. The authors reported that only the nanoparticles with polysorbate 20, 40, 60, and 80 coatings produced significant effect and the maximum effect was observed for the PBCA nanoparticles bearing polysorbate 80 coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211429495">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211429495">18</xref></sup> PBCA nanoparticles coated with surfactants have been successfully used in the delivery number of drugs across the BBB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211429495">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211429495">20</xref></sup> including the peptides, antitumour drug doxorubicin, loperamide, the NMDA receptor antagonist MRZ 2/576, and tubocurarine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211429495">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211429495">24</xref></sup> Calvo et al. employed a novel strategy by using PEGylated polycyanoacrylate (PEG-PHDCA) nanoparticles, PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles as vector for drug delivery in experimental model of Prion disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211429495">25</xref></sup> The work showed that the PEG-PHDCA particles produced a higher uptake by the spleen and the brain in comparison to the non-PEGylated nanoparticles. Svetlana et al.demonstrated that Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80 enable an efficient brain delivery of the drugs after intravenous injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211429495">26</xref></sup> This ability was evidenced by two different pharmacological test systems employing as model drugs the antitumour drug doxorubicin and the agonist of opioid receptors loperamide, which being P-gp substrates can cross the BBB only in pharmacologically insignificant amounts: binding of doxorubicin to the surfactant-coated PLGA nanoparticles, however, enabled a high antitumor effect against an intracranial 101/8 glioblastoma in rats, and the penetration of nanoparticle-bound loperamide into the brain was demonstrated by the induction of central analgesic effects in mice. Both pharmacological tests could demonstrate that therapeutic amounts of the drugs were delivered to the sites of action in the brain and showed the high efficiency of the surfactant-coated PLGA nanoparticles for brain delivery. The results of the study also demonstrated that the efficacy of brain delivery by nanoparticles not only is influenced by the coating surfactants but also by other formulation parameters such as core polymer, drug, and stabilizer.</p>
<p>The opiate agonist loperamide was chosen as a model drug, loperamide does not exert antinociceptive effects after i.v. injection because it is not able to cross the BBB. However, intracerebral administration of loperamide causes antinociceptive effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211429495">27</xref></sup> Therefore, this drug was used as an indicator for successful transport across the BBB.</p>
<p>Biodegradable polymers are most commonly used to prepare nanoparticles for drug delivery. Poly(lactide) (PLA), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) are all approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose. Among the various biodegradable polymers, PLGA remains a popular choice as a biodegradable drug carrier due to the controllable degradation rates of PLGA and the releasing of encapsulated drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211429495">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211429495">29</xref></sup> Poloxamer 188 is a difunctional block copolymer surfactant approved by the FDA under the trade name Pluronic F68. Poloxamers and poloxamine nonionic surfactants have diverse applications in various biomedical fields ranging from drug delivery and medical imaging to management of vascular diseases and disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211429495">30</xref></sup> The attaching of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) on the nanoparticles would also be helpful to enhance the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles and increase absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211429495">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this research is to develop a series of nanoparticles containing loperamide as drug delivery systems that are encapsulated by PLGA, PLGA-PEG-PLGA, and PLGA-PEG-PLGA coated by surfactants poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80. The main purpose is to investigate the effect of poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80 on physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the coated nanoparticles, especially for the penetration of the BBB.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211429495"><title>Synthesis of the PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer</title>
<p>The triblock copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening method as reported by Zentner et al. with some modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211429495">33</xref></sup> PEG 2000 (0.9 g) was heated for 2 h at 150°C, 5 mmHg vacuum to remove water. D, L-Lactide (20 g) and glycolide (5.4 g) were added and reacted with PEG for 30 min. Stannous 2-ethylhexanoate (0.04 g) was added as catalyst and the mixtures were heated at 160°C for 6 h under 5 mmHg vacuum. After the reaction was completed, the copolymers were dissolved in dichloromethane and recrystallized in water three times to remove water-soluble impurities and unreacted material. Purified copolymers were dried under 5-mmHg vacuum at 37°C overnight. The dried copolymer was analyzed with <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded with CDCl<sub>3</sub> using a 400 MHz Bruker spectrometer (AVANCE model, Germany) at 25°C.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211429495"><title>Preparation of drug encapsulation of nanoparticles</title>
<p>The drug-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method. The four types of nanoparticles were prepared, including PLGA nanoparticles (PN), PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PEP), polysorbate 80-coated PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PEP80), and poloxamer 188 coated PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PEP188). The nanoparticles were prepared as follows: (1) PN: The PLGA polymer (50 mg) and loperamide (25 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. While the polymer solution was vortexed, 0.7 mL of ethanol was added. The mixtures were then mixed with an aqueous solution containing 0.1 wt% TPGS as emulsifier at 650 rpm stirring rate. After 4 h, the suspension was washed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 5°C. (2) PEP: The PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer (50 mg) and loperamide (25 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. The following procedures were the same as those of PLGA nanoparticles. (3) PEP80 or PEP188: The PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer (50 mg) and loperamide (25 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. While the polymer solution was vortexed, 0.7 mL of ethanol was added. The mixtures were then mixed with an aqueous solution containing 0.1 wt% TPGS as emulsifier at the 650 rpm stirring rate. Then the mixture was added drop-wise to an aqueous solution (20 mL) containing either 1 wt% polysorbate 80 or 1 wt% poloxamer 188 under constant stirring. After 4 h, the suspension was washed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 5°C. For fluorescent coumarin 6 loaded nanoparticles, the same procedures were applied, except the loperamide was replaced by 0.05 wt% coumarin 6 in organic phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211429495"><title>Physical properties of the nanoparticles</title>
<p>The mean diameter of dispersed nanoparticles was determined by photon correction spectroscopy using a laser light scatting instrument (Malven Zetasizer 3000HSA, Worcs, UK) at a fixed angle of 90° at 25°C. The samples were dispersed in deionized water and diluted at least 50-folds for better measurement and suitable signal intensity. The zeta-potential was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000HSA (Malvern, Worcs, UK). The morphology of nanoparticles was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 F, Tokyo, Japan) following negative staining with sodium phosphotungstate solution (0.2%, w/v). All data are taken by an average of three sample measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211429495"><title>Evaluation of the drug encapsulation efficiency</title>
<p>Nanoparticles (3 mg) were dissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL). After evaporation, the drug was reconstituted in a solution consisting of acetonitrile and deionized water (1.2 mL 50:50, v/v). The solution was filtered through 0.45 µm syringe filter before transferring into a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) vial. The assay of loperamide was carried out by HPLC. The mixture of acetonitrile/sodium phosphate buffer (40:60, v/v) (pH 2.3, 20 mM) was used as the mobile phase and flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The retention time of loperamide was 22 min with UV detection at 195 nm. For coumarin 6 encapsulated nanoparticles, the encapsulation efficiency was determined by the same extraction process as described for the drug-encapsulated nanoparticles. The fluorescence was measured by HPLC with a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min, mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/water (60:40 v/v). The excitation and emission wavelength were set at 462 and 502 nm, respectively, using a fluorescence detector module. The encapsulation efficiency (%) was calculated as the ratio of the drug content in the samples to the initial drug content.</p>

<p>Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats of 150–180 g were supplied by the BioLasco Taiwan Co. Ltd. The animals were randomly distributed into four groups with four rats in each group and acclimatized for 1 week. Rats were allowed access to food and water for 1 day, and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and any suffering. The coumarin 6 encapsulated nanoparticles were diluted with 0.9 wt% NaCl saline. The nanoparticles, coumarin 6 solution (coumarin: Tween 80 = 1:250, w/w), and coumarin 6 solution co-administered with blank PEP188 (coumarin 6 solution: blank PEP188 = 3:5, w/w) were subsequently administered through the tail vein at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Small amount of blood was drawn from the rats in each group through tail vein after 2 h injections, and then the rat’s brain was perfused for 10 min using 0.1 M Ringer’s buffer solution. The brains were extracted and stored at –80°C until analysis. The brain was lyophilized and homogenized into powder before the analysis. Brain powder (50 mg) was suspended in PBS (0.3 mL), and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (1.4 mL). The brain tissue emulsion was centrifuged (11,000 rpm, 15 min), and the organic layer was separated and evaporated under vacuum.

<p>Effects of the surfactant-coated PEP, including the PEP coated with poloxamer 188 and polysorbate 80, on the particle size, size distribution, surface charge, and physical state of the encapsulated loperamide were investigated. They were also investigated in comparison with the uncoated PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PEP) as well as with the PLGA nanoparticles (PN), which are most often used in the literature for drug delivery. The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211429495">Table 1</xref> indicate that the sizes of loperamide encapsulated PEP was relatively smaller than those of the PN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211429495">Table 1</xref>). This is due to the PEG has good ability to stabilize the hydrophobic polymeric matrix core during nanoparticle formation. Hence, coalescence or aggregation of the nanoparticles was reduced, resulting smaller particle sizes. The particle size of the nanoparticles seems did not change significantly due to the surfactant coating. The polydispersity for all the nanoparticles also shows quite narrow-size distribution. The results of drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) demonstrated that both PEP and the surfactant-coated PEP had much higher loading capability compared to the PN. This implies that the PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer can be a better drug carrier for more effective drug therapy than the PN. The small EE variations between the PEP and the surfactant-coated PEP indicate that the adsorption of surfactant did not damage the drug loading efficiency. The surface charge can greatly influence the particle’s stability in suspension through the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles. It is also an important factor in determining their interaction with the cell membrane, which is usually negatively charged, <italic>in vivo</italic>. The zeta potentials in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211429495">Table 1</xref> show that the negative surface charge of PN (−22.4 ± 0.9 mV) was converted to neutral charge of PEP (−0.5 ± 1.2 mV) and positive charge of the surfactant-coated PEP (1.5 ± 0.75 mV for PEP80, 3.1 ± 1.4 mV for PEP188). This result indicates that the presence of the nonionic PEG layer on the particle surface can shift the shear plane of the diffusive layer to a larger distance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211429495">37</xref></sup> The mean zeta potentials did not change a lot with the surfactant coating. The zeta potential of the surfactant-coated PEP was about 1.5–3.1 mV, which implies a nearly positive surface charge. The TEM images of the loperamide encapsulated nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211429495">Figure 2</xref>) and the coumarin 6 encapsulated nanoparticles show the morphology of nanoparticles were generally spherical with the particle size around 170−200 nm in diameter.

<p>We also prepared coumarin 6 encapsulated nanoparticles to investigate the cellular uptake and to observe the imaging of the particles. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328211429495">Table 2</xref>, the trend was found to be very similar to the loperamide encapsulated nanoparticles. The increased particle size and size distribution were mainly attributed to the different encapsulated polymer interactions during process. Coumarin 6, being more hydrophilic than loperamide, can interfere with the precipitation rate of the polymeric chains which greatly affects the particle size and its uniformity.

<sec id="sec16-0885328211429495"><title>In Vitro permeability screening by the transwell system</title>
<p>Quantitative analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> permeability screening by transwell system for the all nanoparticles was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211429495">Figure 3</xref>. The results explicitly indicate that the permeation percentage of PEP across the <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB was 13.7-folds higher than just the loperamide solution and was 20.7-folds higher than loperamide co-administered with blank PEP188. These results demonstrate the ability of PEP to encapsulate and transport drugs across the BBB that normally cannot cross. The permeation percentages of the surfactant-coated PEP were significantly enhanced compared with the PEP and PN. The permeation percentage of PEP188 across the <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB was 1.47-folds higher than that of PEP80. The poloxamer 188 coated PEP demonstrated better cellular uptake in BBB model than PEP coated with polysorbate 80. Because poloxamer 188 is a nonionic triblock copolymers composed of a central hydrophobic chain of polyoxypropylene linked by two hydrophilic chains of polyoxyethylene polymers and polysorbate 80 is consists of polyethoxylated sorbitan and oleic acid in one molecule, they are usually used as a surfactant due to the hydrophilic polyoxyethylene groups and hydrophobic long chain. Based on the structure viewpoint, because both PEP and Poloxamer 188 are triblock copolymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic structure, the structure of Poloxamer 188 is similar to the PLGA-PEG-PLGA. Hence, when the Poloxamer 188 is coated on the surface of the PLGA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles, it can have better coating than polysorbate 80. The orientation of the hydrophobic polyoxypropylene chain is more rigid in the Poloxamer 188 after coating because the two terminal polyoxyethylene glycol polymers were interacted with the nanoparticle. This effect may be helpful to the BBB penetration. In addition, the mechanisms of Poloxamer 188 effects in cellular uptake were thoroughly investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211429495">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211429495">40</xref></sup> The results demonstrated that Poloxamer 188 block copolymers could (1) be incorporated into membranes changing its microviscosity; (2) induce a dramatic reduction in ATP levels in barrier cells; (3) inhibit drug efflux transporters, such as P-gp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211429495">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211429495">40</xref></sup> As a result, Poloxamer 188 enhances drug transport across the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211429495">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211429495">40</xref></sup> On the other hand, the cellular uptake of the PEP was 1.89-folds higher than that of the PN. It may be most likely due to the effect of PEG from the PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer, which enhanced the absorption of the nanoparticles. The effect of PEGylated nanoparticles on permeability of BBB was also investigated by Patrick.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup> Their results demonstrate that the concentration of PEGylated nanoparticles in the brain and spinal cord, especially in white matter, was greatly increased in comparison to non-PEGylated nanoparticles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup> In addition, this increase was significantly higher in pathological situations where BBB permeability was augmented and/or macrophages had infiltrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup> Based on their long-circulating properties in blood and on their surface characteristics that allow cell interactions, PEGylated nanoparticles penetrated into brain to a larger extent than non-PEGylated nanoparticles tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup> Another reason is that the surface charge of nanoparticles was also an important feature in their effectiveness, because neutral charged surfaces experienced a greater permeability in the BBB model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211429495">41</xref></sup> So, it was concluded that the nearly neutrally charged property of PEP and the surfactant-coated PEP can contribute to the breakthrough of the BBB model.

However, with the PLGA nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 produced only ∼10% of long-term survivors. This discrepancy most likely can be explained by a higher BBB permeability of the PLGA nanoparticles coated with poloxamer 188. However, in that study, the doxorubicin loaded to the PBCA nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 produced the best results that yielded even 25% of long-term survivors, compared to the PBCA nanoparticles coated with poloxamer 188 produced 20% of long-term survivors. These observations suggest that differences in the core properties would be influenced by the nature of the coating behavior and the structure of the coating. Our study distinctly demonstrated that the PEP could enhance distribution of drug into brain than the PN.

<sec id="sec19-0885328211429495"><title>Qualitative study of the nanoparticles distribution in the brain</title>
<p>The qualitative study of nanoparticles for drug delivery across the BBB can be observed through the confocal microscopy images of the brain extracted from the rats under the treatment, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211429495">Figure 6</xref>. The coronal plane of the brain tissue sections demonstrates the presence of the green fluorescent marker that corresponds to the coumarin 6. The results are explicitly indicated that the fluorescence signals of coumarin 6 were very weak in brain tissue for coumarin 6 solution and coumarin 6 co-administered with blank PEP188. However, the results also can be found from the fluorescence signals of coumarin 6 in the brain tissues that the surfactant-coated PEP showed a much higher fluorescence signals than the noncoated PEP. This is most likely attributed to the surfactant-coated PEP, which are able to across the BBB through the receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. In contrast, the sections corresponding to the PEP demonstrate very weak fluorescence signals from the confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211429495">Figure 6</xref>). The trend was in agreement with the quantitative determination of coumarin 6 in the brain as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211429495">Figure 5</xref>. Perhaps, surfactant-coated PEP targeted to the brain could be contributed by the much lower level of the average coumarin 6 concentration in the blood. Therefore, the effect of surfactant on the nanoparticles surface was most likely the main factor that caused the modified distribution of the nanoparticles in the body. Again, the noncoated nanoparticles have the lower fluorescence signals in the brain as a result of the resistance from the BBB as well as the enhanced elimination rate from the body. Although the intensity was much lower than that of the surfactant-coated nanoparticles, the noncoated nanoparticles could reach to the brain to a certain extent. This is probably due to the PEG on the nanoparticles, which help to enhance the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles and increase absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211429495">32</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is worthy to mention that the brain tissue samples were collected only 2 h after the nanoparticles injection.

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the surfactant coatings on the nanoparticles as stabilizer and showing of the analgesic effect, which would be indicative of the ability to reach the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328211429495">47</xref></sup> The antinociceptive effects of the formulations measured as percentage of a maximal possible effect (% MPE) and area under curve (AUC) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211429495">Figure 7</xref>. In the animal test, a hot plate with temperature set at 55°C was employed to evaluate the antinociception effect of loperamide in mice. The results showed that the intravenous injection of loperamide solution did not inhibited nociceptive response of mice at the dose of 5 mg/kg. The results also showed that the nociceptive response in mice for the intravenous injection of the loperamide encapsulated PEP produced slight inhibition of at 150 min postinjection. The MPE produced by this nanoparticle only reached 12% at 150 min. However, the significant inhibition of nociceptive response in mice for the intravenous injection of loperamide encapsulated surfactant-coated PEP at the same dose was produced. The MPE of loperamide encapsulated for PEP188 at 150 min was 35% compared to that for PEP80 (MPE: 21%). The AUC for PEP188 is 1.6-folds higher than that for PEP80. These results suggested the poloxamer 188 coating can help to deliver the loperamide across BBB to the central nervous system, which is better than that of polysorbate 80 coating. In addition, the results also showed that after surface modification with poloxamer 188 for the nanoparticles, the antinociceptive effect was greatly enhanced.

<sec id="sec21-0885328211429495"><title>Formalin test</title>
<p>To assess the systemic and nociceptive effects of loperamide encapsulated nanoparticles on the modulation of acute pain, conscious mice were subject to formalin test. Loperamide encapsulated nanoparticles were thought involved in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information at the periphery, spinal cord and supraspinal level. The formalin model produces a biphasic response: the early nociceptive response, which possibly is associated with C fiber activation and the late nociceptive response, which appears to be dependent on a combination of inflammatory reactions in the peripheral tissue and facilitation of spinal transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328211429495">48</xref></sup> Formalin generates an initial phase of activity (5–10 min, phase 1), a quiescent interphase (5–10 min), and a second phase of activity (lasting 60 min, phase 2), and this is seen with spontaneous behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885328211429495">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the total licking duration was short, the analgesic effect of the drug was promising. This animal model exhibited an early-phase pain induced by the central nervous system and a late-phase pain induced by the central and the peripheral nervous system. Suppression of the early-phase pain reveals that the drug has an analgesic effect on the central nervous system. The antinociceptive effects of loperamide nanoparticles and loperamide solution determined by formalin test after i.v. injection (5.0 mg/kg) in male ICR mice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211429495">Figure 8</xref>. The results showed that the intravenous injection of loperamide solution did not reduce nociceptive response of mice at the dose of 5 mg/kg. The results also show that the licking duration for loperamide encapsulated nanoparticles with coating surfactant are significantly shortened. For example, the licking duration for PEP188 exerted 1.6-folds analgesic potency than PEP and 1.4-folds than PEP80. In addition, when PEP coated with poloxamer 188 that was administered intravenously 150 min prior to the formalin injection, it significantly increased the inhibition of formalin-induced first phase pain response. These results suggested that PEP coated with poloxamer 188 could deliver loperamide across the BBB to the central nervous system.

<p>A series of nanoparticles consisting of the biodegradable PLGA-PEG-PLGA triblock copolymer for drug delivery across the BBB were successfully developed in this study. The surface of nanoparticles was modified with poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80. The nanoparticles were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method and characterized for their properties. This is also showing that coating of drug encapsulated PEP with surfactants such as poloxamer 188 and polysorbate 80 could help to deliver drug across the BBB. The poloxamer 188 coated PEP demonstrated the greatest cellular uptake and achieved highest fluorescence concentration in the brain tissues over this with polysorbate 80 surface modification. Surface modification is a feasible and efficient strategy for nanoparticles made of biodegradable polymers to deliver imaging/opiate agonist agents across the BBB.</p>
