There they wrestled her to the ground and, apologizing for their actions, tied her to the water pipes, placed a pillow under her head, kissed her on the cheek, and left a glass of water nearby. They then took her keys and escaped from prison. Tragically, the abandoned Mrs Mick suffered a stroke and died an undignified death sprawled beneath the prison washbasins. Upon their capture two days later, 16-year-old Jennie McVinn, 16-year-old Bessie Carroll, and 19-year-old Isabel Prouse<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269758012447216">1</xref> </sup> were charged with murder.</p> <p>The murder of Mrs Mick became a major news story immediately. In the <italic>Toronto Daily Star</italic> alone, there were no less than 18 articles on the event, 2 letters to the editor, and 2 photo essays on the young women over a period of four months.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269758012447216">2</xref> </sup> This general interest in the plights and misfortunes of Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn offers an important glimpse into the distinctly gendered world of criminal offending. In particular, by drawing on the press accounts of the young women’s criminal justice experiences,<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269758012447216">3</xref> </sup> this article reads the case of the murder of Mrs Mick as a window onto the relationship between the competing narrative frames of female victimization and criminal culpability, demonstrating the ways that, both discursively and materially, their dichotomization fails to adequately account for the complexity of women’s relationship to crime and justice.</p> <p>In this reading of the intensive press coverage of the case, it is significant that Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn were treated as stars in their own dramas and each woman was given the opportunity to react, sometimes daily, to her legal circumstances. In part because of these contributions to their public personae, a note of sympathy crept into the press accounts of the death of Mrs Mick. Indeed, as the public came to know more about the events that transpired on 24 May, the tenor of the story changed considerably. The description of Mrs Mick’s tragic end was transformed from the condemnatory ‘cruel slaying’ to the more neutral ‘death of Mrs Mick.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269758012447216">4</xref> </sup> The young women were recast, from ‘girl assailants’ to ordinary young girls who, when they appeared in court, ‘might have been tardy school-girls, paraded before a mistress for a reprimand.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269758012447216">5</xref> </sup> And, the ‘alleged slaying’ became, instead, an unfortunate chain of events, or ‘an avalanche of tragedy’. And, as the story unraveled, it became abundantly clear that the avalanche metaphor was particularly apt. Each young woman’s story began with a small act of defiance: loitering, defying a probation order, disobeying an overbearing father. In the local jail, each of the women found herself in the detention ward for institutional infractions: refusing to work, swearing, speaking ill of the jail superintendent. It was in the detention cells that the plans to escape were hatched, executed and, then, went terribly wrong. Ultimately, the three women were convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to five years in a federal penitentiary. And, all three women would find themselves before the courts again after their release.</p> <p>The story of Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn thus exemplifies two, intersecting, dilemmas arising from female criminality. The first dilemma centers on the outwardly contradictory, and unmistakably anxiety-ridden, public accounts of the young women. The press and legal officials clearly struggled to make sense of the extraordinary circumstances of seemingly ordinary girls, and the incoherence of their narratives tells us a great deal about the degree to which the young women were thought to be responsible, and for what. Second, the circumstances surrounding the initial incarceration of the young women, and their persistent refusal to subject themselves to authority, raised the possibility that the justice system was unjust. Indeed, the women’s increasingly intensified entanglements with the law offer historical testimony to a duality that has become a central theme in feminist criminology: their violent behavior and their victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system were the flip sides of the same coin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758012447216">Balfour, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447216">Comack, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758012447216">Comack and Brickey, 2007</xref>).</p> <sec id="section1-0269758012447216"> <title>Women, violence and resistance</title> <p>While historical criminologists often note that not all women submitted passively to the authority of the law, drawing conclusions about the nature of resistance can be difficult. In large part, this is often a structural issue: the objects of legal disputes are typically shaped into historical subjects by the architecture of law itself and the structured exchanges between judges, lawyers, witnesses, police, and experts in the court rooms. Thus, courts are not places of unmediated speech and, more often than not, the defendants do not speak at all. True to form, once Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn came to trial, they were silent in both the courtroom and the press.</p> <p>But, in the days and weeks before their trial, the young women’s own stories were of significant interest, including eight front page headline columns − and small wonder. The story contained all the elements of a modern pulp fiction tale: of defiant ‘bad girls,’ of a struggle between authority and resistance, of adventure and capture, and of seemingly gender-bending behavior. This formula arguably fuelled the development of a modern mass media. Carolyn Jackson and Penny Tinkler note that the ‘modern girl’ of the 1920s, like her contemporary twenty-first-century counterpart the ‘ladette,’ was very much a product of the mass media − so much so, they suggest, that she was the prototype for the youth spectacles that have come to predominate in the modern press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758012447216">Jackson and Tinkler, 2007</xref>: 266). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269758012447216">Dunscombe and Mattson (2006</xref>) make a similar argument in their account of the ‘bobbed-haired bandit’ of New York City who, in the winter and spring of 1924, engaged in a series of drugstore armed robberies, and whose story captivated and dominated the local press for months on end. In their account of the competing narrative frames deployed by the multitude of newspapers in 1920s New York, Dunscombe and Mattson point out that the story of Celia Cooney was newsworthy precisely because it captured contemporary anxieties about gender, class and modern life. The narratives woven around Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn reveal a similar set of cultural motifs, through which the young women’s demeanour, dress, and physical bearing were read through a variety of lenses, to reveal the young women as both innocently child-like and dangerously adult, as simultaneously repentant and defiant, and as, at once, appropriately feminine and disturbingly modern.</p> <p>Yet, perhaps precisely because it was such a sensational case, the young women themselves were offered ample opportunity to tell their own version of the events, at least in the court of public opinion. Rather than simply being objects of press accounts, the three young women told what Natalie Zemon Davis has referred to as ‘pardon tales,’ that is, they engaged in a process through which they attempted to ‘shape the events of a crime into a story’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758012447216">Davis, 1987</xref>: 2; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758012447216">Sangster, 1993</xref>). The device of the ‘pardon tale’ is a useful one, as it acknowledges that those before the courts operate within a known power structure, but nonetheless use that structure to subvert, resist, and re-invent their own circumstances into a compelling counter-narrative. As Sangster explains, ‘This is not to dismiss women’s stories as contrived fiction; rather, [pardon tales] encapsulated women’s reactions to their difficult material and social circumstances, but were shaped by dominant cultural motifs and astute perceptions of the posture designed to release them from the court’s clutches’ (1993: 197). Read this way, the various narratives that emerged about the young women’s degree of responsibility for the death of Mrs Mick grant insight into the workings of agency and resistance in the lives of criminalized women.</p> <p>To be attentive to the dynamics of agency and resistance in women’s crime experiences, however, is not to be dismissive of the power of the state to exercise its own power to shape events. As Myers and Sangster have noted in their analysis of young women’s resistance to reform school in mid-twentieth-century Canada, ‘girls’ resistance rarely succeeded in securing either the attention, freedom or the justice in life they craved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758012447216">Myers and Sangster, 2001</xref>: 688). While Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn gained attention, what public sympathy they were able to generate as a result did not greatly aid them and they were ultimately sentenced to the Kingston Penitentiary on a charge of manslaughter.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269758012447216">6</xref> </sup> In so sentencing the women, Ontario Chief Justice Middleton sermonized that ‘at the end of your sentence, [I trust] you will be old enough and sensible enough to try to lead a moral, honest, industrious life.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269758012447216">7</xref> </sup> Here, Justice Middleton missed the point. For the young women, incarceration <italic>was</italic> the violence, and it continued to exert a heavy toll. Within weeks of their release from federal custody, all three young women found their way back to Toronto, back to the courts, and back into custody.</p> <p>Similarly missing the point, a recent ‘true crime’ recounting of the story of Mrs Mick’s death introduces the events by emphasizing its apparent transgressive nature: ‘In the most commonly held perception of a prison guard murder, the victim is male and the killer is a tough con with nothing to lose. However the case of [Mrs Mick’s] violent death goes entirely against that stereotype’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758012447216">Butts, 2009</xref>: 144). Butts distinguishes clearly between the victim, Mrs Mick, a career prison matron who was ‘well liked by staff and most inmates wherever she worked’ (p. 146), and her ‘teenage killers’ (p. 151) who cavalierly attended a baseball game after learning of Mrs Mick’s death. The moral certainty evident in this account, however, disguises the fascination with which violent, even murderous, women are held. This fascination centres around a seeming paradox, in which white femininity is seen as incompatible with violence<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0269758012447216">8</xref> </sup> while, simultaneously, there exists ‘the equally persistent troubling fantasy that women may in fact embody [violent] qualities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758012447216">Downing, 2009</xref>: 124). The press coverage of the death of Mrs Mick captures this public ambivalence over violent white women. As Susan Cahn similarly found in her analysis of the press coverage of the 1931 Samarcand arson case, in which 16 young white North Carolinian women set fire to their prison, ‘[t]he disruptive actions of troubled and defiant working-class girls forced a moment of reckoning in which the public and the courts had to draw a line between punishable adolescent deviance and understandable adolescent misbehavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758012447216">Cahn, 1998</xref>: 155). In the case of the death of Mrs Mick, this line zig-zagged between sympathy and condemnation. Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn offered troubling examples of what happened when young modern women were given too much freedom and, in the end, they were held to be criminally responsible for Mrs Mick’s death. Yet, at the same time, the young women were seen as ‘little more than children’ and ‘unfortunates’ whose prison environment rendered them ‘outcasts,’ prompting at least one Torontonian to pose the rhetorical question: ‘Would we have escaped if subjected to the same temptations?’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0269758012447216">9</xref> </sup> The avalanche of tragedy that led to the death of a prison matron and federal imprisonment of three teenagers thus opens up ample space for considering the relationship between victimization, criminalization, and the circumstances of young women caught up in the circular dynamics produced by the power of the law.</p> </sec> <sec id="section2-0269758012447216"> <title>Incarcerating the modern girl</title> <p>Feminist research over the past two decades has documented a clear pattern in the criminalization of young white women in the early twentieth century. Variously referred to as ‘the girl adrift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758012447216">Meyerowitz, 1988</xref>), the ‘girl problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758012447216">Strange, 1995</xref>) and the ‘modern girl’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758012447216">Myers, 2006</xref>), the young, single, wage earning woman was the target of, and the reason for, a politics of urban uplift across North America. Her new-found independence, her heterosociability, and her participation in an emergent youth culture, characterized by commercial amusements and unchaperoned leisure pursuits, generated considerable consternation among urban reformers, who feared that extra-familial activities in an anonymous city posed moral hazards to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758012447216">Peiss, 1986</xref>). Yet at the same time, the modern girl was seen as a moral hazard herself, too easily throwing away her virtue for a good time, and undermining the future of ‘the race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758012447216">Bickford, 2007</xref>). The early-twentieth-century girl problem was, thus, an expression of racialized and class-based, as well as gendered, anxieties. Young white women, in particular, were identified as poor guardians of their own virtue, and an intrusive network of regulation, policing and surveillance was quickly developed in order to tame women’s sexuality and domesticate their futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758012447216">Odem, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758012447216">Sangster, 2002</xref>).</p> <p>It was in this context that Carroll, McVinn and Prouse found themselves caught up in the criminal justice net. Each of their routes into the Concord reveals that for the young modern woman, ‘delinquency and sexuality were closely linked with each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758012447216">Gelsthorpe and Worrall, 2009</xref>: 211). Sixteen-year-old Bessie Carroll had been sexually active with at least two men, both of whom were older and married, and her father turned to the courts when his own efforts to keep her at home failed. As he explained, he pulled her out of her high school ‘because she was not paying any attention to school and her studies … so I decided to put her in confinement until such time as she found her senses. I thought it would be a lesson and she could start back again.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0269758012447216">10</xref> </sup> Originally, he had sought her confinement at a Presbyterian Home, but after two weeks, they had released her because there was no charge against her. Undeterred, Mr Carroll brought his daughter to the Police Court.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0269758012447216">11</xref> </sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758012447216">Odem (1991</xref>) notes in her study of the early twentieth-century juvenile courts in Los Angeles, a triangular relationship evolved between parents, young women, and the courts, so that many parents, frustrated by their daughters’ refusal to obey familial authority, sought support from the courts to bring their daughters into line (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758012447216">Myers, 2006</xref>). Bessie Carroll was charged with vagrancy, probably under the auspices of the Ontario <italic>Female Refuges Act,</italic> which allowed for the incarceration of ‘any female between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five years, sentenced or <italic>liable to be sentenced</italic> to imprisonment in a common jail by a judge’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0269758012447216">12</xref> </sup> Carroll thus found herself at the Concord Jail Farm on a six-month sentence beginning on 17 January 1925.</p> <p>Sixteen-year-old Jeannette (Jennie) McVinn was similarly charged under the <italic>Female Refuges Act</italic> − a charge also brought by a parent. On 27 April 1925, McVinn’s mother told Toronto Women’s Court Magistrate Margaret Patterson that Jennie, ‘being my daughter and a girl under nineteen years of age was unmanageable and incorrigible.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0269758012447216">13</xref> </sup> Toronto-born McVinn’s father had deserted the family and her mother had recently moved herself and Jennie to Kapuskasing in Northern Ontario. Like many young women of the period, McVinn had run away from home, although for what reasons are unclear. As she explained to the <italic>Star</italic> reporter: ‘Last fall I ran away from home and was brought back and put on probation. I broke probation and was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of two years, less one day.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0269758012447216">14</xref> </sup> As Myers documents, while running away was usually interpreted in sexual terms by court officials and observers, for the young women, desertion of the family home was a strategy of resistance to any number of conditions, ranging from abusive homes to desires for autonomy, as well as sexual adventures and a longing for excitement in the city. That McVinn was sentenced in Toronto suggests that, at the very least, the city held attractions for her that were not available in northern Ontario. But, although it was a common strategy, running away was not often successful: as happened to McVinn, courts and parents usually managed to thwart young women’s bids for freedom. It was an offence that courts took very seriously, ‘for it signified daughters’ abdication of their subordinate, yet integral, role within the family hierarchy. In leaving home and neighbourhood, girls successfully eluded familial control and circumvented community surveillance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758012447216">Myers, 2006</xref>: 166). Given her youth, Patterson originally determined that McVinn should serve her indeterminate sentence of two years less a day at the Industrial Refuge for Girls, but they had no rooms available at the time of sentence, and so she was sent to the Jail Farm until space at the Refuge could be found. This solution did little to temper McVinn’s efforts to be free. Indeed, given her penchant for running away, perhaps it is not surprising to learn that only one month into her potentially twenty-four-month sentence, it was McVinn who masterminded the three women’s escape from the Concord.</p> <p>Isabel Prouse, by contrast, was already familiar with the carceral net. The eldest of the three at 19 years of age, Prouse was serving her second term in prison at the time of the escape. In August 1923, Prouse had been convicted of being a vagrant, ‘not having any visible means of subsistence [and] found loitering in a side entrance at 193 Gerrard Street East.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0269758012447216">15</xref> </sup> The suspicion that Prouse was a prostitute was compounded by the fact that she was found to have syphilis. Under the provisions of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269758012447216">1918</xref> Ontario <italic>Venereal Diseases Act</italic>, any person found to be infected with a venereal disease was obliged to undergo any course of treatment prescribed by the medical officer, including detention until such time as s/he was given a clean bill of health.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0269758012447216">16</xref> </sup> Thus, although Prouse was given a three-month and a six-month concurrent sentence for vagrancy, she was ‘ordered detained for treatment until cured or otherwise disposed of by [the Department of Public Health]’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0269758012447216">17</xref> </sup> She was released, pending continuation of her treatment, on 19 May 1924. Her liberation was short-lived, however. Prouse was re-arrested on 1 March 1925, when she was found in the company of a man who had ‘procured lodging at … the Grosvenor Hotel for himself and a woman [Prouse] whom he falsely held to be his wife.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0269758012447216">18</xref> </sup> For this offence, Prouse was given a detention sentence of five days. But, she was still infected with a venereal disease. As a result, she was also convicted of a Breach of the Venereal Diseases Act and was returned to indefinite confinement at the Concord Jail Farm until released by the Medical Officer of Health. She arrived at the Jail Farm on 16 March 1925.</p> <p>The Concord Industrial Farm for Women had opened in 1914 as an alternative to the city jail and as a reflection of contemporary beliefs that sunlight, fresh air, and hard work offered a recipe for reform for female criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758012447216">Pineault, 1997</xref>). It had a capacity for 83 prisoners, although at the time of the escape, the Concord was housing just 47 inmates.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0269758012447216">19</xref> </sup> Situated just north of Toronto in the Township of Vaughan on 200 acres of agricultural land, and adjacent to the corresponding Langstaff Industrial Jail Farm for Men, the Concord Jail Farm combined detention with ‘useful work.’ This meant that the Concord was a working farm, where women performed outdoor labor such as working in the fields, raising cows, sheep and poultry (which, in turn, provided milk, butter, and eggs for the Jail) as well as indoor work, including canning fruits and vegetables grown on site, knitting, and sewing uniforms and doing laundry for both the women’s and the men’s farms. As Margaret Carson, the Farm’s Superintendent, explained, ‘The main objective of this Institution is, of course, to make all activities bend towards building up the individual, both physically and morally’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758012447216">Pineault, 1997</xref>: 11).</p> <p>Incarcerated women did not always share these lofty goals and resisting incarceration was a more common approach to the injustice of the justice system than officials liked to admit. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758012447216">Myers and Sangster (2001</xref>) note, incarcerated women employed a wide range of resistant strategies, from insolence and refusal to work, to destruction of prison cells and violations of institutional rules, to outright rebellion and running away. Most acts of resistance were passive, in that they avoided direct confrontation with authority, but it was not uncommon for incarcerated women to engage in head-on clashes with their keepers (ibid.). Each of Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn, clearly unhappy about their confinement, continued to engage in the kinds of acts of resistance that had led to their incarceration in the first place, and each challenged authority sufficiently to find herself punished in the detention cells: Prouse had sworn at a matron, Carroll had insulted Superintendent Carson, and McVinn had refused to work to protest her indeterminate detention. Thus, each woman was transferred to the detention ward, a separate building that contained four cells, two on each side of a shared corridor. It was from there that the women escaped.</p> </sec> <sec id="section3-0269758012447216"> <title>Saucy <italic>and </italic>sorry: Making sense of defiance</title> <p>Initially, the story of the escape told by the press was straightforward. Sometime around midnight on 24 May, Mrs Mick had been ‘enticed’ into the isolation ward. The ‘ruse’ crafted by the three young women was cunning but simple. McVinn had secreted a knife from the dining room. She had then climbed out of the transom in her cell door, an extremely small opening typically used to pass food trays from the corridor to the cells. Once she had wriggled free, she used the knife to cut away at the wood around the locks on the cells of Carroll and then Prouse. A fourth woman, Gladys Palmer, was also confined in the detention ward, but she was too frightened to leave with the other three, and so remained locked in her cell.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0269758012447216">20</xref> </sup> The three young women then removed the lightbulb, called for Mick to come, saying that a pipe had burst in one of the cells, and crept back into their rooms. When Mick entered the darkened ward, the young women jumped out of their cells, threw a blanket over her and tied her to the water pipes in the hallway. There being no other guards on night duty, Mick was not discovered until the day matrons, Mrs Prince and Mrs Thierry, began their shifts the following morning. Both the <italic>Toronto Globe</italic> and the <italic>Star</italic> reported that Mick’s neck was bruised and swollen, possibly showing the signs of fingermarks. Confidently, the <italic>Globe</italic> assured its readers that although Mick was alive when the women left the Concord, ‘[m]edical evidence will show that the matron was choked into silence by hands at her throat, and was suffocated so much by this attack that a hemorrhage followed.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0269758012447216">21</xref> </sup> </p> <p>Meanwhile, Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn made their way to the highway and, after several attempts, managed to flag down a passing car. Twenty-year-olds William Norton and Leonard Swales drove the three to Toronto and then spent some time driving the women around the city until, not having anywhere else to go, they drove them to Swales’ parents’ house where the girls spent the night on the couch. In the morning, Swales, Norton and Norton’s younger brother James drove the three women to Bowmanville (approximately 75 km east of Toronto, along Lake Ontario), where Prouse had relatives. When they refused to take her in, the boys drove the girls the 15 km back west to the neighboring municipality of Oshawa, where Prouse and Carroll got out of the car and did not return. Swales and the Norton brothers then took McVinn back to Toronto, where she asked to be dropped off at her uncle’s house. Her uncle turned her in to the police immediately, and McVinn confessed everything. William and James Norton and Leonard Swales were arrested the next day for aiding and abetting the escape.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0269758012447216">22</xref> </sup> After a forty-hour search,<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0269758012447216">23</xref> </sup> the police, with Carroll’s father along for the ride, finally ‘found’ Prouse and Carroll in Oshawa as the young women inadvertently walked in front of the parked police car. The ‘two pathetic and bewildered figures’ offered no resistance to being taken back to the Toronto Police Court, where they were immediately arraigned on a charge of murder.</p> <p>By the time of their capture the tale of the three escapees had lost some of its confident conviction and the young women began to emerge as objects of pity. Indeed, after the capture of Prouse and Carroll, the <italic>Star</italic> reporter admitted, ‘Many sad scenes are witnessed at police headquarters. It is a common thing to see women weeping as they are brought in but the sight of the two unfortunate girls touched the hearts of all.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0269758012447216">24</xref> </sup> It was not only the court reporters who were intrigued by the young women’s plight. At each successive appearance in court, the magistrate was forced to clear the courtroom of the ‘sensation-seekers’ who jostled for a front row seat to the human theatre. Crowds also gathered outside the jailhouse where the women were remanded pending trial, and often lined the sidewalks as they were taken from their cells to police wagons to court and back again. Importantly, the young women played a part in their own public presentations. In helping to construct public empathy for them, Bessie Carroll was especially talkative, offering both long narratives and culturally intelligible explanations for her actions. Perceiving, and perhaps believing in, the maternalist rhetoric that prevailed in the courts and the urban reform movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758012447216">Glasbeek, 2009</xref>), Carroll suggested that her wayward behavior was the result of having ‘too much of my own way at home … You know my mother died when I was eight – and I missed her guiding hand.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0269758012447216">25</xref> </sup> Certainly it was canny to allude to daughterly deference in her self-presentation, for the theme of mothering loomed large in the story. The final exchange between the night matron and the three escapees resonated with maternalist tropes. Indignant at the suggestion that they had choked the matron, Carroll explained in the press: ‘I never touched her throat … She was talking to me and said, remember I am a mother, I have a daughter. I put a pillow under her head to make her comfortable and after I got a cup of water to give her. I leaned down and kissed her – and she thanked me. Then we ran to the door and got away … We never meant to harm her.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0269758012447216">26</xref> </sup> In giving evidence at the coroner’s inquest, Carroll repeated this testimony almost verbatim, adding that she had also removed Mrs Mick’s glasses, for fear they would break and blind her. Prouse similarly explained, in her testimony at the inquest, that the glass of water had been left out because they expected Mrs Mick to be able to free herself, and the water was to aid in her recovery.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0269758012447216">27</xref> </sup> These displays of tenderness and, indeed, daughterly concern for Mrs Mick’s welfare were pivotal to the public sympathy that the young women received.</p> <p>Similarly important was the young women’s reaction to the news that Mrs Mick had died. Each woman learned of Mrs Mick’s tragic end in the same way that other Torontonians did: by reading the newspapers the next morning. McVinn cried ‘bitterly’ upon hearing of Mrs Mick’s death. Even more sensationally, Prouse and Carroll told the press that they had tried to kill themselves.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0269758012447216">28</xref> </sup> They were first going to throw themselves in the lake, an idea that seemed to appeal strongly to Carroll, but Prouse ‘got cold feet’. Instead, they decided to purchase some poison and do away with themselves that way. In fact, it was as they were leaving the drugstore in Oshawa that they walked into the Toronto detectives searching for them, although there is no record of any poison being found on their persons. Nonetheless, the (melo)dramatic intentions fit neatly with contemporary ideas about adolescent girls’ excitability and irrationality, and seemed to demonstrate that, rather than fiendish monsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758012447216">Cahn, 1998</xref>), the girls were modernly normal.</p> <p>But, this normality was a double-edged sword. As one reporter noted, the girls ‘might have been any one of a thousand girls to be glimpsed nightly at Sunnyside or other of the pleasure resorts’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0269758012447216">29</xref> </sup> This ‘any girl’ characterization may have defused suspicions of murderous intent, but it did not absolve the young women of being troublesomely deviant. As Myers writes, ‘girls embodied delinquency in a way that boys could not’ (2006: 7); as a result, young women’s bodies, demeanor and dress could speak louder than words. Even a hat could signal deeper meanings. When Isabel Prouse was first arrested and the press were sure of her guilt, she was described as wearing a grey coat, a black dress and ‘a gay pink hat.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0269758012447216">30</xref> </sup> A week later, as the press began to question the young women’s criminal liability, Prouse appeared again in court, ‘dressed exactly as on her appearance last week,’ to wit, a grey coat, a black dress and ‘a hat of reddish wool.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0269758012447216">31</xref> </sup> Young women’s physical appearance was thus interpreted as somatic evidence of guilt or innocence.</p> <p>If, as was becoming clear, the young women were not wholly culpable for the ‘drama of tragedy’ unfolding before Toronto’s eyes, they were nonetheless held out as evidence of worrying trends in female youth culture. The ‘bobbed haired figures’ were described as, at once, forlorn, pallid, pale, pathetic, and downcast <italic>and</italic> saucy, disdainful, defiant, cool, indifferent, and composed. Certain questions plagued the accounts (and remained unanswered in any definitive way). Did the women plan the escape, thus rendering the unfortunate death of Mrs Mick a casualty of their machinations, or was it a ‘spur of the moment’ decision, as the trio insisted it was?<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0269758012447216">32</xref> </sup> Gladys Palmer told the coroner’s inquest that the women had spoken to each other in Pig Latin, a piece of evidence that implied the women participated in the ‘forg[ing] of a [resistant] counter culture’ that authorities feared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758012447216">Myers and Sangster, 2001</xref>: 677). Yet, testimony given to the inquest by the women themselves suggested that, once McVinn had freed herself, Carroll and Prouse had had to be talked into escaping with her, which suggested there had been no collective forethought after all. Of similar concern to reporters was whether or not the young women appreciated the gravity of their situation. Repeatedly, readers were told that the young women ‘talked and laughed in the corridor, and the police remarked they did not seem to realize the seriousness of their position’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0269758012447216">33</xref> </sup> Here, the ‘slender, almost childish figures’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0269758012447216">34</xref> </sup> appear as ‘silly girls looking for excitement’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0269758012447216">35</xref> </sup> and too young to be criminally responsible. Rather, they had taken ‘wayward footsteps’ and needed the benevolent guidance of those who knew better.</p> <p>At the same time, the young women remained under suspicion precisely because their youthfulness made them reckless and irresponsible. For example, Bessie Carroll, said to have been ‘especially defiant,’ was the object of press censure because, ‘although obviously conscious of her position, her head was [held] high, at an aggressive angle’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0269758012447216">36</xref> </sup> While being held in jail awaiting trial, the young women were also overheard to have said ‘Well, they can’t hang us anyway – we’re too young for that.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0269758012447216">37</xref> </sup> Meanwhile, Jennie McVinn, ‘who had lost a little of her previous gaity but none of her rosy coloring, took a look at the onlookers and stuck out her tongue with the air of a naughty ballerina’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0269758012447216">38</xref> </sup> In a strikingly non-reflexive moment, the reporters also worried that it was the very publicity of the case that inspired the young women’s show of defiance. Bessie Carroll ‘faced the crowd [outside the courthouse] with a slightly disdainful air’ and it was only once the young women were taken to the jail cells that they admitted to their fears, for ‘there was no curious crowd here to stimulate their self-command.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0269758012447216">39</xref> </sup> Conversely, the young women’s eschewal of public curiosity was read as an admission of remorse: ‘Their entrance into the police headquarters was a pathetic one. Hurrying to avoid the gaze of the curious crowd that was loitering around the corridors … the girls hid their faces in the collars of their coats, holding up their arms and pulling their coats against their faces.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0269758012447216">40</xref> </sup> This physical display of contrition was supplemented by the fact that Carroll ‘stumbled to her knees [and] fainted away’ and both she and Prouse ‘had to be supported as they stumbled along, leaning against the police officials.’ Given the worrying tendency of girls who ‘could at one moment seem normal and the next moment fiendish, one moment disarmingly childish and the next alarmingly adult’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758012447216">Cahn, 1998</xref>, p. 165), perhaps Torontonians were gratified to know that, in the end, the ‘gentle restraint’ of the law had succeeded in containing the rebellion signaled by the young women’s malleable bodies.</p> </sec> <sec id="section4-0269758012447216"> <title>An avalanche of tragedy: Criminalization, victimization, and lessons from history</title> <p>In mid-October, four months after Mrs Mick’s death, Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn finally came up for trial. They pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter when evidence was introduced that Mrs Mick had not been sat on and strangled, as originally concluded from the coroner’s inquest into her death. Instead, expert medical opinion now deduced that Mrs Mick, aged 63 and weighing in at over 200 pounds, had suffered a stroke at least three hours after the young women had left the prison. At first, the Crown prosecutor wanted to proceed to trial on the murder charge in any case, reasoning that the actions of Prouse, McVinn, and Carroll were still directly responsible for Mrs Mick’s death. But, he quickly changed his mind and accepted the manslaughter plea when the defense suggested that they would put the evidence to a jury. While there is no record to document the Crown’s on-the-spot reasoning for accepting the lesser plea, it seems likely that the prosecutor assessed popular sentiment and determined that a jury of their peers would be unlikely to render a guilty verdict for murder.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0269758012447216">41</xref> </sup> A lesser plea, however, did not generate a lenient sentence, despite defense counsel’s submissions that the women’s youth and their attempts to not harm Mrs Mick merited consideration. On the contrary, in passing a five-year sentence at the penitentiary, Justice Middleton addressed the twin problems raised by the young women’s ‘mad escapade’. He first upheld the authority of law over public sentiment: ‘I have enough sympathy for them in their misfortunes … The question is: what is best for the public. If they were allowed to go without punishment, would it be a lesson to them, or would it be rather as a licence to others?’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0269758012447216">42</xref> </sup> Middleton then addressed the trio directly: ‘The punishment shall be sufficiently severe to impress upon you that virtue is its own reward and that the wages of sin is really death. You shall be sent to a place to serve such an apprenticeship that chastity will become a habit’.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0269758012447216">43</xref> </sup> Manslaughter may have been the charge, but female sexuality was what needed to be restrained.</p> <p>This faith in law as insurer of female virtue was shattered, however, when, several years later, all three women faced criminal charges in the Toronto courts once again. On 3 January 1929, the Toronto Women’s Police Court heard an ‘echo’ of its past as Bessie Carroll and Jennie McVinn, paroled only two weeks earlier, after serving three years at the penitentiary, stood together before Magistrate Patterson on a charge of theft ‘preferred by a Department store. They were seen taking dresses, coats and a pair of cuff links’ by the store detective.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0269758012447216">44</xref> </sup> Magistrate Patterson sent both of them to hospital for a psychiatric assessment,<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0269758012447216">45</xref> </sup> and then they were sent back to prison to finish their sentences.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0269758012447216">46</xref> </sup> Isabel Prouse turned out to be even less impressed by the lessons of virtue and chastity. In 1930, she was charged with keeping a common bawdy house (at 383 Adelaide St West), and sentenced to yet another indeterminate sentence not to exceed two years less a day at the provincial reformatory.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0269758012447216">47</xref> </sup> Released in October 1931, she was again arrested in 1932, again for keeping a common bawdy house (at 263 Sherbourne Street). Although this time she was sentenced to only six months’ imprisonment, once again, her status as a VD sufferer meant that she served yet another indeterminate sentence, and was finally released in January 1934.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0269758012447216">48</xref> </sup> Thereafter she disappears from the Toronto records. But, her file ends on an ominous note: a medical assessment concluded that ‘she was very antagonistic, and opposed to answering questions. Her morals are quite low. She possesses a marked feeling of grievance against the law … This woman is of the hardened criminal type and will in all probability commit further crimes and spend most of her life in custody.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0269758012447216">49</xref> </sup> </p> <p>It is clear that, in the end, the escalating criminalization experienced by the young women was the real ‘avalanche of tragedy’. What began as everyday acts of youthful defiance and sexual autonomy turned into a penitentiary sentence and further offences. In this context, Prouse’s ‘feeling of grievance against the law’ makes abundant sense. The use of criminal mechanisms to rein in troublesome young female bodies itself was a violence that, ultimately, begat violence and further criminalization. Like many criminalized women, Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn were justifiably angry about their confinement; unlike most criminalized women, however, their relentless resistance to being ‘good’ marked them out as especially newsworthy. And, in so doing, their activities forced Torontonians, if only for a moment, to consider the consequences of entanglement in the criminal justice net. As one letter writer put it: ‘when 16-year old girls face our courts charged with murder, a challenge is given to our whole social system.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0269758012447216">50</xref> </sup> What is distinctive about this case is that the young women helped to issue this challenge, not only by their actions, but through their own words and the construction of their own public identities. The young women thus disrupted efforts at easy characterizations and, as a result, commentators were unable to find a single frame through which to tell the sensational story. Thus, the press was forced to admit that the young women were angry and saw their incarceration as unjust, while also feeling a connection to Mrs Mick and being deeply troubled by her death. They engaged in a daring escape plan, and yet had nowhere to go once they left prison. And, according to the press, they were both responsible for the matron’s death, and unaware of the severity of the charges against them. They were defiant and remorseful, young and reformable, and old enough to know better. In a word, they were modern girls, and their plight seemed to capture a broader public ambiguity about what the future held.</p> <p>The story of Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn thus also speaks to us across history, and listening to their voices contributes to contemporary efforts to conceptualize the relationships between women, violence, resistance, and criminalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758012447216">Comack and Brickey (2007</xref>) argue that neither dominant frameworks of The Violent Woman as ‘mad, sad, or bad,’ nor feminist constructions of the Woman as Victim capture the complexities of women’s relationship to the spectrum of violence and victimization. In their interviews with 18 women convicted of perpetrating violence, Comack and Brickey found that the violent-or-victim dichotomy relies on fixing women’s identities within a singular framework in a way that inadequately appreciates the multiple self-identifications articulated by the women themselves. The criminalized women who spoke with Comack and Brickey saw themselves as neither solely victims nor solely perpetrators of violence but, instead, as caught up in a complicated web of structural and personal factors, only some of which were within their control. As Comack and Brickey conclude: ‘the women interviewed for this study are struggling to make sense of their circumstances and their own use of violence, particularly as these bear on who they are. In the process, they draw upon (and resist) the discourses available to them. Indeed, what is remarkable in these women’s narratives is their own aptitude in (re)framing their experiences and identities in relation to these dominant discourses’ (2007: 25). The pardon tales told by Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn offer an important historical antecedent to this finding: they, too, both used and subverted dominant discourses as they attempted to shape the framing of the events that so troubled their fellow Torontonians. They exercised an agency, albeit one circumscribed by the structural forces in which they found themselves, and were thus able to unsettle easy assumptions about women’s involvement in criminal activity, especially when that activity appeared to transgress traditional gender codes. The goal for feminist criminologists must be to use such openings to advance our theoretical frameworks, so that women like Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn, both victims and agents, may be understood in their own context and on their own terms.</p> <p>This need for a new theoretical language that can allow for more complex renderings of women’s victimization and criminalization is both widely acknowledged and urgent. As feminist criminologists often note, ‘we lack feminist explanations of women murderers who have not killed in self-defence … Woman-as-murderer is unspeakable and does not fit social norms and codes of femininity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269758012447216">Frigon, 2006</xref>: 4). While Prouse, Carroll, and McVinn were not wilful murderers, their actions did involve violence leading to death, and the press and the courts struggled hard to make their story fit within normative expectations of white adolescent femininity. The incoherence that resulted is both a sign of their failure and of the success of the young women’s tenacious refusal to be contained, either physically or discursively. The contradictory descriptions, the pull between sympathy and condemnation, and the interplay between pity and responsibility that characterized the girls’ story demonstrate that dichotomous conceptualizations of violence and victimization utterly fail to capture the fullness of criminalized women’s lives.</p> </sec> </body> <back> <ack> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>I would like to thank Leyna Lowe for her invaluable and enthusiastic research assistance in preparing this article.

The Concord Jail Farm, by contrast, was mainly populated by older women serving short-term sentences (usually less than five months), mostly for public drinking and other liquor offences. For discussion of the place of the Concord within the larger penal infrastructure for Toronto’s criminalized women, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758012447216">Glasbeek (2009</xref>).</p> </fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn20-0269758012447216"> <label>20.</label> <p>Because she was in her cell, Palmer did not see anything but she was, nonetheless, the chief ‘witness’ to the events at the coroner’s inquest.

They came to trial in September. Leonard Swales and William Norton were each given a one-month jail sentence, ‘not only as punishment but as a warning to other boys’ (Judge Denton, cited in <italic>Star</italic>, ‘Two boys get month for aiding in escape,’ 17 September 1925: 21). James Norton was given a suspended sentence (ibid.). Also charged with aiding and abetting the escape were Swale’s step-mother, Mrs Maud Poole (who had given the trio fresh clothing in the morning, after allowing them to spend the night on the couch) and one Mrs Edith Garrod of Draper Street, who also had given the young women a change of clothes on the night of their escape (Norton and Swales had driven them there before taking them to Swales’ home). Mrs Garrod told the police that ‘she had known the Carroll girl for two years and that she had met her at a restaurant’ (<italic>Star</italic>, ‘Eighth arrest is made to-day in farm escape,’ 1 June 1925: 1). However, it is also the case that one Mrs Edith Garrod, of Draper Street, is listed as a ‘friend’ of Gladys Palmer on her inmate intake form at the Concord (<italic>Concord Case Files</italic>). This suggests either that Carroll and Palmer knew each other or, at least, kept common company prior to finding themselves in prison together or that Palmer was more helpful in the escape plans than she (or the others) let on.
