<p>In <italic>A Strange Stirring</italic>, social historian Stephanie Coontz presents her historically, empirically, and personally grounded reflections on Betty Friedan’s classic work, <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>. Coontz offers a critical homage to Friedan’s book, which was one of the most influential works of nonfiction in twentieth-century America. Friedan’s book, which challenged the idea that women’s most important roles are as mothers and wives, developed a mystique of its own. While often subject to critique, even by those who have not read it, it is familiar to students and scholars of gender across disciplines who often credit it with sparking the Second Wave feminist movement in the United States. Weaving together social history, interviews with women who read it, and her own interpretations of and experiences with Friedan’s book, Coontz seeks to explain the immense resonance of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> for middle-class American housewives of the early 1960s, and assess its continued relevance to gender politics and feminism in the United States.</p>
<p><italic>A Strange Stirring</italic> has at least three complementary goals. The first is to situate <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> historically, illuminating the status of women in the United States in the decades before and after its publication. This historical positioning of the book reveals how some of the claims made about <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> since its publication—such as that it sparked the Second Wave feminist movement—are largely unfounded. More importantly, presenting <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> as a reflection of Friedan’s experiences and social location, as well as a reflection of a particular moment in history, helps contemporary readers understand why it was so groundbreaking and how it reflected the social context of its time and author.</p>
<p>The second goal is to offer a critical reading of Friedan’s work that at once recognizes the significance of the book for public and private discussions of gender, while also illuminating its contradictions and silences. Feminist sociologists likely share Coontz’s critique of Friedan as overly focused on the interests and experiences of white, middle-class, suburban, married, and mothering women, and neglectful of women of color, lower-class women, lesbian/bisexual/queer women, urban, unmarried, and childfree women. Still, even if unsurprising, Coontz’s detailed discussion of the omissions in Friedan’s work—which includes a rich array of information on the life choices available to Black and working-class women—sheds new light on the structural positions of Black women and lower-class women in 1950s and 1960s America. Coontz offers much less by way of analysis on Friedan’s inattention to lesbian/bisexual/queer women, and unmarried and childfree women.</p>
<p>The third goal is to examine the effects of Friedan’s groundbreaking work on American women and American gender politics, both at the time of the book’s first publication in 1963 and through the contemporary period. Drawing on surveys and interviews conducted in the contemporary period, as well as letters Friedan received from readers, Coontz convincingly demonstrates how reading <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> was a profound and empowering experience for many. While many of today’s readers will not feel <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> speaks to their experiences, Coontz argues that we can still learn from Friedan: “Whatever the limits of Friedan’s work for today’s readers, her insistence on the need to break down prevailing assumptions about women, work, and family and to look for the societal origins of dilemmas that are often experienced as purely personal remains extremely relevant” (p. 165).</p>
<p>Although Coontz recognizes the profound resonance of this book for millions of Americans, and its importance for feminist thinking, she has no illusions that Friedan’s work was anything but flawed. Ultimately—and I think this is a significant accomplishment—Coontz manages to articulate how Friedan’s book promoted the interests of women without coming across as an apologist for Friedan’s inattention to huge swaths of American women, or to her often individualistic, rather than structural, suggestions for change. Unfortunately, Coontz herself at times falls into the trap of individualism, as the bulk of her material about the impact of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> deals with the reactions of individual women with much less attention to if and how reading the book inspired these women to push for structural change.</p>
<p>One of the book’s strengths is its use of varied data sources over different time periods. Coontz looks to the decades before and after the publication of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> to understand its origins and impacts. Unfortunately, a lack of methodological detail undermines the reader’s understanding of how some of the core data were collected and how the analysis was constructed. The acknowledgments indicate that Coontz collected 188 surveys from women and men who read <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> and conducted follow-up interviews with some of these respondents. Yet the bibliography refers to 188 <italic>interviews</italic> rather than 188 surveys. Nowhere do readers learn what the survey asked, to whom it was sent, how survey respondents were selected for interviews, if interviews constituted a subsample of survey respondents, or what the content of those interviews was. I could not determine if many of the quotes used in the analysis—especially those from other academics—came from interviews, informal conversations, publications, or other sources. A lengthy methodological discussion is not necessarily appropriate for a book aimed at a non-academic audience. Still, any audience would benefit from a clear understanding of how Coontz is assessing the impact of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> on American women and society.</p>
<p>A welcome addition that Coontz or others might take up in the future would be attention to if and how <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> resonated/resonates with women globally. The book was published in many European countries by the late 1960s, and was ultimately translated into at least a dozen languages. Throughout her career as an advocate for women’s issues, Friedan spoke of the “women of the world,” who she believed suffered together from low status, limited opportunities, and the drudgery of housework. Yet we know relatively little about the reception of Friedan’s book outside the United States.</p>
<p>In sum, <italic>A Strange Stirring</italic> helpfully situates <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> historically, and points to the book’s significance for the many American women who felt strangled by what Friedan famously called “the problem that has no name,” or the widespread dissatisfaction many American housewives experienced in the 1950s and 1960s. Coontz offers a balanced account of the strengths and weaknesses of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>. Her prose is highly accessible, making this book appropriate for general readers, and in lower division courses addressing the history of American women and/or American feminism. It also makes enjoyable reading for scholars who want to learn more about the historical context of Friedan’s work.</p>
