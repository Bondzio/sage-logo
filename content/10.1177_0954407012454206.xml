<abstract>
<p>A novel combustion concept called ‘multiple premixed compression ignition’ in the gasoline direct injection compression ignition regime is proposed. Its predominant feature is the first premixed and subsequent quasi-premixed combustion processes in a sequence of ‘spray–combustion–spray-combustion’ around the compression top dead center. The multiple-stage premixed combustion decouples the pressure rise from the pollutants formation process, which means the pressure rise rate and emissions can be reduced simultaneously, while achieving a high thermal efficiency. The experimental study of the multiple premixed compression ignition mode has been carried out in a single cylinder research engine retrofitted from a light-duty diesel engine with a compression ratio of 18.5. Low octane gasoline with the research octane number of 66 was tested under 1400 r/min, 0.8 MPa indicated mean effective pressure conditions, without exhaust gas recirculation or intake conditioning. A parameter study of common rail pressure was implemented to investigate its effect on the performance of the multiple premixed compression ignition mode. When the common rail pressure is 60 MPa under the foregoing operating conditions, the shortest ignition delay of the test fuel is observed. In addition, compared to the single-stage diffusion combustion in traditional diesel engines, the multiple premixed compression ignition mode with the test fuel achieves lower emissions of soot, NO and CO, as well as slightly higher indicated efficiency, with a penalty of higher total hydrocarbon emissions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The thermal efficiency of traditional spark-ignition (SI) gasoline engines is relatively low because of the low compression ratio and high pumping losses, and many efforts have been made to improve the fuel economy of such engines. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is well known for its high thermal efficiency and low particulate matter (PM) and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. However, different from the traditional SI gasoline engine, where heat release is controlled by flame propagation, and the conventional diesel engine, where heat release is controlled by mixing process of fuel and air, the HCCI engine is wholly governed by chemical kinetics. As a result, the start of combustion (SOC) and heat release process are hard to control. Furthermore, the biggest challenge is perhaps to expand the operating range to high load, due to the unacceptable pressure rise rate and combustion noise.</p>
<p>Kalghatgi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012454206">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012454206"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012454206">4</xref></sup> have introduced a successful concept of HCCI using high octane fuels such as gasoline by direct injection into a compression ignition engine. The idea is to realize a separation between the end of injection (EOI) and start of combustion (SOC) without using very high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), early injection or low compression ratio. The engine is operated in gasoline partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) mode, where the stratification of fuel concentration plays a key role, and high efficiency and power density and low emissions have been achieved. This concept has been researched subsequently by Reitz et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012454206">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012454206"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012454206">8</xref></sup> Johansson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012454206">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012454206"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012454206"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012454206">16</xref></sup> Weall and Collings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012454206">17</xref></sup> Zhang et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012454206">18</xref></sup> Sellnau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012454206">19</xref></sup> and Dec et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012454206">20</xref></sup> on high octane number fuels in PPCI mode with different EGR rates, different intake temperatures and boosting pressures, under different loads and speeds. The results reported in the literature have shown that the gasoline PPCI mode has high potential to achieve lower NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM emissions while maintaining low indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) compared to traditional diesel engines. However, high CO and HC emissions at high load still need to be controlled, and the high pressure rise rate remains a big issue.</p>
<p>A novel combustion concept termed ‘multiple premixed compression ignition’ (MPCI) for gasoline direct injection engines working in the compression ignition (GDICI) regime is proposed in this study. In order to build up a clear difference between the PPCI and MPCI modes, the spray events and heat release profile of them are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012454206">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012454206">2</xref>. Obviously, the first premixed and subsequent quasi-premixed combustion processes, in a sequence of ‘spray–combustion–spray–combustion’ around the compression top dead centre (TDC), are the predominant feature of MPCI mode, rather than the ‘spray–spray–combustion’ sequence in the PPCI mode. The interlaced spray and combustion events in MPCI mode can be repeated twice or more, but it is better to fully separate each spray from the previous combustion without overlap so as to ensure the premixed combustion processes. The biggest advantage of the MPCI mode is that it decouples the pressure rise from the pollutants formation process. In other words, the maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) can be tuned by optimizing the injection times and dwell, as well as the split ratio and injection timing, while the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM formation, as well as total hydrocarbon (THC) and CO, can be regulated in each premixed combustion process, respectively. As a result, this type of combustion mode overcomes the difficulties in combustion control when a more homogeneous charge is formed to reduce NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM emissions in the HCCI or PPCI modes at high engine load. The combustion duration in MPCI mode can be longer because the multiple spray and combustion events will control the heat release rate. Although an overlong combustion process is not desirable, the injection timing and dwell can be optimized to obtain high thermal efficiency.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the other hand, each pair of spray and premixed combustion can be shorter due to multiple injections, and the combustion region can be concentrated in the combustion chamber. Consequently, the gap between the combustion area and cylinder wall can be filled with air, which means the THC and CO from incomplete combustion and the heat loss from the chamber will be low. The key point of the gasoline MPCI mode is to separate each spray from the preceding combustion to achieve sequential premixed combustion. Because the gas temperature is lower when the first injection happens, so the ignition delay of the gasoline fuel in the first injection will be longer than that of the following injections. As a result, the first combustion process of the gasoline MPCI mode will be sufficiently premixed due to the better mixing of fuel and air during the longer ignition delay time, and the local combustion temperature will be lower, which will lead to lower NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions. But subsequently the gasoline will be injected into the burned mixture from the previous combustion, which is hot and lacks oxygen. However, thanks to the high octane number (ON) and high volatility of gasoline, the subsequent combustions can be premixed or quasi-premixed. Furthermore, the local temperature and equivalence ratio of the following premixed combustion process will be higher and larger than the first premixed combustion. As a result, the expected path of the gasoline MPCI combustion in a ϕ–T diagram<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012454206">21</xref></sup> can be plotted, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454206">Figure 3</xref>. Although the followed combustion takes place in a high temperature and fuel rich atmosphere, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions can be low after optimization of injection timing and split ratio. It can be easily seen that it is preferable for the first injection to be larger and earlier than the subsequent ones in order to form a greater sufficiently-premixed charge, but the upper limit of MPRR is also a restraint of the first premixed combustion, just as in the HCCI and PPCI modes.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the analysis above, it is expected that the gasoline MPCI has the potential to realize high efficiency and low emissions simultaneously, especially at high engine load conditions. However, because of the complexity of the multi-stage spray and combustion characteristics of the gasoline MPCI mode, a number of parameters have to be tuned in order to achieve low fuel consumption and emissions. The author has studied the influence of injection timing and split ratios in a previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012454206">22</xref></sup> and the effect of common rail pressure on the performance of the MPCI mode with low octane gasoline will be investigated in this paper. A single-cylinder compression ignition engine with the displacement of 0.7 l and compression ratio of 18.5, retrofitted from a four-cylinder light-duty diesel engine, is used to investigate the gasoline MPCI combustion mode. The low octane gasoline with research octane number (RON) of 66 is tested in this study, without intake preheating or boosting. A sweeping of common rail pressure is carried out for RON66 with a two-stage premixed combustion mode. As a comparative study, the single-stage diffusion combustion mode of a conventional diesel engine is also tested under the same conditions.</p>

<p>The engine is connected to an electric eddy current dynamometer, and the original intake and exhaust manifolds, with a turbocharger, are replaced by a naturally aspirated intake and exhaust system for this fundamental combustion mode study. Hence, the intake temperature and pressure in this paper are maintained at the ambient condition of around 15°C and 0.1 MPa, respectively. The engine electronic control unit (ECU) is changed to a research module for flexible control of the fuel injections. The experiments were carried out after the engine was warmed up and reached a stable operating condition. It was found that the speed of 1400 r/min is a stable running speed for the retrofitted single-cylinder engine. Hence, in order to mitigate vibration during the experiment, 1400 r/min was selected as the test speed for the fundamental research of the gasoline MPCI mode in this study.</p>

<title>Test fuels</title>
<p>In order to avoid knocking in traditional SI gasoline engines, it is better for conventional gasoline fuel to have a high octane number. It is well known that the straight-run gasoline fuels known as petroleum naphtha have a lower octane number, which cannot meet the requirements of modern SI gasoline engines. As a result, further refinery processes and anti-knock additives are needed to improve the anti-knock performance of gasoline SI engines. It has been proven that MTBE additives can pollute groundwater when leakage occurs, so it is clear that the measures taken to improve the gasoline octane number are either costly or harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>Low octane number gasoline fuels, in contrast, have their own advantages. Without the need for complicated refining processes and antiknock additives, they are produced at lower cost and are much less harmful to the environment. In addition, low octane number fuels can be easily collected in large quantitiess from the gas condensation formed during natural gas exploitation. Furthermore, the high volatility and feasible auto-ignition quality of the low octane number fuel make it suitable for use in compression ignition engines.</p>
<p>In this study, a low octane gasoline fuel which is a mixture of 70% (v/v) 93# commercial gasoline (RON 94.4) and 30% (v/v) n-heptane is used during the research of the MPCI mode. The mixture has a RON of 66.1 according to the method of linear by volume (LbV), and it is referred to as RON66 in this paper for ease. For comparison, a commercial diesel fuel with 0°C freezing point (No.0 diesel) is also tested in a conventional single-stage diffusion combustion mode. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012454206">Table 2</xref> gives the main properties of these two kinds of fuels.</p>

<title>Test methods</title>
<p>All the tests are carried out at an engine speed of 1400 r/min and a load condition of 0.8 MPa IMEP, without intake air conditioning or EGR. From the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012454206">22</xref></sup> it is found that when the injection dwell is 50°crank angle (CA), the fuel consumption and emissions can be balanced well, though the second injection cannot be thoroughly separated from the first premixed combustion process. Consequently, for the study of the two-stage MPCI mode in this paper, the first injection is located at −50°CA after top dead centre (ATDC) and the second injection at top dead centre for RON66; while single injection of diesel occurs at −15°CA ATDC. A split ratio of 50%, which means that the fuel mass in the first injection is 50% of the total, is used for the RON66 MPCI mode during all the tests. The key issue for the gasoline MPCI is that the fuel and air must be mixed well and rapidly and then a fast combustion should be organized during each pair of spray and combustion processes. Hence the effect of common rail pressure on the performance of the RON66 MPCI mode is investigated in this paper, via a sweeping of common rail pressure under the above-mentioned conditions. The No.0 diesel fuel is also tested under the same conditions, but using a single injection strategy, as in conventional diesel engines for the purpose of comparative study.</p>
<p>The in-cylinder pressure is measured using a Kistler 6125C pressure transducer mounted in the cylinder head and recorded using an AVL IndiModul 621 with a resolution of 0.5° CA in this study. Combustion analysis data is calculated based on the average cylinder pressure of 50 consecutive cycles. Smoke measurements are taken in BSU (Bosch Smoke Unit) using a FBY-1 type unheated sample smoke meter which uses the filter paper sampling method. The exhaust gas emissions are measured using a Horiba MEXA-584L gas analyser, including CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, NO, THC and exhaust lambda values. Fuel consumption is measured using an ONO SOKKI DF-313 digital fuel meter.</p>

<p>The mean gas temperature in the cylinder is something like the ‘cylinder bulk temperature’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012454206">23</xref></sup> which is calculated from the cylinder pressure trace. It is assumed that the temperature and the gas composition is the same in the whole bulk, and this is a quite good assumption with HCCI. Although the temperature of the gasoline MPCI mode is not homogeneous in the whole cylinder, the mean gas temperature can reveal the main feature of each premixed combustion process, and it is closely related to the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot. Calculation of the heat release rate in this paper is according to the first law of thermodynamics, and the interval of real time calculation is 1° CA. The calculation is based on a constant polytropic coefficient of 1.37 to simulate the property of the fuel and air mixture as well as the combustion products in this study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454206">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012454206">5</xref> give the mean gas temperature and the heat release rate profile of the diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI modes under different common rail pressures, respectively. It is clear that the mean gas temperature is affected by the SOC significantly, and the RON66 MPCI mode has a lower peak temperature than diesel single injection mode due to a multiple-stage heat release process. Though the local peak temperature will be higher than the mean gas temperature, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012454206">Figure 5</xref> we can see that it is possible to produce a higher temperature in the second premixed combustion process than in the first one, and this is mainly due to heat accumulation from the first premixed combustion in the cylinder. This phenomenon supports the expected pathway of the gasoline MPCI mode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454206">Figure 3</xref>, to a certain extent, which demonstrates that the gasoline MPCI combustion mode is promising for reducing NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions simultaneously while maintaining relatively high fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>The CA10, which is defined as the crank angle corresponding to the time when 10% mass fraction fuel is burnt, is a good representation of the SOC. The CA10 of the diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI modes under different common rail pressures are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012454206">Figure 6</xref>. An interesting trend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012454206">Figure 6</xref> is that the SOC of the diesel single injection mode becomes earlier and earlier as the common rail pressure increases, while the ignition delay of RON66 has the shortest value at 60 MPa common rail pressure. This is perhaps because of the different viscosity of diesel and RON66. As is widely known, under the same temperature and pressure conditions in IC engines, the stoichiometric mixture of fuel and air has the greatest tendency towards auto-ignition. So, because of the high viscosity of diesel fuel, the liquid core of the diesel spray is hard to break up and evaporate to form a stoichiometric mixture. As a result, if the common rail pressure becomes higher, it is much easier for diesel spray to produce a stoichiometric mixture with air, and this promotes the auto-ignition process of diesel. However, because of the high volatility and low viscosity of RON66 gasoline fuel, though higher common rail pressure is beneficial in forming a homogeneous charge, a too high common rail pressure makes the mixture leaner than stoichiometric, which prolongs the ignition delay time of RON66. This trend can also be observed from the combustion phasing CA50 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012454206">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012454206">Figure 7</xref>, the combustion phasing CA50 is defined as the crank angle corresponding to the time when 50% fuel is burned out, so it reflects the combustion speed in the earlier stage. The smaller CA50 value of the diesel single injection mode reveals that diesel has a faster combustion speed in the premixed combustion phase. However, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454206">Figure 4</xref> it can be seen that the diesel single injection mode has a long diffusion combustion tail where the combustion speed is much lower than that of the second premixed combustion process of the RON66 MPCI mode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012454206">Figure 5</xref>. Moreover, the combustion speed of the second premixed combustion process in the RON66 MPCI mode becomes faster at higher common rail pressures, though its CA50 becomes larger. This will lead to higher fuel efficiency for the RON66 MPCI mode than for the diesel single injection mode. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012454206">Figure 7</xref> it can also be seen that the MPRR of the RON66 MPCI mode is at the same level as the diesel single injection mode, which means that the gasoline MPCI combustion mode overcomes the knocking constraint in the HCCI and PPCI modes by applying the multiple-stage premixed combustion process, where the heat release process can be effectively controlled by the injection events.</p>

Obviously, both the indicated efficiency of diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI modes increases as the common rail pressure rises, due to a faster mixing and combustion process at higher common rail pressures. In addition, the higher combustion efficiency of the multiple-stage premixed combustion process in the RON66 MPCI mode than in the diesel diffusion combustion process is another reason for the higher indicated efficiency of the RON66 MPCI mode. Furthermore, the low heat transfer loss in the first premixed combustion process resulting from the lower peak temperature of the RON66 MPCI mode also leads to a higher indicated efficiency than the single-stage diffusion combustion process of traditional diesel engines.</p>

<title>Pollutants emission performance</title>
<p>The indicated specific emissions of pollutants are calculated based on the indicated work, which is derived from the average cylinder pressure of 50 consecutive engine cycles. The indicated specific NO and soot emission of the diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI mode as the common rail pressure sweeping are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454206">Fig. 9</xref>. It is encouraging to see that different from the trade-off relationship between NO and soot in conventional diesel diffusion combustion mode, the RON66 MPCI mode has very low NO and soot emissions, simultaneously. This phenomenon proves the theoretical analysis above and the pathway of the gasoline MPCI mode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454206">Figure 3</xref> once again. At a common rail pressure of 60 MPa, the NO and soot of the RON66 MPCI mode is slightly higher. This is because, at this common rail pressure, the RON66 has the shortest ignition delay time, which results in a slightly poorer mixing process and a higher peak temperature for the first premixed combustion. Overall, the high volatility and intermediate octane rating of RON66 make it easy to produce premixed charge, and the multiple-stage premixed combustion process decouples the pressure rise and the pollutants formation process. With careful optimization of the injection parameters it is possible to achieve very low NO and soot emissions simultaneously, while maintaining relative high fuel efficiency.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454206">Figure 10</xref> gives the indicated specific THC and CO emissions of the diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI modes as the common rail pressure sweeps. The lower combustion temperature of the first lean and premixed combustion process in the RON66 MPCI mode prevents the NO and soot formation, but the combustion temperature becomes too low to oxidize the fuel completely. This low combustion temperature results in higher emissions of unburned hydrocarbons than the diesel single injection mode. The combustion temperature near the walls will be even lower, due to heat losses. Combustion may be quenched or not occur at all close to the walls. However, the THC emission of the RON66 MPCI mode is still lower than that of the HCCI mode, where the charge is nearly homogeneous all around the cylinder. Fortunately, the THC and CO can be easily converted into H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> using a diesel oxidation catalyst at low cost. This measure ensures the gasoline MPCI concept to be a highly efficient and controllable combustion mode, with the potential to meet increasingly stringent emission standards in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This paper proposes a new combustion mode of multiple premixed compression ignitions (MPCI) for gasoline direct injection engines, and has demonstrated it in a single cylinder engine with a high compression ratio of 18.5 and a displacement of 0.7 l. The indicated efficiency and emissions of the RON66 gasoline MPCI combustion mode have been analysed and compared with the commercial 0# diesel single injection mode under the same running conditions. A parameter study of common rail pressure is carried out to investigate its effect on the performance of the RON66 MPCI combustion mode.</p>
<p>When fueled with low octane gasoline of RON66, a stable two-stage MPCI mode can be realized without intake conditioning or EGR, under the conditions of 1400 r/min, 0.8 MPa IMEP, with a split ratio of 50% and an injection dwell of 50° CA. The RON66 MPCI mode has lower NO, soot and CO emissions, except for THC, and slightly higher indicated efficiency than the conventional diesel combustion mode, and at the same time also has an acceptable MPRR level.</p>
<p>The two-stage gasoline premixed combustion process can be used to alleviate the unacceptably-high MPRR levels in single-stage gasoline premixed combustion, such as HCCI. That means the heat release process of the gasoline MPCI mode can be effectively controlled by the injection events. At the same time, the gasoline MPCI mode overcomes the trade-off relationship between the NO and soot emissions in traditional diesel diffusion combustion mode, which makes it possible to reduce the NO and soot emissions simultaneously, even under high engine load conditions.</p>
<p>Common rail pressure has a significant effect on the SOC both for diesel and RON66, and the RON66 gasoline fuel has the shortest ignition delay at 60 MPa common rail pressure, while the diesel has the shortest ignition delay time at 100 MPa common rail pressure, in this study. Higher indicated efficiency is obtained at higher common rail pressure because of the rapid mixing and combustion process both for the diesel single injection and RON66 MPCI modes.</p>
