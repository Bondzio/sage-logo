<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="section3-1534734612438649">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Nursing homes for older people provide an environment likely to promote the acquisition and spread of meticillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), putting residents at increased risk of colonization and infection. It is recognized that infection prevention and control strategies are important in preventing and controlling MRSA transmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534734612438649">
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To determine the effects of infection prevention and control strategies for preventing the transmission of MRSA in nursing homes for older people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534734612438649">
<title>Search methods</title>
<p>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <italic>The Cochrane Library</italic> 2011, Issue 2), the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched May 27, 2011). We also searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1950 to April 2011, Week 2), OVID MEDLINE (In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, April 26, 2011), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011, Week 16), EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to April 21, 2011), DARE (1992 to 2011, Week 16), Web of Science (1981 to May 2011), and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Web site (1988 to May 2011). Research in progress was sought through Current Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>), Medical Research Council Research portfolio, and HSRPRoj (current USA projects).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534734612438649">
<title>Selection criteria</title>
<p>All randomized and controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies of infection prevention and control interventions in nursing homes for older people were eligible for inclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534734612438649">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>Two review authors independently reviewed the results of the searches. Another review author appraised identified papers and undertook data extraction, which was checked by a second review author.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534734612438649">
<title>Main results</title>
<p>For this second update only 1 study was identified; therefore, it was not possible to undertake a meta-analysis. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 32 nursing homes evaluated the effect of an infection control education and training program on MRSA prevalence. The primary outcome was MRSA prevalence in residents and staff and a change in infection control audit scores, which measured adherence to infection control standards. At the end of the 12-month study, there was no change in MRSA prevalence between intervention and control sites, whereas mean infection control audit scores were significantly higher in the intervention homes compared with control homes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534734612438649">
<title>Authors’ conclusions</title>
<p>There is a lack of research evaluating the effects on MRSA transmission of infection prevention and control strategies in nursing homes. Rigorous studies should be conducted in nursing homes, to test interventions that have been specifically designed for this unique environment.</p>

<title>Synopsis</title>
<p>MRSA is a bacterium that can cause infection in people, particularly those who are in hospital. MRSA is now becoming a problem for older people (residents) who live in nursing homes. Nursing homes are ideal places for MRSA to spread: the residents live close to each other, many have a number of medical conditions and may receive several prescriptions for antibiotics, and some may have pressure sores and medical devices such as catheters. All these factors increase the risk of residents getting MRSA and so increase their risk of dying.</p>
<p>Many different ways of preventing the spread of MRSA have been studied, particularly in hospitals; however, we found only 1 study that looked at whether an infection control education and training program influenced the spread of MRSA in nursing homes for older people. This study showed there was no difference between the group that was involved in the program and the comparison group that continued with their normal practice.</p>
<p>Although there is some evidence for techniques that work well to prevent the spread of MRSA in hospital, it is not clear if these approaches will work in nursing homes for older people. Further research is needed to establish what will work in nursing homes.</p>

<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="section13-1534734612438649">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Pressure ulcers are treated by reducing pressure on the areas of damaged skin. Special support surfaces (including beds, mattresses, and cushions) designed to redistribute pressure are widely used as treatments. The relative effects of different support surfaces are unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534734612438649">
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To assess the effects of pressure-relieving support surfaces in the treatment of pressure ulcers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534734612438649">
<title>Search methods</title>
<p>We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched July 15, 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <italic>The Cochrane Library</italic> 2011 Issue 3). Ovid MEDLINE (2007 to July 2011, Week 1), Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, July 14, 2011), Ovid EMBASE (2007 to 2011, Week 27), and EBSCO CINAHL (2007 to July 14, 2011). The reference sections of included studies were also searched.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534734612438649">
<title>Selection criteria</title>
<p>We included published or unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers, in any patient group or setting, that reported an objective measure of wound healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534734612438649">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by 2 review authors. Trials with similar patients, comparisons, and outcomes were considered for pooled analysis. Where pooling was inappropriate the results of the trials were reported narratively. Where possible, the risk ratio or mean difference was calculated for the results of individual studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1534734612438649">
<title>Main results</title>
<p>We identified 18 trials of support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment, involving 1309 participants with samples sizes that ranged from 14 to 160. Of 3 trials comparing air-fluidized devices with conventional therapy, 2 reported significant reductions in pressure ulcer size associated with air-fluidized devices. Due to lack of reported variance data we could not replicate the analyses. In relation to 3 of the trials that reported significant reductions in pressure ulcer size favoring low air loss devices compared with foam alternatives, we found no significant differences. A small trial found that sheepskin placed under the legs significantly reduced redness, and similarly a small subgroup analysis favored a profiling bed compared with a standard bed in terms of the healing of existing grade 1 pressure ulcers. Poor reporting, clinical heterogeneity, lack of variance data, and methodological limitations in the eligible trials meant that no pooled comparisons were undertaken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534734612438649">
<title>Authors’ conclusions</title>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence about the superiority of any support surface for the treatment of existing pressure ulcers. Methodological issues included variations in outcomes measured, sample sizes, and comparison groups. Many studies had small sample sizes and often there was inadequate description of the intervention, standard care, and co-interventions. Individual study results were often inadequately reported, with failure to report variance data common, thus hindering the calculation of mean differences. Some studies did not report <italic>P</italic> values when reporting on differences in outcomes. In addition, the age of some trials (some being 20 years old) means that other technologies may have superseded those investigated.</p>
<p>Further and rigorous studies are required to address these concerns and to improve the evidence base before firm conclusions can be drawn about the most effective support surfaces to treat pressure ulcers.</p>

<title>Synopsis</title>
<p>Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, decubitus ulcers, and bed sores) are ulcers on the skin caused by pressure or rubbing at the weight-bearing, bony points of immobilized people (such as hips, heels, and elbows). Different support surfaces (eg, beds, mattresses, mattress overlays, and cushions) aim to relieve pressure and are used to cushion vulnerable parts of the body and distribute the surface pressure more evenly.</p>
<p>Support surfaces are used alongside other treatments such as wound dressings to treat pressure ulcers, and this review has reviewed studies that compared different types of support surface. Low-tech support surfaces included foam-filled mattresses, fluid-filled mattresses, bead-filled mattresses, air-filled mattresses, and alternative foam mattresses and overlays. High-tech support surfaces included mattresses and overlays that are electrically powered to alternate the pressure within the surface, beds that are powered to have air mechanically circulated within them, and low-air-loss beds that contain warm air moving within pockets inside the bed. Other support surfaces included sheepskins, cushions, and operating table overlays.</p>
<p>We are unable to draw any firm conclusions about the relative effects of support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers because the evidence base is weak. Current trials have failed to provide robust evidence due to small sample sizes, poor reporting of results, and poor quality of study conduct and design. Further rigorously conducted research into the use of support surfaces for treating pressure ulcer surfaces is required.</p>
