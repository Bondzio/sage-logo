<abstract>
<p>This article highlights religious congregations as a form of nonprofit organization and voluntary association. It contends that, when theology and faith are removed, congregations are a ubiquitous form of nonprofit organization. The article focuses on five key areas of understanding congregations: defining congregations in a manner that set them apart, the great variability that exists among congregations, why congregations are important, what congregations do that is unique, and who attends congregations. As there are many others aspects of congregational studies, the article also suggests other areas of study as well as key supporting citations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Providing an overview of one of the world’s most common and diverse social organizations is not an easy task. There is a lot to cover, and a lot we still do not know. For this reason, the following review article does not introduce new knowledge about congregations. Rather, we aim to provide the reader with a framework that is essential, basic, and specific enough to facilitate an understanding of religious congregations in a systematic manner. Such a project requires painting with a wide brush. The world of congregations is so diverse that there are exceptions to almost every statement presented below. Nevertheless, common patterns remain in the way worshipers institutionalize their beliefs and practices. This article attempts to illuminate them. We start by contrasting congregations with nonprofit organizations in general.</p>
<p>A few authors have already noted on the overlap between congregations and nonprofit organizations. However, there is disagreement regarding the role of congregations in paving the way for American reliance on nonprofit and voluntary organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012460730">Ammerman (1997)</xref> noted that “American congregations have been characterized, almost from the beginning, by their voluntary nature and consequent diversity” (p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0899764012460730">Jeavons (2000)</xref> goes one step further and asserted that “Congregations are the archetypal voluntary association—at least in the United States—and have been the models, source of inspiration, and seedbed for the development of many other organizations that populate the nonprofit sector” (p. 457). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764012460730">Holifield (1994)</xref>, however, disagreed with the timing and argued that the voluntary nature of congregations came with disestablishment and after independence.</p>
<p>In this review we do not take the categorical approach proposed by scholars like Ammerman and Jeavons but rather attempt to contrast congregations and nonprofit organizations. After reading the history of congregations it is more likely to conclude that, until the era of postindependence, congregations were more an arm of the state than true voluntary associations. With few exceptions they were financed by colonial or local taxes and clergy were selected by the powers in London or by local politicians. Although there were exceptions to the rule, it is only after disestablishment that congregations became true voluntary organizations. At that time there were already many other thriving voluntary organizations in existence, and the growth of both congregations and nonprofit organizations was parallel.</p>
<p>In this article, we are following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764012460730">Harris (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764012460730">1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0899764012460730">Warner (1994)</xref> who contended that congregations are a subset of voluntary associations, distinct enough to be singularly defined and studied. It is the religious and spiritual aspects of congregations that make them unique. Unlike other voluntary associations, congregations are composed of people who share a belief in a higher being, whether it is God, gods, or a search for a transcendent experience. As a structured and organized entity, a congregation expresses its beliefs through the shared values, mores, and practices of its members.</p>
<p>According to The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764012460730">Foundation Center (2011)</xref>, in the United States there are 1.5 million nonprofit organizations and about a million of them are registered 501(c)(3) organizations. Although no one knows the exact number of existing congregations, estimates range between 330,000 and 400,000. Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> found, “More Americans are involved in a religious congregation than in any other type of association, group, or club” (p. 29).</p>
<p>The first amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been interpreted so as to separate congregations from the state’s guidance or support. Congregations, regardless of size or creed, are not required to register with the IRS or to submit annual financial reports. To qualify as a congregation (“church” in IRS language) the organization must meet the following five criteria:
<list id="list1-0899764012460730" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The organization must be organized and operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific, or other charitable purposes,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Net earnings may not inure to the benefit of any private individual or shareholder,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No substantial part of its activity may be attempting to influence legislation,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The organization may not intervene in political campaigns, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The organization’s purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764012460730">Internal Revenue Service [IRS], 2012</xref>, p. 3)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Although both congregations and religious organizations (defined as “other entities whose principal purpose is the study or advancement of religion”) are exempt from federal income taxes, only congregations are <italic>presumptively</italic> exempt—that is, not required to apply for tax exemption or to file annual informational returns. In other words, one can declare an organization a congregation, and it is one—de facto and de jure—with all the tax benefits involved. When the courts have to decide what is and what is not a congregation, they apply the associational test. An organization is a church if it brings a body of believers together on a regular basis for communal worship. This topic will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>Numerous studies analyze one congregation from an ethnographic perspective. Many others evaluate congregations within one faith tradition (usually denominational-based surveys). Still others look at congregations from various faith traditions, while focusing on one topic. An attempt to review congregations as a whole, however, is a tall order. In previous decades, studies were mostly devoted to theological tenets and differences and not to congregations as social organizations. Only during the past two decades has it been prominent on the academic agenda. Much of present research focuses mostly on uncovering relationships that hold true for one aspect of congregational life or on proving the relationships between a few variables relating to congregations. Although such concepts are indispensable in understanding underlying dynamics, they hew closely to empirical observations. In doing so, they deprive the reader of an overview that will allow a comprehensive yet relevant understanding of the world of religious congregations. As DiMaggio argued, “good theory” is multidimensional. The best theories are hybrids, combining different approaches to the same topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764012460730">DiMaggio, 1995</xref>). In this manner, this article aims to provide a helpful map to guide any student of congregations. There is some bias toward U.S. congregations, as they are the most studied and the ones with which we are most familiar, but we will also make some attempts to generalize globally. In our background research, we made special use of three books: Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman’s (2005)</xref> <italic>Pillars of Faith: American Congregations and Their Partners</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012460730">Mark Chaves’ (2004)</xref> <italic>Congregations in America</italic>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Robert Putnam and David Campbell’s (2010)</xref> <italic>American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us</italic>. We also relied on many other sources, as well as my 20 years of researching American local religious congregations—including two citywide censuses of congregations (Philadelphia, PA, and Wilmington, DE).</p>
<p>This article centers on topics we believe crucial to understanding the world of congregations—especially vis-à-vis other nonprofit organizations. We begin with an attempt to define congregations as a distinct set of locally based nonprofit organizations. We then discuss congregational diversity and segregation. Following this section, we explain the key functions congregations serve for their members and for society. Next, we explore the work of a congregation, showing that the administrative and organizational life of congregations is more complex and variegated than usually assumed. Finally, we examine the demographic makeup of congregations.</p>
<p>We are under no illusion that this review will chart the full picture of local religious congregations. My aim is to provide one theoretical road map. Much more work is yet to be done.</p>

<sec id="section2-0899764012460730">
<title>Defining Congregations</title>
<p>Congregations are the smallest organized units of collective religiosity in a given society. How do we identify such units? To some, it may seem obvious. A building with a steeple, a cross, the Star of David, or a minaret, where people come and go in regular intervals, for the purpose of religious worship—this is the intuitive picture of a congregation. It captures a lot of what a congregation is. But it is insufficient.</p>
<p>It is clear that a congregation is a collection of people with a common purpose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0899764012460730">Wuthnow (1994)</xref> argued that a congregation differs from a traditional community group because people can “congregate” without personal familiarity with one another. He went on to suggest that a congregation differs from, for example, a group of people in a park because “there is also a sense of corporate identity attached to a congregation” (p. 44). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012460730">Ammerman (1997b)</xref> suggested that congregations are religious entities with a name, a constitution, a building, and a shifting collection of people engaged in complex actions and rhetoric. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764012460730">Hopewell (1987)</xref> defined a congregation as a local organization in which people regularly gather for what they feel to be a religious purpose. He went on to claim that such a group must possess a special name, and it must recognize members who assemble regularly to celebrate a more universally practiced worship, but who develop their own patterns of conduct, outlook and story (p. 12).</p>
<p>These definitions are excellent as heuristics, but insufficient when one wants to define local religious congregations empirically, in a manner that clearly distinguishes them from nonreligious groups and from other groups devoted to religious expression. A suitable definition will exclude noncongregational religious gatherings such as monasteries, shrines, or religious universities but will include nonmonotheist houses of worship and congregations without buildings.</p>
<p>Christians in ancient Rome, Jews in Spain and Portugal (after the 1492 expulsion of Jews), and African American slaves in the United States all participated in group prayer in open fields and people’s homes. Although these groups did not have designated buildings recognizable by the public, they were religious congregations. By the late 1960s, there were more than 350 congregations gathering in apartments, basements, storefronts, racetracks, and coffeehouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0899764012460730">Johnson, 1969</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764012460730">Goslin (1984)</xref> encouraged the creation of such building-less churches as a means to revive faith and reduce costs. Recently, the Village church in Las Vegas left its 12,000 square-foot rental space and began to worship in members’ homes. Fifteen homes now hold services twice a month. On other Sundays, they rent commercial space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0899764012460730">McDonald, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the actual number of building-less congregations is estimated to be much higher than it was in the 1960s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan, Boddie, McGrew, and Kang (2006)</xref> identified that 1 in a 100 congregations that rent space from schools or hotels for their meetings. All of these congregations pass the associational test. In Philadelphia, where the study was carried out, they composed less than 1% of the city’s congregations and yet they were clearly real congregations.</p>
<p>Today, the notion of cyber congregations—people who pray and worship together screen to screen—is gaining modest interest and may be a new form of building-less congregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012460730">Coxe, 2011</xref>). This form of congregation will also pose a challenge to the traditional application of the associational test. Can people associate without meeting face to face?</p>
<p>As noted above, congregation is a subcategory of religious gatherings. Religious gatherings constitute all groups within which people come together for the purpose of expressing and gaining further knowledge related to their religion, faith, or spirituality. Examples of religious gatherings not considered congregations include family devotions, regional/national headquarters of religious denominations, annual meetings, religious rallies, assemblies, pilgrimages, religious-based homeless shelters and hospices, workplace lunch prayers, and religious Chautauquas. Similarly, group meetings that include religious expressions such as blessings, convocations, swearing-in of presidents, and readings of religious texts are not viewed as congregations.</p>
<p>An important contribution in defining congregations was offered by Wind and Lewis (1994), who referred to a congregation as “people who regularly gather to worship at a particular place” (p. i). Implicit in this definition were four criteria: (a) a cohesive group; (b) regular, ongoing gatherings; (c) an organization functioning as, and centered on, religious or spiritual practice; and (d) a group bound to a specific location. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> added three additional characteristics: (e) people have to voluntarily come to the place of worship for the purpose of worship (if religious expression takes place where people reside (such as a monastery or a nursing home) or work then it is not a congregation); (f) the presence of a religious leader(s). While some groups (such as Quakers, Jehovah Witnesses, and the Amish) do not have a clear traditional leader (a clergy), they all have a body that governs the affairs of the religious group. Coming together without order and without organized structure can be a religious expression but not a religious congregation; and (g) a congregation has a formal name and shared identity that distinguish it as a separate entity from all others.</p>
<p>This definition allies with Chaves definition. He defined congregations as “a social institution in which individuals who are not religious specialists gather in physical proximity to one another, frequently and at regularly scheduled intervals, for activities and events for explicitly religious content and purpose, and in which there is a continuity over time in the persons who gather, the location of the gathering, and the nature of the activities and events at each gathering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012460730">Chaves, 2004</xref>, pp. 1-2).</p>
<p>Although, as we will soon show, congregations differ significantly from one another regardless of the faith tradition, they serve the same function. They are the societal mechanism by which people of faith come together to form a collective that sets organized and accepted means to jointly express religiosity. Although each person can pray and worship on his or her own, congregations transform individuals into a coherent and organized group. They do so by setting the rules and rituals accepted by a group, allowing people to express their faith in a manner that is understood, consistent, and unifying. In this sense, the whole is greater than its parts. What’s more, the social energy created by a congregation helps produce public goods that are beneficial to members and society alike.</p>

<sec id="section3-0899764012460730">
<title>The Variability of Congregations</title>
<p>Although congregations can be viewed as separate nonprofit organizations with unique characteristics and functions, they are at the same time quite diverse. One mistake rampant in many circles is to talk of the “faith-based community,” or congregations as one uniform entity. Within the field of congregations, the variety is rich enough to defy most generalizations. In this section, we will discuss a few of the most salient dimensions along which congregations vary: size, ethnicity, geographical locus, typology (parish, temple, and congregation/niche models), and faith tradition. The various faith traditions represent the dimension that presents perhaps the greatest level of variability between congregations. It should be emphasized that each dimension cross-cuts with the other dimensions. So a congregation can be of a certain size, a certain ethnic group can be dominant (or none), it may have a specific or undefined geographical locus, and it may belong to a certain faith tradition or be independent of any. There are, of course, other interesting categories, such as history, longevity, the quality and type of their edifice, and many others, but the categories presented below are those most often discussed in the literature.</p>
<p>The first dimension is size. Congregations range in size from “megachurches” with thousands of members to groups with as few as five members. The Hartford Institute for Religion Research (2001) database lists some 1,200 Protestant megachurches with an average weekend worshipping of 2,000 attendees or more. Of these, about 50 churches reported attendance ranging from 10,000 to 35,000. These congregations are characterized by relatively short services (about an hour), multiple services during the weekend, and an emphasis on making the services entertaining and appealing to members while keeping a strong evangelical spirit. They are often located in suburbs, they tend to be evangelical or Baptist in orientation, and they are often nondenominational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0899764012460730">Thumma &amp; Travis, 2007</xref>). In this sense, size is only one characteristic of a megachurch. For example, 3,000 Catholic parishes reported 2,000 or more attendants for an average Sunday Mass, yet because they are very similar in all their practices to other smaller-size Catholic churches, they are considered regular large Catholic churches rather than megachurches. Hartford data from 2005 suggest that on average, megachurches employ 20 full-time paid ministerial staff persons and 22 full-time paid program staff persons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> reported that in megachurches one finds many more mix ethnicities than in smaller congregations. This can be the result of size, or of an ethnic group deciding its own time of attendance, or creating a cell group de facto segregated within an integrated whole. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0899764012460730">Thumma and Bird (2008)</xref> found that megachurches also show a strong bias toward contemporary worship, and are minimally involved in politics. They also found that, over time, megachurches have been offering more worship services and expanding to multiple locations, shifting to playing a greater role in community service, decreasing their use of radio and television, and putting greater emphasis on the role of small groups.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in South Korea there are much larger congregations with halls that can accommodate 5,000 people at one time and hold up to 10 services per weekend. Some of these Korean megachurches employ more than 200 full-time paid ministerial staff. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0899764012460730">Yoido Full Gospel (Pentecostal; 2011</xref>) boasts a membership of 600,000 members, more than 100,000 elders and deacons, and 527 full-time clergy. It holds numerous services that are broadcast to satellite buildings.</p>
<p>On the other side of the size spectrum are storefront churches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0899764012460730">1</xref></sup> These were historically associated with African American congregations but today may also include a host of immigrant congregations. Small and poor congregations that cannot afford a full-size building tend to purchase space in a commercial building that is on the decline and to transform it into a place of worship, usually accommodating up to a 100 members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0899764012460730">McRoberts (2005)</xref> found that what attracts worshippers to the location of the storefront church is the low overhead rather than the community itself. In fact, most storefront churches are internally oriented, with limited relationships to the broader community. Like megachurches, they also tend to be nondenominational and to favor evangelism and charismatic leadership.</p>
<p>Size matters when studying congregational differences. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764012460730">Barna Group (2009)</xref> found that attendees “of large churches were more likely than those engaged in a small or midsized congregation to give an orthodox biblical response,” and to be active, participating in behaviors such as attending church in the past week, reading the Bible in the past week, volunteering at their church in the past week, and so on. Larger churches were also more likely to have college graduates, affluent attendees, and children aged below 18.</p>
<p>Another crucial dimension of variation is ethnicity. People generally want to worship with likeminded others. Consequently, they tend to form segregated mini communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764012460730">Cnaan &amp; Boddie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764012460730">Emerson, 2006</xref>). Ethnic and racial groups within the United States have historically used organized religion as a means of creating a sense of community, sharing the adaptation experience, and assisting one another financially and emotionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0899764012460730">Lincoln &amp; Mamiya, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0899764012460730">Moore, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0899764012460730">Warner, 1993</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0899764012460730">Warner and Lunt (1941)</xref>, later congregations continued to attract people from particular ethnic groups and socioeconomic levels, as is the case today with Latino and Asian congregations. The level of trust is usually higher in homogeneous social groups, especially for minority groups, where the congregation forms a social hub and links members between the new land and their home country and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764012460730">Ebaugh &amp; Chafetz, 2000</xref>). Conversely, people who are substantially different from congregation members may find they are unwelcome. As Emerson noted, a few members of a different ethnic group do not challenge the dominance of the larger majority. However, in order to be defined as ethnically mixed, “more than 20 percent of the congregation must be racially different than the largest group” (p. 35).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764012460730">Dudley and Roozen (2001)</xref> noted, congregations are not much more segregated than other organizations in the United States. But clearly the majority of congregations demonstrate a strong tendency toward monoethnic dominance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> found that one ethnic group dominates the congregation in 9 out of 10 Philadelphia congregations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012460730">Emerson and Smith (2001)</xref> suggested that segregated churches, even if not formed due to prejudice, perpetuate the lack of integration between blacks and whites in the wider society and also prevent people from forming better attitudes about their own and others’ racial groups. They also argued that religious segregation also limits the networks that people can take advantage of to improve their situations. This approach is in contrast to the majority of writings that hail the importance of black churches and immigrant congregations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012460730">Emerson and Smith’s (2001)</xref> critique of segregated churches touches on a noted problem regarding the segregated nature of most local religious congregations. This problem is that while their bonding social capital is strong, their bridging social capital is compromised. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764012460730">Beyerlein and Hipp (2006)</xref> studied the involvement of congregational members in assisting with and belonging to out-of-congregation social services organization. They found that rate of attendance in worship services did not predict bridging activities but rather helped foster bonding among congregation members. In fact, only congregations with clear outward orientation managed to have members who are involved outside of the congregation.</p>
<p>The most commonly known and celebrated ethnic congregation is the black church. The early 17th century marked the beginning of the forced migration of Africans to America, where they were sold as slaves to Southern plantations. In each plantation there were slaves from different parts of Africa, who had with little shared language, culture, or religion. Over a period of 150 years, slaves adapted to Christian faith and found solace, refuge, and strength in the teachings of the Bible, which provided them with an orientation toward life in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012460730">Frazier, 1963</xref>; Raboteau, 1978). Slaves worshipped with their masters but also held secret worship services known as the “invisible institution” in backwoods, bayous of plantations, and often in their own slave quarters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764012460730">Billingsley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012460730">Frazier, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012460730">Frazier (1963)</xref> called the black church a nation within a nation, as it was and is an agent of political, civic, economic, and social involvement in a racially hostile United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0899764012460730">Mays and Nicholson (1933)</xref> noted that the black church was the only institution wholly owned and operated by African Americans. As such, churches were the local institution most available and willing to provide support services to people in need. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764012460730">Ellison and Sherkat (1995)</xref> called black churches in the South “semiinvoluntary institutions.” Likewise, the black church building has been referred to as a “haven” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764012460730">Franklin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764012460730">Jacobson, Heaton, &amp; Dennis, 1990</xref>). Today, the black church is still the backbone of the black community. Equipped with great political power and influence, it is the environment from which most black leaders emerge. In this sense, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012460730">Baer and Singer (1992)</xref>, the black church of today is more than a place of worship. It is a multifunctional institution that has developed many communal institutions for African Americans such as schools, credit unions, banks, insurance companies, and low-income housing units.</p>
<p>Unlike the wave of white European immigrants to America at the turn of the 20th century, the majority of today’s immigrants come from Latin America and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012460730">Cerrutti &amp; Massey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0899764012460730">Kilty &amp; de Haymes, 2000</xref>). The Latino population has grown exponentially. Today, at 35 million members, it has surpassed blacks as the largest minority group in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0899764012460730">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2010</xref>). Latino religion in America is unique compared to other ethnic groups for many reasons, including the language difference (as more Latinos do not speak English than any other ethnic group); role of religious faith in daily life; shared traditions, values, and symbols, literature, folklore, and music; and its concept of government and social responsibility (Diaz-Stevens &amp; Stevens-Arroyo, 1998). Nationally, 70% of U.S. Latinos are Catholic, a number that has remained stable for the past decade. More and more Latinos in America are converting to Protestantism, but the percentage of Catholics is kept stable by the prodigious influx of immigrants from predominantly Catholic countries such as Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764012460730">Espinosa, Elizondo, &amp; Miranda, 2003</xref>). Putnam and Campbell noted that the influx of Latinos to Catholic churches increases the mingling of Anglos and Latinos within parishes. Among congregations with many Latino members, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0899764012460730">Menjivar (2002)</xref> and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> found that in Protestant (mostly evangelical) churches the size is usually small (usually less than 100) and membership is composed of one ethnic group, whereas Catholic churches tend to be much larger (in hundreds if not thousands) and composed of a variety of Latino groups and sometimes even non-Latinos.</p>
<p>Asian congregations are more diverse and segregated. Immigrants from Asia come from diverse religious backgrounds, ranging from Muslim to Buddhist. Among Muslims the tendency is to join a local mosque, ideally one that mirrors the mosque of the home country. For others, however, it is a different story. Until recently, many Hindu and Buddhist immigrants could not find a suitable place of worship and so often joined an appropriate ethnic church. For example, in Korean churches, there are many members who, in Korea, were not Christians but joined the Korean church for social gatherings, Sunday Korean school classes for children, and camaraderie (Oh, 1989). By 2001, there were 3,375 Korean churches listed in The Korean Church Directory (2001) in America. The same phenomenon is also reported for Chinese immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0899764012460730">Yang, 1998</xref>). The power of home country language, shared norms, common adaptation experiences, and the quest to keep in touch with families back home (especially parents and grandparents) motivates Asian immigrants to form ethnically segregated congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0899764012460730">Min, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Congregations also vary by socioeconomic status, political orientation, governance, faith tradition, theology, doctrines, and worship or other spiritual practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764012460730">Holifield (1994)</xref> reported, “By the 1730s in the large cities, the rich and the poor began choosing separate congregations . . .” (p. 26). In the late 19th century W. E. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012460730">Dubois (1899)</xref> already noticed that in Philadelphia “the various churches, too, represent social classes “(p. 203). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0899764012460730">Wright-Smith (2004)</xref> showed how black churches in Wilmington, Delaware, are polarized by members’ income. As rich African Americans moved outside the city, they either worshipped in their new city or suburb or alternatively were attracted to commuter congregations in the city and local poor African Americans attend community churches. Although there are many economically mixed African American congregations, people generally look for a church that fits their socioeconomic status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0899764012460730">Warner and Lunt (1941)</xref> found that socioeconomic changes were related to changes in people’s denominational affiliation and congregational membership; that is, when people’s socioeconomic status changed they sought to worship with people of similar financial means.</p>
<p>Another important variation between congregations is their geographical locus. In a parish model all members of the faith who reside in a specific geographical area are expected to attend the congregation in their area. By default, the congregation and the community are the same and people have no option as to which place of worship to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012460730">Day, 1991</xref>). Among the notable examples of denominations applying the parish model are Catholic churches, wards of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Jewish orthodox synagogues (as they are not allowed to drive on Saturday; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0899764012460730">McKinney, 1998</xref>). There are two nonparish models of congregations: the temple model and the congregation/niche model. In the temple model, which is most common in Eastern religions (such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism), people attend the temple when the need arises (personal quest for relating to a higher being or around family events), but there is neither expected regularity nor a known community around the temple. In all cases the people who will attend the temple that day will be different than the people who will be there for a person’s next visit. Some holidays are celebrated around the temples, and they often draw large crowds that do not consist of regular groups of members and do not emphasize face-to-face interaction among attendees. However, in the United States, even temples tend to attract the same worshippers and a sense of community is eventually established. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0899764012460730">Yang and Ebaugh (2001)</xref> noted, immigrant worshipers in the United States adopt the congregational form in organizational structure and rituals. They voluntarily join the congregation, meet regularly, form a community, maintain fellowship, incorporate, develop a structure of lay leadership, and engage in religious networking. This trend of “de facto congregationalism” was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0899764012460730">Warner (1993)</xref>.</p>
<p>In a congregational or niche model and in the temple model, people decide which place of worship they wish to attend based on theology, style of worship, sense of belonging, socioeconomic status, or shared ethnicity, and they may travel a significant distance to worship in the congregation they choose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012460730">Ammerman, 1997a</xref>). Although most Mainline Protestant denominations advocate parish responsibility, membership often disregards the rules and selects their own place of worship. Similarly, most mosques in America, almost all independent (nondenominational) churches, and all the nonmonotheistic congregations in America allow members to choose where to worship. The division between parish and congregational/niche congregations is actually blurring, and even among Catholic churches members show strong signs of choosing a church of their choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764012460730">D’Antonio, Davidson, Hoge, &amp; Wallace, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0899764012460730">Wuthnow, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>However, maybe the greatest diversity among congregations is their faith tradition. Most congregations belong to a certain denomination if not a religion. One can easily name the major religions in America: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and so on. Each and every one of these is further subdivided into numerous denominations, whereas other congregations consider themselves independent and nondenominational. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012460730">Adherents.com (2007)</xref> lists 4,200 religions, churches, denominations, religious bodies, faith groups, tribes, cultures, movements, ultimate concerns, and so on, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0899764012460730">Melton (1989)</xref> reported nearly 1,600 different denominations in the United States. These numbers provide an idea of the faith variability of congregations.</p>
<p>Traditionally, American congregations are divided into five key categories. Mainline Protestants and congregations are usually affiliated with the National Council of Churches and include such denominations as Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists, and Congregationalists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman (2005)</xref> estimates that such denominations account for about a quarter of the American congregations. Catholic churches compose the next group. Although Catholics are one of the largest groups in America (estimated at 24%), they continuously lose more members than all other faith groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>) and they tend to have large congregations. Ammerman estimated that they make up about 6% of the U.S, congregations. Even as members leave the church, however, the high-level Latino immigration to the United States means that the size of the church remains roughly the same, though its population is gradually shifting from Anglo-Europeans to Latinos. Conservative Protestant congregations include Evangelical and Pentecostal congregations as well as many nondenominational congregations. More than half of U.S. congregations belong to this group. The final category includes non-Christian congregations (Jewish synagogues, Muslim masjids, Hindu temples, or Sikh Gurdwaras) and groups that do not fall into any of the above key groups. At times, black churches are grouped separately as a sixth main group of congregations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0899764012460730">Steensland et al. (2000)</xref> argued that the traditional division of congregations into five groups does not correspond to empirical reality. They thus proposed and empirically tested a seven-category division that is used by many scholars and is composed of Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Black Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jewish, nondenominational, and others (including Mormons, Muslims, Jehovah witnesses, Hindu, and Unitarians).</p>
<p>In addition to the above categorizations, it should be noted that congregations are a work in progress. Almost all congregations constantly adapt to changing realities, trying to become more relevant to existing members and more attractive to new members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012460730">Ammerman, 1997a</xref>). In so doing, they alter what we know about congregations and form new methods of worshipping and expressing religiosity. Regardless of these variations and the others that one cannot see and identify, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0899764012460730">Woolever and Bruce (2010)</xref> concluded, “while each congregation is distinctive, much about congregations is universal.”</p>
<p>One example of the adaptations and changes in congregational life is the formation of new forms of religion. In the short history of the United States, new religions and denominations were born that formed new types of congregations. American-born faith traditions include the following: Polish National Catholic Church (breakaway from Rome in 1897); Churches of Christ/Disciples of Christ (a restoration movement; solidified in 1832 by merging the teachings of Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell); Pentecostalism (with roots in the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles California, from 1904 to 1906 sparked by Charles Parham); Adventism (originated with the preached William Miller who in 1830s in New York became convinced of an imminent Second Coming of Jesus. This is the parent body that produced the Seventh Day Adventists); Nation of Islam (created and followed solely by African Americans and originated by W. D. Fard); The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormonism, founded by Joseph Smith Jr. in 1830 in upstate New York); Jehovah’s Witnesses (originated in late 1870s in Pennsylvania by Charles Taze Russell); Scientology (originated by L. Ron Hubbard); Christian science (originated by Mary Baker Eddy); Metropolitan Community Church (a gay Christian denomination started by Troy Perry in 1968); Reconstructionist Judaism (originated by Mordecai Kaplan); Native American Church (originated by Quanah Parker in the 1890s); and the Church of Satan (originated by Anton LaVey in San Francisco, California, in 1966). This list of new religions and congregations that originated in one of the world’s youngest countries exemplifies how religion and denominations proliferate and become institutionalized.</p>

<title>Why Are Congregations Important?</title>
<p>Congregations exist for a plethora of reasons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> reported that “more Americans are involved in a religious congregation than in any other type of association, group, or club” (p. 29). This in and of itself begs the question of why they are so important to their many members. In this section, we draw on what congregations produce for members and for society at large.</p>
<p>First and foremost, congregations exist for people to jointly express religious feelings. Certain individuals in all societies possess a sense of religiosity. They accept the presence of a higher being and seek out an avenue to express their emotions. Praying alone or in a family context fulfills this need for some, but most people search for a collective to share their spiritual beliefs and to join in expressing these beliefs together. The collective aspect of a congregation affirms one’s beliefs and validates the chosen means of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0899764012460730">Pargament, Silverman, Johnson, Echemendia, &amp; Snyder, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Carl Jung concluded that a person possesses “a natural religious function” and that his or her psychic health and stability depends on the proper expression of this function just as much as on the expression of instincts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764012460730">Crowley, 2000</xref>). This function is expressed through praying, meditating, singing, chanting, listening to music, and hearing a religious sermon—activities that make people feel closer to God or a higher being. For most congregational members this is the primary reason for attendance and membership.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012460730">Berger and Neuhaus (1996)</xref> offered another insight into the importance of congregations. In their classical work on the shift from state-oriented society to civil society, they contended that organizations such as churches play a key role as mediating organizations, interfacing between citizens—especially the low income and needy—and the impersonal mechanisms of public service bureaucracies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0899764012460730">Marty (1994)</xref> viewed “congregations as aggregates and as part of an aggregation are themselves publics and part of a larger public. Members by taking part in them venture out of privacy into a zone of interactions” (p. 150). Berger and Neuhaus contended that “if these institutions could be more imaginatively recognized in public policy, individuals would be more at home in society, and the political order would be more meaningful.” The religious congregation was especially favored by these organizations, reminding us that they are “bearing and transmitting the operative values of our society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012460730">Berger &amp; Neuhaus, 1996</xref>, pp. 163-189). In this respect congregations are the bedrock of learning civic, political, and leadership skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0899764012460730">Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995)</xref> suggested that civic involvement for many Americans comes from participation in social institutions, such as the work place or a church. Accordingly, congregations play an important role in providing political skill building and recruitment opportunities that might not otherwise be available to nonaffluent individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0899764012460730">Putnam (2000)</xref> also argued that “religious institutions directly support a wide range of social activities well beyond conventional worship. . . . Churches provide an important incubator for civic skills, civic norms, community interests, and civic recruitment” (p. 35).</p>
<p>Ample research shows that religious people, especially those who attend places of worship, do more voluntary work within their congregations and in wider society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764012460730">Bekkers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012460730">Bowen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0899764012460730">Lam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0899764012460730">Park &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0899764012460730">Ruiter &amp; De Graaf, 2004</xref>). This research found that the norm of congregational volunteering spills over to volunteering in secular organizations. In a study of volunteering in 53 countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0899764012460730">Ruiter and De Graaf (2006)</xref> found that in more religious communities, people are more involved in volunteering even if they themselves are not religious. In other words, percentage of congregational goers in a given society is strongly and positively correlated with percentage of members in that society who volunteer. They also found that across countries, non-Christians volunteer more than Christians and that among Christians, Protestants volunteer more than Catholics. However, internationally, Ruiter and De Graaf found that religious participation only weakly explains secular volunteerism. With very few exceptions, when controlling for religious volunteering, church membership shows negative rather than positive effects on secular volunteering. In the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> found that “religion boosts total volunteering so substantially that in addition to their higher rate of religious volunteering, regular churchgoers are also much more likely to volunteer for secular causes” (p. 445). Putnam and Campbell also found that churchgoers are more likely to donate blood, give money to a homeless person, help someone find job, help someone outside their own household with housework, and offer a seat to a stranger.</p>
<p>Regarding donations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0899764012460730">Wood and Hougland (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0899764012460730">Yankelovich (1985)</xref> found that membership in congregations is strongly associated with donating money both to religious and secular organizations. Similar to their findings regarding volunteering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> reported, “Regular churchgoers are more likely to give to secular causes than non churchgoers, and highly religious people give a larger fraction of their income to secular causes than do most secular people” (p. 448). Similar findings are also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012460730">Brooks (2006)</xref>. However, Brooks attributed the difference to their political conservatism whereas Putnam and Campbell attributed the full difference to church attendance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0899764012460730">Saxon-Harrold, Wiener, McCormack, and Weber (2001)</xref> reported that in the United States, the 353,000 religious congregations represent nearly a quarter of all nonprofit organizations. They engage 45 million volunteers, or nearly half of the total 109 million Americans who volunteer. Congregations employ some 1.3 million paid staff, or 11% of employment within the nonprofit sector. Sixty percent of average household contributions go to religious organizations. In this sense, congregations compose a major segment of the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>Of all the private for-profit and nonprofit organizations in communities, only local religious congregations assume, on a regular basis, the additional role of helping the needy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0899764012460730">Wuthnow’s (2004)</xref> argued that religious congregations view their service as inseparable from their self-understanding as “communities of care.” As they serve others, they also serve themselves, becoming stronger as a community of believers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0899764012460730">Yang and Ebaugh (2001)</xref> noted that as part of the Americanization of religion, new immigrants have tended to expand congregational life from mere worship to social services provision. Cnaan and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012460730">Cnaan, Boddie, Handy, Yancey, &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>) showed that, in the United States, a strong social norm exists for congregations to be highly involved in caring for others in need. Most studies show that 90% of American congregations are involved in the provision of at least one social program. Although these programs are often small in size, maintained by volunteers, and devoted to immediate needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman, 2005</xref>; Cheves, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al., 2006</xref>), the life of poor people in America would be much harsher if not for congregational social care. For many people, faith, in its broader sense, is manifested in the action of helping the needy. Such an action follows in the footsteps of key religious figures such as Moses, Muhammad, or Jesus. This sense of duty, unparalleled in other local institutions, helps improve the quality of life in many communities. Of course, congregations cannot <italic>replace</italic> governmental social services, but they are key players in the welfare field. This is part of the reason governments in the United States and the United Kingdom wish to harness congregations as social service providers.</p>
<p>The cultural capital of many Americans is created and sustained via congregations. Many Americans are first exposed to music, poetry, theater, painting, and sculptures as part of participation in religious congregations and the educational programs they provide. For example, the annual holiday choir singing that takes place in most churches and synagogues around December each year involves learning and performing music. In many congregations the choir is active year round. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0899764012460730">Wuthnow (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0899764012460730">2003</xref>) found that 41% of Americans claim to have sung in a choir or ensemble at a church growing up. Many of America’s leading singers, performers, and artists had their first lessons and appearances in congregational settings. Furthermore, congregational choirs and bands often require participants to read musical notes, engage with classical texts, and collaborate with others to produce a quality performance. In this respect, both liberal and conservative congregations use music, choirs, and other forms of arts to transmit the religious message. From traditional organ playing to electronic guitars, from a cappella choirs to rock bands, from sacred text reading to theater productions, congregations are constantly experimenting and testing artistic means to reach their members and even those who are unaffiliated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> found that 15% of Philadelphia congregations offer music classes, 21.3% reported a choral/choir group, and 27.6% of the congregations hold music performances outside their building—that is, for public consumption. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0899764012460730">Wuthnow (2003)</xref> noted, “The presence of musical and artistic programs in congregations is probably beneficial for the spiritual development of church members” (p. 46). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012460730">Chaves (2004)</xref>, following Wuthnow, suggested that maybe the greatest contribution of congregations in America is their transmittal and preservation of arts and culture.</p>
<p>On the individual and family level, many scholars find that participation in organized religious activities improves mental health, strengthens overall physical health, and increases the participant’s ability to cope with stress and other pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012460730">Huguelet &amp; Koenig, 2009</xref>; Koenig, 1999). Furthermore, youth attending congregations report fewer risk behaviors and higher levels of prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0899764012460730">Sinha, Cnaan, &amp; Gelles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0899764012460730">Smith, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0899764012460730">
<title>What Do Congregations Do?</title>
<p>Running a congregation is similar to running a secular nonprofit organization but with a few distinct characteristics. The first and most unique aspect of congregational life is worship. Congregations exist primarily to serve the spiritual needs of members in a collective manner. Worship is the pinnacle of congregational activity as it transforms people’s individual spirituality into a collective normative religious experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0899764012460730">Kapp, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman (2005)</xref> noted, congregations lacking satisfactory and uplifting worship services are doomed to fail. People come to congregations to connect with the holy via sacrament, liturgy, singing, proclamation, celebrating religious passages of rites, open witnessing, shared fasting, reciting sacred texts, and listening to the word of God. The clergy often prepare a sermon, a committee or the denominational headquarters select texts to be read and hymns to be sung, music is selected and players practice it before the worship service, members are asked to provide testimonies or share experiences, announcements are made, flowers are ordered and placed, wine (or other drinks) and bread are purchased and shared, religious artifacts are shown, and, when all is over, the worship hall has to be cleaned up. Although there are numerous variations in how congregations worship, all of them require planning and work. Tasks are performed on an ongoing basis—at least weekly, and in some faith traditions daily or multiple times a day. Regardless, each worship service has to meet members’ expectations and work has to be done to assure its successful execution.</p>
<p>The second unique aspect of local religious congregations is their reliance on members’ labor. Many nonprofit organizations, especially the small ones, rely on volunteers. Congregations do so in the extreme. Many congregations have a professional (usually paid), formal leader. But they also have countless volunteers (disproportionately women) who do much of the day-to-day work of keeping the place up and running. This enormous reliance on lay participation is the key to congregations’ viability and longevity. It is also unique that the work is performed by the same people who are the “clients” of the organization. Rarely do the clients, volunteers, and leaders of a nonprofit overlap so much.</p>
<p>The second unique aspect of local religious congregations is their longevity. Recently founded congregations may struggle and fold, but once a congregation has established itself and reached certain stability, it is likely to survive for a long time—longer than most for-profit and nonprofit organizations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012460730">Ammerman (1997a)</xref> showed, even in neighborhoods that had lost their economic backbones, congregations did not close shop. Rather, they transformed, finding a niche that attracted enough worshippers to help the congregation survive. Of course, some congregations do fold or merge, but they do so at lower rates than other comparable organizations.</p>
<p>The fourth unique aspect of local religious congregations is religious education. In order to socialize new recruits and children of members, as well as to sustain members’ religious knowledge, congregations provide substantive religious education. The number of religious classes offered is set by the size of the congregation and the availability of paid or volunteer teachers. Often the classes, sometimes known as “Sunday school,” are offered on weekends when members and their children are attending the congregation. However, in some cases (especially with adult classes), classes are offered during the week and at members’ homes. In all cases, there is a curriculum to be followed, with material provided by denominational headquarters, parachurch organizations, or, today, downloaded from the internet. Teachers and/or clergy prepare the classes, and members attend them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman, 2005</xref>). Because most members and their children do not learn the tenets of religion in school, religious education in congregations is essential for proper socialization and continuity. In fact, many members participate in congregational life precisely in order to ensure their children receive religious and moral education.</p>
<p>A special aspect of religious education is the teaching of values and behavioral norms. Almost every faith tradition in the world has clear tenets that ask adherents to behave ethically, not to cheat, not to harm others, and to exhibit charitable behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012460730">Cnaan, Wineburg, &amp; Boddie, 1999</xref>). In an era in which public schools shy away from instilling values, congregational education programs are the locus of values teaching. In Sunday schools, in Bible classes, and in religious youth groups, values are transmitted and youth are socialized to accept them. This aspect is a major draw for parents who wish to enhance their children’s prosocial and moral foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0899764012460730">Roof, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The weekend is usually also a time for fellowship. Given the high population of immigrants in American society and the high geographic mobility of its residents, finding like-minded and trusted friends is often a crucial element of religious participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012460730">Bane, Coffin, &amp; Higgins, 2005</xref>). Members come not just to worship but also to congregate. The fellowship that generally follows the official service is especially central to this social integration. In almost all American congregations, after the worship is over, people do not rush home. Rather, they sit down with fellow worshippers over coffee, cake, or a more substantial meal. Stemming from Judeo-Christian traditions of breaking bread among members and helping build a community around the congregation, fellowship is an important aspect of congregational life. Although most common among Protestant congregations, it is also common among other faith traditions and especially immigrant congregations. It solidifies the ranks of members and transforms the religious experience into a pleasant social experience as well. Of course, guaranteeing successful fellowship requires a committee of volunteers to organize the meeting and procure food and drink.</p>
<p>Most congregations collect money in the form of tithes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0899764012460730">Saxon-Harrold et al. (2001)</xref> found that 79% of all congregational revenue comes from charitable contributions by individuals in the form of pledges (planned giving) and unplanned offerings (placing money in a collection plate). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764012460730">Chaves and Miller (1999)</xref> reported similar findings. Other sources of revenue come from “earned income,” such as dues and program fees, publishing, school tuition, and rent. Few congregations are assisted by denominational support (usually young ones or those temporarily in need) and fewer are assisted by bequests (usually older congregations that received endowments from departed members). This extensive reliance on members’ continual support places congregations at risk, and when recession hits or membership declines, congregations face serious financial difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012460730">Ammerman, 1997a</xref>). As most revenues are generated by tapping members’ pockets, it is essential to call on members to tithe, to pass the plate every weekend service, and to have a clerk and/or treasurer go over the revenues, credit members when due, record who pays, and deposit the money. Few nonprofit organizations rely so heavily on members’ contributions. However, given that American congregations are legally exempt from submitting form 990 to the IRS, very few have a solid financial auditing mechanism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764012460730">Duncan and Stocks (2003)</xref> studied a sample of congregations affiliated with three established denominations and found that although about 70% of pastors claimed that their congregations have some type of annual audit, only 15% of churches have an audit conducted by an independent CPA. In other words, congregational audits are most often conducted internally rather than by professionals.</p>
<p>During the week congregations mostly run like other nonprofit organizations. They pay bills, maintain the property, plan meetings, publish reports, network with other congregations or organizations in their social environment, and so forth. However, in addition to serving members’ spiritual and social needs, congregations are also highly involved in two types of missions: evangelism or proselytizing and provision of social services. These two types of missions are not mutually exclusive, and many congregations are involved in both. With very few exceptions, religious traditions call on believers to spread the message and recruit new adherents. Thus, many congregations devote extra energy and resources to local or international missionary work. While the most notable examples are Assemblies of God, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Mormons, many congregations hold classes for nonmembers, visit neighbors to share their faith, recruit coworkers, hold public prayers, and distribute religious pamphlets, CDs, and DVDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012460730">Coleman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0899764012460730">Rudin &amp; Harshman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0899764012460730">Van Engen, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, congregations are also highly involved in social service provision. In most cases a congregational committee is established to manage and allocate resources to the social program. In almost all cases, the congregation bears the cost of the social programs. When members join congregations they expect to find evidence of social service/ministry and are aware that soon they will be asked to contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As demonstrated, life of congregations is significantly skewed toward the weekend, when members most often attend and meet with staff. During the week maintenance activities and preparatory activities are taking place, and an empty building allows for the provision of congregational social services. Like other nonprofits, congregations are occupied by mundane tasks and plans for growth and sustainability, but the emphasis on spirituality and creation of a group or community around a congregation makes them unique.</p>

<title>Who Attends Congregations?</title>
<p>Only 40% to 50% of Americans attend congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>). In other countries, this percentage is even lower. It is therefore interesting to determine who attends congregations. Although many Americans claim to be regular attendees of congregations, some studies have found that on an average weekend only about 22% of the American population actually attends a place of worship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764012460730">Hadaway &amp; Marler, 2005</xref>). What’s more, certain subgroups tend to attend congregations more than others. As previously noted, the rate of congregational attendance is higher among African Americans than all other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Worldwide, women attend congregations on a regular basis much more than men. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0899764012460730">Woolever and Bruce (2010)</xref> reported from a large sample of church attendees that 61% of attendees were women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012460730">Cnaan et al. (2006)</xref> similarly reported that in Philadelphia, 65.25% of attendees are women. In studies of religious behavior over the past 100 years, the greater religiosity of women over men is probably the most consistent finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764012460730">Argyle, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012460730">Beit-Hallahmi &amp; Argyle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764012460730">Gallup &amp; Lindsay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0899764012460730">Roth &amp; Kroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0899764012460730">Stark, 2002</xref>). However, attendance varies between congregations. More proscriptive denominations may emphasize family life, thereby attracting more couples or even more men (as is the case with Jehovah’s Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). Another exception to this rule is faith traditions where ritual attendance by women is not a required element, such as Islam and Orthodox Judaism. The majority of attendees in these traditions are men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0899764012460730">Loewenthal, MacLeod, &amp; Cinnirella, 2001</xref>). In African American congregations, however, women represent an overwhelming majority of attendees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0899764012460730">Kunjufu, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The older adults, especially retirees, are also overrepresented among regular congregational attendees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0899764012460730">Woolever and Bruce (2010)</xref> found that 3 in 10 congregational members are retirees (29%), more than double their percentage in American society (14%). Not surprisingly, married people attend congregations more than single women, though at least a fifth of them attend without their spouse. Furthermore, among African Americans the percentage of married attendees is lower,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0899764012460730">2</xref></sup> whereas among Muslims, Jews, and strict groups like Jehovah’s Witnesses or Mormons, couples constitute the majority of attendees. In the same vein, people with children are more likely to attend congregations than singles or childless couples.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0899764012460730">Woolever and Bruce (2010)</xref> suggested that as a whole, when compared to the American population, congregational members are more likely to be well educated, employed full-time, of medium to high income, and of professional occupations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> also found that “having more education corresponds to a higher level of attendance at religious services” (p. 28). These findings stand in contradiction to Karl Marx’ famous phrase that “religion is the opium of the masses.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764012460730">Glaeser and Sacerdote (2008)</xref> suggested that more educated people seek social networks and aim to join helpful collectives, even though they may be less believing.</p>
<p>This attendance profile for women, older people, retirees, married people, and well-educated people is not unique to the United States. The Australian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0899764012460730">National Church Life Survey (2009)</xref> reported almost identical results. The only difference found in the Australian study was that no minority group demonstrated significantly higher levels of attendance, with 75% of attendees being Australian born.</p>
<p>Attendance demographics only capture a small part of the membership picture. People attend at various frequencies. Some members come once a month or less and others come weekly or even a few times during the week. Members are not necessarily loyal to a particular congregation or faith tradition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam and Campbell (2010)</xref> noted, “Americans freely move from one congregation to another, and even from one religion to another. In the United States it is perfectly natural to refer to one’s religion as a ‘preference’ instead of as a fixed characteristic” (p. 4).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Congregations were too long neglected by academics. Although some excellent works on congregations have been published in the past two decades, overall we still have much to learn. Congregations are the most ubiquitous community organization and the one that attracts the most civic participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012460730">Ammerman (2005)</xref> suggested that congregations thrive “because American law and society created a space for voluntary religious communities” (p. 2). We agree with this observation and would add that this freedom is especially fertile in a country of immigrants who identify less with the national population and who are seeking meaningful social relationships and trusted communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012460730">Bane et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In this review article, we outlined five key layers necessary to understand the complexity of religious congregations. By discussing the various ways to define congregations and how to distinguish them from other nonprofit organizations and worship gathering, we were able to construct a clear definition of religious congregations. We then used the diversity of congregations to show how understanding one congregation or even one subject of congregations will not necessarily provide guidance in understanding them all. A review of the functions of congregations then made clear the many reasons why so many people attend congregations and provide them with resources. Next, we provided insight into the life of congregations, which may be familiar to active members and clergy but not to most people. Finally, we provided an analysis of who attends and belongs to congregations, proving that although it is easy to say congregations mirror the makeup of society, some groups are more inclined to participate, and some groups less. In this approach, we followed DiMaggio who argued that “good theory” is multidimensional and that the best theories are hybrids, resulting from combining different approaches to form a theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764012460730">DiMaggio, 1995</xref>). We are far from having a singular unified theory of congregations. But viewing them in contrast to nonprofit organizations and focusing on the five layers discussed above provide us with an emerging conceptual framework. Viewing congregations as was done in this article is intended to serve as a springboard for future research.</p>
<p>Of course, this review has been necessarily limited. We have not had space to address important topics such as the history of congregations and their continual adaptation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764012460730">Holifield, 1994</xref>), clergy behavior and education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764012460730">Carroll, 2006</xref>), political engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764012460730">Demerath &amp; Williams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764012460730">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0899764012460730">Smidt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0899764012460730">Wald &amp; Calhoun-Brown, 2007</xref>), understanding congregations through rational choice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764012460730">Iannaccone, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0899764012460730">Jelen, 2002</xref>), congregations and information technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012460730">Bailey &amp; Storch, 2007</xref>), the Americanization of congregations and their tendency to become isomorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764012460730">Dolan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0899764012460730">Wolfe, 2003</xref>), subgroups and conflict within congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012460730">Becker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012460730">Eiesland, 2000</xref>), members’ involvement, members seeking a proper congregation, congregational shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012460730">Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>), the congregation in relation to their community, and many other important topics. Nevertheless, we hope that the framework we provide will prove helpful to contemporary thought and stimulating to further research.</p>

<p>Although home churches may be even smaller, they do not fall under my definition of congregations, since some or all members do not voluntarily come (they reside there). Furthermore, most home churches have no desire to grow and move to a large edifice. Although some storefront churches are large in membership, the majority of them are small and often organizationally tenuous.</p></fn>

<p>It should be noted that among African American congregations, because of large level of religiosity among women and the relative low percentage of married couples, one finds a low level of couples attending church. However, among married African Americans the percentage of church attendance is likely the highest.</p></fn>
