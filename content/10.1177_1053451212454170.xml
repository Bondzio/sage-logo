<p>A key issue in using the federal definition of emotional disturbance (ED) is the challenge of measuring five characteristics of ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212454170">Epstein, Nordness, Cullinan, &amp; Hertzog, 2002</xref>). Stated briefly, these five characteristics include (a) an inability to learn, (b) relationship problems, (c) inappropriate behavior, (d) unhappiness or depression, and (e) physical symptoms or fears (for full statements of the characteristics, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454170"><italic>Federal Register</italic>, 2006</xref>). The Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454170">IDEIA, 2004</xref>) specifies that data for making a disability identification must arise from multiple sources, and proper assessment practice dictates this as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454170">Salvia, Ysseldyke, &amp; Bolt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454170">Turnbull, Huerta, &amp; Stowe, 2006</xref>). Thus, school personnel use a variety of assessment practices to gather information for deciding whether to identify a student with an emotional disturbance. Among these assessment practices are teacher nomination, teacher-completed rating scales, student-completed self-rating scales, semistructured interviews of student or parent, and measurement of observed student behavior.</p>
<p>Classroom observation of a student who is being considered for identification as ED is a requirement in the special education regulations of many states. However, the nature of such observation is often unspecified, with assessors and teams having various possibilities. For one thing, the assessor or school district can create a standard set of phenomena to observe and measure, such as a list of potential behavioral and emotional problems. Alternatively, the assessor or team can create original target behavior definitions to be used by an observer during recording sessions in the classroom.</p>
<p>Classroom observations provide a measure of actual classroom behavior that can be an important supplement to other assessment practices to determine eligibility as well as intervention decisions. For example, to assess the severity of problem behavior across settings, a frequency count of target behavior in the classroom could be compared to results from a parent’s rating of student behavior functioning at home using the <italic>Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Child Behavior Checklist / 6-18</italic> (ASEBA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454170">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>). Similarly, for a student identified as at-risk by teacher ratings scales, such as the <italic>Behavioral Assessment System for Children–Second Edition</italic> (BASC-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454170">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders</italic> (SSBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212454170">Walker &amp; Severson, 1990</xref>), classroom observations can be used to identify specific target behaviors that may warrant intervention, as well as antecedent and consequent variables that may be prompting the problem behaviors.</p>
<p>Observation protocols that accompany the ASEBA, BASC, and SSBD can be used to provide supportive documentation to assist in eligibility decisions and intervention planning; however, few are keyed specifically to the federal definition of ED. This column describes a target-behavior recording procedure designed to yield data based on the federal criteria for ED. This procedure is the main thrust of the observation form (OF), a component of the <italic>Scales for Assessing Emotional Disturbance–Second Edition</italic> (SAED-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454170">Epstein &amp; Cullinan, 2009</xref>). The SAED-2 is a system of assessment tools based on the federal definition of ED. The SAED-2 consists of three standardized components: rating scale, developmental/educational questionnaire, and observation form (OF). These assessment instruments and procedures include a variety of approaches for gathering data to determine a student’s behavioral functioning and other information as it relates to the federal definition of ED.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212454170">
<title>The Observation Form</title>
<p>The SAED OF is based on a direct observation approach to measurement of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454170">Cooper, Heron, &amp; Heward, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454170">Salvia et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, it is designed to measure student behaviors associated with the five characteristics of ED, plus classroom on-task behavior, which has high significance for student educational success (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454170">Brophy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454170">Epstein, Atkins, Cullinan, Kutash, &amp; Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454170">Marzano, 2007</xref>). To guide the observer, there are clear descriptions of key behaviors that exemplify each of the five characteristics of ED (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454170">Table 1</xref>), as well as on-task behavior. These are presented on the OF itself as well as in the manual.</p>

<sec id="section2-1053451212454170">
<title>Social Validation</title>
<p>A unique feature of the OF is its incorporation of a social validation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454170">Kazdin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454170">Wolf, 1978</xref>) to provide a context for understanding how discrepant the target student’s behavior is from the behavior of classroom peers. This social validation is achieved via the peer comparison method, whereby observation data is collected on the target student as well as a typical peer. Social validation helps reveal how similar or dissimilar the target student’s behavior is in comparison to that of a comparable peer who does not evince high rates of disruptive behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451212454170">
<title>Observation Occasions</title>
<p>To use the OF, the observer and teacher arrange for observations to take place during a block of time lasting at least about 35 minutes. This allows for a brief period, usually 5 minutes, in which the observer and the students can become oriented to one another. The brief orientation is followed by a recording period of 30 minutes, with 15 observe-and-record intervals for the target student alternating with 15 observe-and-record intervals for the comparison student.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212454170">
<title>Recording</title>
<p>The OF uses two kinds of target-behavior recording procedures, partial interval and whole interval, to facilitate accurate and efficient measurement of student classroom behavior. Partial interval recording is used to measure student behaviors indicative of each of the five characteristics of ED. That is, the student is recorded as showing characteristic <italic>X</italic> if he or she engages in one or more behaviors indicative of characteristic <italic>X</italic> for any part of the 30-second observe interval. Partial interval recording is also used to measure any other behavior that the examiner determines is not covered by any of the behavior descriptions associated with the five characteristics of ED. Whole interval recording is used to measure on-task behavior, that is, the student must evidence on-task behavior for an entire 30-second observed interval in order to be recorded as showing on-task behavior for that interval.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451212454170">
<title>Informal Observations</title>
<p>In addition to observing and recording target behaviors, the observer attends to and makes note of social, physical, and other noteworthy aspects of the classroom environment. These would include circumstances that might be prompting or maintaining the target student’s behavioral and emotional problems (e.g., “When Jameale loudly and disrespectfully stated that he wasn’t going to do his work, Mr. Marx approached him and offered a different, easy task”), reducing the likelihood of that student’s appropriate social or academic performance (e.g., “When JoLee is following the rules, Ms. Shorter generally ignores her”), or otherwise seem to be worthy of consideration in the context of the student’s situation. These informal observations are made before, during, and after the 30-minute period of target-behavior recording, and may be supplemented or clarified by discussions with the teacher. (All names are pseudonyms.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212454170">
<title>Scoring</title>
<p>When all intervals have been recorded, the target and comparison students’ results are summed into categories consistent with the federal definition of ED. Recording summaries allow the observer to present the data on both students in either numeric or graphic form, or both. The last page of the OF includes a section titled “Anecdotal Classroom Observations,” which calls for brief, informal observations about the classroom situation in which recording has occurred. In this section, the OF prompts descriptive notes about the physical layout of the classroom, how time is used, the rules and routines in the classroom, and the teacher’s behavior management practices. In addition, this section provides space for the observer to write brief suggestions about the behavior problems recorded, important aspects of the classroom, antecedent and consequent features of the classroom environment that may prompt behavior problems or perpetuate them, and other suggestions for interpretation based on formal behavior recording and/or informal observations.</p>

<title>A Case Study Using the SAED OF in an Elementary School Setting</title>
<p>The following case study describes a research-based application of the OF to a young student with emotional and behavioral challenges in an elementary school classroom (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451212454170">Note 1</xref>). Last year, Ronnie transferred to Windom Hills Elementary School after Christmas break. Ronnie’s teacher, Ms. Jensen, immediately noticed that Ronnie struggled during social interactions and unstructured learning situations. She inferred that he did not like to interact with peers and people with whom he was unfamiliar. Despite being withdrawn at times, Ronnie was also very impulsive and even explosive when he was presented with an unfamiliar task, or during activities that required some social interaction. Ronnie was an easy target for teasing and verbal bullying by peers because of his weight problem and his difficulty understanding social cues. When teased, Ronnie would often respond with shouts and physical aggression. As a result of his difficulties with peer relationships, Ronnie struggled with group projects and cooperative learning activities.</p>
<p>Ms. Jensen tried some interventions to accommodate Ronnie’s impulsive behaviors and peer relationship problems. First, she moved Ronnie to the back of the classroom in an effort to seat him away from the students who were teasing him. Second, she designed an incentive program to give him stickers for every time he successfully participated in cooperative learning activities. Finally, she tried to remind herself to provide him with more encouragement and verbal praise. In spite of these interventions, Ronnie’s impulsive behavior and difficulty with peers continued.</p>
<p>In response to these ongoing problem behaviors, Ms. Jensen referred Ronnie to the school intervention team (SIT). The SIT reviewed the interventions Ms. Jensen had documented on the problem referral form that she completed. Satisfied that Ms. Jensen had tried a number of valid interventions to improve Ronnie’s behavior, the SIT recommended that classroom observations be conducted to provide additional information about the nature and the severity of his behavior problems.</p>
<p>The SAED-2 OF was used on two occasions a week apart. Dr. Kay, the school psychologist, conducted both observations. He and Ms. Jensen agreed that an appropriate time for observation was during science period, which was after lunch. This was a time of day when Ronnie’s behaviors were most problematic because it required him to use social skills for negotiating transition from lunch into the classroom, and because first-grade science required students to follow teacher directions and cooperate with peers. Before conducting the two observations, Dr. Kay and Ms. Jensen identified a peer to serve as the comparison student. The student was the same age, gender, and ability as Ronnie but had no significant behavior problems.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451212454170">Table 2</xref>, the data obtained from the two observations were consistent. Compared to his peer, Ronnie averaged higher levels of Relationship Problems (67% vs. 7%), Inappropriate Behavior (47% vs. 7%), and Physical Symptoms or Fears (40% vs. 0%). These data were compatible with the anecdotal reports from Ms. Jensen.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Information obtained from the observational recording data and Section 6: “Anecdotal Classroom Observation” resulted in some additional interventions for Ms. Jensen to consider. First, Dr. Kay noted that the physical layout of the room created areas of high traffic that passed by Ronnie’s desk. Ms. Jensen’s attempt to move him away from peers who were teasing him, resulted in him being placed near the entry/exit door to the classroom. The team used this information to suggest that Ms. Jensen consider moving Ronnie’s desk to a location near the front of the room, but off to the side so that it was not in the way of student traffic around her desk. Second, Dr. Kay found that the schedule for the day seemed to change often in Ms. Jensen’s classroom. The unpredictable nature of the schedule might create additional anxiety or confusion for Ronnie. The team recommended that Ms. Jensen consider going over the next day’s schedule with Ronnie as he leaves school, reviewing the morning schedule when he enters the classroom in the morning, and reviewing the afternoon schedule with him after lunch. The objective was to familiarize him with the scheduled events for the day, give plenty of warning if the schedule changes during the school day, and let him know what the expectations were for the day. Finally, given Ronnie’s difficulty with peers during cooperative group activities, the SIT suggested that Ms. Jensen give Ronnie a specific task to complete during group activities so that he knows what is expected of him for the group activity. After sharing these results with the parents, the SIT recommended that a multidisciplinary team assess Ronnie’s present level of performance across a variety of social, cognitive, and academic domains to determine his eligibility for special education services.</p>

<sec id="section8-1053451212454170">
<title>Uses of Classroom Observation</title>
<p>Although there are many ways to conduct classroom observations and target-behavior recording, the OF is unique because it is designed to specifically direct the observer’s attention to the five characteristics of ED and to other important aspects of the student’s behavior and classroom environment. Among the uses of the OF are helping identify students with ED, planning education and intervention services, monitoring and evaluating the impact of services, assisting with functional behavioral assessment data collection, and providing data for use in school-wide positive behavioral support systems.</p>
<sec id="section9-1053451212454170">
<title>Identification</title>
<p>The principal use of the OF is assisting in the identification and diagnosis of ED. Because no single instrument or procedure can to be used to identify a disability, the OF is to be used in conjunction with other assessment instruments in the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454170">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454170">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>; Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454170">Reynolds, Livingston, &amp; Willson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454170">Salvia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454170">Taylor, 2006</xref>). The information gathered through use of the OF can be integrated with the other data to help the multidisciplinary team determine a student’s eligibility status. In the case of Ronnie, the OF would serve as a starting point for collecting data and considering whether additional assessment is warranted to determine the nature and severity of the behavioral problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212454170">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>A second use of the OF is in treatment planning. Observation data on student behaviors can be used to pinpoint problem behaviors that occur most often or those that are most maladaptive in the classroom. The OF can assess how extensive those behaviors are, thereby pointing to behaviors that may be targeted as part of a comprehensive behavior intervention plan. The OF also provides data on peers without behavior problems, which can be helpful in determining reasonable treatment goals within that classroom setting. Furthermore, the OF includes descriptions of the physical layout of the classroom, the rules and routines of the classroom, and descriptions of the teacher’s behavior management practices. These classroom variables may suggest antecedent and consequent phenomena that are functionally related to the student’s maladaptive behaviors and should be considered when a comprehensive treatment plan is written.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451212454170">
<title>Monitoring and Evaluation of Student Functioning</title>
<p>A third use of the OF is monitoring and evaluating treatment. The OF can be used on a regular basis to monitor student behavior, especially behavior indicative of a characteristic of ED, to determine the effectiveness of an intervention. For example, to alleviate Ronnie’s physical symptoms and fears, the team suggested Ms. Jensen review the next day’s schedule at the end of the school day, beginning of the day, and again after lunch. To determine the success of this intervention, the data collector might not record all five characteristics, but only the physical symptoms/fears characteristic. Thus, decisions on whether to continue or modify the intervention could be made based on the student’s behavior over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1053451212454170">
<title>Functional Behavioral Assessments</title>
<p>Although not designed for use in conducting a functional behavioral assessment (FBA), the OF data can be helpful to school staff responsible for FBAs. For instance, the OF may be used as part of the data collection process for clarifying the problem behavior, and the informal observations and inferences of Sections 6 and 7 can be used to identify antecedents and consequences that may be prompting or reinforcing the behavior. The OF may also be useful in a FBA for collecting observational data to evaluate the FBA hypothesis statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1053451212454170">
<title>School-Wide Positive Behavioral Intervention Supports</title>
<p>The OF can also be used within a framework for implementing school-wide positive behavioral intervention supports. Within this framework, the OF may be useful in providing data to help identify select and targeted interventions for students who do not respond to universal interventions, or as a screening measure for students who may be at-risk of significant behavior problems. In the case of Ronnie, to get school-wide information the team might use the OF in multiple situations, such as lunch or recess, to assess school-wide variables that may be prompting Ronnie’s problem behaviors. Within a middle or high school setting, team members could use the OF in multiple classroom settings to determine school-wide variables that may be influencing behavior.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Through the use of observation measures, observers can attend to classroom management phenomena that may prompt or reinforce the student’s problem behaviors. Observational measures that accompany the ASEBA, BASC, and SSBD can provide supportive documentation to assist in eligibility decisions, intervention planning, and program evaluation. However, only the SAED OF is based on target-behavior recording methodology, as adapted to measure classroom behaviors that may be indicative of ED. Regardless of which measure is used, classroom observation is an essential part of the assessment process to assist educators and related professionals with eligibility decisions as well as intervention planning and evaluation for students with or without disabilities who exhibit emotional and behavioral problems.</p>
