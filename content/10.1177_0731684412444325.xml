<abstract>
<p>Hybrid composites are manufactured by combining two or more fibers in a single matrix. Hybrid composites can be made from artificial fibers, natural fibers and with a combination of both artificial and natural fibers. Hybrid composites can help us to achieve a better combination of properties than fiber reinforced composites. The constituent fibers in a hybrid composite can be altered in a number of ways leading to variation in its properties. The importance of this review can be attributed to the significant aspects of natural fiber based hybrid composites which are found to be predominantly affected by factors which include variation in fiber volume/weight fraction, variation in stacking sequence of fiber layers, fiber treatment and environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The contemporary technologies especially related to aerospace, underwater and transportation applications require atypical combination of material properties that cannot be realized by the metal alloys and ceramics. The applications related to aviation warrant high specific strength and high specific stiffness of the structural materials, which cannot be obtained by using conventional materials. Composites help us to achieve the desired properties by combining different materials in a judicious way. In general they possess high specific strength and high specific modulus which makes them useful in various industrial applications involving such characteristics. The glass fiber polymer composites and the carbon fiber polymer composites are used in the modern industries as an alternative to metals and these have the desired characteristics. Each type has its own sphere of applications and limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412444325">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Composites are broadly classified as synthetic fiber reinforced composites and natural fiber reinforced composites. Synthetic fiber reinforced composites have applications in various areas due to their favorable properties when compared with the conventional materials; in addition they can be custom-made as per the requirements of the consumer. In spite of all these advantages the synthetic fiber reinforced composites lack in various aspects like reusability, recycling and bio degradability after end of their life span. All the aforementioned issues are leading to the problems of environmental sensitivity, as a result we need to explore viable alternatives which could resolve our problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412444325">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412444325">6</xref></sup> It was found that materials made of renewable resources like natural fibers embedded in a polymer matrix called biopolymers provide us good alternatives to synthetic fiber composites. Natural fibers are classified based on their origin as plant based and animal based. Plant-based natural fibers are jute, coir, sisal, pineapple, ramie, bamboo, etc. and animal-based fibers are silk, wool, etc. Natural fibers which have advantages of being economical to manufacture, eco-friendly, harmless to health, lightweight, high stiffness and specific strength provide a possible alternative to the synthetic fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412444325">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412444325">9</xref></sup> In due course of time it is thought that the natural fiber composites will replace synthetic fiber composites at least in some applications where a short life of the product is advantageous. In recent times the natural fiber composites have had huge growth in the automobile industry due to the advantages of renewability, reduced emission of pollutants and improved fuel efficiency because of reduced weight of the components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412444325">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412444325">19</xref></sup> Natural fiber composites are found to have higher strengths than wood composites and a few plastics, which improves their prospects as good products in future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412444325">20</xref></sup> In spite of their favorable properties natural fibers possess disadvantages like lack in thermal stability, strength degradation, water absorption and poor impact properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412444325">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412444325">23</xref></sup> In order to improve their properties researchers turned their focus towards the study of effect on mechanical properties due to hybridization of natural fibers with synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>Hybrid composites consist of an amalgamation of two or more fibers in a polymer matrix. The possible combinations of hybrid composites include artificial–artificial, natural–artificial and natural–natural fiber types. Hybrid composite materials have wide applications in the field of engineering due to low cost, strength-to-weight ratio and ease of manufacturing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412444325">24</xref></sup> These hybrid composites provide an option of achieving a blend of properties such as stiffness, ductility and strength, which cannot be achieved by single fiber reinforced composites. Hybrid composites also possess increased fatigue life, better fracture toughness and lower notch sensitivity compared to single fiber reinforced composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412444325">25</xref></sup> Research on various combinations of artificial fiber based hybrid composites revealed that they had certain advantages like high specific strength, high toughness, high impact resistance, etc. Owing to adverse effects on environment, high cost, etc. researchers started exploring natural fiber based hybrid composites. There are two possible varieties of natural fiber based hybrid composites which are obtained by combination of natural–natural and artificial–natural fibers (references in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412444325">Table 1</xref>). Natural fibers themselves can be treated as composites which makes them more tougher when compared to synthetic fibers, more over a rightly configured high quality natural fiber reinforced hybrid composites possess good strength and stiffness values nearer to glass fiber reinforced composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412444325">26</xref></sup> It was observed that partial replacement of artificial fibers with natural fibers led to an artificial–natural based hybrid composites, which show intermediate characteristics between pure natural and pure synthetic fiber based composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412444325">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412444325">28</xref></sup> Researchers substantiated that improved properties can be achieved by hybridizing natural fiber based composites with glass fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412444325">29</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731684412444325">33</xref></sup>

<p>In the present review focus is on the factors that influence the mechanical properties of the natural fiber based hybrid composites. The factors considered here are fiber volume/weight fraction, stacking sequence of the fiber layers, treatment of fibers and effect of environmental conditions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412444325"><title>Factors affecting mechanical behavior of hybrid composites</title>
<sec id="sec3-0731684412444325"><title>Fiber volume or weight fraction</title>
<p>It is the measure of volume or weight proportion of fibers in a hybrid composite. Many researchers have studied the behavior of the hybrid composites by varying the volume/weight fraction of the fibers and observed positive and negative effects on mechanical properties due to that variation. Pothan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731684412444325">34</xref></sup> established that the tensile strength of banana and glass fibers reinforced polyester hybrid composites vary linearly with the volume fraction of the glass fibers. They noticed higher the volume fraction of the glass fibers failure occurred due to delamination of the layers. The impact strength of the hybrid composites was more at 11% glass fiber volume fraction. There was a decline in the impact strength with further increase in the volume fraction of the glass fibers. Mishra et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731684412444325">35</xref></sup> have revealed that the hybridization with the glass fiber showed a positive response on the tensile, flexural, impact and water absorption properties of the hybrid composites. The ultimate tensile strength, impact strength are maximum at 8.6 wt% of glass fibers in pine apple leaf fiber-polyester hybrid composites and 5.7 wt% of glass fibers in sisal fiber–polyester hybrid composites. The enhancement in the tensile strength of the hybrid composites was due to the addition of high modulus glass fibers compared to the bio-fibers. The flexural strength of the bio-fiber composites has been increased with the content of glass fibers because the glass fibers provide more resistance to shearing. Significant increase in impact strength of the composite with the glass fiber loading was observed till 8.6 wt% and beyond that no substantial increase was found. Velmuragan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731684412444325">36</xref></sup> have experimentally evaluated the tensile, flexural, shear and impact properties of glass/palmyra fiber waste sandwich composites. Two sets of samples were prepared, the first set consisted of composite plates prepared with 30–70 wt% of the fibrous waste (palmyra fiber waste) and second set is made by inserting the fiber waste between chopped strand glass fiber mats by altering both glass and waste fiber content with the total fiber weight percentage fixed as 60%. It was observed that the first set of composites with 58–65 wt% fibers showed slight improvement in flexural strength, reduction in tensile strength and significant improvement in shear and impact properties when compared to that of resin. Owing to superior mechanical properties in 58–65 wt% palmyra fiber waste composite they have considered the overall fiber percentage as 60%. In the second set all the above mechanical properties of the composites were found to improve with increase in the amount of glass fiber in the hybrid composites. Hybrid composite containing 48% palmyra fiber, 10 wt% glass fiber showed good strengthening effect than the composite with 11 wt% glass fiber. Padma Priya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731684412444325">37</xref></sup> experimented on silk-glass hybrid composite with total fiber weight fraction of 25% in which glass fiber is varied from 0 to 50%. Hybridization of the composite showed that properties increased with increase in weight fraction of glass fiber. The modulus of hybridized composite is found to be higher than the un-hybridized one due to the presence of higher modulus glass fabric. A 50% glass and 50% silk combination results in a more improved performance than un-hybridized composites. The presence of 50% glass fiber in the hybrid composite leads to efficient load transfer from glass to silk fabric. The flexural strength increased with increase in glass fiber content in the hybrid composite owing to increased opposition to shearing. It was also observed that hybrid composites had lower moisture absorption than un-hybridized composites. The lower water absorption is due to the addition of water resistant glass fibers which prevents direct contact between silk and water. Sabeel Ahmed and Vijayarangan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731684412444325">38</xref></sup> have tested by considering total weight fraction of fiber as 42% with varying glass and jute fiber weight fractions. The elastic modulus in both warp and weft directions increased upon hybridization with glass fibers, Poisson’s ratio decreased with glass addition and shear modulus was not affected much. The elastic modulus was increased due to high modulus and load bearing ability of glass fibers whereas the decrease in Poisson’s ratio was due to greater extensibility of glass fibers when compared to jute fibers. Abdullah-Al-Kafi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731684412444325">39</xref></sup> have made an attempt to find out the mechanical properties of the jute polyester, and jute, glass fibers reinforced polyester hybrid composites by varying the wt% of the fibers. The tensile and flexural properties of the jute-polyester composites increased till 25 wt% of the jute fiber content, further increment of the fiber content showed a decline in the properties because of formation of agglomerates which block stress transfer. The tensile and flexural properties of the hybrid composites increased with the content of the glass fibers because of the high strength and modulus of the glass fibers. Mirbagheri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731684412444325">40</xref></sup> observed that there was an improvement in the tensile properties of the wood flour/polypropylene composite by hybridizing with the kenaf fiber and also mentioned that the improvement in the properties directly related to increase in the weight percentage of the kenaf fibers in the hybrid composite. Abdul Khalil et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731684412444325">41</xref></sup> have done an investigative study on hybrid composites prepared from oil palm and glass fibers reinforced polyester to obtain the mechanical and physical properties at different ratios of the fiber content. The tensile properties are enhanced up to 45 wt% of fiber loading and declining trend has been observed if the fiber content increased further because of the formation of the agglomerates which acts as barriers to stress transfer. The tensile properties are enhanced with the glass fiber volume fraction but reverse trend has been observed in case of increase in content of oil palm fibers because of the poor bond quality between the matrix and the fibers. The elongation at the hybrid composites increased with the increment in the oil palm fiber content but an opposite trend has been observed with increment in the glass fiber content. The flexural and impact properties increased till 35 wt% of the fiber loading beyond that there is a declining trend was observed due to the fiber–fiber interactions and problem with the dispersion of the fibers in the matrix phase. The hardness of the polyester matrix has been reduced by incorporation of the oil palm fibers because the fiber cell contains water molecules which act as plasticizers. The hardness of hybrid composite has been increased with glass fiber loading and the maximum hardness was at 15% of fiber content beyond that it has been decreased. Water absorption by the hybrid composites have been reduced with the content of the glass fibers, because the oil palm fibers are hydrophilic in nature. The dimensional stability is more at the higher glass fiber volume fractions in the hybrid composites. Haneefa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731684412444325">42</xref></sup> have studied the tensile and flexural properties of banana and glass fibers reinforced polystyrene hybrid composites which increased with the glass fiber volume fraction. This improvement was due to the high strength of the glass fibers, proper dispersion of the fibers in the matrix, enhanced mechanical interlocking. Venkata Reddy and Venkata Naidu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731684412444325">43</xref></sup> have observed enhancement in tensile properties of uni-axially oriented glass and kapok fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites with the proportion of the glass fibers. This improvement was facilitated by effective load transfer and better dispersion of the fibers in the matrix. Jarukumjorn and Suppakam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731684412444325">44</xref></sup> have mentioned that the effect of hybridization of glass fiber in sisal–polypropylene composites was not much on the mechanical properties. They noticed a significant increase in the thermal decomposition temperature, heat distortion temperature and reduction in water absorption percentage with increase in glass fiber volume fraction. Idicula et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731684412444325">45</xref></sup> have stated that the performance of the composites has been increased with the volume fraction of the sisal and banana fibers. The permissible fiber volume fraction was mentioned as 40% beyond that the proper stress transfer from fibers to matrix was not occurred due to fiber agglomeration. Since the strength of the banana fibers is more than the sisal fibers, the tensile and flexural properties have been improved which showed a positive hybrid effect. The impact strength of the hybrid composites was less than the sisal fiber polyester composites, due to porous nature and the high spiral angle of the sisal fibers. Vara Prasad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731684412444325">46</xref></sup> studied the tensile and flexural properties of the hybrid composites made from polyester reinforced with glass and jute fibers. They concluded that the tensile strength of the hybrid composites increases with the increase in the volume fraction of the glass fibers, the Young’s modulus is more for the hybrid composite with greater jute fiber volume fraction than the glass fiber volume fraction. A tabulated description of research papers reviewed on variation in fiber volume/weight fraction is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412444325">Table 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec4-0731684412444325"><title>Stacking sequence of fiber layers</title>
<p>Stacking sequence represents the pattern of arrangement of the fiber layers in the hybrid composites. The effect of variation of the position of the fiber layers on the mechanical behavior of the hybrid composites have been studied by the researchers. Sabeel Ahmed and Vijayarangan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731684412444325">47</xref></sup> investigated the tensile, interlaminar shear and flexural properties of the jute and glass fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites by varying the stacking sequence of the layers. The tensile strength of the specimens with the glass fibers at extremities showed higher values than the other specimens because the strength and stiffness of the glass fibers are superior to the jute fibers. The flexural strength is more for the specimens with glass layers at the extreme ends and the jute layers at the core, because the flexural strength is mainly controlled by the stiffness of the extreme plies. The hybrid composites with glass fibers as extreme plies on both sides showed good improvement in properties. The interlaminar shear strength and the flexural strength were found to be greatly influenced by the layering pattern than the tensile properties. Abdul Khalil et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731684412444325">48</xref></sup> compared the composites made from mechanical and chemical fibers with the oil palm empty fruit bunch and glass fiber reinforced vinyl-ester hybrid composites. The tensile modulus of the hybrid composites with glass fibers at the extreme portions produced higher values than any other layered pattern due to excellent load-carrying capacity of glass fibers. The tensile behavior of the chemical fiber composites were found to be better than mechanical fiber composites because the mechanical fibers contain lignin which helps in reducing bond strength. The hybrid composite with glass fibers at the middle portion and natural fibers at the extreme positions showed higher tensile strength, due to good interfacial bonding and proper transfer of load. The flexural strength and flexural modulus of the hybrid composites with glass fibers at the outer layers are higher than the other layered patterns with natural fibers at the extreme portions, because of high load carrying capacity of glass fibers than the natural fibers. The impact strength of hybrid composites with natural fibers at extremities indicated higher values due to their chemical composition. The water absorption of the hybrid composites increased with the content of the natural fibers due to presence of lignocellulose. Gupta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731684412444325">49</xref></sup> have experimentally evaluated the mechanical properties for flax fiber reinforced composite (FFRC) lamina, glass fiber reinforced composite (GRP) lamina, glass-flax-glass-hybrid (GFGH) and flax-glass-flax-hybrid (FGFH). The change in the properties due to variation in stacking sequence was observed. It was given that the stacking arrangement GFGH is superior to FGFH in terms of tensile, compressive, flexural, impact and specific tensile strengths. Amico et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731684412444325">50</xref></sup> studied the effect of variation in stacking sequence of the layers in a hybrid laminate on its mechanical properties. It has been observed that the hybrid composites made with asymmetrical stacking sequence are less capable than the symmetrical composites. The effect of stacking sequence on the tensile strength was not clearly noticed. The impact strength of the hybrid composite with adjacent glass layers showed higher values. The hardness was found to be higher for composites with good structural integrity and whose tested surface has more glass layers. The specimens with sisal at core and glass at extreme portions showed poor flexural strength when compared to the specimens with the glass reinforcement at the middle and at the extreme portions. Tumolva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731684412444325">51</xref></sup> have experimentally tested a natural fiber reinforced hybrid composites with long abaca and short bagasse fibers acting as strengthening agents in ortho-type unsaturated polyester (UP) resin. Fiber reinforced plastic laminates were prepared and tested with same uniform thickness, however, with alternating stacking sequences of abaca and bagasse fibers. Two stacking sequences with 3 abaca sheets sandwiching 2 bagasse mats parallelly and at 90° cross-ply orientation were made and tested. The tensile strength for cross-ply orientation is lesser than that of the parallel. In spite of lower tensile strength the cross-ply type allows superior load support in both transverse and axial directions making it more suitable for biaxial loading. Jayabal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731684412444325">52</xref></sup> have evaluated mechanical properties of woven coir–glass hybrid polyester composites for different stacking sequences. The stacking sequences GGC (‘C’ for Coir and ‘G’ for glass) and CGG showed maximum values of flexural strength, impact strength and tensile strength. The GGC specimen yielded higher mechanical properties than that of GCG specimen. Moreover GGC specimen also generated higher breaking resistance than that of CGC specimen because coir fibers are weaker than glass fibers. Jawaid et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731684412444325">53</xref></sup> have done a comparative study between composites prepared from oil palm fibers, jute fibers and combination of both. They observed that tensile and flexural properties of the hybrid composites lie between oil palm fiber reinforced epoxy composites and jute fiber reinforced epoxy composites. They reported that the location of high strength fibers in the hybrid composites affects the tensile and flexural strengths. The conclusions revealed that incorporation of jute fibers in the oil palm fiber composites improved the mechanical behavior and hybrid composites with jute layers on the extreme portions possess greater strength because the strength of the jute fibers is more than that of oil palm fibers.

<sec id="sec5-0731684412444325"><title>Treatment of fibers</title>
<p>In composite materials good interfacial bonding between the fiber and matrix is essential for optimum performance. Lot of research work has been done till date to improve the bond strength, researchers have chosen chemical treatment of fibers as one of the ways to achieve a good bond strength between fiber and matrix leading to the improvement of mechanical properties. Alkali treatment was the most preferred treatment for natural fibers which led to the improvement of interfacial adhesion between fiber and matrix. John and Venkata Naidu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731684412444325">54</xref></sup> compared between untreated, alkali-treated and silane-treated sisal and glass fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites. Their research work revealed that alkali-treated hybrid composites showed better tensile strength than silane-treated and untreated hybrid composites due to removal of hemicellulose from sisal fibers which helped to improve the adhesion characteristics. The silane-treated hybrid composites showed better tensile strength than the untreated hybrid composites because of enhanced wetting characteristics of sisal fibers. Noorunnisa Khannam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731684412444325">55</xref></sup> conducted an experimental study on the effect of alkali treatment on the tensile, flexural and compressive properties of sisal and silk reinforced polyester hybrid composites. The optimum tensile, compressive and flexural properties were observed for the treated hybrid composites with fiber length at 2 cm and identified that the alkali treatment enhanced the interfacial bonding of the hybrid composites. Patel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731684412444325">56</xref></sup> revealed that the alkali-treated jute fibers undergo acrylation leading to improvement in physical properties. The mechanical properties were found to be improved by modification of fiber surface after treatment. The water uptakes of treated hybrid composites have been reduced because of esterification of −OH groups in the jute fibers. Venkata Reddy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731684412444325">57</xref></sup> compared the mechanical properties of treated and untreated kapok, glass fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites. Clear enhancement of the flexural properties has been observed due to the hybrid effect and the alkali treatment. The interlaminar shear strength of the treated fiber hybrid composites is more than the untreated hybrid composites due to enhancement of the bond strength. Raghu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731684412444325">58</xref></sup> examined the chemical resistance of the treated and untreated sisal, silk fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites. The treated and untreated hybrid composites are exposed to various acids, solvents and alkalis. Exposure of treated and untreated hybrid composites to carbon tetra chloride showed predominant weight loss due to damage of polyester crosslinking caused by chlorinated hydrocarbons. Venkata Subba Reddy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731684412444325">59</xref></sup> studied the effect of chemicals and alkali treatment on mechanical behavior of glass and bamboo fiber reinforced polypropylene hybrid composites. The alkali treatment showed positive effect on the tensile properties and chemical resistance due to removal of hemi cellulose on the bamboo fibers which enrich the bond strength. Noorunnisa Khanam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0731684412444325">60</xref></sup> investigated the effect of NaOH treatment of coir fibers on the behavior of coir/silk fiber hybrid composites. The treated composites showed better properties than the untreated hybrid composites. The treatment enhanced the adhesion of the fiber and matrix by removing the lignin and hemicellulose from the surface of the coir fiber. Raghavendra Rao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0731684412444325">61</xref></sup> studied the effect of alkali treatment on the mechanical properties like flexural strength and compressive strength of the glass and bamboo fiber reinforced epoxy hybrid composites. The alkali-treated hybrid composites showed high compressive and flexural strengths, because of the removal of hemicellulose content from the bamboo fibers. Ashok Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0731684412444325">62</xref></sup> investigated the effect of alkali treatment of fibers on impact strength, hardness properties and chemical resistance of sisal, glass fiber reinforced epoxy hybrid composites as a function of fiber length. The hardness and impact strength for the alkali-treated hybrid composites at a fiber length of 2 cm were found to be optimum, hemicellulose elimination from the surface of the sisal fibers helps in improving the interfacial bond strength of the composite. The treated hybrid composites showed good chemical resistance except towards sodium carbonate and toluene.

<sec id="sec6-0731684412444325"><title>Effect of environmental conditions</title>
<p>The environment in which a hybrid composite has to function has considerable influence on its mechanical properties. This fact has prompted researchers to study the effects of various environments on the behavior of hybrid composites. Phani and Bose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0731684412444325">63</xref></sup> inspected the effect of hydrothermal ageing on degradation rate of glass fiber composites and jute-glass fiber hybrid composites using acousto-ultrasonic technique. The inclusion of jute into glass fiber hybrid composite has caused a reduction in the rate of degradation. They observed that for aging time below 70 h the jute-glass hybrid strength degradation rate was found to be greater than that of pure glass composite whereas for above 70 h the strength degradation rate of jute-glass was found to be lower than that of pure glass composite. They attributed these findings to the reason that below 70 h aging time the jute fiber and jute- resin interface undergoes fast degradation when exposed to moist conditions whereas above 70 h aging time the inflated jute fiber layer absorbs swelling strain from resin which behaves as a cushion, in addition jute fiber layers provide extra protection to sandwiched glass layer. They also found that strength readings of the three composites are nearer to each other for long-term aging. Thwe and Liao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731684412444325">64</xref></sup> experimentally evaluated tensile and flexural properties of bamboo polypropylene composite (BFRP) and bamboo, glass fiber polypropylene hybrid composite (BGRP) with respect to moisture sorption time and temperature. They observed that the tensile and flexural strengths reduce with sorption time and temperature; the environmental deterioration can be postponed by adding small amount of glass fiber hence improving the durability of the bamboo fiber composite. In addition the use of maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent is found to suppress moisture sorption and strength reduction. They studied BGRP and BFRP samples manufactured with 30% overall fiber content and exposed to water at 75°C for 600 h and 25°C for 1600 h. They observed the sorption behavior which is the mass gain percentage during aging and concluded that the amount of sorption is lower for bamboo–glass hybrid composite which is due to negligible moisture sorption by glass fiber. In addition the usage of MAPP in matrix further leads to reduction in water sorption by 1.5–2% for BFRP and BGRP samples. This reduction is caused by improved interfacial fiber/matrix bonding. It was observed that the sorption rate is higher for 75°C when compared with 25°C during the initial stage because of interfacial de-bonding leading to more water settlement in the composite which increases with soaking time. It was also observed that the gain in mass of the composite was reduced during aging with increase in glass fiber content and also same trend was observed with the usage of MAPP in matrix at both 25°C and 75°C. Panthapulakkal and Sain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0731684412444325">65</xref></sup> studied the behavior of hemp and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene hybrid composites when exposed to water for certain period of time at 40°C, 60°C and 80°C by varying the content of the glass fibers. They reported with increase in volume fraction of glass fibers the saturation point of moisture absorption attained prematurely. The maximum moisture uptake has been observed at 80°C due to leaching of the materials from the natural fibers at high temperatures. The diffusion coefficient increased with increase in immersion temperature, at high temperatures diffusion dominated the resistance showed by glass fibers. The tensile behavior of the composites before and after the exposure to water has been studied. A reduction in the tensile properties of the composites was observed due to loss of interfacial bonding between fibers and matrix. They revealed that the tensile properties of the re-dried specimens were better than the wet samples. John and Venkata Naidu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0731684412444325">66</xref></sup> studied the effect of alkali treatment on the chemical resistance of sisal, glass fiber reinforced polyester hybrid composites. It has been observed that there is a loss of weight for both treated and untreated hybrid composites when exposed to carbon tetrachloride, to be precise the weight loss in treated hybrid composites is more than the untreated hybrid composites, it was due to the attack of chlorinated hydrocarbons on polyester crosslinking and degradation in the alkali groups due to hydrolytic attack. Silva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731684412444325">67</xref></sup> observed the effect of water absorption on the mechanical properties of curaua and E-glass fiber reinforced orthophthalic polyester hybrid composites. The hybrid composites were exposed to distilled water and the sea water and comparison of the mechanical properties was made with the non-hybrid composites made from curaua natural fibers. It has been observed that the diffusion rate is same for both sea water and the distilled water up to 330 h and beyond that the diffusion rate of the sea water was found to be reduced due to the addition of NaCl ions on the surface of the fibers. Tensile strength and tensile modulus of the hybrid composites exposed to distilled water was reduced more than the hybrid composites exposed to sea water because of the higher absorption of distilled water by the hybrid composites. The flexural modulus degraded more for sea water samples because of the matrix plasticization. Arun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0731684412444325">68</xref></sup> have experimentally evaluated the critical stress intensity factor, inter-laminar shear strength and impact toughness for glass/textile fabric reinforced hybrid composites under normal condition and sea water. The magnitude of characterizing parameters changed with variation in immersion time. Scanning electron microscopy analysis was used to determine nature of fracture and it also revealed that the fiber pull out, matrix cracking and also the nature of crack growth is different in sea water environment. The specimen with more glass content was found to have higher critical stress intensity factor in both sea water and normal conditions, more over with increase in immersion time the interlaminar shear and flexural strengths decreased in sea water. Abdul Khalil et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0731684412444325">69</xref></sup> conducted an experimental study on the oil palm and jute fiber reinforced epoxy composites to find out the percentage of water absorption and thickness swelling. They have established an enhancement in the aforementioned properties by hybridizing the oil palm fiber composite with the jute fibers when compared to the pure oil palm fiber reinforced epoxy composites. The presence of the jute layers at the extreme portions of the hybrid composites showed better improvement in the properties than the hybrid composites with oil palm layers at the end positions. It was also mentioned that the water absorption capacity and thickness swelling is directly related to the density of the composite, presence of the voids and the bonding between fiber and the matrix. Zamri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731684412444325">70</xref></sup> studied the variations in flexural and compressive properties of jute and glass fiber reinforced unsaturated polyester hybrid composites when exposed to three aqueous environmental conditions such as distilled water, sea water and acidic water for 3 weeks. Observations were made that the absorption of water increased with the exposure time. The diffusion coefficient was calculated for each specimen and found out the diffusion coefficient is more in case of distilled water followed by acidic water and sea water. They reported that the presence of sodium chloride in sea water helps to reduce the diffusion rate. The strength of the composites reduced with increasing immersion time. The flexural and compressive strengths of the hybrid composites are more than the natural fiber composites due to the presence of high strength glass fibers which are hydrophobic in nature.
