<abstract>
<p>Men’s health discourse has been around for more than 2 decades. The higher mortality rates and the shorter life expectancy in Asian men compared with their women counterparts show the disadvantaged status of men’s health. Thus, discussions on men’s health should address their health needs and not be confined to sex-specific male urology and reproductive health. In Asia, assessing men’s health needs is challenging because of the vast differences in the socioeconomic status and the diverse culture among its member countries. Although, the epidemiology of men’s health provides the focus for what to address in improving men’s health, having an optimal strategy requires the understanding of men’s health-seeking behaviors and the social determinants surrounding them. Thus, public health approaches addressing health behaviors and health promotion in the society should be one of the keys in improving men’s health status. Locally relevant information is needed to inform effective public health approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Men have poorer health status compared with women in almost all countries in the world. Men’s health discourse started in the early 1990s in a few European countries, Australia, and the United States of America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512452756">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512452756">2</xref></sup> However, as early as 1984, men were already noted to be disadvantaged in relation to mortality and morbidity patterns compared with women in the United States of America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512452756">3</xref></sup> More recent reviews have confirmed the same concern around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512452756">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512452756">9</xref></sup> Men’s poorer health profiles compared with those of women are also reflected in almost all the vital statistics published by the World Health Organization (WHO), such as life expectancy at birth, mortality rates, disability-adjusted life years and non–sex-specific disease death rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512452756">12</xref></sup> On an average, men’s life expectancy at birth is 5 years shorter than that of women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The diseases that contribute to men’s mortality are non–sex specific and amenable to early intervention. Although male-specific illnesses have been the emphasis in men’s health traditionally, cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in men. This is followed by injuries, road traffic accidents, cancers (mainly respiratory tract and colorectal cancers), violence, war, infectious diseases (including HIV/AIDS), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512452756">13</xref></sup> These causes of death are not male specific and share many common risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, sedentary lifestyles, obesity, hypertension, and high-risk behaviors. The disturbing fact is that the causes of death are overwhelmingly lifestyle related and hence preventable or amenable to early intervention.</p>
<p>From an Asian perspective, similar disadvantages in men’s mortality and vital statistics compared with women have also been documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512452756">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512452756">18</xref></sup> On an average, men’s life expectancy at birth is 4 years shorter than that of women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup> Although the poor status of men’s health in Asian countries is well acknowledged, progress in men’s health faces great challenges. Among the challenges is to define and understand men’s health in a manner that reflects the needs of Asian men. The importance of men’s health is still not clear to many health care providers from Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512452756">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512452756">20</xref></sup> The recent 2011 6th Biennial Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Society for the Study of Aging Male, with the conference theme of “Think Anti-Aging, Talk Men’s Health,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539512452756">21</xref></sup> had a heavy slant toward male-specific disorders despite the fact that non–male-specific disorders contribute to the main health concerns of Asian men. Furthermore, the emphasis on a biomedical perspective of men’s health has neglected the psychosocial needs of men. Hence, the objective of this article is to discuss the current definition of men’s health and how it relates to Asian men’s health needs. These justify why public health plays a key role in promoting men’s health.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The definitions of men’s health were searched in the main electronic health science databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science) to identify review articles, editorial discussions, and debates on men’s health. The search also included official web sites for men’s health organizations and published electronic governmental policies. Literature on Asian men’s health needs was examined by reviewing the epidemiological data of men’s health and the determinants of men’s health. World Health Reports and Burden of Disease Reports from WHO were the main sources of epidemiological data. These were supplemented by published Asian data relevant to men’s health in the same electronic databases. In view of the abundant data on men’s health morbidities, which include cardiovascular risk factors, alcohol, smoking, obesity, prostate disorders, lower–urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), male sexual health and psychological health, review articles on the relevant topics were used instead in this article. The data on the determinants of men’s health in Asia were searched for using the following keywords: Asia, health-seeking behaviors, needs assessment, social determinants, health risk, masculinity, social supports, social structures, and men’s health. Data on the determinants of men’s health in Asia are scarce. We have included all original work or review articles investigating the contributing factors to men’s poor health in Asia and excluded articles about immigrants and pathophysiology of male-specific diseases. Out of 196 relevant titles identified, only 16 related to men’s health in Asia. However, only 5 original articles and 2 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They differed greatly in their methodology. Thus, we could only provide a discussion and propose strategies to improve men’s health based on the current understanding of men’s health.</p>

<title>Definition of Men’s Health: The Current State of Debate</title>
<p>There is considerable debate about the definition of men’s health. However, much of the debates on men’s health definition come from West.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512452756">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512452756">25</xref></sup> Men’s health is easily mistaken as an issue of mere differences between men and women because it appears to be self-apparent from the term used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512452756">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512452756">25</xref></sup> The only universal difference between men and women is probably the biological sex difference. Taking the stance of these mere differences, men’s health would then involve issues about male genitourinary and reproductive health. However, focusing the discussion on this distinction implies that all men are homogeneous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512452756">25</xref></sup> Most would disagree with this definition and would argue that men’s health should go beyond sexual and reproductive health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512452756">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512452756">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref></sup>; it should also encompass illnesses predominant in or specific to men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512452756">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512452756">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539512452756">29</xref></sup> Based on epidemiological data, significant mortality and morbidities in men are nonsexual organ-related illnesses like cardiovascular diseases, bowel cancer, and unnatural death (suicide and accidental injuries).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512452756">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539512452756">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539512452756">31</xref></sup> However, concentrating on illnesses common or specific to men is still insufficient. Closer examination of the data reveals that the mortality and morbidity burden of men is related to their gender roles in society and social status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512452756">25</xref></sup> A broader definition is, hence, needed to capture the gist of men’s health issues involving men’s social roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The definition of men’s health has been evolving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512452756">2</xref></sup> The WHO defined health, in 1948, as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539512452756">32</xref></sup> In the context of men’s health, it carries the same meaning as to achieve a high standard of complete well-being for men. This broad concept of health is highly inclusive of many issues related to men by taking a bio-psychosocial model of health. Similarly, many men’s health forums and organizations have defined men’s health from this model of health, and furthermore, they are more explicit about gender issues surrounding men’s health. For example, the European Men’s Health Forum has provided a more precise and gender sensitive definition of men’s health:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>A male health issue is one arising from physiological, psychological, social, cultural or environmental factors that have a specific impact on boys or men and/or where particular interventions are required for boys or men in order to achieve improvements in health and well-being at either the individual or the population level.</italic><sup><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539512452756">33</xref></italic></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this model of health is not without its problems. First, it ignores layman’s views of health. Men may view health from a role performance perspective, where health is considered a resource enabling their participation in social and community activities such as work, play, reproduction, and parenting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539512452756">27</xref></sup> Health to men is a medium through which they can exercise their masculine identity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539512452756">34</xref></sup> For men, “doing health is a form of doing gender.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539512452756">35</xref></sup> Hence some argue that their view of health and well-being should be incorporated into the definition in order to answer their needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512452756">22</xref></sup> rather than it being purely from health care providers’ perspective. Second, the bio-psychosocial model concerning “well-being” is being criticized for medicalization of society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512452756">36</xref></sup> The concept of well-being creates an impression that we should attempt to achieve the highest standard of health through medical technologies. This is a provider-centered concept. On the contrary, a person can feel completely healthy if he/she can fulfill his/her social responsibility and maintain a sense of mental coherence despite physical disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512452756">36</xref></sup> Hence Huber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539512452756">36</xref></sup> proposed that health should be a concept denoting the ability to adapt and to self-manage. Huber’s view supports layman’s views about health which emphasize functionality rather than a complete state of well-being. Thus, to fulfill the health needs of men, a more inclusive definition or concept of men’s health is needed that incorporates laymen’s perspective taking into consideration their social roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Porche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539512452756">37</xref></sup> and Porche and Willis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512452756">2</xref></sup> review the definition of men’s health and have rightfully suggested that men’s health should be “a holistic, comprehensive approach that addresses the physical, mental,emotional, social, and spiritual life experiences and health needs of men throughout their lifespan (p. 254)”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512452756">2</xref></sup> The definition incorporates the holistic approach, which emphasizes the bio-psychosocial model of health and, more important, the needs of men; also, here, laymen’s views are taken into consideration. His emphasis on the health needs of men has important implications in Asian countries because of vast differences in the health needs among Asian men.</p>

<title>Defining Asian Men’s Health Needs</title>
<p>Reviewing Asian men’s health needs is challenging because of differences in the epidemiology of diseases and socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup> Infectious diseases, lack of clean water supply, nutritional disorders, and poor sanitation are still significantly present in poorer countries in Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756">11</xref></sup> On the other hand, men from developed countries face mainly the threat of noncommunicable diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup> Also, Asia is not a homogeneous continent. The sociocultural differences between and within Asian countries are enormous. Because of these differences, published data from the West may not be applicable. Already there is emerging evidence to show that men from South Asia have significantly different help-seeking behavior when compared with those from the West.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref></sup> To be systematic, Asian men’s health needs can be examined from at least 3 perspectives: (1) epidemiology of men’s health, (2) men’s health-seeking behavior, and (3) social structures and the social determinants of health.</p>
<sec id="section5-1010539512452756">
<title>Epidemiology of Men’s Health in Asia</title>
<p>Life expectancy at birth is often used as the marker to demonstrate men’s poor health status. However, more useful statistics to reflect men’s health needs should include causes of death and their morbidity profiles. These statistics in Asian countries have been reviewed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512452756">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1010539512452756">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1010539512452756">41</xref></sup> In summary, life expectancy at birth for men is 4 years shorter than for women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup>; Japan, which is a developed country, has the longest life expectancy in the world of 79 years, whereas men in Afghanistan, which is a much poorer country, have a life expectancy of only 47 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756">11</xref></sup> The main causes of death for men in developed countries are noncommunicable diseases, such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases, whereas in developing countries such as India, Myanmar, Bhutan, and Cambodia, communicable diseases still contribute to the main causes of death in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512452756">11</xref></sup> Male suicide rates in Asian countries are much higher compared with the rates for their female counterparts and compared with the West, particularly among male elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1010539512452756">42</xref></sup> Death from injury is also a major problem, particularly among developing countries such as Iraq and Kazakhstan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1010539512452756">43</xref></sup> Even though men in developed Asian countries enjoy a longer life expectancy, they face the problems of aging and noncommunicable diseases. On the other hand, in developing countries, even though communicable diseases are a threat, men also face a rapidly aging population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1010539512452756">44</xref></sup> and increasing mortality rates as a result of noncommunicable diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512452756">12</xref></sup> Lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, and obesity are also major concerns. The prevalence of smoking in Asian men ranges from 24% to 70%. The worrying trend in smoking is that there is a rise in rate of 2% annually in developing countries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1010539512452756">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1010539512452756">46</xref></sup> and most countries in Asia are in this category. The prevalence rates of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are also worsening in Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1010539512452756">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1010539512452756">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Problems specific to men, such as prostate disorders and sexual dysfunction, although they do not contribute directly to the mortality rate, are prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity.

<p>Hence, illnesses that contribute significantly to men’s mortality and adversely affect men’s quality of life should be given due attention. They should be the focus for health promotion, including sexual and reproductive health. Although this epidemiological approach to assess men’s health needs is valid to a certain extent, it still represents a provider-centered approach. For instance, we are aware of the need to reduce cardiovascular and cancer deaths in men through lifestyle risk modifications and medications and to have appropriate safety measures for men involved in hazardous occupations, but we are unsure whether our agenda is shared by the men. To formulate an effective intervention to address men’s health concerns, we need to understand their health-seeking behaviors in relation to their needs to fulfill their social role as men in the society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1010539512452756">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1010539512452756">70</xref></sup> Therefore, assessment of men’s health needs should also incorporate an understanding of men’s health-seeking behavior.</p>

<title>Understanding Men’s Health-Seeking Behavior in Asia</title>
<p>Literature from the West shows that men’s health-seeking behavior is greatly influenced by the society and culture surrounding them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1010539512452756">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1010539512452756">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1010539512452756">71</xref></sup> Men adopt a set of masculine health behaviors, such as being stoic, tough, in control, and able to take care of themselves, to fulfill their needs to demonstrate manliness because society expects this of men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756">24</xref></sup> Men with illnesses and psychological ailments are considered weak by the society. Hence, men will try hard to project a healthy and strong image.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1010539512452756">71</xref></sup> They will negotiate a legitimate reason within the boundary accepted by the society to engage themselves in health promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539512452756">34</xref></sup> This socially constructed masculinity is thought to compromise men’s health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1010539512452756">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1010539512452756">71</xref></sup> However, the masculine traits, or so-called expected gender roles, differ from one society to another.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1010539512452756">72</xref></sup> These multiple masculinities contribute to the different patterns of health-seeking behavior noted in different cultures and societies, both between men and women and within different groups of men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512452756">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1010539512452756">73</xref></sup> Men do care about their health, but they need to find good reasons and a context to act within the accepted concept of masculinity among their peers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1010539512452756">74</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1010539512452756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1010539512452756">77</xref></sup> and in their culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1010539512452756">78</xref></sup> Therefore, understanding their health-seeking behavior in relation to their sociocultural context could help strategize measures to fulfill their needs to fit into the gender role in the society.</p>
<p>The concept of masculinity, however, may be different between Asian and Western cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref></sup> Evidence from Asian countries is scant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup> With the diversity of cultures and societies in Asian countries, the difference between Asian countries could be even greater. There have been some studies from Asian countries that support a concept of masculinity similar to that in the West while also showing some differences. Similar to the Western data, studies involving South Asian men in the United Kingdom and the Chinese demonstrated that men fear loss of control more than their health and thought it unmanly to self-report psychosocial issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1010539512452756">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1010539512452756">80</xref></sup> Being in control is a dominant feature in the model of hegemonic masculinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1010539512452756">72</xref></sup> In contrast, family responsibility is also an important feature in defining masculinity in some Asian countries. A study investigating Malaysian men’s views of health-seeking behavior found that men placed high importance on health and valued family responsibility, and these had motivated them to stay healthy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1010539512452756">81</xref></sup> One of the reasons for medical checkups was just to keep healthy. The Asian Men’s Attitudes To Life Events and Sexuality (Asian MALES) study attempted to explore the correlations between masculinity traits and health behavior among Asian men using a survey method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1010539512452756">82</xref></sup> It also highlighted some differences. More than 10 000 men from China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan were asked about 13 attributes of masculine traits relating to social life and the manly image. First, the study demonstrated differences in the perception of important masculine traits between countries. Having lots of money was seen as most important in China, but being seen as a man of honor, a family man, having a good job, and being in control were seen as most important in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1010539512452756">82</xref></sup> This is in contrast to the Men’s Attitudes to Life Events and Sexuality study from the West, where masculinity is linked with being in control of one’s own life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1010539512452756">83</xref></sup> Second, men who placed importance on being a family man sought medical help more readily than those who did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1010539512452756">84</xref></sup> Similarly, a study in the United Kingdom of Asian immigrants also demonstrated a significant difference in how cultural values have shaped the way men seek help for chest pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref></sup> Men from South Asia also placed a high value on family responsibility and hence they sought help for chest pain more readily than Westerners. Wisdom, education, and responsibility for family and their own health were much valued masculine attributes, and these contributed to a greater willingness to seek medical help.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref></sup> Therefore, placing family values above their own image is somewhat different from the findings in the West. Emphasis on this set of values (family responsibility) in health promotion may be helpful in some Asian countries in order to fulfill men’s psychosocial needs.</p>

<title>Social Structures and Social Determinants of Health</title>
<p>Besides exerting an impact on health-seeking behavior, the social structures surrounding men also influence men’s health. Attention to these structures is needed to provide a healthy environment for men, hence improving their health. Poor socioeconomic status, unattended stress, high-risk occupations, unemployment, poor social support, and man-unfriendly health care are among social structures that adversely affect men’s health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512452756">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1010539512452756">85</xref></sup> regardless of their personal values toward health. Each of these concerns is closely linked to Asian countries, where a majority are developing countries.</p>
<p>Poor socioeconomic status, which is still a major problem in many Asian countries, not only affects the health of women and children but also men’s health. The rates for all 3 causes of death (communicable and noncommunicable diseases and injury) among men aged 15 to 59 years in low- and middle-income countries were much higher than that in high-income countries. In the published statistics by WHO, the total men’s mortality rate in 2004 was 5/1000 in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia and 3/1000 in the Western Pacific compared with 2/1000 in high-income countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref></sup> Similar patterns were seen with Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) for adult men in these regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref></sup> Public health issues related to poor socioeconomic status such as poor sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition have an equal impact on men as they do on women and children.</p>
<p>Work-related health problems are also among the major concerns for Asian men. In many parts of Asia, men are often the sole breadwinners. Hence, compared with women, they are exposed directly to health problems related to employment such as work stress, retrenchment, unemployment, and occupational hazards. High-risk occupations such as mining, construction, timber cutting, law enforcement, armed forces, and firefighting are dominated by men. Furthermore, awareness of occupational safety is low. These contributed to a high injury-related mortality rate among men compared with women in all regions of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512452756">10</xref></sup> Also, because of men being the sole breadwinners, unemployment is associated with a greater negative impact on men than women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1010539512452756">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1010539512452756">87</xref></sup> Higher mortality, adverse effects on mental health, and higher morbidities were noted to be associated with unemployment even after allowing for the effects of socioeconomic factors, health-risk factors, and prior ill-health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1010539512452756">87</xref></sup> This is a logical consequence, because as the breadwinners, unemployment places tremendous stress on men.</p>
<p>Although the literature on supportive social structures for Asian men is scarce, men generally have smaller social networks compared with women. Good, supportive social structures such as social networks, social integration, and quantity and quality of social relationships are positively associated with greater survival benefits compared with poor supportive social structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1010539512452756">88</xref></sup> Hence, the lesser availability of social networks for men may explain their poorer health. Furthermore, it was noted that Asians use social support less often than Whites for coping with stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1010539512452756">89</xref></sup> Thus, one of the needs for men’s health is improved supportive social structures.</p>
<p>Health services, which are also part of the social structure, in most countries are not man friendly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1010539512452756">90</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1010539512452756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1010539512452756">92</xref></sup> Women and child health services are the priority in many Asian countries but rarely gender-sensitive men’s health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref></sup> Often, health care delivery is fraught with problems such as long waiting times, clinics being inaccessible after working hours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1010539512452756">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1010539512452756">90</xref></sup> and stigmatization of men’s health services as services for men’s sexual health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1010539512452756">93</xref></sup> Also, health care providers in some Asian countries may be unclear about men’s health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512452756">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512452756">20</xref></sup> This reflects yet another unmet need for men.</p>
<p>Therefore, social structures, which are the “upstream” factors that affect men’s heath, need to be attended to if the mortality and morbidity among men has to be reduced.</p>

</fig>
<p>Information on the mortality and morbidity patterns of men’s health only provide a focus of what to address in improving men’s health status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512452756">Figure 1</xref>). Noncommunicable diseases are the main concerns in developed countries in Asia. On the other hand, communicable diseases are still significant problems besides the emerging noncommunicable diseases in developing countries. Psychological health, injuries, and occupational hazards are other concerns of men’s health. These are in addition to male-specific illnesses such as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, testosterone deficiency syndrome, and prostate disorders. Treatment and management of illnesses concerning men have advanced so much that mortality and morbidity related to these illnesses can be improved. For example, the effective management of cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of death in men, has considerably reduced cardiovascular mortality rates, at least in developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1010539512452756">94</xref></sup> Effective smoking cessation strategies are available as well as advances in the management of erectile dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1010539512452756">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1010539512452756">96</xref></sup> testosterone deficiency syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1010539512452756">97</xref></sup> and premature ejaculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1010539512452756">60</xref></sup> to improve men’s quality of life. Safety measures are also available for workers involved in hazardous occupations. However, merely identifying the areas for improvement is insufficient. The challenge for health care providers is to engage men in the provision of these services—how to deliver the services effectively. This will need an understanding of men’s health-seeking behaviors and reconstitution of the social structure to a more man-friendly one.</p>
<p>Understanding men’s health-seeking behaviors and their social structures from a layman’s perspective is crucial while adopting an effective strategy to promote men’s health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512452756">Figure 1</xref>). Men’s desire and needs to conform to a socially constructed masculine image are not to be blamed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512452756">23</xref></sup> and neither should they be changed. Thus, strategies to reeducate men on health service use are being challenged for their effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512452756">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1010539512452756">98</xref></sup> Rather, a positive approach to promote a healthy image of men based on a local concept of masculinity is probably the way forward. For example, placing a high priority on family responsibility is an important masculine trait in South Asian culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539512452756">38</xref></sup> The need to be in control is also considered an important masculine trait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1010539512452756">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1010539512452756">80</xref></sup> These could be used as health promotion tools. Measures reflecting these masculine traits include empowering men to make decisions, highlighting being responsible to the family as a masculine trait. Another example is to adopt the theme focusing on “take care of your health before you can care for your family.” These strategies, in some ways, help men identify a legitimate reason to seek help. But these examples are based on limited studies on health-seeking behaviors in Asia. More localized qualitative studies from a sociological perspective exploring men’s health-seeking behaviors and the local concept of masculinity are needed to inform best strategies to engage men in health services and health promotion. Though much can be learnt from the West, there is a need also to look at the local settings because of diverse social and cultural differences in Asia.</p>
<p>As outlined above, the social structures affect men’s health directly and also indirectly by shaping men’s health-seeking behaviors. Attention to these upstream factors is paramount to have an impact on men’s health status. The measures have to include having relevant policies, preventive approaches, and health promotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512452756">Figure 1</xref>). Needless to say, improving socioeconomic status and ensuring safer working environments need effective social policies that acknowledge men’s needs. These policies need to attend to the problems of unemployment, social security, work stress, and occupational hazards where there is a direct impact on the majority of men. Ireland and Australia are the only 2 countries at the moment with national men’s health policies. The policy plays a crucial role in laying down the framework for coordinated measures to improve men’s health. Social networks and help lines for men should be encouraged and built within the Asian concept of masculinities. Laymen’s participation in planning such supportive activities is necessary rather than taking the top-down approach, to ensure its durability. Social networks and help lines provide a cushion for many health challenges such as facing stressful life events and also opportunities for men to talk about their health problems. Many such activities are initiated by the community in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1010539512452756">99</xref></sup> For example, the Men’s Shed program in Australia has successfully attracted the interest of men from the community to form social networks among peers. The program focuses on the need to be locally relevant. Thus, in-depth studies into the health behavior of Asian men are needed on which such program can be based. Surveys based on prespecified hypotheses and theory may not be appropriate if they are not preceded by any exploratory studies. Health services tailored to men’s needs is the next social structure that needs attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512452756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512452756">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1010539512452756">90</xref></sup> The services not only need to be man friendly, such as tailored to men’s working hours, providing men’s health information, having outreach programs, and ensuring confidentiality, but they also need to focus on preventive measures for the main causes of male mortality and morbidity, such as preventive health checkups and promotion of healthy lifestyles. Therefore, to have major impacts on improving men’s health, we need a wide array of measures, ranging from social and men’s health policies to man-friendly service delivery.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Having a holistic and gender-sensitive men’s health definition is important to put men’s health activities in a correct perspective, thus addressing men’s health needs. Efforts to improve men’s health in Asia cannot escape from paying attention to how Asian men define health and their health-seeking behaviors. However, the larger structure that determines and shapes men’s health-seeking behavior is the society surrounding men. Although the epidemiology of men’s health provides a focus of what to address in improving men’s health, it does not provide us with enough information as to the best strategies to use to address men’s health concerns. We have to consider men’s health-seeking behaviors and their social structures in the approaches to address men’s health concerns. Because social structures surrounding men are the main factors underpinning men’s health concerns, a public health approach is necessary. However, in Asia, improving men’s health is a great challenge because data on Asian men’s health-seeking behaviors and how Asian men define health are lacking. Furthermore, defining men’s health needs in Asia is difficult because of her diverse cultures and society. A better understanding of Asian men’s health needs and their health-seeking behaviors is needed.</p>
