<p>At the beginning of what we hope will be a long and successful partnership with SAGE Publications, here is a timely reminder of who AREC is and what we do.</p>
<sec id="section1-1747016112445533">
<title>Who are we?</title>
<p>AREC is an independent, self-governing body of research ethics committees which fosters excellence in research involving human beings. While AREC membership is drawn largely from the NHS and university sectors, we are increasingly aware that there is a need to offer support and assistance to a wider audience. We are currently trying to contact potential members/partners who are also involved in research. No other UK organization provides as much education and support in research ethics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1747016112445533">
<title>What do we do now?</title>
<list id="list1-1747016112445533" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide training via tailored, in-house workshops and regional seminars which may be undertaken jointly with local organizations. This is carried out at the lowest possible cost, ranging from £35 to £75 per day, with lunch and refreshments included. Regional seminars planned for 2012 will take place in Stirling, Manchester, Durham, London, Birmingham, Cardiff and Dublin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Produce up-to-date information for subscribers and research participants through <italic>Research Ethics</italic>, our quarterly Journal, and information sheets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Act as a point of contact for national and international researchers who query whether ethical approval may be appropriate to them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide a voice for the Ethics community, to promote both the value and importance of conducting stringent ethical review and responding to current issues.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1747016112445533">
<title>What are we doing in the future?</title>
<p>We aim to anticipate future developments and provide our members with information and support. Thus, we are currently working with universities to trial a scheme of kitemarking, to provide a ‘light touch’ set of principles to adhere to, but which will be stringent enough to give assurance to the wider community that ethical standards are being maintained. Many university colleagues will be aware that the ethical approvals for research projects involving human participants issued by university research ethics committees (URECs) are questioned by outside bodies on the grounds that URECs do not demonstrably conform or operate according to any set of external standards. The emphasis here is on ‘demonstrably’, since most would measure up to the best national and international standards, but we have no obvious way of showing this to be the case. One of AREC’s major projects, therefore, is to encourage universities to participate in a kitemarking scheme whereby participating universities would sign up to a set of internationally accepted standards and work within a standard operating procedure framework. AREC is pledged to move this proposal forward in the coming year, but we need as many universities as possible to strengthen the common cause.</p>
<p>AREC responds to the needs and requirements of our membership, and offers a variety of membership schemes, from Individual to Corporate. For further information, please contact Jackie Maull (<email>jackiemaull@arec.org.uk</email>).</p>

<title>What could you do?</title>
<list id="list2-1747016112445533" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Sponsor a student to attend a workshop.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Work in partnership with AREC to produce a joint workshop. Are there any burning issues or topics you would like to see addressed? Together, we can plan a regional workshop that caters to your needs and requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Speak! Volunteer to be a speaker at a workshop – whatever your speciality, we can make very good use of your skills and experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Volunteer – AREC is always in need of help, in any form. With an exceptionally small staff, any offers of voluntary assistance, from manning a desk at a workshop to acting as a legal advisor would be very warmly welcomed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Give feedback. The more information we receive from our members, the better service we can offer. So don’t be shy − use the ‘contact us’ page on our website to tell us what <italic>you</italic> want.</p></list-item>
