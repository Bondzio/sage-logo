<abstract>
<p>Angry facial expressions are thought to serve as signals of social correction, indicating that one person disapproves of another’s behavior and wants them to desist. If individuals respond to such signals by inhibiting disapproved-of behaviors, they should effectively reduce the prevalence of angry and aggressive encounters in their lives. Two studies tested this idea by incorporating angry and neutral expressions within a task which measures behavioral-inhibition processes. Consistent with predictions, trait anger was related to response-inhibition processes for angry but not neutral expressions; such that low trait anger individuals exhibited faster response-inhibition processes in the angry context. This effect occurred when participants were explicitly instructed to inhibit behavior in response to facial expressions (Study 1) and when expressions were presented incidentally (Study 2). The findings could not be explained in terms of more general tendencies toward aggression or impulsivity or through perceptual processes.</p>

<body>
<p>Imagine that after you make a suggestion to another person, their facial expression immediately turns angry. Do you withdraw your suggestion or continue advocating for it with full determination? In his social response reversal theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">2004</xref>) argues that this situation reflects an important psychological process underlying individual differences in anger and aggression. According to this theory, angry expressions serve as a signal of social correction, indicating that one person disapproves of another’s behavior and wants them to desist (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611409246">Fridlund, 1994</xref>). If an individual inhibits their behavior in response to such signals, they can preemptively stop the escalation of anger and aggression. By contrast, individuals who are not responsive to these signals may allow minor disagreements to spiral into angry and aggressive conflicts. The purpose of the current investigations is to test a prediction from this theory, namely that trait anger would be related to the speed of response-inhibition processes for angry expressions.</p>
<sec id="section2-1948550611409246">
<title>Past Research on Social Response Reversal Theory</title>
<p>A number of lines of research have provided support for social response reversal theory. Participants consistently report that angry facial expressions communicate a message to, “Back off or I’ll attack!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1948550611409246">Yik &amp; Russell, 1999</xref>) or more general intentions toward hostile dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611409246">Hess, Adams, &amp; Kleck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611409246">Jenkins &amp; Ball, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611409246">Knutson, 1996</xref>). Neurological evidence is also consistent with this theory, in that angry expressions activate the orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409246">Blair, Morris, Frith, Perrett, &amp; Dolan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611409246">Kesler-West et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611409246">Sprengelmeyer, Rausch, Eysel, &amp; Przuntek, 1998</xref>), especially in individuals with little predisposition toward anger and aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409246">Coccaro, McCloskey, Fitzgerald, &amp; Phan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611409246">Dougherty et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, orbitofrontal activity effectively down-regulates amygdala activity and angry affect among such individuals (Coccaro et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611409246">Dougherty et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>More directly relevant to the current investigation is the question of whether individuals varying in trait anger actually differ in their behavioral and psychological response to angry expressions. The results of studies testing these predictions have been less straightforward. Such studies have mostly focused on the prediction that anger-prone individuals are deficient in perceiving signals of social correction. Some studies are consistent with this prediction, showing that anger- and aggression-prone individuals exhibit deficiencies in the perception of angry expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611409246">Best, Williams, &amp; Coccaro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611409246">Blair, &amp; Cipolotti, 2000</xref>). However, other studies have yielded contradictory evidence, indicating that such individuals are actually more accurate in the perception of angry expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611409246">Barth &amp; Bastiani, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The current investigation focused on a later stage of the social response reversal process. Once angry facial expressions have been correctly perceived, individuals may respond to them differently. Angry expressions may prime a response-inhibition goal in low trait anger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611409246">2010a</xref>), allowing them to preemptively avoid the escalation of hostilities.</p>
<p>However, individuals often retaliate aggressively to signal of hostile dominance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611409246">Horowitz et al., 2006</xref>, for a review), and this is especially true for high trait anger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611409246">2010a</xref>). As such, angry expressions may activate a response-execution goal in high trait anger individuals, allowing them to execute aggressive responses. In the current studies, we tested this hypothesis using the stop-signal paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>), which is described next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1948550611409246">
<title>The Stop-Signal Paradigm</title>
<p>People often face conflicts between a planned behavior (e.g., playfully teasing a friend) and signals to inhibit their behavior (e.g., the friend’s angry expression). In such situations, two processes compete to win a psychological race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>). If the “go” process is completed first, the individual will impulsively perform the planned behavior (e.g., teasing). If the “stop” process is completed first, the planned behavior will be successfully inhibited.</p>
<p>The stop-signal paradigm was designed to study these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>). In this paradigm, participants continually perform a “go” task, such as identifying presented stimuli (i.e., the “go-signals”). Occasionally, a “stop-signal” is presented shortly after the go-signal, signaling participants to withhold their planned response. The time for the go process can easily be calculated as the participants' average reaction time (RT) to go-signals on trials not involving a stop-signal. More importantly, the time for the stop process can be determined by varying the delay between go- and stop-signals (i.e., the stop-signal delay). The stop-signal delay at which participants successfully inhibit responses 50% of the time represents the point in time at which the go and stop process complete simultaneously. Given this, participants' stop-signal reaction times (SSRTs) can be calculated by subtracting the critical stop-signal delay time from their average go-signal RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611409246">Figure 1</xref> for a visual illustration).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1948550611409246-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The stop-signal task is ideal for testing predictions from social response reversal theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">Blair, 2004</xref>) for several reasons. First, it is a highly validated and well-understood measure. Response-inhibition deficits have been linked to individual differences in impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611409246">Logan, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</xref>) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611409246">Ooserlaan, Logan, &amp; Sergeant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611409246">Wilcutt, Sonuga-Barke, Nigg, &amp; Sergeant, 2008</xref>, for meta-analytic reviews).</p>
<p>Second, the neurological basis of the response inhibition is well understood. The presentation of stop-signals recruits a broad fronto-basal-ganglia circuit (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611409246">Aron, Robbins, &amp; Poldrack, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>), which overlaps with the circuits involved in social response reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">Blair, 2004</xref>). For example, Brodmann’s area 47 (variously referred to as part of the orbitofrontal cortex or the inferior frontal cortex) is activated by angry expressions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409246">Blair et al., 1999</xref>) and this area is also crucially involved in response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611409246">Aron et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, this paradigm can be used to investigate contextual modifications in the speed of response-inhibition processes. For example, the word “Stop” primes a response-inhibition goal, resulting in faster SSRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>). Conversely, the word “Go” primes a response-execution goal, resulting in slower SSRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on this prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>) and social response reversal theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">2004</xref>), angry facial expressions were expected to prime a response-inhibition goal in low trait anger individuals. After all, response inhibition could effectively diffuse escalating hostilities and preserve social harmony. By contrast, angry expressions were expected to prime motivations toward revenge and response execution in high trait anger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2010a</xref>), thus undermining effective response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>). Two studies were conducted to test these predictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1948550611409246">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, participants completed a stop-signal task in which angry and neutral expressions served as stop-signals within different blocks. They also completed a well-validated measure of trait anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611409246">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>). It was predicted that trait anger would be related to the speed of response-inhibition processes for angry but not neutral expression stop-signals.</p>
<p>Study 1 was also designed to address issues of discriminate validity. Past research has found that individuals high in impulsivity exhibit longer SSRTs within the traditional stop-signal paradigm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611409246">Logan et al., 1997</xref>). High levels of impulsivity reflect broad, situation-independent tendencies toward disinhibition (e.g., in aggressive contexts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt, Talley, Benjamin, &amp; Valentine, 2006</xref>, as well as other self-regulatory domains such as disordered eating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611409246">Robinson, Pearce, Engel, &amp; Wunderlich, 2009</xref>). Based on this, it was predicted that impulsivity would be related to longer SSRTs for both angry and neutral expression stop-signals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">Blair (2004)</xref> has argued that social response reversal should only have relevance to trait anger and reactive forms of aggression (i.e., anger-related aggression in response to provocations). Social response reversal processes are simply not relevant to other forms of aggression, such as the proactive use of aggression to achieve one’s goals. Thus, a broader measure of physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611409246">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>) was also administered in Study 1. Because physical aggression captures impulsive as well as nonimpulsive forms of aggression which manifest across different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt et al., 2006</xref>), it was predicted that physical aggression would be unrelated to SSRTs for either angry or neutral expressions.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611409246">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>The angry and neutral facial expressions of three male and three female actors were selected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611409246">Ekman and Friesen’s (1976)</xref> highly validated stimulus set for use in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550611409246">
<title>Stop-Signal Task</title>
<p>Participants arrived at the laboratory, provided informed consent, and began the stop-signal task. They were told that their primary task was to press the left arrow key whenever the letter A or B was presented on screen and to press the right arrow key whenever the letter C or D was presented on screen. Both speed and accuracy were emphasized in the performance of this task.</p>
<p>Go-stimulus letters were followed by the presentation of either an angry facial expression, a neutral expression, or no expression whatsoever. Within two blocks of the task, participants were instructed to withhold their responses whenever an angry expression appeared. Within two other blocks, participants were instructed to withhold their response whenever a neutral expression appeared. In accordance with recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>), participants were explicitly instructed that it would be impossible to withhold their response on many trials and that they should not wait for facial expressions before responding.</p>
<p>The stop-signal delay was initially set at 500 ms. In order to locate the stop-signal delay at which participants could successfully inhibit their responses 50% of the time, the stop-signal delay was increased by 50 ms following successful inhibition and decreased by 50 ms following failed inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611409246">Logan et al., 1997</xref>). Stop-signal delays were separately altered for angry and neutral stop-signals. Invalid-stop-signals (i.e., the expression not serving as a stop-signal within a particular block) were presented following the same delay as valid-stop-signals, but the stop-signal delay was not altered on the basis of invalid-stop-signal trials.</p>
<p>Participants had 1,500 milliseconds following the presentation of the letter to respond. Following each trial, there was a 1,000 ms delay till the next trial began. Error messages were presented for this duration if the participants committed an omission, commission, or incorrect-response error (i.e., “Didn’t Respond,” “Should Have Stopped,” or “Wrong Button”). There were 72 trials in each block, evenly divided between the presentation of angry expressions, neutral expressions, and no expression at all. Block type order and trial type order within each block were randomly generated by the computer program for each participant.</p>
<p>In order to correct for slight across-participant differences in inhibition rates, a variant of the integration method was used to calculate SSRTs. Each participant’s mean stop-signal delay was subtracted from the <italic>n</italic>th RT in their rank-ordered RT distribution, with <italic>n</italic> determined by multiplying a participant’s response rate on stop-signal trials by the number of correct go-signal RTs (involving the presentation of no facial expression) in their RT distribution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>, for evidence supporting the validity of this SSRT calculation method).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550611409246">
<title>Personality Assessment</title>
<p>Following the stop-signal task, participants completed the trait anger and physical aggression subscales of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611409246">Buss and Perry’s (1992)</xref> Aggression Questionnaire. The trait anger subscale contains seven statements (e.g., “Some of my friends think I’m a hothead.”) indicative of tendencies toward angry emotions. The physical aggression scale contains nine statements (e.g., “I get into fights a little more than the average person”) indicative of tendencies toward physically aggressive behaviors. Participants indicate how well each statement characterizes them using a 1 (definitely inaccurate) to 5 (definitely accurate) response scale.</p>
<p>These scales have exhibited excellent convergent, discriminate, and criterion-related validity and test–retest reliability in past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611409246">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>). For example, they load on to separate but related factors of anger and aggression in psychometric research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611409246">Martin, Watson, &amp; Wan, 2000</xref>). The trait anger scale predicts self-reported and physiological indices of the angry response to provocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611409246">Smith, Glazer, Ruiz, &amp; Gallo, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the trait anger scale predicts aggressive behavior only when an individual is provoked, but the physical aggression scale predicts aggressive behavior across provoked and nonprovoked contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, trait anger displays a considerable overlap with the construct of reactive aggression, while physical aggression represents more generalized tendencies toward aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>). These scales were internally reliable in Study 1 (trait anger α = .77; physical aggression α = .85).</p>
<p>Because generalized response-inhibition deficiencies in the stop-signal paradigm have previously been linked to impulsivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611409246">Logan et al., 1997</xref>), Study 1 participants also completed the core narrow impulsivity items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611409246">Eysenck and Eysenck’s (1977)</xref> scale. Participants indicate how well 13 items (e.g., “Do you generally do and say things without stopping to think?”) characterize themselves used a 1 (absolutely not true of me) to 4 (absolutely true of me) response scale. This scale predicts impulsive aggression when provoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt et al., 2006</xref>), as well as other self-control deficits (e.g., disordered eating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611409246">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>). It proved to be internally reliable in the current study (α = .81).</p>

<title>Trait Anger Analyses</title>
<p>The SSRTs were analyzed with the general linear model (GLM). The GLM is a more general form of the traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) which can accommodate continuous-between subject variables.

<title>Discriminate Validity Analysis</title>
<p>Parallel GLM analyses of SSRTs focusing on physical aggression and impulsivity yielded evidence of discriminate validity. The analysis focused on physical aggression yielded no significant effects whatsoever, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .14. This is consistent with the idea that social response reversal processes are specifically linked to trait anger and reactive aggression, and not to physical aggression broadly considered.</p>
<p>The analysis focused on impulsivity yielded only an impulsivity main effect, <italic>F</italic>(1, 77) = 10.61, <italic>p</italic> = .002. Individuals high in impulsivity exhibited longer SSRTs (<italic>M</italic> = 291 ms) than individuals low in impulsivity (<italic>M</italic> = 263 ms). Unlike the trait anger-related findings, this effect was not qualified by block type, <italic>p</italic> = .26. Such results are consistent with the idea that impulsivity reflects broad and situation-independent tendencies toward disinhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 1 yielded evidence consistent with social response reversal theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair, 2003</xref>). Trait anger was related to the speed of response-inhibition processes when angry expressions were used as stop-signals, but it was unrelated to the speed of response-inhibition processes for neutral expressions. This pattern could not be explained in terms of broader tendencies toward aggression or impulsivity as these measures yielded different patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1948550611409246">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 2 was designed to conceptually replicate the trait anger-related findings of Study 1 under more realistic conditions. In everyday life, there is no explicit requirement to inhibit responses when others display an angry expression. Thus, angry and neutral expressions were incidentally presented as prime stimuli prior to each trial of a standard stop-signal task. It was predicted that trait anger would be related to the speed of response-inhibition processes following angry but not neutral expression primes.</p>
<p>A further goal of Study 2 was to determine if the Study 1 findings could be explained in terms of perceptual deficits. To provide a separate index of perceptual abilities, Study 2 participants were asked to overtly categorize the prime angry and neutral facial expressions. It was predicted that trait anger would be unrelated to the ability to perceive angry expressions, suggesting that any pattern obtained with SSRTs is located within an inhibitory rather than a perceptual phase of processing.</p>

<sec id="section18-1948550611409246">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 54 undergraduate psychology students (39 female; 15 male; <italic>M</italic> age = 19.9) from the University of Wyoming participated in exchange for course credit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1948550611409246">
<title>Stop-Signal Task, Study 2</title>
<p>The stop-signal task used in Study 2 was similar to that used in Study 1, with the following variations: Each trial began with the presentation of a facial expression. Participants indicated whether the face displayed an angry or neutral expression as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing the left or right arrow key. Response mappings were counterbalanced across participants (i.e., left = angry for some; right = angry for others). A 1,000 ms error message followed all incorrect responses, and participants were asked to recategorize the expression correctly. This design feature ensured that participants correctly perceived the expression before proceeding to the stop-signal task.</p>
<p>A 1,000 ms delay intervened between all correct face categorizations and the stop-signal task trial. The stop-signal consisted of the letter <italic>X</italic>, and it initially appeared following a stop-signal delay of 250 ms. Stop-signal delays were separately altered on a trial-by-trial basis for angry and neutral primes. Participants completed 256 trials, evenly distributed between angry and neutral primes. The stop-signal was presented on 25% of trials, evenly divided between the two prime types.</p>

<sec id="section20-1948550611409246">
<title>Personality Assessment</title>
<p>To ensure generalizability, a different measure of trait anger was administered in Study 2. Participants completed the trait anger subscale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611409246">Spielberger’s (1988)</xref> State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. In this scale, participants indicate how frequently 10 statements (e.g., “I fly off the handle.”) describe them, using a 1 (Rarely or Never) to 4 (Frequently) response scale. This scale predicts increases in self-reported state anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611409246">Deffenbacher, 1992</xref>), cardiovascular arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611409246">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), and behavioral aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt et al., 2006</xref>) following provocation. It also exhibits adequate test–retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611409246">Deffenbacher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611409246">Spielberger, 1988</xref>).

<title>Results</title>
<p>Study 2 SSRTs were analyzed in a GLM analysis, with prime type (angry vs. Neutral) entered as a discrete within-subject factor and trait anger entered as a continuous between-subject factor. Gender was dropped from the design because it yielded no significant effects in a preliminary analysis. The analysis yielded only the predicted trait anger by prime type interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 53) = 6.19, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .10, a medium effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611409246">Cohen, 1987</xref>). All other effects did not reach significance, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .15. The estimated SSRTs for participants high (i.e., 1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) and low (i.e., 1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409246">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>) are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611409246">Figure 2</xref> (bottom panel). Consistent with hypotheses, trait anger was significantly related to participants' SSRTs following angry expression primes, β = .26, <italic>p</italic> = .026 (one-tailed). While there was a trend toward a similar positive correlation following neutral expression primes, this trend did not reach significance, β = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .31 (one-tailed). Thus, trait anger was only reliably related to the speed of response-inhibition processes following angry expression primes.</p>
<p>Parallel analyses of all other dependent measures obtained from the stop-signal task (i.e., go-signal RTs; omission, commission, and incorrect response errors) yielded no significant trait anger by prime type interactions, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10. Importantly, this was also true for two measures obtained from the face perception task; face categorization RTs: <italic>F</italic>(1, 53) = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> = .22; face categorization errors; <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. Thus, the predicted interaction could not be explained in terms of participants' perceptual abilities or any other measure obtained from the stop-signal task.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<sec id="section23-1948550611409246">
<title>Summary of Results</title>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair’s (2003)</xref> social response reversal theory, it was predicted that trait anger would be related to the speed of response-inhibition processes for angry but not neutral facial expressions. The results of two studies provided converging support for this prediction. In Study 1, participants completed a stop-signal task in which angry and neutral expressions served as stop-signals. In Study 2, angry and neutral expressions were incidentally presented as prime stimuli prior to each trial of a standard stop-signal task. Despite these variations, results were consistent. Trait anger was related to slower SSRTs for angry but not neutral expressions. The results of Study 2 also indicated that this effect was not due to perceptual deficits as trait anger was unrelated to the speed or accuracy with which participants categorized facial expressions. Thus, these effects appear to be located within an inhibitory stage of processing rather than a perceptual stage.</p>

<sec id="section24-1948550611409246">
<title>Alternative Explanations of the Findings</title>
<p>The current studies yielded evidence consistent with social response reversal theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">Blair, 2004</xref>), indicating that trait anger was related to the speed of response-inhibition processes for angry but not neutral expressions. However, one may reasonably ask if there are alternative explanations for the results. For example, could the findings be due to trait anger’s correlation with some other dimensions of personality? Study 1 found that more general tendencies toward impulsivity or physical aggression did not yield the same pattern as trait anger. Thus, initial results support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409246">Blair’s (2004)</xref> contention that social response reversal processes are specifically linked with trait anger and reactive aggression. Future studies should continue the examination of discriminant validity in relation to other dimensions of personality.</p>
<p>One may also ask if trait anger is linked with response inhibition for a wider array of stimuli than just angry expressions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair’s (2003)</xref> theory, trait anger should be linked to response inhibition for any signal of social correction, including angry expressions as well as other signals of social disapproval. For expressions which serve different functions, however, this same pattern should not emerge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409246">Blair (2003)</xref> has specifically contended that fearful and sad expressions function as unconditioned negative reinforcers of behavior, while happy expressions serve as unconditioned positive reinforcers. These facial expressions should therefore not affect response-inhibition processes but should instead alter the frequency of behaviors. While this initial investigation was not designed to test these more nuanced predictions of Blair’s theory, future research should seek to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, one may ask if other psychological processes besides response inhibition are responsible for the current results. For example, one may suggest that high trait anger individuals experienced greater emotional arousal in response to angry expressions, and this arousal interfered with response inhibition (e.g., by distracting them from the response inhibition task; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; DeHouwer, 2007</xref>). However, research indicates that high trait anger individuals do not exhibit immediate elevations in emotional arousal in response to unambiguously hostile stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2007</xref>). Instead, they exhibit prolonged emotional arousal in response to such stimuli, suggesting that emotion regulation processes are responsible for the production of differential arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611409246">2008</xref>). Thus, existing research suggests that response inhibition may be a plausible explanation for individual differences in angry arousal rather than vice versa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1948550611409246">
<title>Response Inhibition, ADHD, and Aggression</title>
<p>By now, a large literature demonstrates that individuals with ADHD exhibit impaired response-inhibition abilities in the stop-signal paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611409246">Ooserlaan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611409246">Wilcutt et al., 2008</xref>, for meta-analytic reviews). Given that ADHD is highly comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611409246">Connor, Steeber, &amp; McBurnett, 2010</xref>), studies have also naturally investigated the relationship between response-inhibition abilities and ODD/CD as well. These studies have been wildly inconsistent, with even different meta-analyses coming to different conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611409246">Ooserlaan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611409246">Wilcutt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The current studies suggest that two factors must be taken into consideration to solve this quandary. First, ODD and CD are widely regarded as heterogeneous disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611409246">Dodge, Lochman, Harnish, Bates, &amp; Pettit, 1997</xref>), consisting of substance abuse proclivities, reactive aggression, proactive aggression, and other forms of antisocial behavior. Thus, the first suggestion from the current studies is that anger and reactive aggression may represent a more specific aspect of personality and psychopathology directly relevant to response inhibition. After all, failures to contain one’s angry impulses are a hallmark characteristic of reactive aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611409246">Dodge et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond this, the current studies also suggest that the context in which response-inhibition is performed is crucially important. Individuals do not act within a vacuum. They have goals which interact dynamically with the social context they encounter. Thus, individuals may mobilize the cognitive resources needed for response inhibition when it serves their goals, and they may allow these same resources to lay dormant when they have little motivation to contain inappropriate responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611409246">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>). The current results suggest that low trait anger individuals mobilize these resources when they encounter angry expressions; while high trait anger individuals allow these resources to lie dormant under the same circumstances. Future research should expand upon this basic insight in order to understand the relationship between response inhibition and more clinically significant levels of antisocial behavior.</p>

<sec id="section26-1948550611409246">
<title>The Consequences of Social Response Reversal</title>
<p>Beyond their theoretical implications, we believe that the current results have important social consequences. For example, the current studies outline a psychological process that should prove useful in averting hostile social encounters. Research indicates that hostile social encounters typically escalate gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611409246">Anderson, Buckley, &amp; Carnegey, 2008</xref>). An angry facial expression leads to a rude comment. This in turn leads to an overt insult, ultimately spiraling into an intense argument and even physical aggression.</p>
<p>People high in trait anger readily feed into this escalating cycle of hostilities. They interpret ambiguous provocations in a hostile fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611409246">Epps &amp; Kendall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2010b</xref>). They ruminate upon these provocations for prolonged periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611409246">Gerin, Davidson, Christenfeld, Goyal, &amp; Schwartz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611409246">Sukhodolsky, Golub, &amp; Cromwell, 2001</xref>). They become highly angry (Deffenbacher, 1992), motivated by revenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611409246">Harmon-Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611409246">Troop-Gordon &amp; Asher, 2005</xref>), and aggressive in their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409246">Bettencourt et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, their aggressive behaviors provoke their adversaries into heightened aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611409246">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>), thus further escalating the cycle of hostilities.</p>
<p>In contrast to this, the current studies focus on a process by which low trait anger individuals may actively diffuse escalating cycles of hostility. If these individuals inhibit disapproved-of behaviors early in this sequence (e.g., when only nonverbal expressions of anger have been displayed), they may short-circuit this process before it begins. Instead of leading to insults and aggression, angry expressions may result in a subtle and almost undetectable shift in behavior which preserves social harmony (e.g., from teasing to magnanimous joking). Future research should seek to more definitively test this idea. If confirmed, it would prove to be a vital process by which individuals actively create a <italic>nonhostile</italic> environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611409246">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611409246">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>).</p>
