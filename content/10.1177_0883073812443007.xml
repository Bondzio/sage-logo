<p>This is the sixth edition of what is already established as the definitive reference for neurological examination. Maintaining the voice and character of the first edition, which was published in 1994, the authors revitalized and updated the text in order to reach a new generation of budding neurologists.</p>
<p>The structure and layout of this edition are well crafted and specifically tailored for easy interpretation. This is clearly evident in the multiple modalities used to reach readers. The authors use many strategies to connect with many different learning styles, including case presentations, flow charts, colorful images, mnemonics, structured outlines, and many others. For those of us who are just learning to hone our examination techniques, being able to refer to a variety of materials facilitates easy learning. The colorful cartoon images selected are easy to interpret even for the most novice of readers, and the photo montages allow the reader to view real-world examples of both common and uncommon neurological conditions. The radiographic images are appropriately selected and illustrate the intended point.</p>
<p>Throughout the text the authors carry a conversational and sometimes even humorous tone, which provides the reader with the sense that the instructor is actually in the room teaching. This is furthered with the use of self-study questions in the form of fill in the blank, multiple choice, and short essay answer. This allows readers to assess their own mastery of the material and identify certain areas in which improvement is needed.</p>
<p>Although the book overall is well structured, it is not specifically tailored for a quick reference guide, and thus a fledgling neurology student may become lost in the details. The chapters are sometimes broken down into topics that perhaps could be grouped as one. For example, the three chapters on vision and ocular motor systems could be condensed perhaps into one larger chapter. The authors provide a very useful outline of the standard neurological examination for easy reference in the beginning of the book, but these pages could be even more beneficial if they were perforated and therefore able to be carried into the clinic setting.</p>
<p>I used this book throughout my third year of medical school to improve my neurological examination skills, and it has helped me tremendously. The authors have paid an homage to Dr DeMyer with this edition, and I can only imagine he would be proud.</p>
