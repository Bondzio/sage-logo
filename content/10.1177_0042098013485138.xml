<p><italic>Locating Migration: Rescaling Cities and Migrants</italic>, edited by Nina Glick Schiller and Ayşe Çağlar, is an elegant volume of essays exploring the interaction between migration and the construction of urban spaces. This collective work brings two disparate fields into a long overdue and very important conversation: it brings together the study of international migration with the study of cities and the processes through which they are reimagined, restructured and repositioned in the global economy. Out of this conversation emerges a central concern with the ways that migrants participate in the construction of the economic and political life of the cities in which they live and to which they remain connected. The pieces in this volume show convincingly that a robust understanding of international migration requires a consideration of the different pathways to integration that migrants carve out in the specific cities in which they settle.</p>
<p>In its exploration of the interaction between migration and the life of cities, <italic>Locating Migration</italic> moves beyond the established theoretical practice in the fields of urban planning and migration studies of considering cities simply as a backdrop; the aspiration of the book is to move forcefully “beyond the general understanding of the ‘city as context’” (p. 3). To do this, the editors and the contributors to the volume draw on the concept of ‘city scale’. The working definition given for ‘city scale’ presents it as the relative position of a city in a field of power, both global and local in making, and shaped by current and historical flows of political, cultural and economic capital. As Glick Schiller and Çağlar specify, cities are upscaled or downscaled depending on the kinds of access to global resources (p. 191). ‘City scale’ is offered as a notion that attempts at once to capture the socio-spatial unit of a geographically specific city, while at the same time reflecting the differences between a ‘global’ city like New York or Paris and ‘downscaled’ cities with fewer global connections like Manchester, New Hampshire and Halle, Germany—all cities considered in this volume. Even as the editors and most of the contributors rely heavily on the concept of the city scale in their pieces, the volume does not shy away from the controversy around the usefulness of this term. The volume, to its credit, even includes an essay by Michael Samers questioning the usefulness of ‘city scale’, critiquing it as poorly defined and as sidestepping helpful, and established, theories of labour market incorporation for workers, immigrant and non-immigrant alike.</p>
<p>Within the framework of scalar positioning of cities, albeit contested, one of the major ambitions of this volume is to demonstrate that migrants are important actors in the creation of city scale. This is arguably the book’s most powerful contribution.</p>
<p>In both theoretical and empirical pieces, the volume reclaims the agency of migrants in shaping the economic and political trajectories of the cities in which they live. The argument presented is that immigrants spur change far beyond the ethnic enclaves that are a preferred subject of migration studies research. They transform local industries and the density of their global connections; they reshape local labour markets, altering the institutions and the power relations that govern them; they renew and change the cultural practices in a given city and, in so doing, often expand the cultural boundaries of the city itself. The essays in this volume also caution that the politics of migrant agency are often complex, conflicted and historically and spatially contingent. In certain cases, migrant strategies for labour market incorporation strengthen neoliberal economic dynamics, whereas in other cases, sometimes in the same cities, migrant efforts directly challenge increasingly unequal distribution of economic and political resources. Taken as a whole, the pieces in <italic>Locating Migration</italic> make the forceful argument that, when migration is considered exclusively through an ethnic lens, the nuance, diversity and specificity of migrant agency is lost, clouded by a haze of debates about ethnic identity and social capital and a neglect of the relationships that stretch beyond co-ethnic ties.</p>
<p>Organisationally, the book is divided into two sections. The first section presents three essays that address the theoretical debates around the concept of ‘city scale’ and consider how to incorporate migrants into analyses that adopt this framework. Essays by Neil Brenner, Michael Samers and Nina Glick Schiller and Ayşe Çağlar comprise this section. True to their mission, the essays in this section engage with analytical optics and less or not at all with empirics. The second section of the book offers a series of case studies of migrants and migration in particular city spaces, and the pieces in this section resonate nicely with one another. Caroline Brettell, for example, offers a description of Indian migrants in the Dallas Fort Worth metropolitan area and their efforts to encourage highly skilled co-ethnics to move to the city to take position in the booming IT sector, and the themes of this pieces are echoed in Judith Goode’s essay on immigration to Philadelphia and its articulation with the high-end medical services sector. Goode’s essay also discusses how migration to Philadelphia is bifurcated, with migrants incorporated on the one hand into high-value-added knowledge sectors and the low-wage service industry that supports these highly skilled workers on the other. The ways in which the incorporation of migrants into low-wage, or falling-wage, work offer migrants different and often constricted avenues for shaping city spaces are taken up in Ruba Salih and Bruno Riccio’s piece on migrant workers in Emilia Romagna (ch. 7) and in Nina Glick Schiller and Ayşe Çağlar’s piece on Manchester and Halle (ch. 10). These two chapters point to the ways that migrants are fostering new forms of global connectivity through their participation in local labour markets, a theme also taken up in Rijk van Dijk’s piece on Ghanaian migrants in the Netherlands (ch. 6), Monika Salzbrunn’s chapter on Senegalese migrants in Paris and New York (ch. 9) and Bela Feldman-Bianco’s chapter on the Portuguese in New Bedford (ch. 11). In these latter three chapters, the emphasis lies on the cultural connectivity migrants’ forge and its impact on ancillary economic and political relationships.</p>
<p>The theoretical section of the book is detailed and the empirical portion is quite rich. Moreover, the essays in the second half strive to engage with the debate laid out in the first half. Nevertheless, there is clear disconnect between the two sections of the book. This dissonance is jarring and seems to be more serious than one that grows out of a difference in foci. The source of this disconnect, in my view, is this: while the empirical chapters convincingly demonstrate that migrants do in fact make city scale and while they show that migrants do transform political and economic flows of power and resources that determine a city’s scalar position, they do not consistently or fully explain how. The processes by which migrants actually author scale change, in an incremental and ongoing way, are elided in descriptions that focus more directly on outcomes. Without a more ample consideration of process, these pieces are hamstrung in their attempt to connect—and indeed to support or contest—the arguments presented in the book’s first portion. And without empirical grounding, the theoretical debates discussed in the volume feel somewhat unmoored and even begin to display some of the same traits—namely, a lack of definition and a divorce from real-world dynamic—that the articles offer up as critiques of current literature on the scalar position of cities.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, it is most appropriate to view this volume as a call to arms. In that role, it is at its most compelling. Its exhortation to give the agency that migrants exercise in shaping the cities in which they live its full due and to consider the ways migrants amend the physical expression of urban space and the positioning of local cities in global flows of power and resources in any analysis of city spaces is both significant and forceful. Migrants make the cities in which we all live and <italic>Locating Migration</italic> provides a strong foundation from which to investigate how.</p>
