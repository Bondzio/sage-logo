The research involved a comprehensive literature review and case studies of nine English schools. The results show that four themes emerged in relation to high performing teams: the need to create and sustain a team ethos, the need for clarity, for flexibility, and the value placed on the experience of team members. The study found that these teams had not been involved in training aimed at working as a team, challenging the previous literature which highlights the importance of such training. The article concludes by offering suggestions for further research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>leadership</kwd><kwd>recruitment</kwd><kwd>senior leadership teams</kwd><kwd>skills</kwd><kwd>teams</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><disp-quote><p>Skill: the ability to do something well, usually as a result of experience and training </p><p>Attitude: someone’s opinions or feelingsabout something, especially as shown by their behaviour.

Without it, groups perform as individuals; with it, they become a powerful unit of collective performance. The best teams invest a tremendous amount of time shaping a purpose that they can own. The best teams also translate their purpose into specific performance goals. And members of successful teams pitch in and become accountable with and to their teammates. The fundamental distinction between teams and other forms of working groups turns on <italic>performance</italic>. A working group relies on the individual contributions of its members for group <italic>performance</italic>. But a team strives for something greater than its members could achieve individually. In short, an effective team is always worth more than the sum of its parts.</p></disp-quote><p>This sums up what it is that separates teams from groups of people, and what it is about teams that makes them so valuable to schools: a team is more than the sum of its parts; a team can accomplish more, precisely as a team, than can the individual members on their own. This is borne out in research carried out by Leithwood and Mascall, which found that the effect of leadership in the schools studied explained a much higher proportion of variation in student achievement than is usually recorded for the effects of the leadership of individual head teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212468350">Leithwood and Mascall 2008</xref>; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212468350">Leithwood et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468350">Day et al. (2009</xref>) found that the quality of leadership at school level accounted for more direct success in meeting challenges than did policy innovations. This was the case due to the values, aspirations, qualities and decision making capabilities of leaders.</p><p>The teams being investigated in this project were leadership teams; within all of them, leadership was distributed among the members in various ways. The value of distributed leadership is well rehearsed in the literature, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212468350">Harris, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212468350">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212468350">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212468350">Pont et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212468350">National College, 2009</xref>), although, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468350">Spillane et al. (2004</xref>) point out, there is still little knowledge of the processes at work in leadership, and that an understanding of how groups go about leadership is essential. There is no one, agreed, definition of distributed leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468350">Mayrowetz, 2008</xref>); it may be that the term is a new way of describing an older phenomenon, leadership which is shared, or collegial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212468350">Harris and Spillane, 2008</xref>). However, in a review of the literature surrounding distributed leadership, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212468350">Bennett et al. (2003</xref>) summarized three elements which are to be found in the concept of distributed leadership: firstly, that it is an inherent property of a group of individuals acting together, producing more than they might just by concerted, individual action; second, that those involved have an open concept to the boundaries of leadership; and third, that expertise is widely shared among the group. An indepth discussion of distributed leadership is outside the remit of this article; for our purposes, we will adopt the definition that distributed leadership is about leadership practice, about interactions among individuals within an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212468350">Spillane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212468350">Harris and Spillane, 2008</xref>). This entails a view that ‘de-centres’ the central actor, and calls on researchers to take a wider view of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212468350">Mayrowetz, 2008</xref>: 426); it focuses attention not on the leaders themselves, but rather on what they do, (and how it is done) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468350">Spillane et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>If the distribution of leadership is to be effective, the working relationships between team members, which are based on the ethos of the team, must be based on a shared foundation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212468350">Jackson and Madsen (2005</xref>) comment on the ‘unique social dimension’ of leadership which enhances the economic and administrative aspects of work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55a-1741143212468350">Wing (2005)</xref> also highlights the value of ‘shared philosophies’ among team members, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40a-1741143212468350">Mulford and Silins (2011)</xref> point out that leadership (specifically as vested in the head teacher or principal) is an ‘interactive, reciprocal and evolving process’, which involves many people, and is reciprocally influenced by the context in which it occurs. </p><p>Shared values among school team members are not a given, except at the most basic level; one can assume a general valuing of education, for example. Schools are highly complex places, which require leadership teams to function from the base of a sophisticated and shared value system; this value system may arise out of conflict (a subject to which we will return). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212468350">Gu et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrate that such shared values have a positive effect on pupil attainment, that is, they help the school team to accomplish its goal of supporting students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468350">Day et al. (2009</xref>: 194) found that while policy is important, what sustained positive change in schools was ‘the vision, values, qualities … indeed the moral purpose of individual leaders’; this was found to be the case, as well, in a study of schools facing challenging circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212468350">Harris, 2002b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212468350">Cawelti (2000</xref>) found the same sharing of values among team members in turnaround schools in the USA, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212468350">Jenewien and Morhart (2008)</xref> report a similar finding for successful America’s Cup teams.

Team members also need to be aware of what the others are doing, and will do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212468350">Cranston and Ehrich 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212468350">Wageman et al., 2008</xref>), highlighting the need for agreed structures within the team.</p><p>Shared values do not arise out of nothing, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468350">Wallace (2002</xref>) emphasises the importance of interpersonal relationships within teams, including shared purpose and core values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212468350">Earley and Weindling (2004</xref>) add that the ability to trust and support each other is important and SLT members should have the opportunity to speak their minds, and to express contrary views, but still work well as a team.</p><p>The literature supports the idea that this shared team ethos and working rests on a foundation of shared training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212468350">Katzenbach and Smith 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468350">Thomas and Collier 2002</xref>). Training tends to have a positive effect on performance, both directly (in the form of new skills) and indirectly in the form of outcomes such as empowerment, communication, and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212468350">Dvir et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468350">Thomas and Collier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212468350">Arthur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212468350">Aguinis and Kraiger, 2009</xref>). This training would support not only skills, but the development of the group ethos mentioned above. The ethos of the individual team members, supported by this training, combine to form the shared ethos of the team, which in turn supports the team’s success. </p><p>Finally, the concept of effective leadership is not without its own issues. There is no one way of being an effective leader; however, research has identified common elements of effective leadership, including sensitivity to local and national requirements, appropriately distributed leadership, and trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468350">Day et al., 2009</xref>). Measuring effective leadership is a difficult task, and depends on the paradigm within which that effectiveness is measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468350">Wallace, 2002</xref>), and what is being measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212468350">Gorard, 2010</xref>). Raw student outcomes may be useful measures, but these are of course affected by the population from which the students arrive at the school; contextual information (such as contextual added value scores) can give a more nuanced picture, but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212468350">Gorard (2010</xref>) argues, these are still open to error. No one, single measure can be said to lead to a true description of effectiveness; for the purposes of the study reported here, the Ofsted grading of ‘Outstanding’ has been used to define the population from which the sample will be taken. Ofsted grades schools on a wide ranging assortment of standards, such as the educational standards achieved by students, the quality of leadership and management, the development of pupils in non-academic areas and the contribution the school makes to the wellbeing of students and the communities in which they live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212468350">Ofsted, 2009</xref>). No judgements were made by the research team in relation to this status of ‘outstanding’.</p><p>Taken together, the literature provides a picture of teams in which leadership is distributed to members who are able to rely on each other through a shared ethos, who are aware of the work done by others, who have grown into this form of team through training and who are led by someone who provides the links between them and holds the team together.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1741143212468350" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>This article is based on research about establishing and developing high performing leadership teams, undertaken for the National College. The project related to high performing leadership teams in English primary, secondary and special schools. The research addressed the factors associated with high performance (defined through the Ofsted award of ‘outstanding’ in relation to leadership and management) in leadership teams. The literature review for the project was completed in the Autumn term, 2009, while all the field work was undertaken in the Spring term, 2010.</p><p>The research is underpinned by six research questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What factors are important in recruiting individuals for high performing leadership teams?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What factors facilitate the establishment and development of high performing leadership teams?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What factors are important in maintaining a high level of effectiveness in the performance of senior leadership teams?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the characteristics, strategies, and approaches which are critical to the effective leadership of high performing teams?

Four themes will be explored: the creation of an ethos for the team, the need for clarity, the need for flexibility, and the value of continuity.</p><p>This project comprises two interlinked phases. The first was a comprehensive literature review, the main findings of which are interspersed here as required. The second phase, on which this article primarily rests, was qualitative, and involved a small research team working with a sample of nine schools. The research takes place within the framework of grounded theory, which seeks to find theory from examination of the real life experiences of respondents; originally a rejection of the ‘extreme positivism’ of much social science research, grounded theory was proposed by Glaser and Strauss in the late 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212468350">Suddaby 2006</xref>: 633). Grounded theory is concerned with interpretation; theory arises from, and is situated within, the data collected, in a continual interplay between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212468350">Urquhart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212468350">Raduescu and Vessey, 2011</xref>).</p><p>This framework is particularly suited to complex issues, such as those which occur between members of teams. This framework necessitates the use of qualitative tools of data analysis, and also of theoretical sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212468350">Glaser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212468350">Holloway and Todres, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212468350">Lingard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The sample schools were selected in conjunction with the National College. The population for the research was deemed to be all schools who had received overall Ofsted judgements of ‘outstanding’ in the academic year 2008/9, working from the basis that staff within such schools would demonstrate, and be able to articulate, the elements which contributed to their success. From that population, a large sample was selected, of all those schools who had received outstanding judgements for leadership and management. From this, the research team, in conjunction with the National College, chose a smaller sample of nine schools: two special schools, three primary schools and four secondary schools, to cover all phases of compulsory schooling. Schools were chosen to provide a wide range of contexts in terms of socio-economic status (SES) of the school community, types of school and, to some extent, geographic distribution. The team also sought to avoid schools which had already been highly researched. The case study schools will be identified by letters throughout. Research with each school was conducted as a separate case study.</p><sec id="section3-1741143212468350"><title>Case Study Schools</title><p>School R is a special school for students with complex needs and moderate learning difficulties, with 136 students from 11 to 19 years of age; the school has both a senior leadership team and a senior management team. The leadership team consists of six members who operate on a strategic level, while the management team has only four members and has an operational focus. School G is a federation of two schools, for pupils with severe learning difficulties; there are 100 pupils. The school has an executive head and two heads of school; its leadership team is composed of longstanding members, who have been with the federation through a period of change. The leadership team considered here is that of the federation, overall.</p><p>The primary schools are School L, which is in a soft federation with another primary school, and has 236 pupils. The head of School L is also the executive head of the federation; the school has both a senior leadership team and a senior management team; the teams considered here are those of School L, not the federation overall. As with School R, the management team consists of four staff and has an operational remit, while the leadership team of three has a strategic outlook. School M is a small Church of England infant school, with 72 pupils. The school’s leadership team does not have regular meetings; it meets on average once a month. School N is a large primary school with 389 pupils; again, the leadership team does not meet regularly; it meets ‘as and when necessary’ (head, School N).</p><p>The secondary schools are School P, which is a large Catholic school, with 1678 pupils, School S, another large comprehensive school with 1000 pupils plus 360 pupils in a joint sixth form with two other schools. School B is a smaller secondary school, with 672 pupils; unusually for a school judged outstanding by Ofsted, School B was also designated a national challenge school in September 2008. There are six members of the SLT team, which meets every morning and then twice weekly for a longer meeting. School Y is a large secondary school with 1596 pupils; its SLT is large, with 10 standing members and two associate members. This team meets twice weekly, and then twice a term has a longer, off-site meeting which deals with strategic issues.</p><p>The case study work undertaken by the team consisted of a visit to the school, lasting from one to three days. During these visits, individual, semistructured interviews were undertaken with at least six members of the SLT (assuming there were so many), plus a selection of other members of staff. The interview schedule was developed around the six questions listed above. Through examination of the nine case studies, a series of themes have arisen that relate to the important points in creating high performing senior leadership teams. The four themes to emerge from this analysis are the ethos of the school (and hence the team), the need for clarity, continuity, and the need for flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1741143212468350"><title>Ethos of the Team</title><p>The first theme, which emerged from the data more strongly than any other, is the importance placed on ethos by the high performing teams in the study, and especially by the head teachers.</p><p>In this sense, ‘ethos’ has a dual, or more accurately, a multivalent meaning. In the first instance, it relates to the ethos of the school. The concept takes in more than just the atmosphere of the school, and goes directly to the heart of the reason for being a school in the first place, ‘We all want the best for the children’ (SLT member, School R), ‘Every child really does matter – and we were doing that before it became national!’ (SLT member, School B). There is some evidence of the importance of the head teacher in the creation of school ethos. The head teacher at School P reported that the core value in terms of recruitment was ‘relationships and helping children to learn’. At School B, staff reported that this vision was driven by the head teacher’s own vision and passion for the school; at School P, the head created the vision for the school when he arrived over 16 years ago, and that vision is still animating the leadership team. At School M, it was reported that ‘the head has developed an ethos where we look out for one another and anybody will jump in and help’ (associate head 1).</p><p>In the second, and subsidiary meaning, ‘ethos’ is used to refer to the raison d’être of the leadership group<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143212468350">1</xref></sup> itself. Headteachers made statements showing the value placed on the ethos of the team when recruiting. It is for this reason that we have borrowed the second part of the article title from JCB, ‘Recruit for attitude, train for skills’ (Arthur et al., 2008), as this succinctly sums up much of what heads told us about their views on building teams and recruiting members: attitudes, the ability to buy into and uphold the ethos of the school and thus the SLT, were considered more important than having specific skills. This is most clearly demonstrated in School B, where the head recounted appointing a deputy to fill a specific role who had no experience of the role at all, but who was deemed to have the right attitude. </p><p>This recruitment for attitude may also explain an interesting lacuna in the SLTs studied: few of them engaged in any CPD or other activities aimed at building or supporting team work. One head commented that these were skills candidates for the SLT would be expected to have (School B). This is contrary to much of the literature in the field which suggests the value of such training. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212468350">Katzenbach and Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212468350">Dvir et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212468350">Thomas and Collier, 2002</xref>). </p><p>Among other practices not reported independently but relating to the issue of the values in the school, the most important was operating within what were referred to as ‘cabinet rules’ – that is, working within a system in which discussion, even controversy and dissention are not problematic within the SLT, but outside the confines of that group, a united front is presented to the school; in the words of the head at School P, the SLT ‘talks the same story’. This allows for wide ranging discussion within the SLT, testing of new ideas and pushing of boundaries, but also allows the SLT to provide a united, stable voice for the rest of the school.</p><p>Working in such a way requires a great deal of trust between members ‘We can rely on everyone to do their jobs’ (acting deputy, School S), ‘There is a high level of trust and professional respect’ (deputy, School L); yet again, we found few instance of teams deliberately working to build such trust. Rather, it seemed to be a consequence of the way the teams operated, and the expectations heads had for that operation and of the members. ‘We are all part of one family’ (head, School S).</p><p>The overall finding is that leadership team practice at these schools is purposeful, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212468350">Thomas (2009</xref>: 2):</p><disp-quote><p>Effective teams … have a ‘clear and compelling purpose’ and undertake tasks which are relevant to that purpose. They possess strong team-working skills and high levels of integrity and the head exhibits strong leadership within a team framework. The teams are self-evaluative, reviewing past achievements, and constantly looking to improve both themselves and their schools.</p></disp-quote><p>What was found in the case study schools was that these teams’ working skills were embedded, rather than overtly trained for. For the schools in this study, their purpose was inexorably linked to the ethos of the school. </p><p>The three primary schools all have child-centred visions; ‘the vision is about … giving children the chance to succeed’ (deputy, School L). At School M, all members of the SLT stress the importance of working as a team: ‘We are all included and there is a team approach, a united front’ (associate head 1). There are high expectations of SLT members, who each assume a number of responsibilities; these are clearly understood (see next section).</p><p>At School B, associate head 3 summed up the key purpose of the SLT as, ‘making it happen’, facilitating things for other people. A head of department said it was about showing the rest of the staff the route, to support and encourage the rest of the staff, and to ‘share the vision’. This was echoed by the head teacher, who stated that the main purpose of the SLT was ‘strategic leadership in learning and teaching’, and to make sure that their leadership exemplifies the values of the school. It is here that teams begin to turn from the inward, to the outward focus: having assured their own, internal ethos, they are able to function well outside the boundaries of the team.</p><p>Appointments at the three primary schools are underpinned by the concept of ethos. Applicants need to share the schools’ child centred values. The head of School L reported that new members of the SLT ‘have to be driven’ and share the SLT’s values about children and the school. At School M, the head stated that the first consideration in making SLT appointments is that people must be good teachers, who place children at the core and who ‘have a shared vision for the school'. The head of School N said that enthusiasm, willingness to learn, a ‘have a go’ attitude, and recognition of the importance of continuing to move the school forward were key requirements.</p><p>This was also the case in the secondary schools; sharing the vision in the school was especially important at schools B and Y. The deputy at School Y reported that appointments to the SLT depend on vision, enthusiasm and ‘emotional intelligence’. Schools S and Y do not agree, however, on the importance of personal characteristics: at School S, these are considered to be of importance in appointments to SLT, but staff at School Y feel that these characteristics can be learned and are not essential for appointments. At School P, the first consideration is being a good teacher, and a requirement to have generosity of spirit. This emphasis on personal characteristics was also prominent at the special schools, which considered them more important than specific skills, in terms of appointments.</p><p>‘Ethos’ has been highlighted first as it appeared to be the most important prerequisite for appointments to the SLTs in the case study schools; candidates were chosen because of their adherence to and sharing in the ethos of the school. This at times meant that internal candidates were preferred to outsiders, because the head is already aware of how well internal candidates share the common vision for the school.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1741143212468350"><title>Need for Clarity</title><p>Clarity here may be understood as clarity about roles, in two senses. The first is that of the role of the SLT itself; the second, that of the roles the individual members of the SLT fulfil.</p><p>In relation to the SLT, the role of the team was reported to be wide ranging, ‘it is everything’ (head, School P), while a deputy at the same school suggested that it is ‘the core of everything’. The role of the overall SLT is clearly linked to the ethos of the school, with a member of administrative staff School G stating that the role of the SLT was ‘the well-being of students and staff’; a member of SLT at School S reported that the function of the SLT was to support the head’s vision for the school. SLTs were generally reported to be focused on strategic leadership (executive head, School G), as well as on the day to day running of the school (head, School G). Both Schools R and G regarded clarity among senior leaders as one of the reasons for the high performance of the schools.</p><p>More interesting, however, were comments about the second form of clarity: the clarity that existed within the teams themselves, ‘a strength of the team is that everyone has a clear role – that’s very important, who’s leading on what’ (executive head, School G). This sort of clarity also exists at School N, comprising a clear structure and routine, based on good communication, so that ‘Everybody knows what they are doing’ (SLT member). </p><p>School P has gone so far as to create a ‘lengthy’ document which spells out the specific roles of SLT members, entitled, ‘leadership team responsibilities’. School L also has a document which sets out the roles of the members of the SLT. Although there is no such document at School Y, there are still clear role descriptions for members of SLT, which link to a very detailed school improvement plan, ‘It’s got to be the longest in the world’ (deputy, School Y). The head at School S sees deployment of senior leaders as being about ‘who is effective where’.</p><p>Taking reports from all the schools together, it is clear that clarity about roles among senior leaders is essential, and that these roles are linked to the vision set out for the school. </p><p>However, the case study schools depart from previous literature, which argues for the allocation of responsibilities according to school needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212468350">Thomas, 2009</xref>). While staff in the schools have clear roles, those roles are not always decided on the basis of previously held skills, which would most clearly serve the immediate needs of the school; this links to the point made above about the assumption that members of such teams could learn any needed skills, if they bought into the ethos of the school. Staff also negotiate new roles in some of the case study schools, volunteering for new initiatives, and doing so with an awareness of the workloads of others in the group (head, School G). While Schools G and R mentioned aligning personal skills and strengths with new roles, and the head at School B mentioned aptitude, overall what was important in the case study schools was not always the ‘fit’ of the person to the role, but rather the clarity of who was fulfilling the role at any given time. This was exemplified in School B, in which the deputy head role was split between two people in a job share, with one very experienced person sharing with someone new to the role. </p><p>Case study schools were not averse to placing members of staff in new roles, ‘out of their comfort zones’ (deputy head, School P) or that they ‘know nothing about’ (head, School P) partially as a part of career development. The head at School N commented, ‘we have high expectations but we want to allow people to develop’. At School S, the two deputy heads were acting as associate heads at the time of the case study, in preparation for taking on their own headships.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1741143212468350"><title>Continuity as a Valuable Asset</title><p>Although much that has been discussed above has a foundation in the literature about senior leadership teams, one of the findings from the case study schools presents a significant new idea, that of longevity of service, and the value placed on experience. Examination of the responses from the schools, and of the length of service of those in the teams, leads to the conclusion that in these schools at least, a ‘quick fix’, short term solution to challenges would be neither welcome nor effective: this holds true as well for the case study school which was a part of the national challenge set of schools.</p><p>The primary schools spoke of a ‘grow your own’ policy (Schools L and N), with a comment that ‘The head has people she wants, they’re home grown’ (KS2 manager, School N). This links to two points, made above, that those who have been in the school some time are aware of and presumably buy into the ethos of the school, and also that the schools have a positive attitude toward staff development, and promotion from within. (Not all teachers, of course, can advance to leadership roles in a single school, hence the deputies at School S acting as associate heads to prepare for taking on their own schools in the future.) Almost all members of the STLs at the primary schools had been internal appointments, with all of the members of the SLTs at Schools M and N being internal. </p><p>The theme continues into the secondary schools, with six of the seven members of the SLT at School P being internal appointments. School S slightly tempers the appointment of internal candidates with an acknowledgement that external appointments can bring a useful fresh approach to the school. The special schools also place a value on experience, with most members of the SLTs there being long serving. At School P, seven of the eight teacher members of the SLT had been appointed internally; collectively, they represented over 100 years of experience at the school.</p><p>School B presents a slight difference, in that there are two associate head teachers who are new, outside appointments, as was the head a few years ago. However, all the other members of the SLT are long standing members of staff.</p><p>The head teacher at School Y presents the most striking case of stability, in that she came to the school as an NQT over 30 years ago and has spent all of her career at School Y. This is closely followed by one of the associate heads, who came to the school almost as long ago.</p><p>Continuity, of course, depends on a low turnover of senior staff. It may be argued that the two things – the valuing of experience and the desire of senior staff to stay in post – go hand in hand; this certainly seems to be the situation in the case study schools. Schools emphasized the value of continuing to work together, of knowing each other well. Trust is a foundation of team work, and takes time to evolve; in the case study schools, this evolution has clearly taken place, either through keeping the team entirely the same or through the sensitive addition of outsiders as needed.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1741143212468350"><title>Flexibility</title><p>The final element which contributed to the success of the schools was that of flexibility. This may seem antithetical to the previous section on the valuing of experience, but the two – flexibility and experience – need not be placed in opposition. Throughout the discussions with senior leadership teams, there was an emphasis on the need to change, to develop, to be flexible as a means of responding to the changing needs of the school. The fact that the senior leadership teams in these outstanding schools were remarkably stable does not mean that they had become stale or stagnant. Rather, they remained flexible and able to respond to new challenges.</p><p>We have already seen that there is flexibility in relation to roles: although team members are clear about which roles are being fulfilled by individuals, there is flexibility within the teams to move people from one role to another, particularly for the purposes of professional development.</p><p>Flexibility can also be seen in the way the teams choose to work: two of the primary schools do not have regular meetings for their SLTs (Schools M and N). The SLT at School M meets when it needs to do so (generally about once a month) but members also discuss issues at the weekly staff meeting. At School N, the SLT meets ‘as and when necessary’ (head, School N). Other schools have more regular schedules, meeting weekly (School G) or more often (often with one or two main meetings a week, and then quick meetings more often, even daily). There is clearly no one, right, pattern of meeting for SLTs in outstanding schools: the teams have the flexibility to meet as dictated by the needs of the school. </p><p>Two of the schools (L and R) differentiate between a SLT and an SMT, with the second concentrating on the more mundane, day to day issues involved in managing the schools, while the SLT deals with the more strategic issues. While only these two schools have separate teams, all of the schools made clear differentiations between dealing with strategic issues and operational ones, relegating the second to briefings or shorter meetings. The SLT at School Y holds special meetings, once a term, which take place in the evening, away from site, and include time for socializing and having a meal, to work on specific strategic issues. </p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-1741143212468350"><title>Discussion</title><p>This article set out to answer the first two questions of the overall research project, which were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What factors are important in recruiting individuals for high performing leadership teams?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What factors facilitate the establishment and development of high performing leadership teams?</p></list-item></list><p>The answer to these questions has been framed through the four themes of ethos, clarity, experience and flexibility, based on the interview data from the respondents.</p><p>In relation to the first question, the case study schools were clear that the factor which most influenced their selection of new members for the STL was the adherence of candidates to the ethos of the school; that new appointments to the senior team in these schools would not only take on board but would enthusiastically support and further the values underpinning work in the school. For a number of schools in the study, this adherence to the ethos of the school was more important than the need to have specific skills; it was assumed that STL members could learn skills far more easily than they could change their value systems.</p><p>The case study schools also show a marked preference for internal appointments to the SLT, with very few members of any of the nine STLs being external appointments. This relates to both the first and the second themes: internal candidates were felt to have proved their adherence to the ethos of the school, and they also had relevant experience, known to and understood by the school. For some schools, this was the result of a conscious policy of professional development, characterized as ‘grow your own’. Again, this finds some support in the literature, which emphasizes the importance of recruiting new staff who can work easily with current team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212468350">Apple, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42a-1741143212468350">Penlington et al. (2008</xref>: 77) offer principles to support school recruitment; while these originally applied to teachers, they are applicable to senior team leaders as well. The principles include, ‘employing teachers who had already proved their capabilities within the school’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212468350">Conger and Lawler (2001</xref>) add that recruitment should take account of existing strengths within the team, seeking to find those who can add to these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212468350">Farris and Woodruff, 2000</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212468350">Earley and Weindling (2004</xref>: 102) add that the ability to trust and support each other is important and SLT members should have the opportunity to speak their mind, and to express contrary views, but still work well as a team; this returns us to the concept of the creation a value system born out of, or at least supported by conflict. ‘Sharing a common purpose, clear roles, collective decision-making, joint responsibility, and presenting a united front, were all factors mentioned with regard to successful teams.’ These factors are evident in most of the case study schools, particularly in the highlighting of the idea of ‘cabinet rules’, where dissent may be voiced, and contrary opinions aired, within the group. This also helps to avoid the possibility of ‘groupthink’, that is, of having a group in which everyone must agree all the time, or thinks in precisely the same way. The fostering of discussion and debate within teams will work to avoid this.</p><p>In answer to the second question, the factors that appear to have facilitated the establishment and development of these high performing teams are all four of the themes presented above; this returns us to the concept of distributed leadership: the concentration is not on the individual leaders, but on what they do, and in these cases, how they work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468350">Spillane et al., 2004</xref>). This, too, may go some way to explaining the flexibility around roles in these teams; as leadership is not inherent in the person, but rather in the team and more importantly, the collaborative action of the members of that team, movement of members from one role to another may be less problematic than in a system that would associate leadership directly with an individual.</p><p>The ethos of the school relates not just to the way adults interact with children but also to the way the senior leadership teams act among themselves, with schools often giving the example of the operation of ‘cabinet rules’ which allow for internal discussion and even disagreement but which also result in a united front to the rest of the school. SLT members also showed an awareness of the need to support each other, using phrases such as ‘we all muck in’ and ‘we are aware of each other’s workloads’. This finding is supported in the literature, which emphasizes the value of shared goals, and a united vision. The teams described in this project fall under the second of Wallace’s four categories of teams, in that they consist of an egalitarian head and an egalitarian team (within which all members carry equal weight, and within which members are free to discuss issues), which Wallace maintains will lead to high gains, a low amount of strain and a high degree of synergy within the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212468350">Wallace, 2002</xref>). This is evident in the study schools, which are all high performing, and rated as outstanding; the retention of staff testifies to the value of the perceived working conditions.</p><p>The outcome of the extension of an ethos of care to colleagues as well as to children can be seen in the retention of staff, and the long serving nature of so many members of the STLs. It would not have been possible for schools to make so many internal appointments if staff were not staying with one institution for long periods of time, allowing them to both demonstrate their acceptance of the ethos of the school and to gain the experience which is so valued in SLTs.</p><p>Again, these views find support in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212468350">Cranston and Ehrich (2005</xref>) urge the development of a shared culture, values and beliefs, and effective team work processes, among members of the SMT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212468350">Coleman (2006</xref>) suggests that team effectiveness may require cultural shifts for participants and adds that bridging between those with defined roles, establishing links but allowing for individual policies to emerge, may have advantages for strategic development.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212468350">Day et al. (2009</xref>) stress that, when appointing staff, heads ensured that new personnel would share the vision for the school and embody it in their working practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212468350">Wageman et al. (2008</xref>: 49) urge that ‘you should select the best, most appropriate members for the team purpose you have in mind’. These points are reflected in the approaches taken at the case study schools.The emphasis placed on the sharing of values in these schools outweighed other factors in the recruitment process.</p><p>The case study schools also pointed to great clarity of roles within their teams, whether these were enshrined in a separate document, clearly set out in role descriptions or simply understood by team members. This does not contradict the concept above of giving support to each other; rather, it reinforces it, as with such clarity, STL members have a clear idea of their own, and others’ responsibilities.</p><p>Thomas’ (2009) investigation of leadership teams in six secondary schools came to a similar conclusion, with the author commenting on the high levels of integrity and a constant drive toward self improvement. Cranston and Ehrich also urge that teams have clearly defined roles, a shared culture, and foster quality relations and communication with other staff (2005). Mathieu and Rapp (2000) add a further point with their advocacy of ‘team charters’, a clearly defined set of operating principles, and clear performance strategies. Among the case study schools, this clarity was obvious, but only one school had felt the need to enshrine these working practices in a lengthy written document.</p><p>Within this framework, however, there is room for flexibility, as shown by the associate members of two of the SLTs, and the movement from one role to another in other teams. Stability does not necessarily lead to stagnation, if team members are allowed to take on new challenges within their roles, or to change roles as appropriate; as a staff member at School P points out, the school ethos helps people to ‘flourish’, not just to conform (associate head 1).</p><p>There is flexibility between the schools, as well. Leadership practice is different in all of these schools, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212468350">Spillane et al. (2004</xref>), as leadership is not a specific thing which can be investigated on its own, but is rather the result of the combination of leaders, followers, and the situation in which they act out their various roles. It is not within the purview of this article to undertake an in-depth discussion of the difference in leadership among the schools in the study, however, some differences may be highlighted, such as the documents that some schools had setting out roles, which were absent in others, the differences between the frequency of meetings for senior staff, the presence of associate members in some teams and not in others.</p><p>As mentioned above, it was notable that none of the schools in the case study felt the need to undertake training specifically aimed at being a team, or at forging a team among themselves. This may be a result of the length of time they have served together, or it may be, as the head teacher at School B commented, that team building skills were assumed to be already a part of the skill set that SLT members brought with them. The important issue is not the skills involved, which as per the definition given above, can be learned, but rather the attitudes of the SLT members: attitudes which members say are reinforced by working together and through social events (deputy head 1, School P). These attitudes cannot be easily learned; rather they are scaffolding on which the learning of skills build; that is, the attitudes of the members allow the learning of skills not only for the sake of the member herself, but also for the good of the team and the school. </p><p>This runs counter to the understanding in the literature that teams benefit from training as a team. There was clear evidence in the schools of continuous professional development for team members, but no reports of specific team building training. However, there were instances of activities which could easily be understood as team building, such as time away from the school. The time spent together for some of the teams is also striking, with meetings on most or all school days. Such encounters, when built on a solid foundation of clarity of roles and shared vision, allow team members to work effectively, and engage in the professional discussion that is a necessary part of development. The advantages of school-based development are well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212468350">McDowell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212468350">Goodall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212468350">Goodall and Day, 2006</xref>). It may be that the very structures which allow these high performing teams to work so well, also serve to reinforce their effective and outstanding ways of working.</p><p>As seen above, in selecting members for SLT roles, heads have placed greater emphasis on attitudes than they have on skills, asserting that skills can be learned. The definitions given at the outset explain the value of the JCB phrase, recruit for attitude, train for skills. Skills can be learned, while attitudes represent embedded ways of viewing the world, which act as frameworks for action. </p><sec id="section9-1741143212468350"><title>Suggestions for Further Research</title><p>This research has been conducted with established teams, which for the most part are composed of members who have been in role for a significant length of time. It would be useful to conduct further case study work with newer teams, either those in newly established (or newly reconstituted) schools, or teams where there has been a significant change in personnel.</p><p>Second, there is a dissonance between previous literature on the value of training for team work and the experience of the teams reported here. Further research could usefully investigate the value placed on such training by teams at different levels of effectiveness, and the impact such training has been seen to have for teams which have utilized it. </p><p>These outstanding teams did not come about by chance, or a fortuitous grouping of people in one place. Rather, they have been deliberately and carefully built up over time, founded on the head teacher’s vision for the school, which is now shared by all members. Recruitment to the senior teams takes in a range of issues, including teaching and learning. But the emphasis in these teams is on the driving force, their vision, and can be aptly summed up by the phrase, ‘Recruit for attitude, train for skills’, with the training being understood as taking place within the workings of the team itself.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1741143212468350"><label>1.</label><p>‘Leadership group’ will
