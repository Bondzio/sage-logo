<p>Nine months ago, I began work at the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) as the Executive Director. For this former high school nurse, joining the NASN team—board, staff, and members—is an honor and a privilege. All but 1 of my 33 years in nursing has been in community settings: from home care to hospice to schools to state government. Most of my career has been in school nursing. My focus over the years has been to encourage and facilitate school nurse leadership, which enables students to experience optimum health and educational success.</p>
<p>The 2006 opening of the NASN office in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area multiplied opportunities for the association to collaborate with like-minded partners and to influence policy makers for the benefit of children’s health and education. Successes and gains in multiple strategic areas resulted from this move. Six years later, the momentum continues with the increasing visibility of school nurses in child health and education conversations. NASN is poised to deepen the collaboration and broaden the influence that emerged from our presence in the DC area, throughout the nation and abroad. In 2012 and beyond, NASN moves forward with strategic innovation, discipline and relevance.</p>

<title>Where Are We Going?</title>
<p>Looking back at where NASN began provides insight into where we are going. In July 1969, a group of school nurses who were part of the Department of Nurses in the National Education Association convened the first annual meeting of what would become NASN in 1979. Their “purpose was to improve the quality of school nursing, to upgrade the skills of school nurses and to further the abilities of all children to succeed in the classroom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12448878">NASN, n.d.</xref>, para. 1).</p>
<p>Today, the NASN Board of Directors sets forth a plan with strategic goals that continues with the tradition of advancing the quality of school nursing practice and improving health and education outcomes for children. NASN strategic goals are advocacy and public relations, finances, governance and administration, member programs and resources, and research. NASN staff members operationalize the strategic plan and support the board’s governance work. NASN members are often tapped for their subject matter expertise and advice for the work of the association.</p>
<p>In order to move forward, NASN continually analyzes current programs, services, and technology to remain relevant to our members. Member feedback provides vital information and reality checks that inform provision of services and enables strategic focus on what matters most. NASN wants members aware of and accessing the myriad programs, services, and activities provide for them. Determining what services are aligned with current professional priorities and realities for school nurses guides innovation and cessation of programs. NASN makes decisions based on these data, environmental scanning, and conversations.</p>
<p>Partnerships provide educational resources that promote school nurses’ life-long learning. Partnerships help NASN extend its reach to advocate for student health and learning. NASN looks forward to strengthening existing partnerships and developing new strategic partnerships that enable NASN to accomplish its mission.</p>

<title>Why Are We Going There?</title>
<p>NASN advances the specialty practice of school nursing to improve the health and academic success of all students. This mission guides NASN’s decisions and actions. In this season of health care and education reform, NASN stands ready to amplify the voice of school nursing and the well-being of children in order to</p>

<p>Health care delivery is at a turning point. School nurses have unique contributions and untapped capacity to transform the quality of care. The collective voice of school nurses influences health care delivery in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12448878">Institute of Medicine, 2011</xref>). Education reform opens a door for school nurses to articulate what they do and how they collaborate with others to improve student health and learning. NASN is moving forward with research priorities set by the Board of Directors that will</p>

<title>Who Is Going With Us?</title>
<p>The NASN Board of Directors and staff invite every school nurse to join NASN as we move forward to provide relevant educational programs, experiences, and services. Seek out the affiliate school nurse organizations that establish connections and learning for school nurses. Those connections are vital for the future of school nursing. I met Mary and Rhea a few months ago. They are school nurse leaders who first met when Mary was Rhea’s school nurse. Rhea chose nursing as a career and worked for years in education. Mary and Rhea crossed paths years later. Mary reconnected with Rhea, sharing her passion for school nursing, which resulted in Rhea’s becoming a school nurse. Mary and Rhea are going with us.</p>
<p>School nurses, school nurse administrators, school nurse educators, state school nurse consultants, and public health department staff comprise an audience vital for moving forward in positive student health and education outcomes. Form networks within your locality so that multiplied wisdom and knowledge encourages you in the work. This esteemed group of health and education professionals knows the power of a united voice for children.</p>
<p>School nurse positions are decreasing in some communities due to economic challenges. Finding new partners to go with us in this challenging time yields productive partnerships. For example, a school nurse researcher worked with an insurance company, which resulted in school risk managers’ learning about the risks of staffing school health services without regard for the acuity levels and health needs of students. What new partnerships are you discovering?</p>
<p>Parents and guardians are moving forward on behalf of school nurses. School nurses provide health care linkages within school and in the community for students and families. Parents and guardians want their children healthy and safe in schools. NASN partners with these effective advocates as we move forward.</p>

<title>How Will We Get There?</title>
<p>Collins in <italic>Good to Great and the Social Sectors</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12448878">2005</xref>) spoke of the hedgehog concept, which enables clarity about producing long-term results and discipline to decline opportunities that distract from the mission. As NASN builds resources (human and financial), develops a brand (identifies what we do best in the world), and lives out our passion, success relative to the mission occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942602X12448878">Figure 1</xref>). NASN works with strategic focus on the issues and programs that advance school nursing practice and improve student health and learning. NASN is moving forward strategically and with laser-like focus. We are following our passion, overlapping that with what we are the best at, and adding to the picture our resources: human, financial, and our brand. What results will propel school nurses and NASN into transformed health care and education environments. We invite you to come with us. ■</p>
