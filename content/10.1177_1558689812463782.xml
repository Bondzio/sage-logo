<p>Recent European Union expansion has permitted new, but complex, health interactions for migrants. This study examined perceived changes in health and interactions with the British National Health Service among new Polish migrants. In a mixed methods sequential study, questionnaires were administered at Time 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 418), Time 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 222), and Time 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 214). Thirty respondents participated in interviews 6 months after arrival; 25 of these were interviewed 1 year later. Age, psychological and cognitive resources, social support, discrimination, and economic status predicted perceived health changes. Interviews revealed cultural differences in treatment procedures and the role of social networks in health service expectations.</p>

<body>
<p>The health of migrants has emerged as a major topic for epidemiological research, but previous work has rarely considered the wider sociocultural context that informs migrant’s health perceptions. In particular, little research has examined the health status of migrants who engage in circular patterns of migration between developed countries. Such movement between nations is likely to inform attitudes toward, and uptake of, medical services in the new culture, permitting new and significant interactions in health care seeking between the receiving and sending nation. Moreover, epidemiological studies have been largely limited to quantitative approaches that may not capture experiences and expectations of individual patients and how those experiences are intertwined with patients’ cultural background.</p>
<p>The populations of postcommunist Europe have faced a number of serious economic and social challenges over the past two decades. The expansion of the European Union (EU) eastward in 2004, however, offered an opportunity for the large-scale movement of migrants westward; this led to the largest and most rapid migrant movement to the United Kingdom in recent history. Between May 2004 and September 2009, an estimated 1.6 million workers from the EU came to the United Kingdom, of which approximately two thirds were Poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812463782">Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2010</xref>). Such migrants do not require a visa to work in the United Kingdom and are not restricted by the occupations in which they can be employed. Polish medical workers, for example, can work in the United Kingdom in either a private capacity or within the British National Health Service (NHS), while the availability of cheap flights allows Poles to return back to Poland to receive free treatment within the Polish National Health Fund (NFZ) or in private clinics.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how Polish migrants evaluate changes in their health in their new country and their interactions with the NHS in the United Kingdom. First, we adopt acculturation theory to formulate key predictors of perceived health changes during migration. Second, we examine how these migrants experience treatment within the NHS. Finally, we explore how individuals’ experiences and knowledge from <italic>back home</italic> influence their interactions with the British health service. Such pre-migration experiences are becoming increasingly recognized as important for understanding health experiences in the new country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812463782">Gushulak &amp; MacPherson, 2011</xref>). We conduct this work within the context of a three-wave longitudinal study, following migrants shortly after arrival and in two subsequent 9-month periods and employing both quantitative and qualitative methods to address key aspects of Polish migrant health perceptions.</p>

<title>Migrant Health: Key Entry Characteristics and Societal Responses</title>
<p>Migration is frequently portrayed as a critical life event and time of psychological challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy, Furnham, &amp; Siefen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1558689812463782">Weishaar, 2008</xref>). Difficult economic conditions, long working hours, and poor housing make the lives of many migrants very difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689812463782">Kircaldy et al., 2009</xref>). Unsurprisingly, therefore, migrants frequently report stress symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812463782">Berry, 1997</xref>), often manifested in exhaustion and headaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1558689812463782">Sundquist, Bayard-Burfield, Johansson, &amp; Johansson, 2000</xref>). However, while any major environmental change is liable to be stressful, recent evidence has rejected a simple “morbidity hypothesis” that anticipates an inevitable decline in health following migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1558689812463782">Weishaar, 2008</xref>). Indeed, evidence suggests that migrants may be even healthier than their native-born counterparts, a finding often seen as particularly paradoxical, given the health changes they may face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689812463782">Lu, 2008</xref>). The most common explanation for this <italic>healthy migrant</italic> effect is that voluntary migration is selective: Only those with good health have the ability to move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812463782">Di Cosmo et al., 2011</xref>). This effect appears to be stronger in new immigrants, suggesting decreased advantages over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812463782">Sam, Vedder, Ward, &amp; Horenczyk, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Migrants to a particular country should not, however, be seen as identical: There is considerable heterogeneity in health trajectories and outcomes. New entrants to a culture have a number of characteristics and resources that affect their acculturation experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812463782">Berry, 1997</xref>). These resources may change during the migration process as individuals gain new skills (e.g., language fluency), build new networks within their own and receiving communities, and gain (or lose) status in the new country. Two sets of factors are likely to act as key health determinations: one internal to the migrant and the second a product of their new society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy et al., 2005</xref>). Internal characteristics include the migrant’s demographic background (e.g., age, socioeconomic status [SES]), psychological resources on entry (such as personal values, attitudes toward integration in the new culture), and cognitive resources (e.g., language skills; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812463782">Ataca &amp; Berry, 2002</xref>). These internal characteristics combine with contextual factors, including the attitudes of the new society as well as already-present support networks in their new society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1558689812463782">Tartakovsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1558689812463782">Wierzbicki, 2004</xref>). We summarize some key characteristics expected to influence immigrants’ health (and health perceptions) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812463782">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Polish Migration in Context: Community and Health Systems Across Countries</title>
<p>Polish migrants who arrived to the United Kingdom between 2004 and 2009 tended to be young (around 70% were aged between 18 and 35 years) and relatively well educated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812463782">Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2010</xref>). Although these migrants tend to work in occupations below their educational level on entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1558689812463782">Weishaar, 2008</xref>), they are likely to move into more skilled occupations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812463782">Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2010</xref>). At the same time, language skills remain a major barrier to economic progress among these migrants and limit access to some medical services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1558689812463782">Spencer, Ruhs, Anderson, &amp; Rogaly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1558689812463782">Weishaar, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, European comparisons show that Poles generally report rather low levels of psychological well-being, which may negatively affect their sociocultural adaptation and psychological health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Polish and British health systems exhibit a number of similarities and differences. In both countries, patients have access to a state-based health care system “free at the point of delivery.” In both nations, patients register with a single general practitioner (GP), who acts as the gatekeeper to further care, including that of specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812463782">Reibling, 2010</xref>). In both countries, too, health systems have been a matter of recent political controversy, with this debate particularly pronounced in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1558689812463782">Watson, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1558689812463782">2011</xref>). A bill for hospital privatization, introduced in 2007, was vetoed by the then President Lech Kaczyński. Following the President’s death in 2010 there have been ongoing discussions over privatization, while many hospitals continue to be unable to pay utility bills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1558689812463782">Watson, 2010</xref>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, international comparative polls show that Poles are generally comparatively negative about their health services. One Europe-wide survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812463782">Eurobarometer, 2010</xref>) found only 30% Poles rated their overall health care as “good” (compared with 86% in the United Kingdom). Compared with other EU states, 63% of Poles stated their health service is worse, versus only 16% in United Kingdom. Indeed, 69% of Poles thought they were likely to be harmed by hospital care, 67% by non-hospital care: comparative figures in the United Kingdom were again lower (47% and 37%, respectively).</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Using a mixture of methods has a number of advantages when studying migration and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812463782">Edwards &amp; Lopez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689812463782">Lingard, Albert, &amp; Levinson, 2008</xref>). While these different methods can be used to generate convergent findings (“triangulation”) and to elaborate on results and develop theories and procedures, the very tension between these different approaches can also generate new insights and understandings and crucially aid in the contextualization of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812463782">Edwards &amp; Lopez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689812463782">Lingard et al., 2008</xref>). This allows us to refine or challenge broader theories (such as acculturation theory) within very specific, potentially underexplored, contexts (e.g., circular migration).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test a model of pathways to perceptions of mental and physical health among Polish migrants to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, this study examines in depth how the experiences of Polish migrants in their home country with their health system influence their use of, and satisfaction with, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. We take a “pragmatic” approach, combining the methods and ideas we view as best likely to address our research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689812463782">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>). In our study, we used a sequential mixed methods design. We use these different methods because of the complementary strengths of both approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). We employ a QUANT-QUAL (“pure mixed”) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689812463782">Hanson, Cresswell, Clark, Petska, &amp; Creswell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>) with the quantitative approach (a structured questionnaire), followed by the qualitative data collection (a semistructured interview), a method frequently employed in mixed methods research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689812463782">Jakob, 2001</xref>). As reflected in the capitalizations, we give each method equal priority. Given that the quantitative data collection was conducted over three waves, and the interviews over two, we also permitted some reciprocation in the questions asked, allowing for a better integration of our data. As a result, we include an element of “sequential triangulation” in our research, with one stage influencing the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Our design thus allows us a “dialogue” between our research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812463782">Brannen &amp; Moss, 2012</xref>), so that we collect data from one wave of the quantitative study and use it to design our qualitative study—<italic>and</italic> use data from our qualitative work in informing later questionnaire items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812463782">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the above review, we suggest that a number of factors are likely to affect perceived migrant health (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812463782">Table 1</xref>). In the first part of this article, we model the relationship between resources on entry, the attitudes of the new culture, and continuing and developing relationships with both their home and new societies and perceived health changes. We test a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1558689812463782">Figure 1</xref>) of the longitudinal acculturation process affecting health outcomes. This model assumes that some predictors have exogenous character (e.g., resources and characteristics on entry—age, gender, education at Time 1, self-transcendence values at Time 1) and expect these to predict endogenous (dependent) variables at Times 1, 2, and 3. We make some directional assumptions regarding variables measured in the same or subsequent data wave. Here, we expect education and age at arrival to predict language fluency in English at Time 1, while language fluency at Time 1 will predict attitudes to British culture (<italic>Pro-British</italic> Time 1) and support from British people (<italic>Closeness to British</italic> Time 2). Attitudes to British culture (<italic>Pro-British</italic> Time 1) will, in turn, predict perceived discrimination (<italic>Discrimination</italic> Time 2). Support from Polish and British networks at Time 2 and discrimination at Time 2 we anticipate predicting SES at Time 3. This latter variable we expect to predict perceived changes in physical and psychological health at Time 3. We also expect that social support from Polish networks at Time 2 will predict perceived changes in both physical and mental health at Time 3, and support from British networks at Time 2 will predict perceived changes in mental health at Time 3. In addition, we expect a direct effect of discrimination Time 2 on mental and physical health at Time 3. We control for the effect of gender and age on perceived changes in physical health.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a supplement to this quantitative analysis, we also questioned those Time 3 participants who had used general practitioners, dentists, or hospital services in the NHS about their satisfaction levels with their treatment. We also asked all Time 3 respondents whether they would prefer to travel to Poland for medical treatment, if monetary concerns were not a restriction.</p>
<p>In our second (qualitative) phase of the study, we build in particular on these final questions to consider how perceptions about the role of health professionals in Poland influence expectations about treatment by Polish migrants, and their preferences for use of their own health system. Our qualitative data aim to provide richer detail about the health experiences of Polish migrants in the United Kingdom, helping us better understand the complexity of emotions and motivations involved in seeking medical assistance, and the cultural influences on health-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812463782">Castro, Kellison, Boyd, &amp; Kopak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). This is likely to be particularly valuable in the context of changing communities, and those moving locations, such as migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812463782">Castro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689812463782">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689812463782">Mason, 2006</xref>). We use together the data generated by both our quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a more complete and complex picture of the processes (and occasional paradoxes) that emerge during the interactions between migrants and the UK health service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample and Study Procedures</title>
<p>The data reported in this article were from the Longitudinal Study of Polish Migrants, and were collected between June 2007 and February 2009. Participants were Polish immigrants in the United Kingdom, who at first data sweep had been living in Britain for no longer than 3 months and who intended to stay in Britain for a minimum of 2 years.</p>
<sec id="section6-1558689812463782">
<title>Quantitative data</title>
<p>Data for the quantitative (questionnaire) part of this study were collected in three waves (Time 1 [T1], up to 3 months after migration; Time 2 [T2], 9-12 months after migration; Time 3 [T3], 18-21 months after migration). Participants were recruited through a wide variety of methods, including banner advertisements on Internet portals and widely distributed leaflets in Polish shops, churches, and transport hubs. Our sample was from a wide diversity of locations across Britain, representing the unusually widespread nature of the recent Polish migration to Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812463782">Burrell, 2009</xref>). We piloted our initial questionnaire questions with a series of focus group meetings (including members of the Eastern Europe Support Network, a voluntary organization aimed at helping migrants from Eastern Europe, and the Federation of Poles in Great Britain). Both questions and procedures for recruitment and sample retention (e.g., appropriate means of payment) were refined as a result of these meetings. The survey was written in English and back translated; 10 Polish respondents then piloted the translated version. Participants completed the questionnaire online: To encourage completion, they were paid £6, £8, and £10 for the three respective data waves.</p>
<p>In all, 418 respondents participated in this questionnaire study at T1, 228 at T2, and 214 at T3. Quantitative data were conducted on the 172 participants who took part in all three data waves. Participants ranged from 18 to 59 years, with a mean age of 27 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.0); 49% were university educated; on entry to United Kingdom, 61% were in full-time work, 14% in half-time paid work, 19% unemployed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1558689812463782">Table 2</xref> describes the participants in each wave of data collection.</p>

<p>To check for selectivity in sample dropout, we compared the T3 respondents with those who dropped out in consecutive waves on age, gender, and educational level. No significant differences were found between the remaining participants and those who dropped out of the survey, suggesting that demographic variables were unrelated to sample attrition.</p>

<title>Qualitative data</title>
<p>Qualitative data were collected first from in-depth interviews with 30 respondents who had been in the United Kingdom for approximately 6 months (Phase I: 18 women, 12 men, aged between 20 and 59 years, <italic>M</italic> age 30.4 years [<italic>SD</italic> = 9.6]). These interviews were repeated 1 year later with 25 of these original respondents (Phase II: 16 women, 9 men). Respondents were purposively selected from our questionnaire data to represent different gender, age, and educational groups; 30 out of the 60 participants approached agreed to participate. Interviewees were from a range of professions and included a biotechnologist, cleaners, receptionists, and supermarket workers as well as full-time home makers. All interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded with the participant’s permission, with participants paid £8 in shopping tokens for each interview. Interviews included questions on experiences of the NHS, comparisons between the NHS and the health systems in Poland, and preferences for personal use of the Polish or British health system. Interviews were first read several times in their native Polish by the third author, and responses translated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1558689812463782">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>SES was assessed using the European Socio-Economic Classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689812463782">Rose &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>), a three-level categorical schema based on employment contract relations. In this classification system, the higher and lower salariat (Class 1: e.g., large employers) are contrasted with higher grade white- or blue-collar workers and small employers (Class 2) and lower white-collar and manual workers (Class 3). Scores were recoded here so that a higher class is indicated by a higher categorization. Language skills were measured by four self-ratings, evaluating writing, reading, understanding, and speaking of English and combined into a single score by averaging the scores on these four items (Cronbach’s α = .94). Education on entry was coded into seven categories, ranging from primary school through to doctoral level. To measure personal values, self-transcendence was measured using the Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1558689812463782">Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>); the self-transcendence score was computed by subtracting scores on the contrasting self-enhancement values (power and achievement values) from scores on the contrasting self-transcendent values (universalist and benevolent values); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1558689812463782">Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .78). Attitude toward British culture (<italic>Pro-British</italic>) was measured by four items reflecting evaluations and involvement with the receiving community (5-point answering scale, from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>; a representative item was “There are typical British values which I appreciate”). The score on this measure was computed by averaging scores on the four items (Cronbach’s α = .53).</p>
<p>We included measures of support and discrimination at T2 to assess experiences after the first year of migration. Transnational social support (<italic>Support from Poland</italic>) was assessed by averaging answers to three questions asking about the availability of emotional, informational, and practical support from Poland (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1558689812463782">Oakley, 1992</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .72). Respondents’ closeness with British people was assessed by one item on a 4-point answering scale from <italic>superficial</italic> to <italic>very close</italic>. Discrimination was assessed by averaging responses to three items assessing whether Poles were trusted, liked, and respected (3-point answering scale, from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>a lot</italic>, Cronbach’s α = .76).</p>
<p>Perceived changes in health were assessed by one question assessing perceived changes in mental health and one question assessing perceived changes in physical health. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they believed their physical and psychological well-being had changed since their migration on a 5-point answering scale from <italic>much worse than in Poland</italic> to <italic>much better than in Poland</italic>. Because our analyses focuses on perceived negative changes (or the lack of thereof), responses were recoded on a 3-point scale, <italic>much worse, worse</italic>, and <italic>same/better</italic> and then used in the analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, respondents evaluated their experiences with the NHS, indicating this separately for hospital visits, GPs, and dentists. Because our first round of interviews suggested that simple satisfaction with medical treatment had to be differentiated between satisfaction with other elements of the NHS (e.g., satisfaction with the attitude/personal manner of the physician), participants rated their satisfaction with the NHS on a number of dimensions. These were satisfaction with their medical treatment, approval of the personal way in which they were treated (both 3-point scales, from <italic>very satisfied</italic> to <italic>not at all satisfied</italic>), the competence of the relevant medic, and the administrative organization of their visit/s (5-point scales from <italic>very good</italic> to <italic>very bad</italic>). They also indicated their preference for travelling to Poland for treatment if money was not an issue (<italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>).</p>
<p>Our semistructured <italic>qualitative</italic> interviews included three sets of questions on experiences of the NHS, comparisons between the NHS and the health systems in Poland, and preferences for personal use of the Polish or British health system. Interview responses were first read several times in their native Polish by the third author, and responses then translated. We then produced an extensive table with all the material that addressed the above questions listed in tabular format so that these could be represented into approximate numerical indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689812463782">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>). We aimed to produce the smallest number of thematic categories that would best account for the responses generated, to ensure “optimal validation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812463782">Castro et al., 2010</xref>). The first and third authors independently read the translated transcripts and identified the most frequently occurring key themes from the transcripts.</p>

<sec id="section9-1558689812463782">
<title>Validity and legitimacy</title>
<p>Considerable debate exists around the assessment of validity in mixed methods research, to the extent that “legitimacy” has been proposed as the more appropriate term for assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812463782">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812463782">Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006)</xref> emphasize the importance of “the insider perspective” being sufficiently represented, that the researcher demonstrates a broad and encompassing viewpoint (“commensurability validity”) and that there is a fair sharing of power in planning, conducting, and interpreting the work (“political legitimacy”). To address these concerns, we actively involved a multidisciplinary research team from psychology and public health, working alongside groups representing or supporting Polish migrants to the United Kingdom. We conducted in-depth piloting of our questions and procedures with representative members of our sample populations to ensure the “insider–outsider” perspective. Validity of the quantitative measurement was ensured by using validated questionnaires, conducting pilot survey prior to data collection and readjusting questions in the survey after the first wave of qualitative interviews. To enhance “commensurability legitimation,” our researcher was trained in both quantitative and qualitative methods and had previous experience of mixed method research on other applied research projects. Finally, to ensure accurate interpretation of our data, we held dissemination and discussion meetings with Polish group representatives, members of the Polish media, a local Polish borough councilor, the Polish Psychological Society in the United Kingdom, and other participants from the investigated community.</p>

<title>Quantitative Results: Pathway Analysis</title>
<p>We aimed to test a model that integrated the relative contributions of sociodemographic variables and acculturation variables in the examination of health outcomes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed with Mplus 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689812463782">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). SEM allows for the estimation of both direct and indirect effects between variables using causal pathways through the examination of mediating variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1558689812463782">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, because SEM involves a confirmatory rather than exploratory approach to analysis, theory-driven planning is fundamental to SEM analyses. In assessing the fit of a model to the data, several indices are usually taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1558689812463782">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). In line with current practice, we include, alongside the more conventional measure of chi-square fit, the root mean square of approximation (RMSEA), giving a measure of the discrepancy in fit per degree of freedom and the comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812463782">Bentler, 1990</xref>). We include correlations, means, and standard deviations of observed variables as well as path estimates for that model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812463782">Boomsma, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689812463782">Table 3</xref> reports Spearman’s correlations between variables, as well as the means and standard deviations of the variables under study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689812463782">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>As can be seen from the correlation analysis, those who were a) younger b) had better English language skills on entry c) worked in higher SES occupations by T3 d) had experienced less discrimination e) had self-transcendent values f) reported more transnational social support were less likely to report negative physiological health changes since their move from Poland. Respondents who had higher SES by T3, those with self-transcendent values, those keen to engage in British society on entry, and participants who had close relations from British people at T2 were less likely to report negative changes in psychological well-being during their migration.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1558689812463782">Figure 2</xref> shows the results of pathway analysis, with younger age at T1 predicting more social support from Polish networks at T2, lesser discrimination at T2, more pro-British attitudes at T1, higher fluency in English at T1, and better physical health at T3. Education at T1 predicted greater fluency in English at T1 and higher SES at T3. Fluency in English at T1 predicted more pro-British attitudes at T1 and more support from British networks at T2; more pro-British attitudes at T1 predicted lesser perceived discrimination at T2 and more support from British networks at T2. More support from British and Polish networks at T2 predicted higher SES at T3. Finally, SES at T3 predicted better perceived physical and mental health at T3. We did not see the expected relationship of discrimination at T2 on SES at T3. Perceived mental health at T3 was predicted only by SES at T3; the effect of social support at T2 and perceived discrimination at T2 was not significant in the pathway model. Notably, in our T3 sample of respondents who participated in all data waves, 9% of respondents at T1 were classified in the “top” socioeconomic group (Group 3), 19% in SES 2, and 72% in the lowest SES group (Group 1). By T3, 21% were classified in the top SES Group 3, 24% in SES 2, and 55% in SES 1, suggesting substantive movement in SES toward the higher classes during these 18 months.</p>

<?h -1?>Our first area of questioning explored general health experiences in the United Kingdom. Participants reported a wide range of experiences with the NHS, both positive and negative. However, several mentioned that United Kingdom GPs were reluctant to perform extensive tests, preferring instead to advise taking paracetamol. This led to several respondents referring to the GP service in the United Kingdom as the “paracetamol force”:

<p>“Every time I am unwell, or something is happening, the doctor tells me to take Paracetamol . . . The doctor looks [at you] and says “ok, take Paracetamol.” (Female, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One woman describes how she felt she had to exaggerate her symptoms to get treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>“Once I had an inflammation of my stomach. I went to a doctor ( . . . ) he ignored me, and said “sleep more.” So I thought I should go to A&amp;E. I was pretending that I was in a lot of pain. Only then did they do the normal tests and gave me some pills.” [Female, Phase 1]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Individuals’ experiences appeared to be strongly framed by their social network (including “acquaintances’ acquaintances”) Speaking after more than a year in the United Kingdom, one male respondent claims,
<disp-quote>
<p>“It is a painful subject; all the Poles complain all the time.'' (Male; Phase II)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Online sources, such as Internet forums, seemed particularly influential. One female respondent claimed,
<disp-quote>
<p>“I read what the other Poles write, and I have to agree that the doctors here would like to treat everything with Paracetamol and a glass of water.” (Female, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This discourse was prominent, even when not completely accepted by our Polish respondents. In the words of one female respondent,
<disp-quote>
<p>“Generally, it is not so bad. After what I’ve heard, I expected it would be worse.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Comparisons between the UK and Polish services</title>
<p>Consistent with the above concerns over the “prescription” of paracetamol, many participants thought that treatment was more superficial than in Poland.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“A friend from work had a child ( . . . ), and eight hours later [the mother] was sent back home. It would be impossible in Poland: you have to be under medical surveillance for two, three days.” [Female, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>“I prefer Polish [doctors] because when a kid has a sore throat or a fever, a doctor will inspect and recognize [what the problem is].” (Female, Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One respondent worked as a driver of a heavy goods vehicle and required a medical checkup for his work. He was surprised by the brevity and simplicity of the medical checkups in the United Kingdom:
<disp-quote>
<p>“When I was doing tests in Poland, they checked me from every angle, but here . . . he hit my knee, bent my elbow [laugh]. It was funny.” (Male, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many Polish patients in the United Kingdom reported seeking help from “their” GPs in Poland, who they believed were more experienced and competent in their diagnostic skills.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“My child had a very common child disease—rubella. Our GP in the public practice said she did not know what it was . . . So we registered at the private practice, and we got the same answer . . . In the end we called the Polish doctors we knew in Poland.” (Female, Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Procedures were also sometimes portrayed as rather different between the countries. This underlined respondent worries about the extent to which their health concerns were properly investigated.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“When we go to our health practice, we are not sent to the doctor, but to a nurse. She decides what to do.” (Male, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More positive comparisons tended to differentiate between the quality of the medical “treatment” and the level of personal “treatment” and attention provided. Reflecting on their experiences with general practitioners in the United Kingdom, one respondent noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>“They are not very competent, but very nice.” (Female, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Corruption too was seen as less of an issue in the United Kingdom: a year after being in the United Kingdom, one respondent noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>“I have not observed, like in Poland, that doctors suggest you a drug because they are being sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. . . . here ( . . . ) you go to the pharmacy and they suggest cheaper medicines, which is shocking for me, because in Poland they always suggest you more expensive ones.” (Female, Phase II)</p>

<title>Factors guiding treatment preference</title>
<p>Our quantitative survey demonstrated that most of our participants, given no financial barriers, would prefer to return to Poland for medical treatment. However, various factors emerged in the interviews as likely to influence this choice. These included the urgency of the situation, the existence (or absence) of a language barrier, the availability of health insurance at work in the United Kingdom, the repercussions for the worker if they had to travel back to Poland, and the availability of support networks in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Urgency of treatment of course played an important role:
<disp-quote>
<p>“if there was any emergency—I would probably go ( . . . ) here and not think about travelling to Poland''. (Female. Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Language competence was mentioned by several interviewees. In the words of one female respondent, who had only been in the United Kingdom a few months:
<disp-quote>
<p>“In Poland—I would explain in detail what is wrong with me, and here . . . there is a language barrier . . .” (Female, Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Economic costs acted as a motive for either staying in the United Kingdom or returning home to Poland:
<disp-quote>
<p>“I have health insurance at work [in the UK], so if I needed to see a specialist quickly that would be arranged by my work.” (Female, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, others expressed uncertainty about the costs and services available to Poles in the United Kingdom. A respondent who had been only a short time in the United Kingdom claimed,
<disp-quote>
<p>“In the UK I think I would be scared that someone would have to pay, . . . I would also be scared I would not be admitted, because although we are members of the EU . . . I am not sure that more serious operations . . . could be conducted in Great Britain.” (Female, Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For others, it was the existence of networks in the United Kingdom or in Poland that could determine where treatment was sought,
<disp-quote>
<p>“They offered me to stay in the hospital (in London) ( . . . ) but I said I prefer to go to Poland ( . . . ). When someone is ill, he wants to be with family, at home, . . . ” (Female, Phase I).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Related to this is the ability to use particular medical networks in Poland:
<disp-quote>
<p>“when I think about surgery, or any other serious treatment, I generally know who should I approach in Poland, and I know which doctor should I trust . . . or someone who could help me get in to the doctor . . . If I were in Poland and didn’t know that, I would probably see the health service as funeral directors [laugh]. But I know all this, because I am a Pole, and I am used to function in these conditions.” (Male, Phase 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Where participants were contemplating return to Poland for treatment, this was mainly to consult with Polish dentists. This was partly because of price, partly because of perceived competence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“I will use the dental services in Poland, because I know how expensive it is here, so when I visit Poland, I immediately go to the dentist.” (Female, Phase I)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alternatively, others had found their own Polish dentist in the United Kingdom, even shortly after their arrival in the United Kingdom:
<disp-quote>
<p>“now we have found a Polish dentist ( . . . ) in England, . . . in a critical situation, when you have a toothache, it is difficult to wait half a year to go to Poland ( . . . ). You somehow trust them more ( . . . ) He will understand me better, and I will understand him.” (Female, Phase I)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The substantial migration that followed the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 created important new challenges for the health systems of these nations. Regular and easy movement between countries offered opportunities for potential patients to switch between health systems for their treatment, with many migrants bringing with them clear expectations about health care in their new nation. In a pathway analysis using three-stage longitudinal data from Polish migrants, we found that younger age, resources such as education, language skills, and psychological predispositions (values promoting open mindedness, a positive attitude to the receiving culture), combined with social support, (non) discrimination, and social status predicted positive perceptions of changes in health after nearly 2 years in the new country. The evidence from our qualitative and quantitative data suggested that patients’ experiences of the NHS varied across health providers (hospitals, general practitioners, dentists) and the measure of assessment. Furthermore, interviews revealed clear cultural differences in treatment expectations, partly shaped by premigration experiences with the Polish health service.</p>
<p>In our study, we focused on perceptions of health changes since migration. The inclusion of perceived premigration health variables is rare in longitudinal studies, although the health experiences of an individual on entry to a country are likely to be important in later health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689812463782">Lu, 2008</xref>). Previous research has underlined how those with greater financial resources are likely to adjust better to their new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689812463782">Mariño, Stuart, &amp; Minas, 2000</xref>). In our study, we witnessed an upward mobility in the SES of our respondents, with this latter position in SES, not position on entry, a significant correlate of perceived health at T3. Perceived mental health was predicted only by SES at T3, while perceived physical health was predicted by a combination of T3 SES, perceived discrimination, and support from Poland. Consistent with previous literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1558689812463782">Weishaar, 2008</xref>), interviewees also cited economic pressures and restraints as informing decisions about the uptake of treatment options (such as the decision to have treatment in the United Kingdom or in Poland). These results thus emphasize the importance of both material and psychosocial factors in perceived health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1558689812463782">Pickett &amp; Wilkinson, 2008</xref>) as well as the changing nature of such determinants among a migrant population. Contrary to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689812463782">Jayasuriya, Sang, &amp; Fielding, 1992</xref>), education was not directly related to perceived health, although our path analysis demonstrates that the more educated did enjoy higher SES at T3, itself a predictor of perceived physical health.</p>
<p>Fluency in English emerged in both our quantitative and qualitative analyses as an important correlate of health access and perceived health changes, with our path analysis suggesting that this may impact on pro-British attitudes and support from British social networks. Limited language skills can restrict a migrant’s ability to locate services, understand provision entitlements, or communicate successfully with medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812463782">Gushulak &amp; MacPherson, 2011</xref>). Older respondents reported a greater decline in their physical health after their migration, reflecting not only a natural ageing process, but the lower level of resources available to deal with the challenges of their new situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689812463782">Lu, 2008</xref>). However, there was little evidence in our interviews of the purposeful transnational health migration reported in some other studies and often used to explain such an age–health effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689812463782">Lu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Both our questionnaire and interview data underlined the significance of social support networks for the health of migrants. Supportive others can provide reassurance during health visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1558689812463782">Smith &amp; Christakis, 2008</xref>) and give important psychological support when under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy et al., 2005</xref>). In our data, transnational networks <italic>back home</italic> had a direct impact on perceived physical health. Positive relations with the majority community can engender a willingness to use health care institutions in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689812463782">Heim, Hunter, &amp; Jones, 2011</xref>); in <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses of our data, those who at T1 reported more willingness to make contacts with British people were more likely to report GP visits by T3, <italic>t</italic>(149) =1.71 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Our correlation analyses suggested that those with benevolent and universal values (i.e., high on self-transcendence) report less perceived negative changes in their health. Such individuals are more likely to show an openness and tolerance of others, both within (benevolence) and outside of their immediate group (universalism), with our path analysis suggesting that self-transcendent values permit the establishment of supportive relationships with the receiving country.</p>
<p>It is important however not to oversimplify the positive impacts of support. Strong ties with coethnics in one area can lead to ghettoization and social stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812463782">Griffiths, Sigona, Zetter, &amp; Sigona, 2005</xref>). Ethnic group solidarity is often something of an “outsider’s myth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689812463782">Nauck &amp; Settles, 2001</xref>): Polish migrants to the United Kingdom often compete for work and “support” networks are often accompanied by considerable interpersonal distrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689812463782">Ryan, Tilki, &amp; Siara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1558689812463782">White &amp; Ryan, 2008</xref>). Notably, community organizations may be seen as of little relevance for new migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689812463782">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, our interview data suggested that social networks functioned to reinforce generally negative images of the health service in the United Kingdom. The spread of information through Internet forums and other new media implies an active and rapid negotiation of health representations between “distant yet intimate” communication modes, where detailed medical experiences are shared with relative strangers of indeterminate location. Internet forums are regularly used by this new wave of Polish migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812463782">Burrell, 2009</xref>), who use such forums for information about health care as well as for other practical information. Such computer-mediated networks allow individuals to share their experiences anonymously and give access to new information from a potentially heterogeneous range of informants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689812463782">Chen &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>). However, such media may also help perpetuate images of health care that may not always coincide with the reader’s own experience. As such, health professionals need to be aware of the barriers as well as affordances such networks may provide to successful community engagement in health services.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have noted that perceptions of discrimination and racism are related to both lower physical and psychological well-being among minority and migrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689812463782">Heim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689812463782">Karlsen &amp; Nazroo, 2002</xref>). Those who experience ethnic discrimination are more likely to also engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as high levels of alcohol or marijuana consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812463782">Di Cosmo et al., 2011</xref>). Although our interview participants did not report any particular discriminatory experiences in relation to health, perceptions among our questionnaire respondents that Poles were not trusted, liked, or respected were correlated with lower rates of perceived physical health. One particular contributor to this finding may be the geographic dispersal of the Polish community in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1558689812463782">White &amp; Ryan, 2008</xref>). Many ethnic communities live in large concentrations in poorer living areas, where lower levels of discrimination mitigate against the negative impact of the physical surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1558689812463782">Pickett &amp; Wilkinson, 2008</xref>). However, the lack of a geographically focused Polish community may mean that there is little reduction of the impact of discrimination on the health of this community.</p>
<p>Cultural variations in health care systems have been shown to be significant factors in health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689812463782">Kirkcaldy et al., 2009</xref>). Given that Poles had such a low opinion of their own health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812463782">Eurobarometer, 2010</xref>), it is perhaps a little surprising that so many were critical of the UK health system or showed a desire to return home for health treatment. Such a desire was independent of the respondents’ age, SES (T1 or T3), fluency in English, values, discrimination experiences after a year in the United Kingdom (T2), or even their perceived physical or psychological health (T3). One interesting distinction emerged between the perception of the skills held by the health professional and the personal quality of care, with both our quantitative and interview data suggesting that while there were certainly questions about the former, the latter was generally more appreciated. This was most evident when considering the care offered by GPs and dentists, with more than twice as many respondents indicating satisfaction with the level of personal care than the quality of the treatment provided. However, one positive aspect of the administrative system in the United Kingdom was the lack of apparent corruption. “Informal payments” and “backhanders” to doctors and other medical staff continue to be seen as major problems in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812463782">Reibling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1558689812463782">Watson, 2011</xref>). This perception of a corrupt service may explain why European-wide comparisons show Poles are more unwilling to report adverse health care events than their British counterparts (26% reported this in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812463782">Eurobarometer [2010]</xref> survey, compared with 47% of British respondents).</p>
<sec id="section17-1558689812463782">
<title>Integrating Mixed Methods Findings</title>
<p>As often reported when using mixed methods methodologies, our usage of mixed methods not only provided convergent support for a number of our key findings but also generated new richness and insight, and raised further important questions for our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812463782">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Triangulation for our quantitative findings was provided by interview accounts that cited the significance of language as well as structural variables (e.g., economic variables) as influencing treatment preferences in the United Kingdom. At the same time, dissonance between methods is to some extent expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812463782">Brannen &amp; Moss, 2012</xref>) and can lead to explanations that recognize the multidimensionality of complex phenomena, such as circular migration. One notable feature of our findings was that while most of our respondents in our quantitative were satisfied with their NHS treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1558689812463782">Table 4</xref>), there were clear areas of concern reported in our qualitative interviews—and these seemed to reflect what was perceived to be a broader, social consensus among Polish migrants about the nature of the UK NHS.</p>
<p>This apparent tension between our quantitative and qualitative findings can perhaps be best explained by an apparent contrast between a broad, generalized belief about health services in Poland and the United Kingdom, and the more complex everyday experiences of health care amongst Polish migrants. Indeed, different research methods often allow us to see how focusing on global patterns of health-related issues among migrants can miss the local and more private aspect of health interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689812463782">Mason, 2006</xref>). Whereas the 2010 Eurobarometer data showed Poles to hold rather negative attitudes toward their health care system, our Polish respondents in the United Kingdom were particularly concerned about the apparent brevity of health checks in their new country, alongside worries about charges for treatment and language barriers that restricted access and health care communications. Ambiguities are not easily captured within structured questionnaire data but were revealed in our interviews (e.g., when one respondent described the Polish health service as a “funeral service” but was also confident in his ability to “work around” the system). Other significant factors that might influence health care choices—such as the availability in the United Kingdom of health providers from Poland—are also typically not included in omnibus surveys. Finally, as suggested above, social networks might have a significant impact on health perceptions. Thus, although support for the Polish community back home may be positively related to perceived health, the use of Polish social networks may actually discourage the active uptake of NHS services, with potentially significant implications for the future health of our participants. This all hints at the complex combination of variables likely to be taken into account by health care users when seeking medical help.</p>
<p>Working with a mixture of methods does, of course, open up the possibilities of a continuous cycle of studies, which switch between methods and builds on each stage of findings from the previous analyses. In our work we were able, through our interviews, to appreciate important distinctions between “satisfaction” with medical treatment and the personal approachability of the physician or the administrative services. This led us to modify our initial questionnaire so that by T3 it included satisfaction on a number of dimensions. Subsequent analyses could further examine the themes that emerged in these interviews, potentially in a new wave of quantitative data assessment, with the potential to additionally refine our structured questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1558689812463782">
<title>Limitations, Implications, and Future Research</title>
<p>Simply combining methods does not, of course, eliminate study weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812463782">Fielding &amp; Schreier, 2001</xref>), and our work had a number of limitations. Our quantitative data collection required Internet access, and our sample was relatively educated, with almost half being graduates. Our questionnaire data relied on self-reports provided via the Internet. Such reports run the risk of common error variance inflating correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689812463782">McBroom &amp; Reed, 1992</xref>), although this is usually attenuated in longitudinal analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812463782">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakof &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). Overburdening respondents with long questionnaire has been shown to increase nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1558689812463782">Sahlqvist et al., 2011</xref>), which might be particularly problematic in longitudinal studies. Thus, for expediency reasons, we used abbreviated versions of questionnaires and some one-item measures. Although helping to reduce attrition, this might have, to some degree, compromised the validity and reliability of the qualitative measures. In addition, our study included the measures of perceived changes in health; no actual medical records were examined. While subjective measures may have relatively strong relationships to some health indicators (e.g., life expectancy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689812463782">Lehr, 1997</xref>) they have only moderate relationship to medical assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689812463782">Lehr, 1997</xref>). Finally, across the three waves of our questionnaire study, we retained around half of our participants. This dropout rate was not particularly large: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1558689812463782">Markovizky and Samid (2008)</xref>, for example, in a longitudinal study of new Eastern European migrants to Israel reported 65% attrition rate, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1558689812463782">Schwarzer, Hahn, and Schröder (1994)</xref>, in a study of East German migrants, reported 77% attrition rate over a similar 2-year period. Furthermore, nonresponse is not necessarily a weakness unless there is systematic difference between those who responded and those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1558689812463782">Schwarz, Groves, &amp; Schuman, 1998</xref>), and there was little evidence of this in our study. Finally, sample dropout should not be seen as indicative of a simple weakness but can also present an opportunity for further work, perhaps using in-depth qualitative methods to explore reasons for nonresponse. This may be particularly valuable in relation to potentially sensitive issues, such as health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812463782">Fielding &amp; Schreier, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of other variables could also be profitably included in future work. Different ethnic minority groups may not respond in the same way to migration-related stresses, with population size and spread likely to be important in determining acculturation outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812463782">Feldman, Mont-Reynaud, &amp; Rosenthal, 1992</xref>). Subsequent work can also examine the generalizability of these findings to other populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812463782">Castro et al., 2010</xref>), for example, among other migrant groups, including some who do not have ready access to patterns of circular or return migration. Reasons for migration are also likely to be significant and could be further studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1558689812463782">Tartakovsky 2009</xref>): Indeed, the sojourner-like nature of much Polish migration may reduce the moderating importance of receiving-society interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812463782">Berry &amp; Sam, 1997</xref>). While we included respondent’s assessment of perceived discrimination, future work should also more explicitly consider the attitudes of the majority culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812463782">Berry, 1997</xref>). We should also consider different methodologies: photo-elicitation interviews, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812463782">Brannen &amp; Moss, 2012</xref>), can be a powerful means of collecting data on regular health-related behaviors. Perhaps, above all, further work needs to consider health changes over a longer time period. Such work could then profitably contribute to ongoing debates about the point at which new migrants may lose the protective “immigrant effect,” and lapse into the risk ways of their new culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812463782">Di Cosmo et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the implications of our findings for medical care in the United Kingdom—and other nations where such population movements may occur within a unified marketplace? Our data suggest that even with a relatively fluid and “easy” migration, many of the traditional predictors of health outcomes apply. Younger migrants with greater cognitive and material resources are more likely to enjoy better health while the establishment of strong relations with the receiving community—although not necessarily one’s own ethnic community in the new country—may also be protective of well-being. Our findings suggest that Polish-language support will continue to be important for the inclusion of those most vulnerable to ill-health, while schemes that encourage the integration of both the migrant and majority communities may have significant health impact. Furthermore, health resources aimed at particular ethnic communities may be more effectively targeted directly at the migrants themselves, rather than mediated through community groupings, with our data complementing existing evidence on low trust toward such groups among Polish migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1558689812463782">White &amp; Ryan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Online (Polish language) resources are also likely to be important for framing attitudes toward health services and consequent service uptake. Such forums can help explain the services available and deal with some of the more complex issues likely to surround GP practices in the United Kingdom (e.g., around antibiotic prescription and the roles and expertise of different personnel within the British health system). Online materials can also consider issues common to those more familiar with the Polish system, providing reassurance regarding the role of payments and other such concerns from <italic>back home</italic>. All this is likely to involve the active effort of health professionals in fully engaging with migrant communities whilst recognizing the diversity of interests and expertise among such groups.</p>

<sec id="section19-1558689812463782">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In a changing Europe, it is increasingly important to understand the health outcomes of migration as a product of both receiving and home culture. Polish migration to the United Kingdom exemplifies a new, dynamic migration pattern, with many EU citizens circulating between country boundaries as a function of economic opportunities as well as seeking new cognitive challenges. Our longitudinal data show that, as elsewhere, demographic factors and cognitive skills on entry, combined with interpersonal resources and perceived societal attitudes, predict perceived changes in psychological and physical health within a new country. At the same time, experiences of health treatment are influenced by expectations about treatment and health interactions at least partly derived from practices <italic>back home</italic>, as well as the opportunities afforded by alternate treatment opportunities in the home nation. Such findings emphasize the need to incorporate a better understanding of both premigration health systems and continuing transnational health options when attempting to model and promote migrant health behavior.</p>
