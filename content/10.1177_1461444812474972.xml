<p>When Western audiences encounter news about Korea’s online gaming culture, it almost always falls into one of two categories: tragic stories about players who died while playing long sessions of a game at an internet café or sensationalist features that focus on the celebrity culture surrounding professional game players. Dal Yong Jin’s <italic>Korea’s Online Gaming Empire</italic> contextualizes these kinds of stories while broadening the purview of what that culture means for the political economy of Korea, to the national and international technology and gaming industries, and to a the emerging fan culture surrounding gaming both in Korea as well as globally. As Jin puts it, the book offers “a reflection on the complexity of online games” as it relates to “the political economy development of the Korean game industry and its ongoing reconfiguration” (p. 7).</p>
<p>Jin deploys what he explains as a <italic>critical</italic> political economy methodology throughout that also functions as an organizing principle of sorts for the book as a whole. That is, the text is very good at moving chronologically through the economic and cultural growth of the titular “Empire” whilst also reflecting on the consequences that various decisions have had on some of those most wholly invested in that development. Chapters cover topics such as the impact of Korea’s turn-of-the-century technological infrastructure initiatives on the social norms of a traditionally collectivist culture, the emergence of the Korean game industry in the years following the 1997 economic crisis, the business of competitive gaming as materialized in eSports and its effects on both players and fans, and the global implications of the economic, political, and cultural activity surrounding gaming in Korea.</p>
<p>A standout component of <italic>Korea’s Online Gaming Empire</italic> is the detailed financial and historical research that went into the creation of the book. Jin has done something remarkable here in chronicling the fiscal development of a wide variety of interests related to online gaming both inside and outside of Korea that converge in a variety of ways that create what he calls the eventual “transnationalization of Asian online game industries” (p. 151). He tracks government expenditures, corporate profits, consumer spending by demographic, professional gamer earnings, and a number of other statistics (such as market penetration of eSports programming) that collectively provide a thorough understanding of how, over a period of about ten years, a small component of Korea’s entertainment buysiness became one of the most important tech-based industries in the nation.</p>
<p>Some of the more significant figures, such as those tracking the growth of Korea’s NCSoft, the country’s premier online game development company, are smartly interpreted through Jin’s mixed-methodological, critical approach. Jin cites a variety of statistics to demonstrate that NCSoft has had phenomenal successes in Korea and throughout other Asian regions, where the games in its <italic>Lineage</italic> series have earned the company billions of dollars. Interestingly, though, the first game in the <italic>Lineage</italic> series had only moderate success in the West, and so Jin discusses NCSoft’s challenges in conquering a broader global market with the sequel <italic>Lineage II</italic>. He explains that even though the first game, like many in the genre, featured Western, medieval Europe-based stories, the mechanics of gameplay “integrated with Korean culture” because “its allure is that it is community-based” (p. 130) and thus offered an appealing experience to those who live in more traditionally collectivist cultures. Jin explains that, with <italic>Lineage II</italic>, NCSoft utilized a strategy of developing the game itself in the United States in close consultation with Western game-development talent, changed gameplay to “adopt American styles” of combat and player interaction (“American game users want…to be a hero-king or Lone Ranger”) (pp. 35-36). Jin argues that the NCSoft example indicates that globalization need not only proceed from the West, and that Korea’s ongoing success in online gaming suggests “it is instead a multidirectional and multidimensional process” (p. 140). This kind of careful attention to the myriad connections between an evolving Korean gaming industry and those around the world who play its games marks much of Jin’s writing.</p>
<p>Equally as absorbing is Jin’s close focus on the Korean eSports culture, specifically as it shapes fan communities. Jin argues convincingly that much of the youth of Korea is infatuated with competitive online gaming. In this discussion, in particular, the influences of critical theory on his thinking are most clearly demonstrated; he invokes Henry Jenkins’ work on fan culture to help make sense of what he sees as some of the “oppositional” components of fan participation surrounding professional online gaming, tempers that perspective with a consideration of Mark Andrejevic’s work on the commodification of direct fan community involvement with media, and mines Sara Grimes’ writing on the economy of multiplayer gaming communities to help contextualize the specific instances he references in the book. As with the sections of the book that focus on building a detailed historical record through statistical research, so too does Jin keep his writing here accessible and interesting; one need not have a detailed previous knowledge of the gaming industry in Korea nor of the cultural theorists he invokes to help explain that <italic>Empire</italic> in order to appreciate the book’s contribution to game studies research specifically and media studies scholarship on political economy more broadly.</p>
<p>In <italic>Korea’s Online Gaming Empire</italic> Dal Yong Jin lays bare an industry that most Western audiences know very little about, and about which far too little attention has been paid by games studies scholarship. He makes a convincing case that not only are the innovations in gaming going on in the country worthy of academic notice, but that the greater cultural and economic changes brought about by the ascendancy of the games industry and its affiliated professional leagues and fan communities will be compelling to anyone interested in the increasing global reach of online gaming.</p>
