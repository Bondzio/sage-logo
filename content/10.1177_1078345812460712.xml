<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>This issue is the first of Volume 19 and hopefully another series of four issues with articles that reflect not only the challenges and opportunities faced by correctional systems and correctional health care providers but their successes, as well. Fiscal uncertainty and constraints at federal, state, and local levels continue to require correctional systems to do more with less. Although reductions in resources have brought about significant reductions in life skills, education, and transitional programming, correctional systems, especially individual institutions, have developed innovative approaches to maintain core program activities. Correctional programs have reached out into their local communities to solicit their support and involvement in inmate programs. These relationships also help communities continue essential services such as fire departments, emergency medical services, and general maintenance. Corrections–community partnerships afford many opportunities to involve inmates in projects that maintain or augment community services. Plus, they provide valuable work skills and experience for inmates within community environments. Since nearly all inmates eventually return to the community, these partnerships present significant opportunities to fill the gaps in reentry and continuity of care programs. We need to know more about the level and scope of corrections–community partnerships and their challenges and successes. I encourage you to provide commentary and share your experiences with the <italic>Journal.</italic>
</p>
<p>I call your attentions to the two Field Reports in this issue: “Syphilis Outbreak at a California Men’s Prison” and the “Peer Health Education in Haiti’s National Penitentiary.” Field reports are another means to share current information about an outbreak, operational innovations, or best practices outcomes in a shortened format. I encourage you to use the field report as a vehicle to describe your non-research experiences in program operations, health services, and administration. Field reports will be peer-reviewed but do not require the rigor required for clinical or outcome evaluation. Plus, they enable the <italic>Journal </italic>to keep you informed about emerging issues.</p>
<p>Volume 19 of the <italic>Journal</italic> includes case studies, best practices, and field reports. We will continue in our efforts to publish more frequent “special emphasis sections,” literature reviews, and field reports to keep correctional health professionals up-to-date on trends and developments important to their field. I believe you will find this issue very informative, and I welcome and appreciate your comments and suggestions.</p>
