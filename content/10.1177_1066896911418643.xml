<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is by definition a benign proliferation of myofibroblasts, which was first described in 1986 by Vuitch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911418643">1</xref></sup> The term <italic>pseudoangiomatous</italic> was proposed to emphasize the fact that histological pattern mimics, but does not actually constitute, a vasoformative proliferation. PASH can present as a microscopic focus; as a solitary, clinically palpable mass; as multifocal nodules; or as a diffuse massive process with asymmetry of the breasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418643">5</xref></sup> Clinically and radiologically, PASH is often recognized as a mimicker of fibroadenoma. Histologically, it can be misdiagnosed as phyllodes tumor, or low-grade angiosarcoma. The purpose of this study is to review the clinical and histopathologic features of PASH in an effort to help define a standard for the diagnosis and treatment of PASH.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation of PASH is nonspecific. Most cases are identified as insignificant microscopic findings in association with benign breast disease. Clinically asymptomatic PASH incidentally detected by mammography typically occurs in postmenopausal patients. Palpable lumps are usually firm, painless, and mobile with no associated nipple or skin changes. The radiographic finding of PASH oftentimes leads to an initial diagnosis of fibroadenoma in the majority of cases, or an overall benign provisional diagnosis.</p>
<p>The exact cause and pathogenesis of PASH is still controversial. It is postulated to have a hormonal etiology secondary to a large density of progesterone receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> or to possibly be a hormone dependant process. This is supported by PASH being a disease of primarily premenopausal women or older women on hormone replacement therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418643">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911418643">7</xref></sup> Historically, the interest in PASH arises from its ability to resemble other lesions on both clinical as well as radiologic examination, leading to the need of histologic examination to make a definitive diagnosis. Currently, the management of patients with a core biopsy diagnosis of PASH is not well defined. Treatment options include either clinical surveillance, or surgical intervention. Surgical options range from complete excision of the lesion with clinical follow-up, to mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for diffuse lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643">3</xref></sup> Reports of medical management such as the use of hormonal manipulation using tamoxifen have been described in single case studies; however, further appropriate trials are needed to establish it as a medical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911418643">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study we hope to add to the expanding knowledge base of information on PASH. We present the relevant clinical and microscopic findings in 79 cases of PASH, diagnosed at Loyola University Chicago Medical Center from 2002 to 2009.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective database search was performed to identify patients with PASH over a 7-year period of time (2002-2009). A total of 79 cases of PASH were diagnosed at Loyola University Chicago Medical Center from 2002 to 2009. Clinical findings, including clinical examination, breast imaging studies, and follow-up status were collected from electronic medical records (EMRs). The clinical history was reviewed to determine whether each mass was palpable, its location, and its size and shape. The EMR was also reviewed to determine the patient’s menopausal status and whether there was a history of hormone replacement therapy use.</p>
<p>Macroscopic data were obtained from pathology reports. The microscopic slides were reviewed by 2 pathologists to document the distribution (focal, multifocal, or diffuse), and types (classical or proliferative/fascicular) of PASH. Classical PASH was defined as small slit-like spaces and anastomosing channels without erythrocytes lined by a layer of flat cells that do not display atypia. Proliferative/fascicular PASH was defined as areas of increased cellular proliferation containing spindled cells without atypia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418643">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418643">10</xref></sup> Slides are reviewed to determine if the PASH present is associated with any preneoplastic and/or neoplastic epithelial lesions (including benign proliferative changes, hyperplasia with our without atypia, in situ or invasive carcinoma). A <italic>Z</italic>-test for independent proportions is used for statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>PASH was identified in 79 patients undergoing breast biopsy or mass excision. The patients’ ages ranged from 15 to 65 years, with a mean age of 43 years. In total, 76 patients were female (96.5%) and 3 were male (3.5%). Racial status was as follows: 75.6% Caucasian, 10.5% African American, 7% Hispanic, and 6.9% other.</p>
<p>In the female cohort, the majority of patients were premenopausal (75%). Overall, 20.2% of the female patients were postmenopausal and in 4.8% of patients the menopausal status was unknown. Out of the 76 female patients 10 (13.1%) were on exogenous hormone therapy. A total of 59.8% of the patients presented with a breast mass and in the remaining 40.2% of patients the lesion was an incidental radiological finding. All 3 of the male patients presented clinically with gynecomastia.</p>
<p>With regard to management strategies, a total of 65 patients (82%) underwent a core biopsy because of a palpable or radiologically visible lesion. This biopsy method failed to diagnose PASH in 23 (35%) of 65 cases that were ultimately diagnosed as PASH following excisional biopsy. Therefore, 47% of the patients were not diagnosed with PASH until the time of surgical excision.</p>
<p>Microscopically, PASH was designated as a unifocal mass in 82% of patients, multifocal (multiple separate foci) in 12% of patients, and diffuse changes in 6% of patients. Classical PASH morphology was seen in 97.6% of cases and proliferative/fascicular PASH in 2.4% of cases.</p>
<p>Benign proliferative epithelial changes accompanied PASH in 60.4% of cases. Atypical ductal and atypical lobular hyperplasia was present in 25.6% of cases. Invasive carcinoma was found in 11% (9/79) of cases. Of the 9 cases of infiltrating carcinoma, 8 were invasive ductal carcinoma (89%), and the remaining malignancy was invasive micropapillary carcinoma. In addition to PASH, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was present associated with invasive carcinoma in all cases. There was one additional case of PASH associated with DCIS without invasion. There were also 2 cases in which lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS; 2%) was present. The finding of carcinoma in 9 out of 79 cases of PASH is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>Z</italic>-test for independent proportions). On follow-up, local recurrence was noted in 4 cases (5.2%). In all cases of invasive carcinoma, the prior diagnosis was suspected on mammography or ultrasound (via architectural distortion, or pleomorphic malignant calcifications). Invasive tumor size averaged 2.0 cm (range 0.1 to 5.0 cm). Additional histologic findings associated with the invasive carcinoma and PASH were as follows: fibroadenoma (3 cases), atypical lobular hyperplasia (1 case), radial scar (3 cases, fibrocystic changes (2 cases), columnar cell hyperplasia (1case), columnar cell change (1 case), and atypical ductal hyperplasia (1 case).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clinically, PASH can present as an incidental microscopic focus; as a solitary, clinically palpable mass; as multifocal nodules; or as a diffuse massive process with asymmetry of the breasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418643">5</xref></sup> Historically, it has been described in premenopausal women and in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref></sup> However, age at diagnosis in females may range from the teens to the mid-50s (with median age in mid to late 50s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> PASH is also a frequent finding in gynecomastia. It is reportedly present in studies of symptomatic male breast biopsies in the range of 23.8% to 47.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> In our study, patient age ranged from 15 to 65 years, with a mean age of 43 years. A total of 76 patients were female (96.5%) and 3 were male (3.5%), all of whom presented with gynecomastia. PASH has also been reported to involve the breasts of immunosuppressed patients. These include patients with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, and patients undergoing cyclosporine treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911418643">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911418643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911418643">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The clinical presentation of PASH is nonspecific. Most cases are identified as incidental microscopic findings in association with benign breast disease. The nodular form of PASH occurs less frequently and either presents clinically as a palpable breast mass or is detected radiologically by mammogram or ultrasound. Palpable masses are usually firm, painless, and mobile with no associated nipple or skin changes. A study done by Celliers et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418643">15</xref></sup> described the mammographic and sonographic features of 73 cases of PASH. The most common appearance on mammogram was of a solid, noncalcified mass or of localized increased stroma. Stromal distortion and stellate opacities were rare. On ultrasound, PASH presented most commonly as a well-defined, hypoechoic mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418643">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896911418643">16</xref></sup> These radiographic findings lead to an initial diagnosis of fibroadenoma in a large percentage of cases or an overall benign diagnosis. The study concluded that although there are emerging characteristics associated with PASH on imaging, the features are not specific enough to allow for a prospective diagnosis and that histological conformation is recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896911418643">15</xref></sup> In our findings, 59.8% of patients presented with a palpable breast mass and in the remaining 40.2% of patients the lesion was an incidental radiological finding.</p>
<p>Grossly, PASH is often described as resembling a fibroadenoma. The excised tumors are well demarcated, discrete, single, and firm to rubbery in consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> The tumors range in size from microscopic foci up to lesions 18.0 cm in diameter. The cut surface is usually described as homogeneous, and tan/white. Cystic spaces may or may not be present. Hemorrhage and necrosis are typically absent, except in lesions subjected to needle biopsy or aspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>PASH in its most classical form consists of anastomosing slit-like spaces lined by flattened spindle cells intersecting through keloid-like wavy hyalinized acellular mammary stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911418643">Figure 1</xref>). The slits are present in both intralobular as well as interlobular stroma. These slit-like spaces are lined by spindle to ovoid myofibroblasts, which can be plump, but do not show atypia. The spindled cells typically have nuclei that are attenuated, and often resemble endothelial cells. The lesions are often composed of intermixed stromal and epithelial elements, with the lobular and duct structures of the breast parenchyma separated by increased stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911418643">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>Immunohistochemial staining of myofibroblastic cells in PASH is consistently positive for vimentin, CD34, smooth muscle actin, and BCL-2. They may focally or weakly be positive for estrogen receptor. The myofibroblastic cells are negative for CD31, factor VIII, cytokeratin and S100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418643">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896911418643">17</xref></sup> Electron microscopy features of PASH are nondescript, with well-formed slit-like spaces readily distinguished from vascular spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> The exact cause and pathogenesis of PASH is still controversial. It is postulated to have a hormonal etiology, or possibly represent a hormone-dependent process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup> This hypothesis is supported by PASH occurring primarily in premenopausal women or in older women on hormone replacement therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418643">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911418643">7</xref></sup> However, it does not explain the number of male patients with PASH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911418643">7</xref></sup> Another hypothesis suggests that PASH is an independent myofibroblastic lesion of the breast. This theory draws on the fact that PASH has been known to recur (15% to 22% of cases),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911418643">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418643">9</xref></sup> can be multifocal and can be found in association with other breast tumors. Furthermore, PASH has been described in many benign and malignant breast lesions, including carcinoma, hamartoma, fibroadenoma, and phyllodes tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911418643">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896911418643">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896911418643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896911418643">20</xref></sup> Though there is no evidence to suggest that PASH is a premalignant condition or high-risk marker for malignancy, previous reports identify that up to 10% of specimens also have invasive carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historically, the interest in PASH arises from its ability to mimic other lesions on both clinical as well as radiologic examination. As previously discussed; the differential diagnosis of PASH based on histology includes low-grade angiosarcoma or phylloides tumor. Currently, the management of patients with a core biopsy diagnosis of PASH is not well defined. Clinical surveillance or surgical intervention is the mainstays of treatment options. Surgical options range from complete excision of the lesion with clinical follow-up, to mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for diffuse lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911418643">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911418643">3</xref></sup> Because of the rarity of PASH and uncertainty about the clinical behavior, surgical excision has often been the recommended treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911418643">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911418643">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911418643">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418643">10</xref></sup> Surgery is more often the treatment in nodular forms of PASH detected as a palpable breast mass or on radiologic imaging. However, other studies recommend no additional specific treatment if PASH is an incidental histologic finding in specimens excised for other lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896911418643">21</xref></sup> Certainly, the management of PASH found incidentally on core biopsy should depend on the nature of any associated lesion. No studies have yet evaluated the long-term clinical outcome of patients with PASH who undergo surveillance or hormonal treatment instead of excision.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there have been very few reports of invasive carcinoma accompanying PASH. A study done by Damiani et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896911418643">22</xref></sup> in Italy described 5 malignant tumors (2 invasive carcinomas and 3 non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas) showing an unusual pattern of spread within anastomosing spaces consistent with those described in pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia. Their study postulated that the slit-like spaces of PASH may represent a network of stromal channels (prelymphatics) connected to the main lymphatic system of the breast. However, these tumors were believed to be independent of the PASH itself, and the intermingling of tumor with PASH was because of lymphatic-type spread not as coexisting tumor entities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896911418643">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our findings of 9 cases of PASH associated with invasive carcinoma, it is important to emphasize that no malignant pathology was within the bulk of the PASH lesion and therefore there is no known direct correlation between the two. Review of the 9 cases of invasive carcinoma and PASH, 8 contained invasive ductal carcinoma and 1 contained invasive micropapillary carcinoma. In all cases, the prior diagnosis was suspected on mammography or ultrasound (via architectural distortion or pleomorphic malignant calcifications). In all cases, the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma was evident prior to the diagnosis of PASH, either by biopsy or prior lumpectomy specimen, and PASH was an incidental finding at final excision. Invasive tumor size averaged 2.0 cm (range 0.1 to 5.0 cm). Additional histological findings associated with the invasive carcinoma and PASH were as follows: fibroadenoma (3 cases), atypical lobular hyperplasia (1 case), radial scar (3 cases, fibrocystic changes (2 cases), columnar cell hyperplasia (1 case), columnar cell change (1 case), and atypical ductal hyperplasia (1 case).</p>
<p>A second study done by Ferreira et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418643">10</xref></sup> evaluating the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of PASH in 26 patients, described a case of a mass diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma on core needle biopsy. No changes of PASH were noted on biopsy. On excisional biopsy, the invasive carcinoma (0.9 cm in greatest dimension) occupied up to one third of the underlying PASH tumor that measured 4.0 cm in greatest dimension, and the 2 were intimately associated. They concluded that the case may represent an incidental association of a common neoplasm with a rare breast lesion, similar to cases of carcinoma occurring in more frequent fibroadenomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911418643">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of our study was to add to the expanding knowledge base of information on PASH. We present the relevant clinical and microscopic findings in 79 cases of PASH, diagnosed at Loyola University Chicago Medical Center from 2002 to 2009. Because of the findings of infiltrating carcinoma in 9 out of 79 cases of PASH, as well as a local recurrence rate for PASH of 5.2%, we recommend extensive sampling of biopsy specimen with PASH, with appropriate clinical and radiologic follow-up. Further studies would be helpful to confirm our findings and to support our recommendation for patients with PASH.</p>
