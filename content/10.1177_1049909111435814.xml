<p>These were not easy times for Jeannie. She was alone, has no husband or family, is sick for the last 2 years, with a grim prognosis that she knew would end with death, and now has another hospitalization. When she was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, she had expected the worst. It was not death that frightened her, it was the treatment the doctors were talking about, the pain that might come when she was near the end, and worst of all, just being sick, and being alone. There were friends and she knew they would stand by her. Still, it was different from family—people who were in your life for a lifetime, tied together by shared parents, grandparents, by blood. She had none of them. An only child of an only child; there were not even cousins to count on. None of this mattered when she was well, since having no one was just a normal part of her life. “Self-sufficient with no neurotic entanglements,” is how she would describe the lack of family. She was 56, so there were many years for her friends to have been part of her life.</p>
<p>This all made sense until her visit to a doctor 2 years ago. An otherwise healthy, nonsmoking middle aged woman, who had been suffering with a nasty cough, was now having hard time breathing while going up and down stairs. The preliminary diagnosis was pneumonia. There was, however, something on the chest x-ray that the doctor did not like. After a week of many tests, including a positron emission tomography scan and one procedure, a needle biopsy, the preliminary diagnosis was changed to definitive and pneumonia became stage 4 adenocarcinoma. The doctor said there was good news in the bad news. It was not small cell. There was a possibility that the treatment could contain the spread of the cancer at least for a while. The bad news, at least for Jeannie, is that the prospect of having to go through it alone.</p>
<p>Jeannie need not have worried about her worst fear. She was never alone. When she needed someone, someone was there. A handful of friends, who had been there for each other, were there for her. She did not need them often. When you are all grown up and on your own, you become accustomed to doing things by yourself. When did she need them? Three times: when a not so routine doctor’s visit necessitated decisions, because the current chemo was containing the cancer, and during the periodic short hospitalizations when there were the unwanted but predictable consequences of taking the very medicine that was keeping her alive, a drop in her electrolytes, bloody stool from terrible constipation, and a need to tinker with pain meds to get it just right.</p>
<p>Now they were here again, although this time it was different. Jeannie is in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the doctors are talking about the cancer being terminal instead of treatable. The fourth line of chemo failed, the tumor in her lung was growing, and she was in a generally weakened state from the disease and all the chemo she had taken. Now that there was only one very toxic treatment option left, it was time to rethink the plan of care. It was not unreasonable to consider moving from acute to palliative care and to consider end of life wishes. Predictably, Jeannie was distressed by the news. She was not, however, surprised. Her body had been speaking to her during the last few months, and she had heard what it was saying. She knew that end of life choices should be made so she could be in control of her own care, even when the monster inside her was out of control and eating away at the very life she still wanted to be part of.</p>
<p>The medical team asked the hospital’s ethicist to become involved when this cognitively intact 56-year-old woman with an advanced life limiting illness decided not to accept another course of chemotherapy and said she did not want to be placed on a respirator, even if there was a possibility that it would only have to be for a short time. The capacity was not a consideration. The question was whether she understood the choices she had and the consequence of the decision she was making. After sitting down with Jeannie (she in the bed in the ICU), the ethicist in a chair had pulled up along side of her and after what was nearly an hour of speaking to the patient about who she was, what she knew about her illness, and what she wanted, the ethicist confirmed and endorsed a reasoned decision by a thoughtful and reasonable patient. No more treatment, no respirator, provide comfort and symptom management, and a referral to hospice.</p>
<p>That night, before the patient could be transferred from the ICU, she desaturated. She went into respiratory distress and was intubated. Was it the ethicist’s cynicism that had him think that at the first sign of distress a caregiver, a doctor, or a nurse went to Jeannie and said we can help you breath, all it takes is putting you on the respirator until you are strong enough to breath on your own. Or was it Jeannie, who after being offered medicine to make her comfortable, in that moment of panic, asked to be placed on the respirator, opting for the number of days rather then the quality of those days that she still might have to live? No matter. Jeannie was on the respirator, sedated, and now, 3 days postintubation, given the progression of the cancer, there was no question about being weaned. She would need to be on the respirator until she died.</p>
<p>On hospital day 3, postintubation and sedation are discontinued. Jeannie is again aware of who she is, where she is, why she is in the hospital, and is able to communicate with the ethicist by nodding her head. Yes, she knows she is on a respirator, that she cannot be weaned, that she will die sooner rather then later if she is terminally extubated. Jeannie, after so many years of being on her own, makes her decision, although a little less resolved than when she had first decided: she never wanted to be on a respirator. She wants to be extubated.</p>
<p>Because there is less resolution, the ethicist returns a few hours latter, and they talked about the decision one more time. Now there is greater certainty. The only question left is when it will happen. Jeannie wants her close friends to be there with her. We will wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: This time the ethicist makes sure every caregiver knows the plan and that this will be clearly and simply endorsed from shift to shift.</p>
<p>It is late afternoon and finally they are all here. Three women are at the bedside. They talked to each other; they talk to Jeannie, who, on the respirator, can only nod. They are looking at a small photograph. It is of a dog. Our patient, their dear friend, has only one regret about what she is asking us to do. The picture is of Buddy, her little dog, her “family” and she will not be able to see him one more time, not be able to say good-bye. When Jeannie was hospitalized, she had not known that it was this bad, that she was so close to death, and that she would never be coming home again. It was all those things. Now she would be leaving this world without one last chance to touch and stroke this little white dog that had been her family for these past 10 years.</p>
<p>It does not have to be this way. The ethicist speaks to the nurse manager, who speaks to security. It is not what is supposed to happen but they will, with the help of Jeannie’s friend make this happen. One last visitor, her Buddy, will be quietly and discretely brought to her in the ICU for one last good-bye before she is taken off the respirator.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Jeannie’s friends brought her dear, sweet dog into the ICU for a short visit. The nurses and the doctors, who were on duty that night, understood what they were witnessing and were moved by the meaning of that moment. They all felt privileged to be caring for their patient in this way. With the visit done, Jeannie, surrounded by her friends, was removed from the respirator. When her breathing became labored, her medicine was increased.</p>
<p>Jeannie passed away at 5.30 in the morning, having said good-bye to all who were important to her in this world.</p>
